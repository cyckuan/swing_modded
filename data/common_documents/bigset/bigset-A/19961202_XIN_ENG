<HEADLINE> Pak Court Considers Maintainability of Dissolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- While considering the
maintainability of a constitutional petition against the
dissolution of the National Assembly, Chief Justice of Pakistan
Sajjad Ali Shah said, "We are trying to see that system is
survived."
</P>
<P>
Before adjourning the case till Monday, the chief justice today
heading a three-member bench heard the arguments both for and
against the maintainability.
</P>
<P>
The speaker of the defunct National Assembly was represented by
Syed Iftikhar Hussain Gilani, while Khalid Anwar appeared before
the court on behalf of the president who was held respondent in
the case.
</P>
<P>
The court's room was jam-packed, and among those present were
the speaker, Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani, former prime minister Balkh
Sher Mazari, former federal ministers Shahban Mirani, Khurshid
Shah and Sher Afgan.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice sought the views of the lawyers on whether
the question of maintainability could be postponed, for taking it
up at the later stage, during the consideration of merit and facts
of the case. He said that "We are hard-pressed by time".
</P>
<P>
He also observed that it should also be examined that whether
the present petition is maintainable, and whether another
petition, filed by the deposed prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, was
not coming up before the court, particularly when similar points
have been agitated in the two petitions and the relief sought was
also the same.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's National Assembly and the government of Benazir
Bhutto were dissolved on November 5 by President Farooq Leghari.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: France Faces Crisis of Credibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- France is facing a crisis of
credibility in Africa, especially French-speaking African states,
following its diplomatic and political failure over the recent
crisis in the Great Lakes region, and due to its diminishing
economic aid to Africa.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the 19th annual Franco-African summit in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on December 4-6, Paris, for its part,
is pondering over ways to change its traditional policy as a
neo-colonial power toward Africa.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic maneuver by France to send a multinational force
to eastern Zaire has resulted in a total failure, with most of the
Western powers deciding not to send ground forces but to launch
air dropping operations of aid instead to the refugees from
Uganda, an English speaking country out of the influence zone of
France.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that France will avoid formally
discussing the crisis of the Great Lakes region and the problem of
succession of U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and
will only discuss "good management of government and economic
development" at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Rival countries including Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda,
which are entangled in the ethnic war in the Great Lakes region,
are all invited by the host of the summit, President Blaise
Compaore.
</P>
<P>
The credibility of France as a dominant power in Africa began
to erode after Paris devaluated by 50 percent in January 1994 the
African franc which had been bound with the French franc for two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, France began to link economic aid to the building
of law and order in Africa, a step aimed at kicking the ball of
economic development to African themselves, although Paris has
promised to maintain its financial alliance with the African
franc.
</P>
<P>
Due to an overall austerity budget plan at home, France is
cutting its economic aid to Africa year by year, while urging
other Western powers, mainly the United States, to donate more
dollars to the black continent, which is showing a sign of
economic improvement.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, France still does not know how to more effectively
deal with the old problems of Africa in a new international
situation, including ethnic conflict and government corruption.
</P>
<P>
When France sent troops in June 1994 in Operation Turquoise to
Rwanda under the name of humanitarian rescue, it actually let the
former Hutu army and Hutu militias, held responsible for the 1994
genocide in Rwanda, to flee to eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
France is also accused by Rwanda, Zairean Tutsis, and the
United States of supporting the "decadent" government of Mobutu
Sese Seko, who has been staying in Switzerland and France when his
country is on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Christophe Ruffin, former advisor of the French Defense
Ministry, blamed the government for still intending to keep the
Hutu refugee camps in the Kivu region which had served as bases of
sabotage by Hutu extremists against Rwanda over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that France should "sacrifice its incriminating
alliances" with the leaders of countries of its traditional
influence sphere, and let African countries, especially the
southern African countries led by South Africa, to take over more
responsibilitParis, said that France should
modernize its mechanism of cooperation with Africa, which is now
divided between the Presidential Office, the Foreign Ministry, the
Ministry of Cooperation, and the Ministry of Finances.

<HEADLINE>   Friendship Tree Bears Rich Fruit: Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today described Sino-Pakistan relations as a tree
bearing rich fruit of political, economic, cultural, scientific
and technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China and Pakistan, friendly and close neighbors, have always
respected, understood, trusted and assisted each other, said Jiang
in his toast at the state banquet given in his honor by Pakistani
President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari.
</P>
<P>
History has proven and will continue to prove that China and
Pakistan are true friends in need who have jointly shouldered the
weal and woe despite international vicissitudes in the past 45
years, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
China and Pakistan established diplomatic relations in 1951.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to work together with our Pakistani friends from
all walks of life and encourage each other in our efforts to build
an all-round cooperative partnership between China and Pakistan
for the 21st century," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Pakistani friendship is able to serve as a model of
relations between countries with different social systems, the
Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari, who visited China two years ago, shared Jiang's views,
saying that relations between Pakistan and China have long been
regarded as a model of how relations can be and should be between
neighboring countries despite differences in size, in social
system and in history and culture.
</P>
<P>
He added that Pakistani-Chinese ties are not confined to
government-to-government relations.
</P>
<P>
"They are relations that are now firmly rooted in mutual trust
and respect and in the hearts of our two peoples," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leghari said that it is one of the major tasks of the
leaderships of the two countries to preserve and pass on the
tradition of Sino-Pakistani friendship to future generations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese people are prepared to work
together with the Pakistani people for their well-being and for
peace and development in Asia and in the entire world as well.
</P>
<P>
Attending the banquet were, among others, Chinese Vice-Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Minister Wu Yi, Pakistani Caretaker Prime Minister
Malik Miraj Khalid, Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yakub Khan and
Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad.

TIRANA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Justice Minister
Kristofor Peci has announced that Albania will not abolish death
sentence for the time being.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Justice Ministry told reporters today that
Peci had announced the decision at a meeting of the Council of
Europe in Ukraine this week on abolishing death sentence in
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said when racial revengeful killings, which were
left over from history, still exited in the country, an immediate
abolition of the death penalty would not help to prevent serious
crimes.
</P>
<P>
"Death sentences should be abolished, but cautiously and
gradually," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK's NHS Loses Mlns of Pounds to Cheating Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Doctors, pharmacists and
opticians are defrauding the National Health Service (NHS) of
millions of pounds through false claims for drugs and services, an
official investigation has discovered.
</P>
<P>
The inquiry by the Audit Commission found bogus prescriptions
were being written by GPs for "ghost" patients, inflated claims
were being made for drugs and hospitals were double-billed for
doctors' fees.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated to be costing the NHS as much as 60 million
pounds (96 million US dollars) a year -- enough to employ at least
4,000 extra nurses.
</P>
<P>
The report, released here today, criticized lax financial
controls by health authorities for failing to stem the fraud at a
time when doctors say the NHS is seriously underfunded.
</P>
<P>
The commission also discovered that only 1.4 million pounds
(2.24 million dollars) is detected which, although double last
year's figure, is "the tip of the iceberg," said officials.
Prescription fraud, the most prevalent, increased fourfold in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed how health professionals systematically
defraud the NHS, often conspiring together.
</P>
<P>
The most common tricks include:
</P>
<P>
-- GPs prescribing for non-existent patients while pharmacists
collect the fee for both parties to share;
</P>
<P>
-- Prescriptions being issued for genuine patients without
their knowledge;
</P>
<P>
-- Pharmacists double-charging by billing patients for
prescriptions, then claiming the same amount from the NHS;
</P>
<P>
-- Opticians falsifying prescriptions by adding items such as
tinted lenses to their NHS claims when the patient received clear
glasses;
</P>
<P>
-- Temporary staff, including nurses, inflating the hours
worked on their weekly time sheets;
</P>
<P>
-- GPs making false claims to health authorities about staff
payments to gain extra reimbursements; and
</P>
<P>
-- Locum agencies double-billing for nurses and doctors
employed by hospitals as emergency cover, resulting in
multi-million-pound losses.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that several cases under investigation involve
potentially large sums. One GP is believed to have defrauded the
NHS of more than 250,000 pounds (400,006 dollars).

<HEADLINE> UK, Worst in Europe for Card Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain has become the center
of Europe for lucrative credit card fraud and the police are
uncovering growing evidence of wide-scale involvement by drugs
gangs.
</P>
<P>
A conference paper revealed today showed that fraud levels in
Britain in 1995 accounted for 45 percent of all credit card fraud
in the European Union and were more than double those in any other
member state.
</P>
<P>
David Veness, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan
Police, warned delegates from Europe, the United States and the
Far East that stolen cards were increasingly being traded by drugs
cartels.
</P>
<P>
Counter-measures against sophisticated fraudsters have been
stepped up over the past two years but losses to banks and credit
companies in Britain, where card use has always been high, still
topped 80 million pounds (128 million US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Figures compiled by Dutch police showed that the only member
state to come close to Britain was France where losses last year
amounted to 31 million pounds (49.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Organized criminals, including the Mafia, triads and yardies,
are known to be major players in fraud worldwide and British
police believe the pattern has now spread to Britain.
</P>
<P>
Veness, who heads Special Operations at Scotland Yard, told the
conference, "There is evidence to suggest drug supply networks are
used to distribute stolen plastic cards."
</P>
<P>
"Over the past three years the Metropolitan Police check and
credit card unit has enjoyed considerable success tackling
organized attacks on the card payment system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Evidence also suggests that convicted bank robbers are turning
to credit card fraud as a less dangerous form of crime.
</P>
<P>
Police now fear the spread of electronic shopping, particularly
via the Internet, will provide criminals with new opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Force Delivers Aid to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian-led multinational
force for eastern zaire announced today that it has flown its first
consignment of aid to Tanzania, a report reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
the report quoted Major Rod Babiuk, spokesman of the multinational
force, as saying that ''the multinational mission's first operation
took place and there was a shipment of medicine and cholera vaccine
for Medicins Sans Frontieres (doctors without borders) to Kigoma,
Tanzania on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
''This is the first humanitarian airlift by the force,'' Babiuk
said.
</P>
<P>
The shipment was carried out after the multinational force was
unable to deliver any aid to refugees in Zaire. Zaire refuses to
grant the international force permission to overfly or enter its
territory.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, refugee camps at Kigoma swelled in
November with the influx of 25,000 Zaireans and 5,000 Burundian
Hutus, who crossed Lake Tanganyika to flee fighting in eastern
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
More than 40,000 Burundians have also sought refuges in Kigoma
from fighting in southeast Burundi. However, the report quoted
analysts as saying that Kigoma remains accessible to normal aid
flights and there appears little need for deliveries by the
multinational force. enditem

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Jordan Valley Always Part of Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu said here today that in any agreements with
the Palestinians, the Jordan Valley will always be part of
Israel, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks during a meeting with leaders of
the Jewish settlements in the Jordan Valley. He said that the
region will not be a narrow strip, but a wide and intensive
Jewish community between the Jordan River and the Palestinian
autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
Jordan Valley regional council chairman David Levy said after
the meeting that an agreement has been reached with the
government to improve the roads in the valley.
</P>
<P>
Levy also said that Netanyahu agreed to grant the Jordan
Valley settlements the highest standing for developing towns and
to build 450 new housing units.
</P>
<P>
He said that the community in the Jordan Valley, which had
been mainly dealing with agriculture in the past, would try to
develop tourism in the region, especially on the north coast of
the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, he said, establishing new roads and widening
the existing ones will top the agenda of the regional development.
</P>
<P>
The region will also build more hotels, restaurants and other
tourism services.
</P>
<P>
Levy estimated that the Jewish population will increase by
5,000 in the next five years among all the 17 settlements in the
valley area.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Meets Egyptian Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai met with Egyptian Ambassador Muhammed Bassiouny
this afternoon in a bid to defuse tensions stemmed from the
hardline policy of the new Israeli government regarding peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place in the Holiday Inn hotel in Jerusalem,
according to Israel Radio. During the meeting, Mordechai discussed
 with the Egyptian envoy negotiations between Israelis and
Palestinians, especially on a pending agreement on partial
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai claimed that there had been some progress over the
past two days between the two sides on reaching a final agreement
on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
But Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said Saturday
that "no practical and tangible progress is being made on the
ground because of the rejection by the Israeli side to implement
what has been agreed."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli negotiating team "wanted to change a number of key
articles in the Hebron accord, which is what the Palestinian side
rejects," Arafat said in Jordan on his way to the United Arab
Emirates and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The Mordechai-Bassiouny meeting came against the backdrop of
growing tensions between the two neighbors. The Israeli defense
chief asked the ambassador to call on his government to tone down
"hostile approach" against Israel and Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu in particular.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Friday that he had sent a letter to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak defending Israel's settlement
policy.
</P>
<P>
"I received a message, a letter from President Mubarak. I sent
him a letter in return. In his letter he really expressed their
concern over our settlement policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There was not threat, but I can say that I clarified
to President Mubarak that our policy on our right to settle
and to build the existing settlements is a policy that is in
line with peace," Netanyahu argued.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mubarak declared in Cairo that despite their
peace treaty, he could not force his country to normalize
relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We can't order any free citizen to deal with Israel, because
he will say 'no, I'm not convinced,'" Mubarak said after meeting
the visiting Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.

ATHENS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Heavy flooding continued today
in the northern Greek regions of Xanthi and Kavala, leaving three
people dead, many injured and causing widespread damage.
</P>
<P>
The province of Xanthi was declared in a state of emergency

JOHANNESBURG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- At least five Inkata
Freedom Party supporters were wounded today in a clash with
supporters of the African National Congress near Durban, South

<HEADLINE> European Rapid Reaction Force Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A European Rapid Reaction Force
for intervention in the Mediterranean region is denounced as
evidence of continuing colonialist attitudes towards the peoples
of the South, a British MP said today in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Though only four countries (France, Italy, Portugal and Spain)
participate in the newly set up force named EUROFOR, it clearly
constitutes a back-door expansion of NATO's aggressive military
capability against the Arab countries in the Mediterranean region,
Labor's MP Tony Benn added.
</P>
<P>
Benn believed the EUROFOR is "answerable" to the Western
European Union defense organization and may also be deployed
directly under the auspices of NATO to "help ensure stability" in
the Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
In language typical of such moves by the Western powers in the
past, the aims of the force have been described as "missions of
humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping and crisis response, the MP
said.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the EUROFOR immediately drew strong
condemnation from the region threatened with intervention.
</P>
<P>
Libya pointedly asked, "Would Italy, France, Spain and Portugal
accept the establishment of an Arab rapid deployment force to
intervene in European affairs?

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader on Peace Process in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams,
currently in Athens to promote his autobiography, declared here
today that the strategic objective of the party was a negotiated
peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the semi-official Athens News Agency
(ANA), Adams said that although Sinn Fein's ultimate goal was
Irish independence and an end to British rule, its current
primary, strategic objective was a negotiated peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
The collective challenge for all those trying to build an
alternative to the armed struggle, he added, was to persuade the
Irish Republican Army that there was an alternative means to
pursue its objectives. He stressed the need to tackle the cause of
the conflict, the injustice.
</P>
<P>
"My aim and Sinn Fein's aim," he explained, "would be to see an
end to all the armed groups, to achieve a situation where there is
no need for the IRA."
</P>
<P>
Adams expressed disappointment with British Prime Minister John
Major's stewardship of the peace process in Northern Ireland, but
feels he still has a chance to help bring about peace.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Sinn Fein's relations with the Republic of Ireland,
Adams said, "There have been certain tensions but these are almost
natural and understandable. The Irish government at this time is
focussed and has made it quite clear this week that it doesn't
accept the British position."
</P>
<P>
Regarding his vision of a united Ireland, Adams commented that
Ireland should be secular, pluralist and reflect the diversity of
its people.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly, and most Republicans, have no interest in an
united Ireland unless it embraces, it has a capacity to include,
all sections of our people. It doesn't matter to me whether a
person is a Catholic, a Protestant, or an agnostic or a Jew,
religion should be a matter of personal conscience," he said,
adding the belief that church and state should be separate.

<HEADLINE> Republican Lawmakers Opposed to Changes in Welfare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Senator Don Nickles, the
Senate majority whip, ruled out fundamentally changing the new
welfare law, as the White House wants and Senator Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, the Democrats' leading expert on welfare, said today it
won't happen in the New Congress.
</P>
<P>
Nickles and Moynihan appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton promised last August when he signed
the Republican-crafted welfare overhaul bill to fix aspects he
said were too severe -- particularly cuts in food stamp spending
and benefits for legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The White House is reportedly now considering to restore
13 billion dollars of the projected 54.6 billion dollars in
savings from the new law over six years. The law shifts
responsibility for welfare programs to the states and sets time
limits for how long people can remain on welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
"I think Congress is going to be very cool to make those
changes," said Nickles, a Republican from Oklahoma. "I think
you'll see technical corrections this year. But significant
reforming or undermining the welfare bill? No."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moynihan, asked if he believes Congress would go
along with White House-proposed changes, responded, "No. None.
Whoever said that?" He strongly opposed the legislation,
predicting that ending welfare entitlements will significantly
increase poverty in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Moynihan urged Clinton to concentrate on protecting children,
who he foresaw as the first victims of a smaller social safety
net.
</P>
<P>
"If the president can produce a national awakening about the
condition of children and not get us into fussing about
eligibility for food stamps, we may pull it off," Moynihan said
today. "If not, why, we have a calamity, I believe."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in his weekly radio address Saturday, said, "Now that
we have ended welfare as we know it, let the change not be to have
even more children in more abject poverty but to move people who
can work into jobs."
</P>
<P>
In the House of Representatives, Ways and Means Chairman Bill
Archer, a Republican from Texas, said last week that House
Republicans would fight "with energy" any attempt by Clinton to
make significant changes in the new law.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Blasts Israel for Failure to Implement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
who is here for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak today,
blamed the Israeli side for the current stalemate in the
Palestinian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing enormous problems with the Israeli side which is
trying to avoid the accurate implementation of the agreements,"
Arafat said upon arrival from Doha earlier today following his
Gulf tour that took him to UAE and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1993 Oslo peace accords signed between the PLO and
the Jewish state, Israel should have completed the troops
redeployment from the bulk of the West Bank town of Hebron by
March 28.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader voiced the hope that the talks would
yield results satisfactory to the Palestinian people and help push
forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who held a tete-a-tete meeting with Mubarak this
evening, also praised Egypt's supportive role in the Middle East
peace process and the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit, which fell within constant consultations
between the two Arab leaders, came when relations between Israel
and Palestine strained over Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's
plans to expand Jewish settlements, apart from the deadlocked
talks over Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to have diplomatic ties with the
Jewish state, has recently stepped up attacks at the Israeli
settlement expansion, warning of a freeze in normalizing relations
as a protest against the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to Netanyahu, splashed across major
Arabic newspapers here Friday, Mubarak warned that the Israeli
settlements hinder the peace process and undermine the efforts
exerted to push it forward in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak stressed the exigency of reaching an agreement between
Israel and Palestinian Authority to settle their difference, and
of resuming the Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Cairo-based Arab League warned
Israel Sunday that its plans to build new settlements in occupied
Arab lands would throw the entire peace process into danger.
</P>
<P>
Israel should not only stop building new settlements but also
dismantle existing ones immediately, said a statement issued after
a two-hour emergency session of the League. The session dealt with
Israel's plans to build thousands of new Jewish homes in Gaza, the
West Bank and Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians complain that the Jewish settlements break up the
territories between their main cities and diminish their chances of
establishing an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> International Population Meeting Opens in Addis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A five-day international
population meeting was opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Participants from 25 countries are gathering at the
"international council on management of population programs
(ICOMP) 14th international seminar on management of quality
reproductive halth programs.
</P>
<P>
With the theme of "after Cairo and beyond", Haryono Suyono,
chairman of the ICOMP and minister of population of Indonesia,
reviewed at the opening ceremony the development of international
cooperation in population and development.
</P>
<P>
He said "it was in Cairo that a new paradigm of population and
development was launched, a paradigm which is so all encompassing
that it is labeled as the reproductive health program in the
broadest sense".
</P>
<P>
The Economic Commission of Africa Executive Secretary, K.Y.
Amoako said that since the 1994 international conference on
population and development in Cairo (ICPD), "many African
countries have been reformulating their population and family
planning programs to take into account the reproductive health
concerns in the ICPD."
</P>
<P>
"This seminar is, therefore, timely and relevant to African
countries to learn how other countries are resolving some of the
problems on reproductive health care," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Minister of Health Adem Ibrahim pointed out at the
meeting "a national maternal mortality ratio of about 1,400 per
100,000 live births, as well as an infant mortality rate of over
100 per 1,000 live births, is a testimony of the need to
dramatically improve the quality of life of our population."
</P>
<P>
The seminar will discuss topics such as sustaining national
commitment to population and reproductive health issues.

volunteer labor is a glorious tradition that must be carried

Li, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau

Volunteer labor was popular in the early days of the People's

</P>
<P>
China has a huge population, which has brought the country
problems and difficulties, he noted. But it has advantages as
well. If the people are well organized they can do many things
that will benefit the coming generations, he added.

UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan delivered a
speech on the occasion, which was read out by his
representative. Sheikh Zayed recently returned home from the
United States where he underwent a surgical operation.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Sheikh Zayed said: "Our federation could not
have been established, nor could it have prospered, had we not
followed from the outset a clear path of mutual inter-dependence
and collaboration, a path in which each part is of service to
the whole, and in which each part will do all that is required
in order to help that whole, the federation."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "it is now the task of this present
generation to carry forward the torch and to continue that which
we have begun."
</P>
<P>
He said the UAE has pursued a balanced and effective foreign
policy, which is based on the principle of non-interference in
the internal affairs of others, good neighborliness, respect for
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of others, and a
refusal to resort to the use of force or the threat of force to
achieve gains or territorial changes.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of collaboration and solidarity
between the Arabs, he said "whatever efforts may be needed to
achieve it, the restoration of Arab solidarity is the best way
to ensure the stability of our states and the prosperity of our
peoples."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Middle East peace process, Sheikh Zayed said
the UAE has consistently stated its belief that a permanent,
comprehensive and lasting peace should be sought, in accordance
with relevant U.N. resolutions and the principle of "land for
peace," along with an Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab
lands.
</P>
<P>
After the speech was read out, a military parade was held.
</P>
<P>
The national day celebrations also coincide with that of the
30th anniversary of Sheikh Zayed's accession as the Ruler of Abu
Dhabi, one of the seven emirates that formed the UAE in 1971.
</P>
<P>
To celebrate the anniversaries, the UAE people have organized
a host of colorful activities. A grand carnival was held here
from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and will continue at the same time
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A number of UAE folklore and music groups perform for the
public at four different locations. Some 2,600 students from
various schools in the capital participated in the carnival
presenting music, plays, magic games and marionette shows for the
audience.
</P>
<P>
In the evening, a spectacular fireworks, laser and light show
will be held here.
</P>
<P>
To mark the occasion, 28 hotels in Dubai, another emirate,
baked a 2.5-kilometer-long cake, which is made up of 5,200
separate pieces of cake from a special recipe, weighing in total
69,862 kilograms. The huge cake is said to have beaten the
existing world record in America recorded in the Guinness Book
of Records.
</P>
<P>
Syed Shaukat Ali Shah, a taxi driver, today offered free
rides for his clients in the capital, saying "it's a day to be
happy and I am trying to add to the happy atmosphere in the city
by giving my customers a free ride on December 2" to celebrate
the anniversaries.

PARIS, December 2 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed its regret
over the arrest of several opposition candidates for municipal
offices by the Serbian government, which took place as widespread
anti-government demonstrations have been going on in the Serbian
capital for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The arrest of the candidates for municipal elections is not
the right way which will lead to an appeasement," said French
Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux.
</P>
<P>
The oppositions of Serbia are protesting the annulment by
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic of the results of the
municipal elections last month, which could have brought to power
the oppositions in several major Serbian cities.

<HEADLINE> Beira Corridor Development Conference Starts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A two-day conference on the
Beira development corridor began here today.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said Zimbabwe and Mozambique had come up with the idea of a Beira
development corridor as part of efforts to expand infrastructure
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The current Beira corridor is a railway and road network
running between the Zimbabwean eastern border town of Mutare to
the Mozambican port city of Beira.
</P>
<P>
"However, a lot of work needs to be done for the concept to
become a reality. For a start, we need to clearly define the
areas to be covered by the Beira development corridor," Mugabe
said.
</P>
<P>
He expected "the area will extend beyond the existing road and
railway networks of the present beira corridor and encompass
parts of Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe and even
Zaire".
</P>
<P>
About 400 businessmen and delegates from the region, Europe, the
far east and North America are attending the conference.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Divers Salvage Engine of Nuke-Contaminated Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Japanese divers today salvaged
from the sea the engine of a Japanese tuna ship which was hit by a
U.S. hydrogen bomb in 1954, Kyodo news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The operation in Mie Prefecture marked the end of a five-year
search for the ship's engine by Suehiro Sugi, a 61-year-old
resident of Kainan in nearby Wakayama Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The ship, Fukuryu Maru No. 5, was fishing for tuna 160
kilometers east of the Bikini Atoll on March 1, 1954, when the
United States carried out the experimental explosion of the
hydrogen bomb "Bravo," a blast said to be 1,000 times more
powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hirishima and Nagasaki
in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The ship's 40-year-old chief radio operator later died of
radiation sickness, the other 22 crew members were not seriously
affected.
</P>
<P>
After the 1954 contamination incident, the 141-ton vessel was
used as a training ship by the Tokyo University of Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The ship was decommissioned in 1967 and its engine was
purchased and later mounted onto a cargo ship based in Owase, Mie
Prefecture. The cargo ship ran aground and capsized in 1968 off
Mihama in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Sugi, the publisher of a small newsletter, launched the search
after he found out that the tuna ship, which became known abroad
as Lucky Dragon V, was built in his native prefecture.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, local divers found the engine off Mihama, near
where the cargo ship went down.
</P>
<P>
Sugi says he plans to donate it to the Fukuryu Maru No. 5
(Lucky Dragon V) museum on Yumenoshima Island in Tokyo Bay.

<HEADLINE> Movie Fans Revel in Cairo International Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Braving jostling crowds, Egypt's
serious movie fans swarmed to a copious screening hall today to
enjoy their only annual opportunity to see quality international
films that are otherwise never shown in local cinemas.
</P>
<P>
Actually, no devoted moviegoer wants to miss the legendary 20th
Cairo International Film Festival and catch a glimpse of the
centennial of the Arab and Egyptian cinema.
</P>
<P>
An approximate 200 films from 52 countries, including dozens of
movies never before shown, will grace the festival running through
December 2 to 15.
</P>
<P>
The films, some subtitled, feature a blend of new releases and
dear classics. They reveal a world of cultural and artistic
differences, as well as varieties of style and content.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 films vying for the best first film in the Naguib
Mahfouz Competition (NMC) are the "Carmen," a bleak look at the
life in the contemporary Balkan, "Haifa" about life in a Gaza
refugee camp through the eyes of a tramp who is named after the
city, and "the Freedom Gang" portraying a juvenile gang in wartime
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
An excellent forum to introduce debut productions and
innovative artists to the international crowd, the NMC award gives
new directors the chance to have their work viewed by jurors who
themselves are colossusi in the industry.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian audience was not acquainted with European, Asian
or African cinema before the festival," said Egyptian playwright
Saad Wahba, who is also a prominent critic and the mastermind of
the Cairo International Festival.
</P>
<P>
He said he is eager to introduce film genres other than the
American one, which "is overwhelming the world with its culture."
</P>
<P>
Throughout previous festivals, usually marred by scheduling
mishaps, some trends prevailed: one is that Chinese movies are
gaining popularity.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese film that won the 1992 best film award, depicts the
unforeseen turns of life that befell a Chinese couple when the
husband goes to the U.S. to strike gold and left the wife home
alone.
</P>
<P>
"Red Swan" was entered into this year's International
Competition. It recounts the dramatic lives of four actresses in a
ballet company that stages the Swan Lake. The actresses represent
new China's first generation ballerinas.
</P>
<P>
Also on the show is "Red Cherry," a story based on true events
about the nightmarish experiences undergone by several Chinese
children in a Russian international orphanage during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
To mark UNESCO's choice of Cairo as the cultural capital of the
Arab world, Egypt has moved up the stakes for the best Arab film
in the festival.
</P>
<P>
Nine films, produced by Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia,
Palestine and Lebanon, are angling for the 100,000 Egyptian
pounds (30,000 U.S. dollars) award.
</P>
<P>
Two Egyptian entries in the competition tend to explore
family dramas and show the personal perspective of larger issues
than focus on character and mood and soundtrack build-up, said
local critics.
</P>
<P>
"The Woman and the Hatchet" is based on a true story of family
crimes. A feud between a captain and a city governor plays out
against the backdrop of political turmoils in 1940s' in
"El-Hishary."
</P>
<P>
The first Arab film was made in Egypt's coastal city of
Alexandria, in 1896, with the help of French filmmaking pioneers
the Lumiere Brothers about a month after the first Lumiere film
was made in France.
</P>
<P>
In 1917, when the first film company was formed, the
Egyptian-Italian Cicia Cinema Company, the directors, actors,
cameramen are all Italian. A year later, 80 movie theaters cropped
up across Egypt.
</P>
<P>
A hundred years later, Egypt, the world's third largest movie
producer, is churning out 60 films annually to the Arab audience
of more than 300 million.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The 6.2-km-long western
section of the Yan'an Elevated Highway in downtown Shanghai was
opened to traffic today. So far, the total length of elevated
highways in use in this, China's largest metropolis stands at 44
km.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the western section has shortened the
distance from downtown Shanghai to the Hongqiao International
Airport. It now takes only 30 minutes to cover the distance.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai attaches great importance to the building of
transportation facilities, and has built a 29-km-long elevated
highway with four lanes and an eight-km-long south-north elevated
highway with six lanes.
</P>
<P>
These elevated highways play an important role in easing the
city's traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
The city is now building more elevated highways, some of which
will link up the urban areas with the outskirts. Currently, the
five-km-long eastern section of the Yan'an Elevated Highway and an
eight-km-long elevated highway between downtown and the suburban
Minhang District are under construction.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's GDP Growth Hit by Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 2 (Xinhua)-- Serious flooding in Cambodia
has hit the country's economic growth rate this year and
led to higher than targetted inflation, Cambodian Finance Minister
Keat Chhon told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
After seeing a 7.6 percent rise in gross domestic product (GDP)
in 1995, the government had set a target of 7 percent growth for
this year.
</P>
<P>
But the flooding which hit the country earlier this year had a
significant impact on GDP growth which is now forecast to be 6
percent, 1 percentage point lower than targetted, Keat Chhon said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also blamed the floods for the higher than
targetted inflation rate for the year. At the beginning of the
year, the government had hoped to keep inflation at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But Keat Chhon told Xinhua that inflation for the year will now
be 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
On hard currency, the minister said the country had enough
foreign currency reserves for two months, but did not specify the
exact size of the reserves.
</P>
<P>
He said the riel, the Cambodian currency, is stable and now
stands at 2700 riels to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that financial discipline in our public spending
would have to be tightened and that more effort was needed to
increase government revenue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Cui Tiankai expressed strong indignation at and
condemnation here today of the requests by the Foreign Policy
Committee of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Foreign
Affairs Council of the LDP that foreign heads of state and
political figures be encouraged to visit the Yasukuni Shrine.
</P>
<P>
Answering a reporter's question, Cui said the action by the
institutions of the LDP, Japan's ruling party, is a new wound
inflicted on the feelings of the peoples of Japan's neighboring
countries in Asia, including China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that visiting the Yasukuni Shrine is
question of whether or not one has a correct understanding of and
proper attitude toward that historical period of aggression waged
by Japanese militarists. He said that such an erroneous decision
by the LDP will surely cause serious concern among Japan's
neighbors in Asia and draw from them strong condemnation.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that the Japanese side will try to win the trust of
the peoples of the other Asian countries by making a
thorough introspection with regard to its past and stick to the
road of peaceful development, he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Help Discover Gene Which </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Whether you are bold and
confident or anxious and self-pitying may be determined by a
previously-discovered gene, while a shortened version of the
gene may increase the risk of depression and mania.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Benjamin, head of the psychiatric service in
Israel's Soroka Hospital, noted that the discovery of the gene
by Israeli, U.S. and German scientists is especially interesting
for its use in prescribing anti-depressants, adding that it is
less relevant for detecting neurotic behavior solely on the
basis of a blood test.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the prestigious journal
Science, Benjamin and his colleagues from the University of
Wurzburg in Germany and U.S. National Institutes of Health
discovered an "adventurous gene" that made headlines
about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The scientists found a modest but quantifiable link between
anxiety-related behavior and the gene that controls the ability
of the brain to use the vital neurotransmitter called serotonin.
</P>
<P>
People who have a shorter version of the gene for the
serotonin transporter have more negative thoughts and feelings
than those with a relatively longer version of this gene.
</P>
<P>
However, researchers stressed that the influence on behavior of
the transporter gene is modest, accounting for only about 4
percent of the difference in people's tendency toward neurotic
behavior.
</P>
<P>
The serotonin transporter is a DNA molecule that allows nerve
cells to respond to the serotonin that surrounds them, and the
gene causes the production of a protein that acts as a chemical
pump for the removal of serotonin.
</P>
<P>
This neurotransmitter is the target of anti-depressants
while these drugs immobilize the pump and compensate for
the short gene, causing an additional increase in the serotonin
level.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin said he gave questionnaires to 500 white American
males to determine their psychological makeup, and then took
blood samples and searched for a gene that could help explain
differences in behavior.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese president
recalled the friendship with Pakistan in particular.
</P>
<P>
China and Pakistan enjoy "a friendship that has withstood the
test of international vicissitudes" and the two peoples have
regarded each other as friends in need and brothers bound by
common fate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the 45 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties,
the two peoples have always sympathized with and supported each
other, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also praised the good-neighborly links between his
country and South Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and South Asia have shared similar
historical experience, in that they all suffered from the
atrocities of colonialism and imperialism. "It is our common fate
in bad times that makes our friendship all the more endearing," he
said.
</P>
<P>
China and South Asia have all along sympathized with and
supported each other in their struggle for national liberation and
independence and in their current quest for state sovereignty and
economic development. "We will always engrave on our mind the
invaluable support from our friends," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said both China and South Asian countries are members of
the developing world and both sides need a peaceful and stable
international environment and particularly, a favorable
surrounding environment. "Blessed with favorable political,
economic, cultural and geographical conditions, the development of
friendly relations and cooperation between the two sides holds out
broad prospects and enjoys a huge potential for progress," he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Jiang also briefed the Pakistan members of
parliament on the current situation in China.
</P>
<P>
He said China's economy has enjoyed a sustained, rapid and
sound development since the introduction of the policy of reform
and opening-up to the outside world in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
China's GNP increased by an annual rate of 9.9 percent from
1979 to 1995 and China's economy will still be growing by more
than seven percent every year in the coming 15 years, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said China respects the customs, lifestyles and religious
beliefs of minority ethnic groups in China and attaches great
importance to developing economic and social undertakings in areas
inhabited by them.
</P>
<P>
"At present, China enjoys political stability, economic
prosperity, national unity and social progress. Our endeavors on
all fronts are progressing successfully," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced China's determination to achieve national
reunification. "The Chinese people are resolved to overcome all
interferences and settle the questions of Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan in accordance with the principle of 'one country, two
systems' so as to fulfill the lofty mission of national
reunification," said the president, adding that "It is the sacred
duty of every people to maintain its national unification."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Hong Kong and Macao will remain prosperous
and stable after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty of them
in 1997 and 1999 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will retain its status as an international trade,
financial and shipping center, and the legitimate rights and
interests of foreign enterprises there will be protected by law."
</P>
<P>
"A reunified and prosperous China will be a major contribution
to peace and development in Asia and the world at large," Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the world is heading for multipolarization
featuring the rise of developing countries and "the pursuit of
peace, stability, cooperation and development has become the main
theme of our times. However, hegemonism and power politics linger
on, numerous contradictions and disputes continue to plague the
world, and peace and development remain severely challenged."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people stand ready to work with the peoples of
South Asia and other countries (in the world) towards a new
century of peace and cooperation and a new world of stability and
prosperity," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is on the third leg of his four-nation Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
After attending an informal meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, he visited the Philippines and
India and will continue on to Nepal.

country's reform, opening-up and economic development as well as
to creating job opportunities and maintaining social stability,
according to the SASP.
</P>
<P>
"However, problems and contradictions like waste and loss of
assets have cropped up in the process of the reform and
opening-up," the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is necessary to examine property accumulation in
the collectively-owned enterprises in order to boost the
development of such firms and safeguard their rights and
interests, the industry watchdog explained.
</P>
<P>
The checkup will cover all urban-based collectively-owned
enterprises and units registered with the industrial and
commercial administration departments at all levels, such as joint
economic organizations, government institutions, credit
cooperatives, cooperative and joint-stock enterprises formed on
the basis of collectively-owned enterprises, and agencies,
enterprises and units that occupy collectively-owned assets in any
form, according to the SASP.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that a small-scale checkup has been going
on, on a experimental basis, among 17,087 enterprises in 226
prefectures and cities since July this year.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Trade Deficit Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit in
November amounted to 1.83 billion U.S. dollars, 14.4 percent up
from the 1.6-billion-dollar deficit last month, said the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry today.
</P>
<P>
The growing trade deficit is a result of the country's fast
increasing imports in the month, which swelled 12.2 percent from a
year earlier to 13.32 billion dollars, while exports increased by
0.3 percent to 11.49 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The November trade figures brought the total exports for the
first 11 months of this year to 117.97 billion dollars, while
imports totaled 136.61 billion dollars, for a deficit of 18.64
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
If the current trends continue, South Korea's trade deficit for
the whole year will approach 20 billion dollars, surpassing the
government's 18-billion-dollar projection, a ministry official
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's trade deficit stood at 10.06 billion
dollars, up 58.7 percent from the 6.34 billion dollars registered
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 30.3 percent from 1994 to 125.06 billion
dollars in 1995, while imports grew even faster at 32 percent to
135.12 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Addresses Pakistani Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today delivered a speech to Pakistani Senate focusing on China's
relations with South Asia and also covering a wide range of other
issues.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is on a four-day state visit to Pakistan, expressed
China's willingness to foster closer ties with South Asian
countries and called for unity and cooperation of the two sides to
defend the rights and interests of developing nations.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the two sides to properly handle existing
disputes between them by seeking common ground on major issues
while reserving differences on minor ones.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to join hands with South Asian nations in
building a long-term, stable and 21st century-oriented friendly
and good-neighborly relationship," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The president put forward a five-point proposal on ties with
South Asia, including increasing exchanges, enhancing mutual
respect, promoting cooperation, properly handling disputes and
fostering unity.
</P>
<P>
"China and South Asian countries have a great deal of common
ground and converging interests just as all neighbors do. However,
as neighbors, it is difficult not to have some differences or
disputes from time to time," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We stand for seeking common ground on major issues while
reserving differences on minor ones."
</P>
<P>
He also urged countries on the subcontinent to look at the
differences or disputes from a long-range perspective, seek a just
and reasonable settlement through consultations and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"If certain issues cannot be resolved for the time being, they
may be shelved temporarily so that they will not affect the normal
state-to-state relations," he suggested.
</P>
<P>
He called for unity and cooperation to safeguard the rights and
interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Past experiences have proved that only through closer unity
and cooperation and with sound economic development can developing
countries effectively resist hegemonism and outside interference,
safeguard their independence, sovereignty and interests and secure
a firm foothold in the community of nations," Jiang said in the
speech.
</P>
<P>
"While the world is undergoing a structural transition, it is
necessary for the two sides to step up consultation, cooperate
closely and come to each other's support in international affairs
with a view to jointly safeguarding the rights and interests of
developing countries and facilitating the establishment of a fair
and equitable new international political and economic order."
</P>
<P>
In the speech, the Chinese president also assured South Asian
countries that China will live harmoniously with them and will
forever remain a trustworthy friend and neighbor to them.
</P>
<P>
"While firmly opposed to such hegemonistic behaviors as
infringing on other countries' sovereignty and interfering in
other countries' internal affairs, China will never seek hegemony
for itself."
</P>
<P>
"Always respecting other countries' sovereignty and territorial
integrity, China also hopes that its position of achieving
reunification and opposing national dismemberment will be
understood and respected by others," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the two sides increase exchanges to deepen the
traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
"We should, through a variety of exchanges, particularly direct
contacts and dialogues between top leaders, enhance mutual
understanding and trust and build closer ties between each other."
</P>
<P>
The president also called for joint efforts to carry forward
the friendship "cultivated by our older generations of leaders."
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged the two sides to explore new ways of
mutual-beneficial cooperation to achieve common development.
</P>
<P>
China and South Asia should carry out various forms of
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit to lay a
more solid foundation for closer bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Jiang also stressed the important role South
Asia can play in maintaining peace and stability in the whole of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"As home to one third of Asia's population, South Asia is an
important part of Asia. Without its stability and development,
there can be no peace and prosperity in Asia as a whole."
</P>
<P>
He said, "China, as always, will support South Asian regional
cooperation, support the proposal and initiative for the
establishment of South Asia Nuclear-free Zone and Indian Ocean
Zone of Peace, and support all efforts designed to serve peace,
stability and development in the South Asian region."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Doctors, Nurses Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- State-run hospitals in parts of
Cyprus were paralyzed for two hours today as doctors and nurses
staged strikes this morning for more staff members and other
benefits.
</P>
<P>
Nurses at Limassol, Paphos, Kyperounta and Polis started the
two-hour strike at 8 o'clock (0600 GMT). Rural health centers, as
well as casualty departments also joined the strike.
</P>
<P>
All doctors in state-run hospitals stopped work from 1000 to
1200 hours local time (0800 to 1000 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Contingency medical and paramedical staff are standing by to
deal with emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
The President of the Doctors' Board Demetris Demetriou said
Friday that the industrial action was taken because of a deadlock
in talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The doctors' trade union demands promotion opportunities and
the right to a full pension after 27 years in service. And the
nurses' trade union demands replacement staff for those on leave,
pension schemes, payment of arrears of wages, increase of
permanent staff and hiring of auxiliary personnel.
</P>
<P>
Nursing staff staged a two-hour work stoppage last Thursday in
another four state-run hospitals in Nicosia, Larnaca and
Paralimni.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Manolis Christophides said Friday that the
working conditions of both doctors and nurses are of a very
high standard and compare favorably internationally.
</P>
<P>
He said that several measures have been announced over the
last few days by the government, satisfying most of the nurses'
and doctors' demands.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Christophides' remark, the nurses' trade union
President George Flourentzos told the press today that there was
no progress in the negotiations to resolve the problem with the
Ministry of Health.

<HEADLINE> Feasibility Study of Trans-Asia Rail Network to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The feasibility study of
the Trans-Asia railway from Singapore to Kunming in southern
China will start next month, according to Malaysian Transport
Minister Ling Liong Sik today.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian national rail company KTM, appointed as the
project coordinator, will appoint this month a consultant group
to undertake the study, Ling told reporters after chairing the
opening session of a working group on the railway here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will grant 2 million ringgit (800,000 US dollars) for
the study which is expected to take 10 months and the consultant
will submit four reports to a supervisory body comprising experts
from the eight countries involved -- Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and China.
</P>
<P>
Ling said three routes had been shortlisted for the Trans-Asia
railway which was approved at the summit meeting of leaders of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in Bangkok last
year.
</P>
<P>
The railway will begin from Singapore, passing through
Peninsular Malaysia to the Thai capital from where a branch of
the railway will run through the Mekong basin countries of
Cambodia and Vietnam and then to Kunming.
</P>
<P>
A second link will be set up from Bangkok to Vientiane in Laos
and onwards to Kunming. Laos currently does not have a railway
system.
</P>
<P>
The third route is from Bangkok to Myanmar before ending in
Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Ling said the respective governments would decide on the common
meeting points between each country. Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam,
Laos and China have already agreed on the common points for the
railway.
</P>
<P>
The feasibility study would focus on the economic and technical
aspects of the railway and the financing and construction of the
rail project would be decided after the study, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first report from the consultant is expected by the end of
next February to be followed by an interim report in June, a draft
by September and the final report in October, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ling said priority would be given to routes that will take the
shortest time of construction and this can be done by completing
the missing links in the present networks.
</P>
<P>
The railway is expected to spur economic development in the
Mekong region which is the least developed in Southeast Asia.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Experts on the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) today held their 21st meeting on Hong
Kong's defense and public security.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the two sides focused on the discussion of the
preparations for the entry of a small number of men from the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) in Hong Kong before July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after the meeting, Chen Zuo'er, the Chinese
representative on the JLG, said that the two sides have reached
consensus on the question of the deployment of advance PLA staff
members in Hong Kong for the sake of the preparations for the PLA
garrison in Hong Kong after June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that experts on the two sides will further discuss
some detailed arrangements for the matter.
</P>
<P>
He said that the small number of the advance PLA staff members
to be stationed in Hong Kong will have different duties from those
of the British garrison forces in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, the sources for the funds of the British
forces and of the PLA forces are also different in that the
Chinese central government will provide the funds for the Chinese
military forces to be stationed in the future Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese and British experts have solved some
specific problems concerning the entry of advance PLA men and they
will reach more consensus on the matter.

<HEADLINE> Emir of Qatar To Visit Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad
Ben Khalifa al Thani said he would personally go to Bahrain to
persuade his counterpart there into attending the upcoming
regional summit in the Qatari capital of Doha.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas today,
Al Thani said he would do his best to make Bahrain contribute to
the Doha summit with the attendance of Bahraini Emir Sheikh Isa
Ben Salman al-Khalifa.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain has announced that it would boycott the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) summit on December 7-9 because Qatar
decided to refer its border dispute with Bahrain to the
International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Al Thani also appealed too all the GCC states to join force to
make the Saudi mediation between the two countries a success.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar have disputed over a chain of islands and
shoals, territorial water boundaries and the Zubara land strip in
Qatar, where the Bahraini ruling family lived 200 years ago.
Saudi Arabia has been mediating the disputes.
</P>
<P>
On relations with other countries in the Middle East, the
Qatari monarch reaffirmed his support for the necessity of
executing the U.N. resolutions against Iraq, taking into
consideration of the sufferings of the Iraqi citizens.
</P>
<P>
Al Thani said that his country has frozen all moves of
normalization of ties with Israel after the Israeli rightwing
government came into power in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out, however, that it is difficult for the time
being to abolish the moves made in this connection conducted
already. He did not specify.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari emir described Qatar's relationship with Iran as
consistent, adding that there is no problem between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that any improvement in the U.S.-Iranian
relations would have positive effect on the Gulf region, and that
any regional formula in the future should involve Iran, Iraq and
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Al Thani called for the admission of Yemen into the GCC, saying
that if so, Yemen may not be left alone in the southern corner of
the Arabian Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political, economic and military
organization, groups Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and Oman.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Tannery Limited, a
subsidiary of Guangdong Investment Limited (GDI), is seeking a
public listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The Tannery is mainly engaged in the processing of cow hides
and sheep skins, the sale of semi-finished leather, and to a
lesser extent, the production and sale of leather garments. Its
principal plant, the Nanhai Tannery Plant, is one of the largest
tanneries in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today, Yu Fang, chairman of
Guangdong Tannery Limited, said that the shares to be offered
comprise 110 million shares and the issue price of per share is
1.03 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 110 million shares will be offered for public
subscription in Hong Kong from December 3 and the offer will close
at 12:00 at noon on December 6. Dealings of the shares of the
company will commence on December 16.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, 71 million shares will be offered for
subscription on a preferential basis to shareholders of GDI.
</P>
<P>
He said that the proceeds from the new issue will be used to
invest in state-of-the-art technology, including the innovative
Italian Water Transfer System which will add value to the lower
priced leather split.
</P>
<P>
He said the public listing is a milestone in his company's
development. Since Nanhai Tannery plant commenced operations in
1989, the company has seen soaring demand for quality hides on
the market.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the demand of leather hit 26 million sq. ft. and the
forecast growth in the coming year is 37 million sq. ft., an
increase of 42 percent, he said.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Opens to Mark 55th Anniversary of CRI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition opened here today
on the development of China's international broadcasting over the
past half a century and more.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, organized by China Radio International, is
to mark the 55th anniversary of the country's international
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
Through the presentation of pictures, photos and material
objects, the exhibition illustrates the important role China's
international broadcasting has played in reinforcing the mutual
understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and people
of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The international radio service was initiated on December 3,
1941, when the Xinhua Radio Station in Yan'an, a revolutionary
base in Shaanxi Province, started a Japanese-language program, the
first external radio service in China.
</P>
<P>
Now CRI broadcasts worldwide in 38 foreign languages, as well
as standard Chinese (or Putonghua) and four local dialects, for a
total of 192 on-air hours each day.
</P>
<P>
With reporters dispatched to 20 locations throughout the world
and listeners spread over 200 countries and regions, CRI ranks
among the world's three most influential international radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 55 years generations of CRI radio personnel have
informed their audiences about the War of Resistance Against Japan
(1937-1945), the War of Liberation (1946-1950), New China's
socialist construction, and the reform and opening up to the
outside world in the new period.

TDC's new corporate color, golden orange, is taken from the
reflection of sunrise off the metallic roof of the extension,
which the council will complete in the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
"As Hong Kong's international marketing arm, it is essential
for TDC to have a powerful presence and an ultra-modern image,"
said TDC Executive Director Michael Sze.
</P>
<P>
Sze said that Hong Kong has rapidly become a more
service-oriented sophisticated economy, with greater emphasis on
adding value to business activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that TDC must continue to mirror these trends and to
spearhead them in the services it provides to the business sector.
</P>
<P>
The new logo is graphics based, strong and easy to identify in
a world increasingly driven by graphic images, symbols and icons.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese characters for TDC are given prominence in the logo
alongside English, the international business language.
</P>
<P>
All previous TDC logos were constructed around the English
initials for the council, to resemble a Chinese chop.
</P>
<P>
He said the spread of the wings symbolizes TDC reaching out for
business opportunity across the world for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The new corporate color represents the bright future for Hong
Kong as Asia's business hub.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Makes Proposal on Ties With South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, who is on a state visit to Pakistan, said today that China
and South Asia should properly handle existing disputes between
them and join hands to defend the rights and interests of
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Senate in Islamabad, Jiang put forth a
five-point proposal in fostering closer ties with South Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to join hands with South Asian nations in
building a long-term, stable and 21st century-oriented friendly
and good-neighborly relationship," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"China and South Asian countries have a great deal of common
ground and converging interests just as all neighbors do. However,
as neighbors, it is difficult not to have some differences or
disputes from time to time," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We stand for seeking common ground on major issues while
reserving differences on minor ones."
</P>
<P>
He also urged countries in South Asia to look at the
differences or disputes from a long perspective, seek a just and
reasonable settlement through consultations and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"If certain issues cannot be resolved for the time being, they
may be shelved temporarily so that they will not affect the normal
state-to-state relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for unity and cooperation to safeguard the rights and
interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Past experiences have proved that only through closer unity
and cooperation and with sound economic development can developing
countries effectively resist hegemonism and outside interference,
safeguard their independence, sovereignty and interests and secure
a firm foothold in the community of nations," Jiang said in the
speech.
</P>
<P>
"While the world is undergoing a structural transition, it is
necessary for the two sides to step up consultation, cooperate
closely and come to each other's support in international affairs
with a view to jointly safeguarding the rights and interests of
developing countries and facilitating the establishment of a fair
and equitable new international political and economic order."
</P>
<P>
In the speech, the Chinese president also assured the South
Asian countries that China will live harmoniously with it and will
forever remain a trustworthy friend and neighbor to it.
</P>
<P>
"While firmly opposed to such hegemonistic behaviors as
infringing on other countries' sovereignty and interfering in
other countries' internal affairs, China will never seek hegemony
for itself."
</P>
<P>
"Always respecting other countries' sovereignty and territorial
integrity, China also hopes that its position of achieving
reunification and opposing national dismemberment will be
understood and respected by others," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the two sides increase exchanges to deepen the
traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
"We should, through a variety of exchanges, particularly direct
contacts and dialogues between top leaders, enhance mutual
understanding and trust and build closer ties between each other."
</P>
<P>
The president also called for joint efforts to carry forward
the friendship "cultivated by our older generations of leaders."
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged the two sides to explore new ways of
mutual-beneficial cooperation to achieve common development.
</P>
<P>
China and South Asia should carry out various forms of
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit to lay a
more solid foundation for closer bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is on his third leg of a four-nation visit.
</P>
<P>
After attending an informal meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, he visited the Philippines and India
and will continue on to Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Soeharto on Urban Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said here today that urban development needs serious attention as
it is not only closely related to modern technology but also to
the quality of the people's life.
</P>
<P>
Opening an international conference on the future of Asian
cities at the State Palace, the president said that international
cooperation is needed for an integrated urban development since
various factors have to be taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
"Urban development is crucial to the development of practically
all aspects of life," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, urban development reflects the
achievement of the nation's programs.
</P>
<P>
He cited Indonesia's urban contribution to the 1995 gross
domestic product (GDP) which reached about 60 percent of the
country's total GDP.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of the second long-term development program in
2019, the urban areas' contribution to the national GDP is
projected to reach 70 to 80 percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the achievement has also caused various
problems, such as the decline of the quality of the environment
and pollution, as well as the decrease of agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
The president warned that the development of urban areas cannot
be separated from the issue of population and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by 400 delegates from 25 countries,
will last for three days. It is organized by the New York-based
Asia Society and the Center for Information on Development Studies
in Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Li Lauds UNDP's Aid to China's Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing here
today praised the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) for
its help for China's education, as the two sides started a new
round of educational cooperation.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the fourth UNDP-China Education Program, aimed
at promoting nine-year compulsory education in China's poor areas,
with special focus on girls, was signed here today.
</P>
<P>
Li met Arthur Holcombe, resident representative of the UNDP,
prior to the signing ceremony to express China's thanks to the UN
organization.
</P>
<P>
He said he appreciates the UNDP's shift of the focus of its
assistance to education in the poor areas of western China. He
said that he hopes that the new program would play an active role
in promoting nine-year compulsory education, and the integration
of agriculture, science and education in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
It has been 15 years since China began cooperating with the
UNDP in the field of education. China's State Education Commission
has successfully carried out 20 cooperative projects, including
holding training courses, compiling middle-school English
textbooks and scientific research, with a total aid package of
14.2 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, the UNDP is set to aid the provinces of
Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, all in southwest and northwest China, in their efforts to
realize nine-year compulsory education.

<HEADLINE> Virus Hits Bananas in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A virus that causes the banana
tree to produce tiny and immature fruit has been spreading to six
districts within a year, an Ugandan agriculture official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Proscovia Mutumba, an agriculture official of southwestern
district of Masaka, told the media that the crop will diminish to
very low level as a result.
</P>
<P>
The virus was first found a year ago by an agriculture
assistant in Masaka District. It can make matooke banana lose all
taste. The infected Matooke produces very tiny bounches with
immature fruit and sometimes none at all.
</P>
<P>
The disease has spread to southwestern district of Rakai,
Mbarara, Bushenyi, western district of Toro and eastern district
of Mbale.
</P>
<P>
All banana groups are vulnerable to the disease except exotic
ones, the official said, adding the authorities in Masaka have
imposed a quarantine in the district.

SINGAPORE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Swedish Navy (RSwN)
and the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) started here today their
first bilateral Mine Counter Measure (MCM) exchange program, which
will run through December 10, the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Code-named LEJON SINGA, the annual exchange program was
formalized in November last year between the two countries and
will be hosted by the two navies alternately.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry said that LEJON SINGA will provide the navies of
Sweden and Singapore with the opportunity to work together in the
area of MCM operations. The program will include planning for MCM
operations and the conduct of such operations at sea.
</P>
<P>
The RSN will deploy three Mine Counter Measure Vessels and an
MCM support vessel for LEJON SINGA 1996, while five RSwN officers
will be participating with some RSN officers and servicemen in
command post planning and control onboard the RSN ships, the
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The RSN welcomes the opportunity to participate in LEJON SINGA
with the highly professional and experienced RSwN," it said.
</P>
<P>
Participation in the exchange program will not only contribute
to the professionalism and expertise of the RSN and the RSwN in
MCM operations, but will also help forge bonds of friendship
through the interactions between the officers and men of the two
navies, it added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' GNP to Grow 7 Percent This Year: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' gross national
product (GNP) could stay at 7.1 percent in the fourth quarter of
1996 and is likely to grow by over 7 percent for the year, a
Philippine official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dante Canlas, National Economic and Development Authority
(NEDA) Deputy Director General, said in an interview that the
prediction is based on the level reached during the first three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
The nation's GNP growth, or the country's total output of goods
and services, including incomes from abroad, in the first three
quarters of the year was sustained at 7.1 percent despite the
slowdown in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, the Philippines' GNP grew by 6.8 percent,
1.1 percent lower than the 7.9 percent achieved in the second
quarter because the industry sector declined slightly to 6.8
percent from 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline was attributed to contraction of the mining sector,
with only chromium mining, stone quarrying, clay and sand pits
managing to grow.
</P>
<P>
But Canlas said that the GNP is likely to grow by 7 percent to
7.2 percent for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
"Given the statistics for the first three quarters, I think it
would even be in the range of 7 percent to 7.2 percent," Canlas
said.

<HEADLINE> India's Train Blast Victims Beyond Recognition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Of the 12 passengers killed
in the bomb blast in the S-4 sleeper bogie of the Jhelum train
express at Ambala Cantt 202 km northwest of New Delhi early today,
only the body of an armyman was in relatively recognizable
condition.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here this afternoon said that the other
deceased were burnt beyond recognition. The badly charred bodies
of the three women, Sushila Devi, Bimla Devi and Ram Pyari, were
identified by their relatives from their bangles and earrings.
</P>
<P>
The blast took place just after the train, running behind
schedule, started leaving the Ambala Cantt station. Some smoke,
which was seen billowing from the compartment, was followed by a
loud blast. A number of passengers were trapped in the blasted
bogie which was soon enveloped in a blaze, eyewitnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Railway employees and scout guards initially tried to douse the
fire but they failed. They then started pulling out the badly
burnt passengers from the still burning bogie, railway sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The place where the explosion occurred had a gaping two feet
hole in the floor while the ceiling was also damaged. The fire
damaged the adjoining bogies. The entire platform and the area
surrounding the bogie were littered with tiffin boxes, cashew
nuts, partially burnt currency notes, uniforms, shoes and other
personal belongings.
</P>
<P>
Railway Minister Ram Vilas Paswan rushed to the spot and
ordered a high level probe into the blast.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Parents of five babies born
with brain damage in Hong Kong are considering taking legal action
against a local hospital for negligence during delivery, according
to a report in today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the parents have written to Princess
Margaret Hospital and the Hospital Authority, urging them to
reveal the number of such cases.
</P>
<P>
The parents were quoted as saying that they doubted whether the
hospital was telling the truth about the number of babies who died
or were born with brain damage after suffering from a lack of
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Hospital Authority chief Yeoh Eng-kiong said the hospital was
investigating the complaints, the time of birth of the babies, the
sufficiency of doctors' and nurses' services and if there was
anything done, which affected the babies.
</P>
<P>
Two mothers said they gave birth to severely brain-damaged
babies at Princess Margaret Hospital after doctors ignored their
requests for Cesarean deliveries, while Yeoh said it should be the
doctor's decision whether a woman had her baby delivered by
natural birth or Cesarean section.

<HEADLINE> UN Military Force to Move to Kampala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian led UN
multi-national force for Zaire is scheduled to move its
headquarters here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan newspaper "the New Vision" today quoted the UN
force spokesman, Major Scot Davidson, as saying#,"basically all
that has changed since Friday is approval to relocate our
headquarters to Kampala."
</P>
<P>
On Friday's Ottawa meeting in Canada, ambassadors from 14
countries agreed to deploy the UN force for relief operations in
eastern Zaire, where were concentrating Rwandan Hutu refugees and
Zaireans displaced in recent fighting between the Zairean army
and Banyamulenge rebels.
</P>
<P>
Davidson said he did not expect a major influx of troops into
Uganda in the next few days because, "our mission now is
providing air transport of humanitarian supplies into the the
theatre as opposed to having people in the ground there."
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries including the United States, France,
Britain, Belgium, Senegal and South Africa are contributing to
the mission, which is likely to comprise 1,000 or 2,000 troops
instead of the originally planned 10,000.
</P>
<P>
Zaire is against the setting up of the UN military
headquarters in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Ever since proposals for an international military
intervention in Zaire were first mooted early in November, Zaire
has insisted the operation be led from the bases on its own
territory.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, UN force commander Maurice Baril met rebel
leader Laurent Kabila in Goma, Zaire, a move which infuriated the
Zairean government.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Zairean government spokesman Oguo Makeli accused
the Canadian general Baril of violating Zaire's territorial
integrity and recognizing the legitimacy of rebel authorities.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong scientist claims
to have beaten the world's chemists to find a use for buckyballs
-- a kind of strange molecules discovered 10 years ago, according
to today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
Tang Benzhong, assistant professor of chemistry in Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology, invented new optical filters
which can be used for everything from sunglasses to hi-tech
protection against laser weapons.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that he could be in line for a Nobel Prize for his
discovery, for which the university is seeking a patent, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Buckminster fullerenes -- molecules of 60 carbon atoms
connected in clusters -- won their discoverers the Nobel Prize for
chemistry this year and are named after US architect and engineer
Buckminster Fuller.
</P>
<P>
Scientists around the world have raced to find a use for the
clusters, which have unusual properties of light absorption and
electrical conductivity.
</P>
<P>
Fullerenes, nicknamed buckyballs because of their ball-like
shape, are known to absorb ultraviolet light. Tang said his
achievement incorporates a trace amount of the fullerenes in a
thin layer of plastic or glass that remains clear and can be made
into protective eye-glasses or used for hi-tech purposes.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Armed Forces to Be Revamped: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said here today the country's armed forces are
being revamped in the present technological era.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces are being revamped to their "right size" as
they do not need to be big in number in the present technological
era and the "right size" is expected to be realized before 2005,
he told reporters at the Defense Ministry after launching a
billboard advertisement to attract recruits.
</P>
<P>
But, the defense minister did not elaborate how big is the
"right size".
</P>
<P>
He said the revamp of the armed forces would also give priority
to "fire power".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said the armed forces aim to achieve
their target ratio of three reserves to each regular for all three
services by the year 2020, with the current objective of one
reserve to each regular to be achieved by 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The capability of each service will be brought up to equal
status to enable all three services to operate in an integrated
manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the armed forces and the ministry personnel to avoid
complacency and instead to strive to improve their performance.
</P>
<P>
On the billboard advertisement, which is the first such
advertising effort, the minister said it was aimed at getting the
armed forces closer to the community.
</P>
<P>
Billboards carrying the advertisement sponsored by companies in
the defense industry have been mounted at about 20 strategic
locations around the capital and will be put up in all state
capitals eventually, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lucinschi Wins Moldovan Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Petru Lucinschi has defeated
incumbent President Mircea Snegur in Moldova's presidential
election run-off on Sunday, press reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Russia's Itar-Tass quoted Moldova's Central Electoral
Commission as saying that Lucinschi and Snegur had respectively
won 54.25 and 45.75 percent of the 89 percent of the total votes,
which has ensured Lucinschi to be the new president of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of the presidential election on November 17,
Snegur, who had led Moldova since the country gained independence
from Moscow in 1991, won 38.71 percent of ballots while Lucinschi
won 27.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide turnout was 69 percent, 2 percent up from the 67
percent in the first round of the former Soviet republic's first
presidential election since 1991.
</P>
<P>
After the first round, Lucinschi, who was backed by communists,
state television, much of the press and the Orthodox Church,
gained the support from Prime Minister Andrei Sangheli, who was
knocked out in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that five years of economic crisis have
helped the intellectual Lucinschi, 56, win support among the 4.3
million population.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi, former Moldova's ambassador in Moscow, said that he
was optimistic about Moldova's future relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we will have any differences with Russia,"
Itar-Tass quoted him as saying after the result was declared.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he has close personal contacts with the
Russian leadership, which will benefit his country.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected president expressed his appreciation over
Russian leadership for its support for Moldova's territorial
integrity and for regarding the Dnestr region as an inseparable
part of the republic.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi has been the chairman of the country's parliament
since February 1993.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Withdraw Rep. from Brcko Arbitration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb government
has decided to withdraw its representative from the International
Arbitration Commission for Brcko, whose task is to decide the fate
of a northeastern Bosnian city claimed by both the Serbs and
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic today announced the
decision of the Republika Srpska to withdraw its representative
Vitomir Popovic from the commission in a letter to Roberts Owen,
executive chairman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Klickovic noted that facts have proved that the work of the
commission has never been legally guaranteed and the commission is
only a fig leaf to impose on the Serbs any accomplished solutions
illegal and harmful against the interest of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs will no longer participate in any activities of the
commission and will not recognize any of its decisions.
</P>
<P>
The commission was established this June under the Dayton peace
accord signed last year in Dayton, Ohio, of the United States,
which put an end to the more than three-year Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
The International Court of Justice, based in the Hague, the
Netherlands, nominated U.S. lawyer Roberts Owen as the executive
chairman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Owen and two representatives -- one
from the Bosnian Serbs and the other from Bosnian Muslims --
should decide by the end of this year the fate of the northeast
Bosnian town of Brcko, which had a pre-war Muslim majority but now
is controlled by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Muslims vow to take back the port town by the River Sava, which
leads from Bosnia to Danube, while Serbs regard the city as a
vital link between the northern and southern parts of the Serb
territory and with Serbia as well.

<HEADLINE> 4 Japanese Arrested on Fake Stock-trading Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The head of a Japanese financial
company were arrested today together with three others on charges
of fraud by getting people to invest in fake stock trading.
</P>
<P>
Isao Midorikawa, 48, of Asahi Sangyo Keizai, and his associates
allegedly swindled some 400 million yen (about 3.5 million U.S.
dollars) from about 200 people nationwide, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
They collected the money from people who believed they would be
investing 20 percent of the amount needed for certain stock trades
while Midorikawa's company was putting up the remaining 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the suspects never invested the money in stock trading, and
they allegedly told customers who inquired about the investment
that the money could not be returned because of trading losses.
</P>
<P>
Asahi Sangyo Keizai, located near the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
attracted customers through advertisements in Japan's leading
financial newspapers and by direct mail, police said.

CANBERRA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended at
a six-year high due to persistent buying interests to the local
currency today.
</P>

The Australian dollar closed at 82.03 US cents from last
Friday's close of 81.08 US cents. It was the highest close since

<P>
The local currency rallied in the US foreign exchange market
last Friday. It continued the surge in the local market today by

against the Japanese yen. The upward trend in world commodity
prices also helped to strengthen investors' confidence in the
local currency.

Local traders expected the Australian dollar to remain firm in
the near term because buying from the United States and Japan
would continue to increase.

yen from 92 yen on Friday.

It is a return visit to Perry's China visit in October 1994.

At present, there is a good momentum of development in the

reached a consensus on many issues of importance a week ago, the
relations between the two countries and the two armies have gained

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Arab League Condemnation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel has rejected Arab
League (AL) condemnation on Israel's policy of settlement
expansion, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here by the Prime Minister's Office
Sunday night, spokesman Shai Bazak said Israel "sharply rejects"
such verbal attacks by Arab states and they would not succeed.
</P>
<P>
"Our neighbors will learn that instead of cursing and
threatening, they should cooperate with us to advance peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member AL condemned in an emergency session Sunday the
Israeli government's policy on the Jewish settlements expansion in
the Palestinian territories, warning such practices could destroy
the entire Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the end of the meeting, AL Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said the Israeli settlements are
"considered against international law and totally rejected by Arab
countries and the world community."
</P>
<P>
"We will never have peace of mind until the settlements issue
is ended," he declared.
</P>
<P>
The emergency session was convened at the request of Syria and
the Palestinian Authority to forge a joint Arab strategy towards
Israel's plans to build thousands of homes for new Jewish
settlers in the Gaza, West Bank and the occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Al said, in a statement issued after discussions at the
session, Israel should not only stop building new settlements but
also dismantle the existing ones immediately.
</P>
<P>
Defending the settlement policy on Israel Television Friday,
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said it is "a policy that is in
line with peace."
</P>
<P>
In his response to the AL's condemnation, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai demanded Arab states to "reduce their
belligerent tone, which isn't helping anyone."
</P>
<P>
"Forcible steps will be met with forcible steps. It won't be
worthwhile for the other side (Arab states) to act this way. It
will be better if they seek other ways," Mordechai added following
a meeting with Egyptian Ambassador here Mohammed Bassiouny Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which was arranged in advance, Mordechai
took the opportunity to ask Egypt to tone down Arab verbal
attacks on Israel and the prime minister in particular.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 122 Tons of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Law Enforcement Forces
have announced that they had seized 122 tons of narcotics in the
past eight months, showing an increase of 250 percent over the
same period of last year, a press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which was published by today's local Persian
dailies, was made by Reza Seifollahi, Commander of the Law
Enforcement Forces.
</P>
<P>
Iran confiscated 170 tons of narcotics in the last Iranian
calendar year ending on March 19.
</P>
<P>
The drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems
facing the country since it is one of the best transit routes for
drug to Europe and is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the
border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the main
drug-producing centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowers
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who are caught
with more than 30 grams of heroine or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
According to a media report, Iran has executed over 4,000 drug
traffickers since 1988 and there are over 12,500 foreign
smugglers in the Iranian jails.
</P>
<P>
Seifollahi said that about 60 million U.S. dollars worth of
smuggled goods were also confiscated in the period, adding that
his forces have busted 52 organized smuggling gangs and arrested
41,000 people in the period.
</P>
<P>
He said that his forces will tighten control over the
northern Persian Gulf shores and navigating vessels in a move to
intensify the battle against smuggling activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Tanzania

interests of depositors and facilitate efficient mobilisation and
allocation of financial resources in the economy.
</P>
<P>
BOT Governor Idris Rashidi made the remarks here at the

Association of Accountant (TAA), according to a local newspaper
report today.
</P>
<P>
Rashidi said several strategies have been drawn up by banks in
Tanzania to ensure that they operate efficiently and
professionally.
</P>
<P>
BOT, as the central bank of Tanzania, is strengthening its
capacity to supervise commercial banks and financial institutions
operating in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in the near future the status of banks would be
published so that the public knows where it is risky to deposit.

As the BOT governor, Rashidi said, once banks are allowed into
the market in the country, the central bank will try to ensure
that they operate in safe, sound and prudent manner.
</P>
<P>
"People who were involved in management of banks that failed,
or who have been declared bankrupt or been involved in cases of
fraud can not be allowed to manage banks in the country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He strongly advocated the on-going practice where banks
publish financial statements in newspapers for general
circulation, saying it was an important safeguard on safety and
sound banking.

<HEADLINE> Rough Stalks Become Tasty Fodder for North China's Cows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Cows at the largest diary farm
in Tianjin produced an average of 250 kg of milk more per head in
1995 than it had in the previous year, and that figure is expected
to grow again this year.
</P>
<P>
The reason is quite simple actually. "We have adopted a
technique that turns cheap stalks into nutritious fodder,"
explains Li Desheng, director of the No.1 Workers and Peasants
Union Diary Farm of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Chinese government began to promote the technique,
which was developed by a farm technology station in Urumqi, the
capital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in the northwest,
of using wheat, cotton, corn, and tomato stalks, and wild grass to
produce a kind of fodder.
</P>
<P>
A certain amount of microorganisms are added to the stalks,
which are then placed in airtight containers for fermentation,
after which they become fodder that the animals seem to like.
</P>
<P>
China produces 570 million tons of the stalks annually, but
more than a dozen stalk-treatment methods were tried before the
current technique arrived at as the most satisfying.
</P>
<P>
The technique has proven to be both cheap and efficient. By
using the technique, the Tianjin diary farm saved over 80,000 yuan
on the cost of fodder last year, while its milk output increased
by more than 200,000 kg.

KAMPALA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Pump fuel prices shot up again
today in Uganda, the fourth hike in less than six months this
year.
</P>
<P>
The petrol price per litre jumped from 1,150 Ugandan Shillings
(one U.S. Dollar equals to 1045 shillings) to 1,180 Shillings,
while the diesel hits 1,120 Shillings from the previous 990
Shillings per litre.

The price of kerosene soared from 850 shillings to 880
shillings per litre, representing a three percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The Acting Managing Director of Shell (U) J.R.M. Kasibante
today attributed the increase to the combined effect of the
estimated 20 shillings increase in import duty which has hiked
production costs and depreciation of the shillings.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, fuel prices went up by three percent due to
a slight increase in transport fares.
</P>
<P>
The fuel prices first rose in August this year while on
october 1 this year the fuel prices climbed by one percent in
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Technology has become one
of the leading dynamic forces pushing the development of the
distant Qaidam Basin in northwest China's Qinghai province.
</P>
<P>
Because of inconvenient transport facilities, and harsh natural
conditions, the development of the region has long lagged behind
the nation's average level.
</P>
<P>
But according to a recent report, the speed of natural resource
development, as well as agricultural and stock-raising
development, has been greatly speeded up, thanks to the efforts of
nearly 6,000 technicians from 61 institutions in the area.
</P>
<P>
"At least 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars) has been
generated just by the application of new technologies in the
exploration of natural resources", the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that during recent years the once-low grain
output has been "greatly increased", because of the introduction
of new breeds, and the improvement of field management.
</P>
<P>
Being rich in such resources as salt and gold, the region has
been widely known as one of China's "treasure-houses".
</P>
<P>
"We see great economic potential in future development, by
turning this potential into reality, technicians will find more
roles to play," said an local official.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Pudong Area to Become Gardenlike Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Grass, trees and concrete go
hand-in-hand in Shanghai's Pudong New Area designed for Chinese
and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The booming development zone has made great efforts to build
itself into a garden-like town since it was set up in 1990.
</P>
<P>
All newly-built enterprises or institutions in Pudong have been
required to afforest at least 40 percent of their occupied area at
their own cost.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the largest metropolis in China, is divided into two
parts separated by Huangpu River. Pudong stands on the eastern
bank of the river and was backward compared with the developed
western area before 1990.
</P>
<P>
The setting-up of Pudong New Area, covering 522 sq. km. and
with a population of 1.1 million, has been a major move in
furthering the reform and opening policy instituted by the Chinese
government in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Administrative Committee of Pudong, from the very
beginning, attached prime importance to making the area a green
district, with vast areas of trees and lawns.
</P>
<P>
According to international standards, a modernized town should
have at least a green coverage of up to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the average per capita green spot in the urbanized
area of Pudong has increased from 0.54 square meters to 2.85
sq.m., according to officials in charge of the matter.
</P>
<P>
The committee plans to expand the green area in Pudong's urban
area to eight sq.m. per capita by the end of the century. By then,
the coverage of trees and lawns is expected to reach 25 per cent
of the urban area, which now stands at 60 sq.km. and is expected
to be enlarged to 100 sq.km. by 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, in the coming few years, a number
of green projects will be carried out in Pudong by building three
parks, covering 100,000 sq.m., and planting numerous trees and
vast pieces of grasslands in residential blocks and alongside
major streets and thoroughfares.

<HEADLINE> Stone Paintings Discovered In North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A number of stone paintings that
characterize the religious life of the Mongolian people 700 years
ago have been found in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Gai Shanlin, a prominent archaeologist, says that three stone
paintings have been found in the north part of Inner Mongolia, one
of them depicting a Mongolian tribal hero and three other
important people being worshiped by three servants.
</P>
<P>
Some religious objects and common utensils were portrayed in
another painting, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the paintings reflect the time when Tibetan
Buddhism was spread to Inner Mongolia 700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 40 groups of ancient paintings on stones in
an area along a grassy corridor in Inner Mongolia, Gai said.
</P>
<P>
They show the activities of people hunting, raising animals,
worshiping, and feature drawings of animals, flowers, Buddhas,
pagodas, religious symbols, and ancient figures, he said, noting
that the paintings demonstrate some early methods of worship using
totemic items.

KAMPALA, December 2 (Xinhua) --South African President Nelson
Mandela said that his country will soon open a high commission in
Kampala, capital of Uganda, local daily "New Vision" reported

<P>
A South African team is already in Kampala to survey the high
commissioner's premises.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Elderly People in Shanghai Enjoy Privilege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Life is being made easier for
citizens over the age of 70 in Shanghai, the largest manufacturing
and business center in China.
</P>
<P>
Elderly people are more likely to come across difficulties than
younger generations when they travel or engage in out-door
activities.
</P>
<P>
But this age group in Shanghai are more at ease, thanks to all
sorts of privileges they enjoy.
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Shanghai began to offer privileges to the
elderly, covering railway travel, postal and bus services,
entertainment, and hospital services.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has issued over 830,000 privilege cards to the
elderly, enabling thousands of pensioners to enjoy the benefits.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, the elderly do not have to queue while
buying train tickets, arranging consignment of goods and parcels,
or when they visit doctors in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Those with hospital proof can get priority when buying soft-seat
train tickets, and if in need, they can be helped to get on the
train, and receive special care from attendants.
</P>
<P>
As part of the privilege, they also enjoy a free ferry
service, and do not have to pay for parks or public
toilets.

<HEADLINE> Cataract Suffers in Northwest China Given Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A poor farmer who is a member
of the Hui ethnic group in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in
northwest China could hardly believe that he got his eyesight
back, three years after losing it.
</P>
<P>
The beneficiary of the sight-restoring operation, a 46-year-old
farmer, Ma Baowen, was one of a number of people suffering from
cataracts in rural parts of Ningxia who got assistance from a
medical team organized up by the Ministry of Public Health and the
China Federation of the Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very grateful to the medical team," Ma said, after having
gotten help from the team of more than 30 ophthalmologists and
medical workers from Beijing, Shanghai, and Ningxia, who went to
poor villages last month to perform operations on cataract
sufferers free of charge.
</P>
<P>
With the help of advanced artificial crystalline lenses, 1,384
people were able to regain their eyesight.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the China Federation of the Handicapped said
that the team is the first to be sent by the state during the 1996
to 2000 period, and is the largest of its kind in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In the future, more patients suffering from cataract are
expected to benefit from the state medical-assistance program,
sources with the federation said.

<HEADLINE> India Favors Phased Globalization of Govt Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- In view of the doubts over
equal opportunities becoming available to developing nations from
the government procurement agreement (GPA), India would resist all
efforts to bring government procurement under the ambit of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) at the forthcoming ministerial
meeting in Singapore, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Efforts, however, would be made to suggest progressive bindings
by developing countries after initially putting in minimum offers
and improving them on the basis of the benefits derived.
</P>
<P>
The issue is considered crucial in view of the bidding policies
followed by India and some other developing countries on
preference to the public sector. Globalization of government
procurement would also have implications for the policies followed
by the government to save foreign exchange spending and encourage
the domestic industry at the same time through import substitution
policies, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
GPA signatories should permit developing countries to join the
pact with minimum offers on select areas and see if they actually
benefit on an equal footing with the industrialized economies. If
the fears about imbalances or lack of a level playing field are
allayed, they would automatically improve their offers.
</P>
<P>
Since government procurement accounts for business worth
trillions of US dollars, the industrialized nations, especially
the U.S. and the European countries are keen to make all aspects
of this area subject to WTO rules.

<HEADLINE> Indian Bank to Further Cut Cash Reserve Ratio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Reserve Bank
of India (RBI) C. Rangarajan has said that the apex bank plans to
effect a further one percentage point cut in cash reserve ratio
(CRR) in January next year to allay fears on priority sector
lending by Indian banks.
</P>
<P>
"The second installment of a one percentage point cut in CRR
will be made in January next year. It is our intention that we
should bring about a reduction to CRR by another one percentage
point in January unless there is very strong increase in money
supply consequent upon very large increase in foreign exchange
assets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the RBI announced 1 percentage point cut of
CRR in a bid to alleviate credit pinch.
</P>
<P>
The RBI governor claimed that the cost of credit has already
come down after the first cut in CRR. "We did send out a very
strong message that there is need for bringing down the prime
lending rate of commercial banks and we also said that the banks
should on their own part put a cap on the lending rate," he said.
</P>
<P>
The RBI's busy season credit policy has two objectives -- to
enhance the lendable resources available to the banks and to bring
down the cost of credit, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> China Scores Progress in Making Compulsory Education Universal (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The past few years have seen
steady development in the spread of compulsory education in China,
according to a national conference held in Anhui Province recently.
</P>
<P>
Delegates to the conference on compulsory education in
Ma'anshan agreed that China can be divided into three areas for
purposes of speaking about the spread of nine-year compulsory
education.
</P>
<P>
The areas are the eastern coastal area of six developed
provinces; the central area, covering twelve provinces; and
northwest and southwest area, consisting of nine underdeveloped
provinces and regions.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and 1,025
counties had met state requirements for implementation of
compulsory education, covering 36 percent of the populated parts
of China, and 45 percent of the people were estimated to be
receiving compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997, the six coastal provinces are expected to
make compulsory education universal, and the twelve provinces in
the central part will wait until 1999.
</P>
<P>
The northwest and southwest parts of China, which are the most
financially-difficult area, will have to wait until the beginning
of the next century at the earliest.

<TEXT>
<P>
Progress is being made now, according to the State Education
Commission, but problems still exist, especially in the financial
situation.
</P>
<P>
It is still quite common in some regions for teachers to gear
their work simply to preparing students for examinations.
</P>
<P>
But basic education should be targeted at improving the quality
of people and this is quite urgent.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should take charge of compulsory
education, and when problems crop up, they should solve them.
</P>
<P>
This government function must be improved, said Liu Bing,
vice-minister in charge of the State Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
He noted that financial problems should mainly be solved by the
government, which should not shirk its responsibility in running
schools.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about shifting from education for passing examines to
education for the improvement of individuals, he pointed out that
compulsory education means equal education for all people, and its
universal qualities should be stressed. Educating selected people
is not the purpose of compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
Being able to receive education at the neighbourhood school
and getting a free education are the two most important
characteristics of compulsory education, he explained.
</P>
<P>
To step up the development of compulsory education, competition
in getting a higher education and selecting certain schools should
be discouraged, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Add One More Terminal at Changi Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has decided to
build the third terminal at its Changi Airport, in order to
"maintain Changi's position as a premier hub airport," Singapore
Minister for Communication Mah Bow Tan announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Detailed designing of the Terminal 3 will begin in 1997 and
construction will start in 1999 with completion scheduled for
2003. It will commence operations in 2004, Mah said.
</P>
<P>
Terminal 3 will be designed for an annual handling capacity of
around 20 million passenges, bringing the total handling capacity
of Singapore Changi Airport to 64 million passengers per year.
</P>
<P>
Terminal 3 will also provide 25 additional aerobridge gates,
bringing the total number of aerobridge gates in the Changi
Airport to 88. Besides, the aerobridge parking stands will be
designed for new generation aircraft, such as the 600-seater
super-jumbos.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary cost estimate for the construction of Terminal
3 and related facilities is in the region of 1.5 billion Singapore
dollars (about 1.1 billion US dollars). And the construction of
Terminal 3 will be funded by the internal financial reserves of
the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), a CAAS official
said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Changi Airport handled 23 million passengers last year and
is expected to handle 25 million passengers this year.
</P>
<P>
Mah noted that the Changi Airport is not the only one making
huge investments to serve the increased demand for air travel.
Kuala Lumpur's new Sepang Airport is expected to be operational in
early 1998, while Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok Airport is coming on
stream by the middle of 1998, he said.

TOKYO, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan and the United States today
agreed to move a U.S. military heliport in Okinanwa to floating
facility off the coast of the prefecture's main island.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, drafted by the bilateral Special Action
Committee on Okinawa has paved the way for closure of the
U.S. Marine Corps Futemna Air Station, where the heliport is

document gave the go-ahead to a cut of about 21 percent in the
area of land occupied by U.S. military bases in the southernmost
island prefecture of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed at a meeting in Tokyo by Japanese
Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and Defense Agency chief Fumio
Kyuma and U.S. Secretary of Defense Willian Perry and Ambassador
to Japan Walter Mondale.
</P>
<P>
Some 75 percent of all land used by the U.S. military in Japan
is concentrated in Okinawa, although the island prefecture makes
up only 0.6 percent of the country's total land area.

<HEADLINE> Tree-Planting Brings Wealth to Chinese Peasants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese peasant who was
driven by poverty to leave his hometown in Shandong Province to
move to the northeast in 1949 at the age of 13, never dreamed that
he would become really rich half a century later.
</P>
<P>
Tang Yanxiu, who now lives in Yangmudingzi Village in Jilin
Province, never conceals either his happiness or his wealth from
visitors from afar. In addition to the large amount of money that
he has in the bank, Tang's assets include 2,500 plum trees, 30,000
pines and poplar trees on seven ha. of former wasteland, and more
than three ha. of farm crops with a large number of pigs, cattle,
geese, and ducks.
</P>
<P>
In addition to all this, he owns a "nature reserve", an area
for wild ginseng on more than 1.3 ha. of land that is worth a lot.
</P>
<P>
"It's the government's policy that has made me rich," Tang
explains simply, "but, I'm very hard-working and level-headed in
addition."
</P>
<P>
His fortune began in 1981 when the province adopted a contract
responsibility system that ties income to performance, as other
parts of the country have done.
</P>
<P>
That year, Tang sold some wild ginseng that he had collected,
earning more than 6,000 yuan. With that money he bought oxen and
saws and went to work in the forests, earning an even bigger
fortune, over 20,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing years, he just kept expanding his wealth,
planting trees, ginseng, and crops, and raising animals.
</P>
<P>
He, however, has never forgotten his humble roots or the land
that gave him his start, and in recent years, has donated more
100,000 yuan for charity and to help his poor neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The local government has praised him for his meritorious
actions to encourage more people to follow his example.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that there are many people like Tang in the
Changbei mountains in the province who have become rich through
hard efforts by the implementation of the contract responsibility
system, and northeast China is considered a poorer area.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the policy to encourage some people to get
rich first will lead to common prosperity for all people.

Colombo, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Ninety Tamil rebels have been
arrested by Sri Lankan government troops in the Jaffna peninsula
in the past two weeks, military sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had infiltrated the areas as refugees and engaged in

Meanwhile, the security forces are expanding the perimeters of
the areas and in doing so they have been able to flush out pockets
of rebel cadres and unearth a large stock of arms and ammunition,

LHASA, December 2 (Xinhua)-- Farmers in an area of the Tibet
Autonomous Region have found a new source of income, growing
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Linzhi Prefectural Tobacco Monopoly Bureau

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is steadily closing
its trade gap with China, recording a 24 percent decline in its
trade deficit in the first eight months of this year compared with
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Business Economics Department of the Thai
government, the deficit in the first eight months was 5.16 billion
baht (206 million US dollars) while total two-way trade was 60.32
billion baht (2.41 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Though Thailand has had a trade deficit with China for five
years, it has been decreasing steadily, from 21.18 billion baht
(847 million dollars) in 1992 to 11.32 billion baht (452 million
dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post today quoted the department as saying that
massive imports of capital goods and raw materials from China were
the main cause of the imbalance, while exports of farm produce to
China have been dropping.
</P>
<P>
Thailand shipped 27.58 billion baht (1.1 billion dollars) worth
of goods to China from January to August, down by one percent from
the same period last year.

GUANGZHOU, December 2 (Xinhua) -- A farmer in south China who
made a considerable amount of money by transporting goods sold
several of his trucks recently, and plans to put most of the money
he got into land development for growing vegetables and raising
fish.
</P>
<P>
Ye Huizan is one of the several hundred thousand farmers on the
Pearl River Delta who have returned to agricultural production,
which is now a profitable undertaking, from their former
profitable transport businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey done in Guangdong Province, one-fifth of
the 520,000 farmers in Zhaoqing and Yunfu who went to other parts
of the country to look for work have returned to the fields.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of farmers in the suburbs of Guangzhou, the
provincial capital, have also come back, removing their work shoes
to get their feet dirty in paddy fields again to produce high
yields.
</P>
<P>
In Qiaotou Township, Dongguan City, 1,000 laborers have come
back from other fields of businesses to the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Large tracts of land for orchards, vegetable farms, and fish
ponds in the Pearl River Delta are proving more attractive to the
migrant farmers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the "return rush" of farmers has become an
important financial source for local agricultural
development.

<HEADLINE> Russia Opposes NATO's Eastward Expansion: Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia will reiterate its
opposition to NATO's proposed eastward expansion at the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) summit
slated to open here Monday, Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Russia will not allow NATO to play a dominant role in the
building of the European security, Chernomyrdin told Portuguese
media before leaving Moscow for Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is part of Europe. Europe is our home. To the future of
its home, Russia will not stay indifferent. Russia will not agree
to any ideas and moves that try to exclude Russia from joining in
the construction of the security system of the European Mansion,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he, on behalf of President Boris
Yeltsin, will convince leaders to the summit that the OSCE should
be an axis organization in building the European security.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia cannot exercise veto on the issue of NATO's
eastward expansion, nobody can deprive Russia of its right to
defend its position, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister, accompanied by Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, is scheduled to submit to the summit proposals
for "the development of a general and all-embracing model for a
Europe of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and government of the 54 OSCE states to attend
the summit are expected to adopt documents that will map out a new
security blueprint for the European continent.
</P>
<P>
The last OSCE summit two years ago in Budapest, Hungary, was
wrecked by a row over the same issue.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who arrived here today, has met Portuguese
President Jorge Sampaio and Prime Minister Antonio Guterres.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE was established in 1972 as the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), providing a multilateral forum
for dialogue and negotiation. The CSCE summit in December 1994
adopted the new name of OSCE, in order to reflect the body's
changing political role.
</P>
<P>
Its 54 participating nations comprise all the recognized
countries of Europe and Canada, the United States and all the
former republics of the disintegrated Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of U.S. college
students studying overseas is increasing sharply in the past few
years and many prefer going to universities in Asia, Africa and
the Middle East rather than those in traditional Europe, a survey
found.
</P>
<P>
The number of American students studying abroad rose 10.6
percent to 84,403 in 1994-95, continuing a 10-year upward trend, a
report released Sunday by the New York-based Institute of
International Education said.
</P>
<P>
A fast-growing economic market in China led to a 30 percent
increase in American students studying there in 1994-95. Costa
Rica also reported a 30 percent increase, partly because many
students want to learn Spanish, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australia is aggressively recruiting U.S. students.
It reported a 42 percent rise in American enrollees in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that studying abroad was now considered a
more instrumental part of undergraduate education and the American
students recognize the importance of a second language and
international experience in competing for good jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States seas a continued sixth-year slow
growth in foreign students in U.S. campuses this year. The 453,787
foreigners on U.S. campuses this year is only 0.3 more than a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The institute has conducted an annual statistical survey of the
foreign student population in the United States since 1949.

<P>
BELGRADE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb Republic
decided today to quit the International Arbitration Commission for
Brcko, saying it would no longer recognize any decision made by
the commission.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Roberts Owen, executive chairman of the
commission, Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic said the
commission was only "a fig leaf used to impose illegal and
established solutions that harm the fundamental legal interests of
the Serbs."
</P>
<P>
The commission, formed last June in accordance with the Dayton
peace accord, includes a Muslim-Croat representative, a Serb
representative and an executive chairman appointed by the
international court.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the commission is to arbitrate on the border
along the Bosnian Serb-controlled Brcko Corridor.
</P>
<P>
The commission has never been able to operate normally as the
Muslims insist that Brcko belongs to them while the Serbs demand
an expansion of the corridor from the current eight kilometers to
20 kilometers in width.

<HEADLINE> New Talks on Indonesia's Car Policy to Begin in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 2 (Xinhua) -- New talks on Indonesia's policy
to build a so-called "national car" will start in Geneva on
Tuesday, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Industry and Trade Minister Tungky Ariwibowo was
quoted as saying that the talks with representatives of Japan, the
European Union (EU) and the United States would continue until
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the two countries have filed a complaint with the
World Trade Organization (WTO) over the policy, saying that the
policy violated international trade rules of the WTO as some of
the cars are in fact being built in South Korea. The first round
of talks were held in early November.
</P>
<P>
Ariwibowo said the second phase would focus on written
questions on the policy submitted by the EU, Japan and the United
States at the earlier round of talks, the Bisnis Indonesia daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The questions concerned "local content" in the cars,
Indonesia's national automotive industry in general and the export
and import policies relating to vehicles.
</P>
<P>
In February, Indonesian President Soeharto decided that
producers of a national car would be granted exemptions of import
duties and luxury taxes. These taxes normally add about 60 percent
to the price of cars in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In a joint venture with Kia Motors of South Korea, Pt. Timor
Putra Nasional is allowed to import the cars from South Korea
until its own factory becomes operational in 1998. The company has
so far imported at least 10,500 sedans from South Korea, Bisnis
Indonesia said.

<HEADLINE> Flooding Helps Raise Underground Water Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The floods in both north and
south China this year have not only brought about losses and
disasters, but also an unexpected rise in the level of underground
water.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the rainstorms in water-starved Beijing alone
have served to raise the underground water here by more than one m.
</P>
<P>
This year the flooding in the Pearl, Yangtze, Huaihe, Yellow
and Haihe rivers, all major rivers in China, has caused severe
economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that most of the 30 billion cu m of rain which fell
in north China's Hebei Province this year has turned into
underground water or flowed into reservoirs, to the benefit of
local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They urged the authorities to take this opportunity to
improve management of surface and underground water and to stop
the over-exploitation of underground water, which has led to a
lowering of the water table in over 100 cities, including Tianjin,
Shanghai, Xi'an, Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou.
</P>
<P>
The over-exploitation of underground water in water-starved
north China has also led to other serious problems, including
earth subsidence.
</P>
<P>
Each year China consumes 90 billion cu m of underground water,
17 percent of the country's total water supply.

SHENYANG, December 2 (Xinhua) -- Coastal resort city Dalian, in
northeast China's Liaoning Province, has recently promulgated
regulations on the management of advertisements in a move to
standardize the operations of the city's news media in the field.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, which have 22 clauses, stipulate that news
media can not advertise any product unless the contents of the
advertisement are in full accordance with the qualifications of
the product.
</P>
<P>
Examinations have to be made by government departments before
carrying advertisements for such products as medicines, medical
apparatus, agricultural pesticides, and other important products.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also add that non-advertising-departments of
news media are not allowed to engage in advertising activities in
any form.
</P>
<P>
In order to upgrade the quality of ads, and put an end to false
ads, the Enterprise Advisory Center in Dalian will provide
consultation on related laws and regulations for clients who
intend to put advertizements in newspapers and magazines starting
January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official at the city government, the city
boasts 14 newspapers, nine TV stations, and seven broadcasting

<HEADLINE> Domestic Fuel Prices to double in Capital City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 2 (Xinhua) -- The price of Beijing residents'
daily fuel will double this month in order to keep the city's
loss-making fuel production firms operating, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The price of piped natural gas will be raised from the present
0.3 yuan (3.6 cents) to 0.6 yuan (7.2 cents) per cubic meter, and
that of piped gas will be raised from 0.7 yuan (8.4 cents) to 1.4
yuan (16.8 cents) per cubic meter, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Allocated liquefied petroleum gas will go from 11.4 yuan (1.37
US dollars) to 22.8 yuan (2.74 US dollars) per cylinder and the
gas extra supply will be raised from 24 yuan (2.89 US dollars) to
48 yuan (5.78 US dollars) per cylinder.
</P>
<P>
The price of honeycomb-shaped coal briquets will also be raised.
</P>
<P>
The price increase will affect Beijing's 1.01 million piped gas
users and 1.05 million cylinder liquefied petroleum gas users.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Municipal Commodity Price Administration
said that the move was intended to turn the capital's money-losing
factories into profit-making ones and to enhance residents'
energy-saving awareness.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the State increased the price of coal,
petroleum and natural gas to sustain the development of basic
industries. This has resulted in an increase in fuel production
costs in Beijing, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The price of raw coal for making honeycomb-shaped briquets has
been raised from 60 yuan (7.20 US dollars) in 1993 to 125 yuan
(about 15 US dollars) per ton this year.
</P>
<P>
Including other price increases in transportation, power and
maintenance, the current production cost of briquets has reached
246 yuan (29.6 US dollars) per ton. A sales price of 96 yuan (11.5
US dollars) per ton meant manufacturers lost 150 yuan (18.1 US
dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The city's fuel production firms lost a total of one billion
yuan (120 US dollars) last year, resulting in a payment of 824
million yuan (99.2 million US dollars) from the city's financial
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that these firms are likely to lose 1.23
billion yuan (148 million US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
The city's financial departments will have difficulty providing
subsidies if fuel prices are not raised. The long-term fuel supply
for residents may be affected, the spokesman warned.

<HEADLINE> International Conference Supports West African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from some 20
countries meeting to discuss the Liberian conflict have expressed
support to the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"Disarmament is the key to the Liberian peace proces," said the
participants at the just-concluded special international conference on
the Liberian crisis in Brussels, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria
today.
</P>
<P>
The conference's message of support for ECOMOG, according to the
official news agency, states that demoblization of the about 60,000
combatants in the war-torn country is the essential step to the
disarming process.
</P>
<P>
The participants, including foreign ministers or their
representatives, were from Belgium, Canada, Burkina Faso, Gambia,
Germany, Norway, Portugal, Japan, Sweden, the United States,
Britain, Italy, Mali, Nigeria, the Netherlands, France, Cote
d'Ivoire and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
They particularly commended the ecomog commander, Nigeria's
Major-General Victor Malu, saying "he intends to leave no stone
unturned" to ensure the success of the on-going disarmament exercise
by giving his personal supervision.
</P>
<P>
The conference expressed the readiness of the donor countries to
give necessary support to facilitate the effective functioning of the
peacekeeping force, especially as a follow up to progress made so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the conference affirmed support for the
resolve of the economic community of west african states (ECOWAS) to
invoke sanctions against the leaders of any faction that violates
provisions of the revised abuja peace accord signed last August in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The participants also discussed the possibilities of assisting
ecowas to extend the geographical scope of any of the sanctions
imposed on any erring faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, the conference said, "can be implemented
progressively from relatively mild ones to harsher ones like exclusion
from the coming elections and the establishment of a war crime
tribunal".
</P>
<P>
It emphasized the need to further strengthen ECOMOG's capacity to
enforce any santions imposed on any of the faction leaders who might
be penalized for a breach of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the donor countries at the conference reaffirmed their
willingness to finance rehabilitation programs for the Liberian
fighters being disarmed and welcomed the announcement by the United
Nations organizations and the Europeace Commission that program for
the rehabilitation had already been formulated.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament exercise started in liberia on November 22 and more
than 1,500 fighters have since turned in their weapons to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament process will last till January 31, 1997 to pay the
way for the country's elections scheduled in May.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the conference are representatives of such
international agencies as the European Commission, the International
Monetary Fund, the Organization of African Unity and some UN agencies,
as well as a special envoy of Ruth Perry, Chairperson of Liberia's
Council of State.

<HEADLINE> Intense Competition in Greece's Fast-Food Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Greece's fast-food sector has
become a heatedly contested one with four companies, Greece's
Goody's and Hambo and the U.S. giants McDonald's and Wendy's at
the forefront.
</P>
<P>
They are vying for a share of a market estimated to be valued
at over 50 billion drachmas (about 220 million U.S. dollars)
annually.
</P>
<P>
McDonald's, which entered the Greek market at the decade's
beginning, is unfolding rapidly on the local scene, with a total
of 16 outlets operating in Greece by the end of 1995. Its outlets
will have amounted to 30 by the end of this year. The company
expects this figure to swell to 70 within the next two-year
period.
</P>
<P>
Ever since its arrival in Greece, McDonalds' investments have
grown steadily. In 1993, McDonalds invested a total of 640 million
drachmas (2.78 million dollars) in the Greek market, over 1
billion (4.35 million dollars) in 1994, 3.3 billion (14.3 million
dollars) in 1995 and 4.8 billion (21 million dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
With a market presence in Athens and Salonika at present,
McDonalds' next step will be the city of Patras located in
northwestern Peloponnese.
</P>
<P>
Greek fast-food chain Goody's has so far launched a sizable
101 outlets throughout the country and plans soon to introduce a
further 15, of which seven will be located in the great Athens
area.
</P>
<P>
Wendy's, which first entered the Greek market in 1989, and is
owned by the Nikas group, operates a total of 10 outlets, of which
eight are located in the great Athens area, and the other two are
in Larissa, central Greece and Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
The company plans for the new year to entail the opening of six
new outlets, of which two will be located in Athens, and the
others in Patras, Salonika, Ioannina and Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
Greek-owned Hambo operates 28 outlets, of which 15 are located
in the great Athens area. The company's total revenues reached 4
billion drachmas (17.4 million dollars) in 1995, and are expected
to increase to 4.8 billion drachmas (20.8 million dollars) in
1996.

<HEADLINE> UN Approves Resolution on Nigeria's Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A committee of the United
Nations General Assembly has voted 86-14, with 56 abstentions, to
approve a resolution on the human rights situation in Nigeria,
the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The resolution sponsored by the European Union demands that
the General Assembly show its "deep concern" about alleged human
rights violations in Nigeria and urges its government to release
all political prisoners, trade union leaders, human rights
activists and journalists.
</P>
<P>
The resolution notes the Nigerian government's "declared
commitment" to transition to civil rule and urges it to take
"immediate concrete" steps to restore democracy.
</P>
<P>
The approved resolution will be forwarded to the
185-member General Assembly, which is expected to adopt it before
going on recess on December 17.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Ambassador to the UN, Ibrahim Gambari, called the
resolution unbalanced and unnecessary, in view of the progress
made by the Nigerian government in promoting and protecting human
rights as well as moving the country towards civilian rule.

<HEADLINE> Rally Organizers Must Strictly Obey Law: Belgrade Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Following a number of
large-scale anti-government rallies in Belgrade in the past 10
days, Belgrade police demanded that rally organizers strictly
abide by law and report to police the detailed demonstration plan
in advance.
</P>
<P>
"Rallies have been held in Belgrade in the past few days by the
political parties organized in the Zajedno (Together) opposition
coalition, which in many cases have had elements of violence and
gross violations of the law," said a statement issued today by the
Secretariat for Internal Affairs in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
During these events, the police have been more tolerant than
its obligations to public law and order and to the safety of the
people and their property require, mostly because the events have
taken place at a time of election tension and holidays, said the
statement which was quoted by the official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the elections and holidays are over, and regular
working days are to be resumed, during which Belgraders have every
right to expect full personal safety as well as security for their
proper and safe movement in the streets for themselves and their
children, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 days, tens of thousands of Belgraders, led by
the Zajedno coalition leaders, held demonstrations and rallies in
downtown Belgrade to protest against the government's decision to
annul part of results of the second round of election for local
authorities held on November 17.
</P>
<P>
During the rallies, some protesters threw raw eggs and stones
onto the Serbian Parliament, the presidency, the state TV as well
as the building which houses the leading pro-government dailies
Politika and Borba.
</P>
<P>
"In light of this, the Secretariat for Internal Affairs warns
all parties and organizations planning to hold public rallies in
future that they have the duty to abide strictly by the law,
including the duty to report that they plan to hold a rally, where
and when it should be held, and all obligations envisaged under
the law in this connection," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat considers as justifiable all complaints made by
citizens about this kind of behavior and warns the organizers of
and participants in public rallies that they alone will bear
responsibility for every violation of the law and endangerment of
the right to safety of other citizens and their property.
</P>
<P>
"The consequences of disregarding the regulations will be only
to their detriment, because the police will act in line with the
law in every respect," it warned.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations that are underway in Belgrade are the
largest ones in Serbia since those of March 9, 1991. The
demonstrations in that year were later crushed by the police.

<TEXT>
<P>
Each of the estimated 3,000 families received a hand hoe,
which was made in China, and seeds to grow tomatoes, leeks,
cabbage, eggplants and melons on their farmland.
</P>
<P>
Similar distributions, operated by the United Nations Food
and Agricultre Organization, were taking place in other parts
of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"I's ready to work and to grow food," said Kathevine Nyiragia,
61, a woman who arrived in Rutongo only one week ago following a
28 day trek on barefoot from a refugee camp where she said she
lost her husband and two children.
</P>
<P>
Kathevine was among an estimated 600,000 Rwandan refugees who
have, during the last two weeks, returned from eastern Zaire.
Most of them are farmewrs.
</P>
<P>
The FAO estimates that about five million U. S. Dollars are
needed for some 2.3 million people in the Greak Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
FAO officials said the supply of hand hoes and vegetable seeds
is part of a continuing assistance program to increase
productivity to cope with the sudden and massive return of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The organization is also planning to expand the program in
Rwanda and its neighboring countries.
