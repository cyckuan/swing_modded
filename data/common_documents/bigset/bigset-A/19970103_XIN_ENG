<P>
SINGAPORE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The ruling People's Action
Party (PAP) has won the single-seat constituency of Kampong Glam
in the general election today.
</P>
<P>
In Kampong Glam ward, PAP candidate Loh Meng See beat the

<P>
At the close of the poll at 20:00 local time (1200 GMT), 95.86

<HEADLINE> US Jobless Claims Increase to 5-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of American
workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits reached the
highest level in more than five months, the U.S. Labor Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the jobless claims shot up by 22,000
last week ending December 28 of last year. The new applications
for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 366,000,
up from a revised 344,000 during the week ending December 21.
</P>
<P>
It was the highest level of new jobless claims in the U.S.
since they totaled 367,000 during the week ending July 13.
</P>
<P>
The increase of 22,000 jobless claims was also the biggest jump
since they shot up by 23,000 at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims rose
by 9,000 to 352,500, the highest since 360,500 on July 13.
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. analysts prefer to track the less-volatile four-week
average because it smooths out the spikes in the weekly reports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. unemployment rate has been increasing in the past few
months. After dipping to 5.1 percent in August, the unemployment
rate grew to 5.4 percent in November, the highest since an
identical jobless rate last July.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Forces Continue Cross-Border Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces are
continuing their cross-border military operation in a bid to
destroy the military bases of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) in northern Iraq, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Turkish F-4 fighters, which took off from
the air base in Diyarbakir, southeastern Turkey, bombarded Hakurk
camp, one of the largest PKK camps in Sinath region and over 10
kilometers deep into northern Iraq this morning in the continued
cross-border operation, which have lasted for three days.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Turkish security forces killed many
PKK militants, but failed to give the figure.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Turkish fighters started to bombard three PKK
camps in Sinath region and about 5,000 Turkish ground troops
and village guards began to attack the PKK militants, who tried
to flee from Sindi throat in northern Iraq under the cover
of Cobra helicopters.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued Wednesday by the General Staff
of the Turkish Armed Forces, the Turkish security forces killed 72
PKK rebels in the past two days of the cross-border operation.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops have entered northern Iraq for several times in
order to wipe out the PKK militants, who intermittently launch
cross-border attacks against Turkish military and civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government, which has been deprived of the control
over the northern Kurdish area by the U.S.-led western forces, has
made protests against the Turkish operations before and accused
Turkey of violating its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a guerrilla war for autonomy,
which has claimed more than 21,000 lives in southeastern Turkey
since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Arafat-Netanyahu Summit Likely Today, Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is
expected to meet today, but they may not sign the Hebron deal,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held an eight-hour
meeting with Palestinian senior officials Abu Mazen throughout
the night at the Herzliya home of U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk
in the presence of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The talks was held after the terrorist shooting in Hebron
earlier Wednesday in which an Israeli soldier shot and wounded
seven Palestinians in the central Market. Both sides condemned
the terrorist act and promised to continue the ongoing peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said after the talks that an Arafat-Netanyahu
summit would possibly be held late today, but several outstanding
issues remained to be resolved before the Hebron agreement could
be signed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Palestinian side should not try to
reopen talks on issues that have been closed. Israeli officials
feared that the Palestinian side might make new demands for
security reasons following the shooting incident Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, issues of concern to the Palestinians include
obtaining a firm date for the last Israeli troop pullback from
the West Bank, the gradual release of prisoners and a Palestinian
presence at the Tomb of Patriachs, the holy shrine for both Jews
and Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side especially insisted on its demand for
joint patrol near the holy shrine in order to protect the safety
of Palestinian worshipers. Hebron, where 450 Jewish settlers
live among 120,000 Palestinians, has been a hotbed for
Israeli-Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
Before the Wednesday shooting, a Jewish settler named Baruch
Goldstein killed 29 Palestinian worshipers and wounded dozens of
other in a similar shooting spree in February 1994 at the Tomb
of Patriachs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who is now visiting India,
stressed the urgency of speedy conclusion of the long-delayed
agreement on Israeli troop pullback from Hebron. He asked
Mordechai Wednesday to convey a message to Arafat to express
regret for the shooting incident which he described as "a stupid
and wicked act."
</P>
<P>
Ross acted quickly after the Wednesday shooting by holding
separate meetings with Netanyahu and Arafat to offset the
possible repercussion of the incident on the Hebron talks. He
said the incident underscored quick action on concluding a deal
on Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned Arafat Wednesday to
express "outrage and sadness" at the incident. Israeli sources
said that during their phone conversation, Clinton urged Arafat to
wrap up the Hebron talks.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Remains Quiet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Hebron is reportedly quiet
today, one day after an Israeli soldier opened fire to a crowd of
Palestinians in the center of the West Bank town, wounding at
least seven people.
</P>
<P>
Israeli forces have beefed up the security in Hebron, as
armored personnel carriers were placed at key points around the
city, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Noam Friedman, the soldier who carried out the
attack Wednesday, remained in custody, as police and the
General Security Services are trying to find out more about
the man and the motive of his actions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media revealed that Friedman had mental problems.
</P>
<P>
Friedman joined army several months ago, and after some basic
training, he was assigned to a guarding unit at an army base on
the outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The oldest of four children, Friedman lived with his parents in
the Jewish settlement town of Ma'aleh Adumim north of
Jerusalem. He returns home every evening from his base except when
on duty.
</P>
<P>
From a Jewish family, Friedman studied, before his eventually
call-up to the army, in a number of Yeshivas, Jewish religious
seminaries, in the Jerusalem area.
</P>
<P>
Press reports today quoted several rabbis, or Jewish priests,
and people who know him, as saying that Friedman had shown strange
behaviors for some years.
</P>
<P>
A psychologist at Ma'aleh Adumim, who treated him, reportedly
sent a letter to the army, suggesting serious consideration on
Friedman's enlisting and entitlement to carrying weapon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army's military police have also been ordered to open
investigations into Friedman, particularly into the circumstances
of his call up into the army.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Threatens To Withdraw From Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) has put pressure on Nigeria to ensure the success
of its programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
An UNDP official said the organization said it would withdraw
from financing or co-financing development programs if any of its
programs in the country fails to record at least 80 percent
success.
</P>
<P>
However, the official did not give details about the
threatened withdrawal such as the deadline for the required 80
percent success. He neither disclosed the total number of UNDP
development program underway in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to Malam Ibrahim Huseini, UNDP program manager with
the Kaduna State Environmental Protection Authority, UNDP is
sponsoring or co-sponsoring five development programs in the
state, an industrial center in northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The programs involve mass literacy, statistics, women in
development, small-scale industries and environmental
development.
</P>
<P>
He said the involvement of the grassroots in UNDP program
formulation is a deliberate strategy aimed at ensuring the
success of the programs in the country's rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's 1996 Oil Export Income Probably To Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Higher price sustained by excess
demand in the world market may have boosted the oil income of Nigeria
and other oil exporting countries in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The oil export revenue of Nigeria and other 10 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries for 1996 is projected
to increase 23 percent to 162.68 billion U.s. dollars on a
year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
A market report reaching here today estimates Nigeria may have
grossed about 14.09 billion dollars from the export of over two
million barrels per day of oil and condensate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
About 13.18 billion dollars of Nigeria's oil revenues are expected
to have gone to the federal government, which is 3.46 billion dollars
more than the projected 9.72 billion dollars in last year's government
budget.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in September last year, Nigeria's Finance Minister Chief
Anthony Ani reported that a total of 5.03 billion dollars had been
earned from the oil sector by June, compared with a targeted sum of
3.94 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil accounts for more than 90 percent of Nigeria's total
exports. Recently there has been fear of a likely drop in the price of
oil in the international market this year as Iraq is to resume oil
exports.
</P>
<P>
To change the overdependence on oil export for foreign exchange,
the Nigerian government has over the recent years been encouraging the
promotion of non-oil export. But little effect has been produced so
far.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the government will continue to give a boost to the
development on non-oil sectors by new incentives expected to be
included in this year's budget, which is reported to come before the
public next week.

<HEADLINE> US Economists Predict Slower Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy will be
coasting at a slower growth rate this year than in 1996 while
heading into its seventh straight year of expansion, U.S.
economists predicted in a semiannual survey by The Wall Street
Journal.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported today that it is the consensus of 57
economists participating in the latest survey.
</P>
<P>
With an annual growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP)
at 2.9 percent in the first three quarters of 1996, the economists
are looking for a modest slowdown in GDP growth in 1997. They
predicted an annual rate of 2 percent in both the first and second
halves of this year.
</P>
<P>
A sharp change in short-term interest rates that would either
stymie or stimulate the economy is unlikely this year, they said.
The vast majority don't expect the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to
change rates when its policy-maker meets in February.
</P>
<P>
The key is low inflation, they said. The consumer price index
(CPI) was running at a year-to-year growth rate of 3.2 percent in
November. But the core inflation, minus volatile food and energy
components, was running at only a 2.6 percent rate in the month.
</P>
<P>
The economists are looking for an annual CPI growth rate of 2.9
percent in May as the unemployment rate slips a bit to 5.3 percent
from its recent 5.4 percent level.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most economists surveyed said that the heavy
personal debt of U.S. consumers will slow consumer spending, which
in turn will take some of the lift out of corporate profits and
capital spending.

</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators struggled today to arrange
a summit between Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and
PA President Yasser Arafat, but failed to iron out the final
details on reaching the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Ilan, Netanyahu's media adviser, blamed the PA for
applying the old tactics of footdragging in order to bring
more international pressure on Israel so as to squeeze out more
concessions.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear that the stalling is done by the Palestinian
Authority. The reasonable guess is that this situation of no
agreement favors them and it's detrimental to us that most of the
world tend to blame Israel for not doing something that was
supposed to do," he told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Palestinian side had put forward new demands
during the talks, Bar-Ilan said that Israel would not agree
to reopen issues that have already been closed.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the Palestinian side agreed, Israel would
sign the Hebron deal immediately, or even two months ago. He
warned that any delay would increase tension and threats to
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Following the Wednesday violence in Hebron in which
an Israeli soldier shot and wounded seven Palestinians, the
urgency for a speedy conclusion of Hebron deal increased.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan said earlier that he expected the Arafat-Netanyahu
summit to take place late today to initial the Hebron deal. For
the past week, an Arafat-Netanyahu summit was virtually expected
every day to sign the deal, but each time the hope faded away.
</P>
<P>
This could be repeated today. PA Cabinet Secretary Nabil
Abu Rudeineh today said that the Hebron talks would likely
extend for several more days to resolve the last issues
blocking the repeatedly-delayed agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's deputy Abu Mazen, who held an eight-hour meeting with
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai overnight Wednesday,
revealed that there was still one issue remained to be settled
before signing the deal, that is, the timetable for further
Israeli redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai briefed Netanyahu today on his meeting with Mazen and
 held several discussions with U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross in
a bid to find out ways of clearing the last obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to meet with Arafat late this evening in an effort to
finalize the long-delayed Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Arafat held a meeting with European Union
peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos to discuss the current
situation of Hebron talks. Asked if he would meet Netanyahu
today, Arafat replied: "Who knows?"

Athens, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Greek cargo ship the Dystos,
which capsized last Saturday off the Aegean island of Evia, sank
today to a depth of 32 meters, harbor officials said.

<HEADLINE> US Major Auto Makers Forecast Sales for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Major auto makers in the United
States have forecast that the year 1997 will turn out much like
last year when auto sales were on a strong and stable trend.
</P>
<P>
Alex Trotman, chairman, chief executive and president of the
Ford Motor Company, predicted that for 1997 overall industry sales
will reach 15 million to 15.5 million passenger cars, pickup
trucks, sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and heavier trucks.
</P>
<P>
The General Motor Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation
echoed his forecast which was based on an assumption that
unemployment and inflation would remain low and the American
economy would continue to produce jobs at a brisk pace.
</P>
<P>
But auto executives and economists for the Big Three automakers
have expressed concern about whether auto sales will stay strong,
for, according to a New York Times report today, the auto market
is quite sensitive to the performance of the overall economy. "For
decades, few industries have been as cyclical as the automobile
business, with sales soaring in good times and plunging so deeply
in bad times that very few survival of some auto makers has been
threatened," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Economists and executives said the threat of economic
turbulence caused by unpredictable events remain. "I expect there
will be, in the next five years, a downturn," Trotman said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Police: Friedman Has Accomplice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police said today
that Noam Friedman, the soldier who opened fire on crowded
Palestinians in the center of Hebron Wednesday, had an
accomplice.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Television report this evening, Yuval
Jibri, a 21-year-old soldier who serves in the same army
unit with Friedman, "is suspected collusion and failure to
prevent a crime."
</P>
<P>
Police today asked Petach Tikvah Magistrate's Court near Tel
Aviv, where the hearing on the shooting incident took place, to
extend the custody of both soldiers for 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Only Friedman appeared in the court today, when he told
the court that he wanted to show that Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu "does not represent the people."
</P>
<P>
He said that he felt compelled to act to prevent the handover
of Hebron, which has been the subject of intensive talks between
Israel and the Palestinians for the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Friedman stated that he regretted over the fact that he only
wounded Arabs and did not kill them, saying he acted alone and
his actions were also to avenge Israelis killed by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
At least seven Palestinians were wounded by bullets fired by
Friedman through his M-16 rifle, before three other soldiers
overpowered him.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli army and Police officials, Friedman had
nothing in his personal file restricting his carrying of a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio reported this morning that a psychologist from
the city of Ma'aleh Adumim where Friedman lived, recommended
that he not be accepted for military service due to his
psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three of the seven the Palestinians wounded during
shooting attack still remain in hospital today, and doctors
said they are expected to be released within a week.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Islamic Jihad Movement today
distributed a leaflet vowing revenge for the attack, stressing
"no crime of the enemy against our innocent people will pass
without a punishment."
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reports said that the militant wing of Hamas,
or the Islamic Resistance Movement, also vowed to take revenge for
the shooting.

<P>
Johannesburg, January 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 people have
been killed in traffic accidents throughout South Africa since the
traditional holiday season began on December 3 last year, the
National Traffici Information Center (NTIC) announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A NTIC report said head-on collisions, collisions with
pedestrians and vehicles overturning continue to be the main causes
of fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the death toll in provinces of Eastern Cape and
Western Cape are well above the average caused by collisions while
pedestrian fatalities in Gauteng Province are much higher than the
national average, the report said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is administratively divided into nine provinces. In
addition to violences and diseases, traffic accidents have been said
to be one of the major killers to South Africans.
</P>
<P>
NTIC officials and informed sources said a large number of traffic
policemen have been mobilized to patrol on major streets and
freeways to decrease traffic toll.
</P>
<P>
However, despite traffic authorities' sustained efforts, the
phenomina of overspeed driving and drunk-driving, the major causes of
traffic accidents, are still quite popular in the country. enditem

<HEADLINE> Russia Proposes Urgent UN Meeting on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia has proposed an urgent
meeting of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council and a representative of the European Union (EU) to draft
a joint plan of action on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was revealed today by Russia's new ambassador to
Cyprus, Georgi Muratov, during a ceremony of presenting his
credentials to President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
"We propose that the big five and an EU representative meet as
soon as possible for a detailed discussion of the Cyprus problem
and the preparation for a joint plan of action for a Cyprus
solution," the new ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Russia would also like to see a "special
contact group for Cyprus" to be set up to facilitate the task of
the U.N. secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Muratov supported President Clerides' proposal for the
demilitarization of Cyprus, which he described as "an important
step towards a speedy and peaceful solution of the Cyprus
problem, the consolidation of peace and security in the eastern
Mediterranean".
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions raised by reporters after the ceremony
at the Presidential Palace, Muratov indicated that Russia does
not object to a proposed sale of surface-to-air missiles S-300
to Cyprus because these are of a "purely defensive nature."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has purchased in the past few years tanks and armored
vehicles from Russia and now is negotiating a deal with Russians
to buy anti-aircraft missile system S-300.
</P>
<P>
The deal was opposed by Turkey which threatened that it will
not remain silent in the face of the Greek Cypriot side's
missile purchases from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Muratov also said he would work toward a visit to Cyprus by
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in the first half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the credentials, President Clerides welcomed any
initiative on Cyprus and reaffirmed his intention and readiness
to cooperate for a just, viable and workable solution which
would safeguard human rights of all citizens of the island and
consolidate peace and security in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
and took control of 37 percent of the island following a
short-lived coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> 115 PKK Rebels Killed in Turkey's Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and fifteen rebels
of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in military
operations both in northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey,
according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Turkish security forces had wiped out 101
PKK militants after the country's air and ground forces attacked
the camps of the rebel group in the Sinath region, over 10
kilometers deep into northern Iraq in their three-day successive
cross-border military operations.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the security forces had also killed 14
PKK members in the anti-PKK maneuvers in Nusaybin town in Mardin
province bordering Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces staged the cross-border operations
Monday night in a bid to destroy the PKK military bases in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security men continuously bombarded four PKK camps
in the Sinath region and about 5,000 government troops and
village guards attacked the PKK militants who tried to flee from
northern Iraq under the cover of Cobra helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Turkish security forces have crossed into northern Iraq for
several times in a bid to wipe out the PKK guerrillas who
launched cross-border raids against Turkish military and civilian
targets.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government, which has lost control over northern
Iraq, an area held by Kurds backed by allied-forces, has made
protests against the Turkish operations before, accusing Turkey
of violation of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Turkish government troops killed 13,255 rebels,
wounded 244 and captured about 2,000, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
Over 21,000 people including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops have been killed in conflicts since August
1984 when the outlawed group started separatist activities for
self-rule in southeastern Turkey.

Cup Hong Kong '97, the opening leg of this year's eight-leg World
Cup short course swimming series.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 13-swimmer team are teenagers, among whom are such
Olympians as female swimmers Nian Yun, 14, and Chen Yan, 17.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the main purpose of his team here is to have
the younger ones tested for getting mature.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that it's hard for some of the national team's
veteran members to hang on till the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We have to get ourselves ready as early as possible for the
Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang revealed that all the Chinese swimmers participating in
the Hong Kong meet will return to Beijing to join other members of
the national team for the second leg of the World Cup series.
</P>
<P>
And some of the national team's elite members are to be sent to
the six European stops of the series in such cities as Espoo of
Finland, Malmo of Sweden and Paris.
</P>
<P>
As for the national swimming team, the Eight National Games
scheduled for October in Shanghai is the number one event on the
year's calendar. "We have to arrange our training and
competitions with priority left on the Games," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also said that some of the current team here would be
part of an elite task force which sets its sight on Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the performance by a relatively young team at last
summer's Olympic Games in Atlanta, Zhang said that the swimmers
did what they could, although short of somewhat too high an
expectation from home.
</P>
<P>
With only three of the 21 Olympic swimmers from the last
Olympics, Zhang said it was almost impossible for them to achieve
what Chinese swimmers had at Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
The current young swimmers are really doing well, both in
training and competitions so far, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"But they need to go through more hardship and major test,
especially through international competitions," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"That's the only way to get mature," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Hong Kong meet starts on Saturday. A record-setting
entry of 28 teams is to be fielded, according to the organizers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Continue Bombardment in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli occupation forces
continued today bombardment at suspected guerrilla targets in a
mountain area opposite the Israeli self-proclaimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon, but no casualties were reported by
security sources in the area.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment was accompanied by reconnaissance flights of
Israeli warplanes over the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, the Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces concentrated today's bombardment, which
lasted from the morning to the evening, at Iglim Al-Toffah, a
ridge often used by guerrillas of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, as a springboard to launch attacks at Israel's
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
At 9:10 a.m. (07:10 GMT), the Israeli troops in their
positions on hills overlooking the south Lebanese village of
Baraashit swept vicinities of the village with heavy machinegun
fire.
</P>
<P>
Twenty minutes later, Israeli artillery fired its first
volley of smoking bombs at Jebal Al-Rafih in Iglim Al-Toffah,
some 60 kilometers southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment was extended to the villages of Sejoud and
Rihan, then to Wadi Slouqi, Zibgin, Wadi Marimin and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the Shiite
fundamentalist Hezbollah, announced that its fighters attacked
the Israeli outpost of Balat at 12:30 a.m. (10:30 GMT) with
anti-tank rockets and machineguns.
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that another squad of its fighters
detonated a mine on the Deir Siryan road in the middle sector of
south Lebanon, targeting a foot patrol of the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia, killing and wounding several
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the SLA militia confirmed that one militiaman was
killed and two others were wounded in the bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance also said that its guerrillas attacked
the Israeli position of Dabsheh with "suitable weapons" and
caused casualties to the enemy.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Moslem guerrillas and bombardments by
Israeli forces constitute a daily scene in south Lebanon, where
the Jewish state established the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer
zone in 1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Hezbollah said today that it
carried out 37 military operations against Israeli occupation
forces and their client militia in south Lebanon in December
1996.
</P>
<P>
It said that three Israeli soldiers were killed and six
others were wounded, including Brigadier General Eli Amitai,
Israel's chief liaison officer and commander of the 1,000 troops
garrisoned in south Lebanon, who was slightly injured twice by
blasts of roadside bombs.
</P>
<P>
One SLA militiaman was shot dead and two others were injured
by Israeli forces when the three were attempting to defect from
their post of Hola, the Iranian-backed Moslem group said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah issued today its statistics on Israeli casualties
in clashes with Lebanese guerrillas in 1996, saying that 45
Israelis were killed and 211 others were wounded, including one
Jewish settler killed and 92 others injured by Katyusha rockets
fired into northern Israel in the first months of this year.
</P>
<P>
It added that its fighters carried out 765 military operations
in the whole year, during which 34 SLA militiamen were also
killed and 72 others wounded, with the Islamic Resistance
suffering a loss of 47 lives.
</P>
<P>
Israel admitted that 28 Israeli soldiers were killed and 102
others were wounded in guerrilla operations against its forces,
and two soldiers died and two others injured in different
incidents in the occupied enclave in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It also confirmed that 20 SLA militiamen were killed and 58
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,500 SLA militiamen collaborating with the Jewish
state are patrolling the Israeli self-styled "security zone" in
south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Tunisia Strives to Attract Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- With the advent of the new year,
Tunisia will establish contacts with 500 external establishments
to attract foreign investments, sources at the Tunisian Ministry
of International Cooperation and Investment said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that among the foreign establishments 300
are in Europe and 200 non-European ones.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, attention will be paid to the markets of three Asian
states, namely, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia, as well as Arab
markets particularly in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that apart from these measures,
Tunisia will endeavor to mobilize all potentials to invite the
largest possible amount of foreign investments in 1997.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, an estimated 470,000 Tunisian dinars (about
470,000 U.S. dollars) has been earmarked for the organization of
symposiums, regional and international economic seminars, video
and tape-making and publications in several languages, and
information discs, so as to make foreign investors acquainted
with the investment climate and opportunities in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the total foreign financial resources,
which have flown into Tunisia during the 1992-1996 plan period,
have reached about 5,064 million dinars (about 5,064 million
dollars), of which 1,194 million dinars (about 1,194 million
dollars) came in 1996.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Dialogue to Settle Sudan-Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today expressed
deep concern about the recent developments in eastern Sudan, a day
after Sudan accused Eritrea of downing its chopper and attacking
its gunship.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based AL, in a statement issued today, called for
handling the issue through dialogue and on the basis of good
neighborliness and non-interference with the internal affairs of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudan had lodged a note with the AL's General Secretariat on
the dangers confronting eastern Sudan due to foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
Sudan said Wednesday that the missile that hit a Sudanese
helicopter gunship had been fired from an Eritrean army camp near
the Sudanese-Eritrean borders.
</P>
<P>
It also accused Eritrea of shooting down a Sudanese military
plane and killing all its passengers.
</P>
<P>
Sudan charged that that Eritrea was still staging a flagrant
attack, vowing to use all means to defend itself.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea is the base of Sudanese opposition movement against
the Sudanese government led by President Omar el-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
In a speech today on the occasion of the 41st anniversary of
Sudan's independence, Bashir called on the opposition to
relinquish armed hostilities and join the peace process launched
eight months ago with the signing to the Political Charter for
Peace.
</P>
<P>
He, however, made no allusion to either reported attacks by
Eritrea on Sudanese territory or to the escape of Sadek al-Mahdi,
leader of the opposition Ummah party, to join the opposition
groups abroad.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today held talks with Mahdi, who arrived here Friday for a 10-day
visit on the first leg of his three-month Arab and European tour.
</P>
<P>
It is the second meeting between Mubarak and a Sudanese
opposition leader within four days. The Egyptian president Monday
met with Mohamed Othman al-Merghani, leader of the Sudanese
Democratic Alliance, which is the gathering of Sudanese opposition
parties working in exile.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mahdi slipped out of Khartoum to Eritrea, the
base of Sudanese opposition movement against the Sudanese
government led by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who ousted
Mahdi in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: S'pore's Ruling PAP Wins All But Two Seats in General Election (1)  by Zeng Hu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- After declaring its victory in
the hotly-contested seats of the Cheng San Group Representation
Constituency (GRC) Friday morning, Singapore's ruling People's
Action Party finally won all but two seats in the 83-member
parliament in this general election.
</P>
<P>
In the Cheng San GRC, the five-member PAP team, led by
Education Minister Lee Yock Suan, secured 53,553 votes, or 54.8
percent of the total votes cast in the ward. They defeated the
Workers' Party team, headed by its secretary-general J.B.
Jeyaretnam, by a big margin of 9,421 votes.
</P>
<P>
All in all, the PAP has won about 65 percent of the votes in
the contested constituencies, up by about four percentage points
from the 61 percent supportive rate of the last general election
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing shortly after the final result was
announced, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said he was satisfied with
the outcome of the election, as voters had rejected the Workers'
Party and Tang Liang Hong, a Workers' Party candidate in the Cheng
San GRC who was accused by the PAP leaders as a Chauvinist.
</P>
<P>
The results of the election demonstrated that the voters had
shown their solid support for a multi-racial society with English
as a common working language, Goh said.
</P>
<P>
The PAP only lost two seats in two single-member constituencies
of Potong Pasir and Hougang, which have been the opposition
strongholds since 1991 election.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore People's Party candidate Chiam See Tong was
returned to parliament in the Potong Pasir ward, while Low Thia
Khiang of the Workers' Party retained his seat for the Hougang
constituency.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, the PAP recovered two seats it lost
to the opposition Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) in the 1991
general election. Those were the Bukit Gombak and Nee Soon Central
wards.
</P>
<P>
In the battle for the six GRCs, the PAP won a grand slam,
winning all the GRCs, including the hotly-fought Cheng San GRC.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Records Increased Maize Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Maize production in Ghana has
doubled and prices risen by about 60 percent in the past ten
years.
</P>
<P>
The progress is attributed to the adoption of new planting
techniques by farmers in the west African country, according to
the latest edition of "Spore", a magazine on information for
agricultural development in African and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
Ghana was the first country to receive the help from the
Sasakawa-Global 2,000, an internationally sponsored agricultural
program, followed by Tanzania, Benin, Togo, Nigeria, Ethiopia and
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Uganda, Eritrea, Guinea, Mali and Burkina Faso also
joined in the program.
</P>
<P>
Assisted by the program, Ghanaian farmers have improved their
planting densities and storage facilities, while carrying out
more timely cultivations.
</P>
<P>
"If they had access to fertilizers, their yield could have
been more," the report quoted Chris Dowswell, co-ordinator of the
program, as saying.
</P>
<P>
To improve soil fertility and offset the lack of fertilizers,
the program is developing organic methords such as the use of
green crops.

<TEXT>
<P>
Analyzing the reason behind the PAP victory this time, Goh said
it was mainly because of the "concrete plans we have".
</P>
<P>
As many as 94.61 percent of the 765,332 voters, who were
supposed to vote Thursday, cast their ballots, as voting was
compulsory and secret in Singapore, a tiny island country with a
total of 1,881,011 eligible voters in the election this time.
</P>
<P>
The other 1,115,679 voters did not vote because their
constituencies were already won by the PAP candidates in
walkovers, as the opposition camp did not field any candidates in
those wards.
</P>
<P>
The PAP was thus returned to power on the nomination day on
December 23, 1996, with a total of 47 seats unopposed. The PAP
fielded 83 candidates, the same number as the parliament seats,
while the five opposition parties altogether put up 38 candidates.
There was also one independent candidate, Chia Shi Teck, who lost
his bid in the Chua Chu Kang constituency.
</P>
<P>
Describing the election as "a watershed" event, Goh said the
outcome showed that the Singapore people endorsed what his party
had done in the past five years, and endorsed the party's
Singapore 21 program, a blueprint for Singapore's development in
the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The results also showed the voters' support for the PAP
approach on concentrating on good government, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said earlier that he would come up with his
new cabinet line-up two weeks after the election.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Capital to Build 160 Primary Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 160 primary schools
will be constructed in Dar es Salaam in three years to ease
congestion in the city schools, City Commission Chairman Carles
Keenja said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference to mark the six months since the
commission assumed office, Keenja said the construction will
double the number of primary schools from the present 163.
</P>
<P>
Because of fewer schools in the capital, 200 to 300 pupils
share a classroom in some schools against a national average of
45 pupils each classroom, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city commissioner said that over 1.4 billion Tanzania
Shillings (about 2.3 million U. S. Dollars) will be spent to
construct 12 new primary schools in 1997.
</P>
<P>
On secondary schools, Keenja said each zone in the city will
construct four such schools.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city commissioner urged city residents,
religious organizations, civic organizations and interested
individuals to contribute to improve the quality of education in
primary and secondary schools.

<HEADLINE> US Manufacturing Economy Expands in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Association
of Purchasing Management (NAPM) said today that economic activity
in U.S. manufacturing sector grew faster than expected in last
December.
</P>
<P>
The NAPM index, a much-watched composite index in the U.S.,
rose by 1.3 percentage points to 54 percent in December from an
unrevised 52.7 percent reading in last November.
</P>
<P>
Most U.S. economists had expected the index to slow to 51.5
percent for the month.
</P>
<P>
The NAPM index is one of the major barometers of the U.S.
economic health during any given month. It is a composite index
based on seasonally adjusted indexes for new orders, production,
vendor deliveries, inventories and employment, with varying
weights applied.
</P>
<P>
A reading above 50 percent generally indicates the U.S.
manufacturing economy is expanding, while a reading below 50
percent suggests the economy is contracting.
</P>
<P>
The rising of the index in December was the eighth time in the
past nine months that the index has indicated U.S. manufacturing
growing with a reading above 50 percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Egyptian Cabinet's First Year Tastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's current cabinet led by
Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri could well celebrate the first year
in office over its initial achievement to make the country one of
the "tigers in the Mideast."
</P>
<P>
Luring investments, stepping up privatization and combating
corruption aptly topped the agenda of the 32-man cabinet when it
was elected on January 4, 1996 to replace the nine-year-old
administration of Prime Minister Atef Sidki and "lead the nation
into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri recruited nine newcomers to deal with finance, economy
and planning in a bid to reverse the much-criticized slow
implementation of reform, started in May 1990.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the take-over by the "economic group" showed that
economic reform would top the new cabinet's priorities.
</P>
<P>
In his first policy statement, Ganzouri, an architect of the
country's economic reform program, announced that he would focus
on upgrading the living standards of citizens. He promised not to
introduce new taxes or fees or additional burdens.
</P>
<P>
A year later, Egypt reduced the budget deficit by 0.4
percentage point to less than one percent, according to sources
from the Central Bank of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to significant increase of tourism revenues, the
monetary reserves have more than doubled the figure of the
previous year, registering 1.9 billion U.S. dollars by the end of
November.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, with an outstanding ability in foreign trade payment,
has been promoted to the top brackets by international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
In line with a stable exchange rate, the economy grew by 5
percent in the 1995-96 fiscal year (ending on June 30), compared
with the 4.8 percent average annual economic growth
during 1990-95.
</P>
<P>
As a commendation to Egypt's economic reform, the International
Monetary Fund agreed on October 11 to write off Egypt's 4.2
billion dollars foreign debts under a debt restructuring plan in
1991. The final tranche of the debt accord has been pending since
Egypt and the IMF fell out in 1994, mainly over the government's
exchange rate policy.
</P>
<P>
As much as a seal of international approval, the debt waiver
also heralded in the third phase of the reform program.
</P>
<P>
Just ten months in office, the cabinet has done enough to
convince international investors that Egypt is an attractive
destination in which to place their funds.
</P>
<P>
Foreign portfolio investment has gone up from virtually zero to
380 million dollars from April to September of the year and there
are clear signs of direct investment in new projects.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, applications for 4,996 projects were
approved with a total investment of 7 billion dollars, nearly 9
times the 1994-95 figure of 782.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, Egypt also won a string of major
investment deals worth 10 billion dollars at the Cairo Economic
Conference held on November 12-14. Thus Egypt succeeded in
putting the country on international investors' map.
</P>
<P>
Under the Egyptian privatization program, a string of
regulations were introduced to protect the rights of the state
while allowing people to buy shares of state-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
The private sector, which is allowed to invest in services,
reportedly contributes more than 80 percent of the investment.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to reverse the perennial trade imbalance, the
cabinet has put up various incentives and facilities to encourage
export, including the treatment of export-oriented output on a par
with the production of the free zones, the elimination of all fees
on export inspection and the reduction of freight cost at ports.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to clean the government's image, Ganzouri vowed there
would be no cover-up for corruption, nor protection for any
official who tampers with state funds.
</P>
<P>
A series of crackdowns on economic crimes followed, crowned by
the arrest of Abdel-Wahab Habbaq, chairman of the Holding Company
for Engineering Industries, who allegedly gained as much as 30
million dollars in illicit commissions which he safely deposited
in foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, Ganzouri said the investment target is 60
billion pounds (18 billion dollars) in 1996-97, the first year of
the fourth five-year plan. He also predicated an economic growth
of 6.2 percent and annual creation of 400,000 jobs in the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
To give privatization a push, the cabinet decided last
February to sell off 61 companies and 36 hotels owned by the
public sector by the end of June 1998, generating 4 billion to 5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
A new canal project, the so-called "project of the 21 century,"
will be launched soon in the country. By cultivating at least
500,000 feddans (210,000 hectares) in the Western Desert, the
project will increase the arable land by 16 percent in its first
stage and effectively change the country's demographic map.

<HEADLINE> US Hotel Industry Gains Record Profits in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The hotel industry in the
United States gained record profits in 1996, the fourth
consecutive year-- a long stretch for a business known for severe
boom-and-bust cycles, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The industry fetched 11.5 billion U.S. dollars last year, a far
cry from the last recession, when the industry, reeling from the
effects of a huge building spree, lost 5.7 billion U.S. dollars in
1991 alone.
</P>
<P>
Now hotels look for 5th year of growing profitability. The
outlook for 1997 is favorable. Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, the accounting
and consulting firm, forecasts a record 11.9 billion U.S. dollars
in industry profits. The firm predicts a slightly decrease in
occupancy, down from last year's estimated rate of 66 per cent,
which is about average for the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
However, economists noted that the hotel industry, despite
attempts to manage its assets more efficiently, cannot shake off
the pattern of overbuilding and retrenchment that makes it
particularly vulnerable to to swings in business activities.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 25 years, according to a report issued last year
by Salomon Brothers Company, the hotel industry has been basically
sticking to the pattern like this: During good times, high demand
brings money pouring into the industry, which recycles it to
finance new hotel rooms. The good times end when recession dries
up demand or overbuilding runs ahead of growth and the resulting
glut strangles profitability.
</P>
<P>
In a fresh attempt to shake off the pattern, the industry has
adopted a new strategy whose emphasis is on efficiency and holding
down labor costs. Most new hotels are far smaller, offer a
continental breakfast or a small food court in place of a
restaurant, and require less labor than older hotels.

<HEADLINE> Less Passengers Pass Geneva Airport in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva Airport saw less
passengers in 1996 despite a 2.2 percent increase of aircraft
landings and takeoffs in the same year compared with those in
1995, according to provisional results released today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a total of 6,186,714 persons passed the Geneva
international airport, 1.3 percent less than the figure of
6,266,911 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the decline was caused by a decision
taken by Swissair, Switzerland's leading airlines, to conduct
major long distance flights to the country's largest city of
Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Telecom '95, a world exposition held in Geneva in
early October in 1995, attracted an extra number of more than
100,000 people to the city that year.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Condemns Hebron Shooting Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League today condemned a
shooting committed by an Israeli soldier as "heinous crime"
against unarmed Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron and
urged better security for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The League's General Secretariat warned that such a criminal
act is likely to increase tension and violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the incident, the Cairo-based league urged
Israel to honor the agreements it signed with the Palestinians and
asked the international community to force Israel to implement
them.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the incident to the February 25 al-Ibrahimi Mosque
massacre in Hebron in 1995, the statement said it followed "with
deep anger and condemnation" the criminal incident which occurred
in Hebron on the morning of the first day of the new year.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, an Israeli soldier opened fire at Palestinians in a
crowded marketplace there, killing and wounding a number of them.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the incident demonstrates how fragile the
security situation is in Hebron and the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
It demanded the creation of an international mechanism to
provide protection for Arabs in occupied Arab territories against
terrorist attacks by Israeli settlers. It also called for
disarming the Israeli settlers in the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
The General Secretariat urged the U.S. and Russia, the two
sponsors of the peace process, and the European Union to shoulder
their responsibilities for bolstering the peace process and making
Israel honor its peace commitments.
</P>
<P>
Noam Friedman, an Israeli soldier, opened fire on crowded
Palestinians in the center of Hebron Wednesday, wounding at least
seven Palestinians, before three other soldiers overpowered him.
</P>
<P>
During the hearing on the shooting incident today, Friedman
told the court that he felt compelled to act to prevent the
handover of Hebron, which has been the subject of intensive talks
between Israel and the Palestinians for the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Friedman stated that he regretted over the fact that he only
wounded Arabs and did not kill them, saying he acted alone and
his actions were also to avenge Israelis killed by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians are trying to clinch a deal to
implement the much-delayed Israeli troop withdrawal from Hebron
where 450 Jewish settlers live among 200,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The redeployment was put off after a wave of suicide bombings
in Israel in February and March. It was further delayed due to Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's demand for better protection for
Jewish settlers.

<HEADLINE> First Futures Exchange Moves into Pudong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Cereals and Oil
Exchange has become the first futures exchange to move from the
old part of Shanghai into the Pudong New Area, an emerging
financial district across the Huangpu River.
</P>
<P>
"Futures market is bound to come into its own in Pudong in the
city government's strategy of moving all of its production factor
markets into the area, " said the city's deputy mayor, Chen
Liangyu.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Cereals and Oil Exchange has had a total turnover
of 845.4 billion yuan in its tradings of rice, soybean and wheat
since it was set up three years ago, and more than 370 million
tons of cereals and edible oil have changed hands during the
period.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicts that an increasing number of grain growers and
traders will be drawn to the futures trading in grain products,
given the necessity for grain to become a commodity with the good
harvests for the past several years.

track laying.
</P>
<P>
The subway, which will be heavily-equipped with foreign-made
facilities, got its first batch of Germany imports in last August,
followed by British and Japanese equipment. These will ensure the
subway to meet international advanced standards of the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that in April the 20 German-made trains will
arrive in Guangzhou.

BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Tigers came from a
halftime deficit to beat Beijing Lions 116-99 Friday, sharing the
top place with 14 wins and four losses at the Chinese Men's
Basketball Professional League.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, led by American David Vanterpool's 33 points and
seven rebounds, trailed by three points at 52-55 in the first half
and jumped to lead with a 8-0 run in the beginning of the third
period.
</P>
<P>
The Lions, which played without their 2.14-meter starting
center Maurie Barnett, whose brother was shot dead in America on
New Year's Eve, closed the score to 72-75 with Sun Fengwu's layup
with five minutes to go in the third period.
</P>
<P>
"We lost two players on the court tonight, Barnett and Cai
Shenghe. And we were outrebounded 33-45 by our opponents. Our
offensive was also bad," said Sun Fengwu, who scored 25 points to
lead the Lions.
</P>
<P>
Barnett, who always dominated the middle in the league, has
gone to the United States and will be back on January 12th, said
the Lions' American coach Joe Weakley.
</P>
<P>
"They looked a little bit tired," said Li Xuefeng, coach of
Jilin, whose American coach Don Sellers was sacked last week for
his "repeated flagrant violations of CNBA rules" by the Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
"If Barnett were in the action tonight, it would have been
another result. It would be hard to say who were winners," Li
Xuefeng added.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun added 30 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for Jilin.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The residents of Shanghai now
have something else to collect -- magnetic cards of various kinds,
which they are holding on to instead of putting them to practical
use.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China's largest city has issued many types of
magnetic cards: for phones, taxis, ferries, subways, and cinemas,
which have in turn caught the attention of local stamp collectors,
due to the simple fact that the cards are increasing in value much
faster than stamps are.
</P>
<P>
The collecting craze is unfortunately ignoring the original
purpose of the cards, which was to speed up payment or movement of
traffic.
</P>
<P>
Local experts advise collectors not to forget the practical
purpose of the cards, and suggest that the issuers learn from the
manufacturers of stamps how to separate the practical use cards
from those for collection.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Army, U.S. Agency to Renovate Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian army will
cooperate with a U.S. agency to rebuild Highway 10, a major road
linking the provincial capital of Battambang with Pailin, a former
Khmer Rouge stronghold which came under government control last
August, a senior army official said today.
</P>
<P>
Highway 10 has been seriously damaged by logging trucks
transporting logs from the thick forests in the area.
</P>
<P>
The army will first clear mines along a 20-kilometer section of
the highway near Pailin, in preparation for the project supported
by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),
Brigadier General Lay Bun Song, Director of the Foreign Relations
Department of the Defense Ministry, said.
</P>
<P>
Mine-clearance operations will start soon as other sections of
the road have been largely cleared of mines.
</P>
<P>
The army's Engineering Department will provide labor and
machinery for the project which will begin as soon as the mine
clearing is finished, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
He did not say how much money USAID planned to put into the
project, saying the Defense Ministry has sent a draft plan to the
U.S. embassy in Phnom Penh and is waiting for a reply.
</P>
<P>
General Ly Seng Hong, Deputy Chief of Staff in charge of
military development, confirmed today that mine-clearing troops
were deployed in the relevant areas two weeks ago and work should
be finished by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Raksmei Kampuchea today quoted General Kwan

<HEADLINE> France Condemns Bomb Attack on Bus in Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- France today condemned the bomb
attack Tuesday on a passenger bus in the Syrian capital of
Damascus, in which a dozen people were reportedly killed.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt described
the attack as "cowardly" and said that one should "rapidly get
right to the bottom" of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the attack showed that all countries in the
world are "exposed to the scourge of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
The French government learned with shock about the cowardly
attack committed on December 31, and has sent its condolences to
the Syrian government, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
France "condemns any act of violence no matter what its origin
is or who its producers are. This act confirms that a same
solidarity should unite all the people in the fight against blind
violence and for the search of peace," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Syria has accused the Israeli intelligence service Mossad of
having masterminded the attack. Israel denied the charge as "a big
lie."
</P>
<P>
A bombing attack on a Paris underground train on December 3,
1996, killed four people and wounded about 90.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Fighters Bomb PKK Camps in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish F-4 fighters bombarded
this morning the camps of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) based in northern Iraq, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the fighters, which took off from the air
base in Diyarbakir, center of southeastern Turkey, bombarded and
destroyed many camps in the Sinath region where PKK military
bases are established inside northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Turkish security forces staged
stronger air raids against the PKK militants who tried to flee
from Sindi Throat in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A total of 101 PKK rebels have been killed in Turkey's
cross-border operations in northern Iraq for the past four days,
the agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish village guards also participated in the cross-border
operations launched by the Turkish government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi official newspaper al-Thawra, organ of the ruling Baath
party, Thursday condemned Turkey for sending troops into northern
Iraq in pursuit of the PKK militants, saying: "Such an operation
is rejected."
</P>
<P>
The PKK uses bases in northern Iraq outside Baghdad's control
as part of its guerrilla war for self-rule in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government troops have crossed into northern Iraq
several times in large numbers in a bid to wipe out the PKK
rebels, who intermittently launch cross-border attacks against
Turkish military and civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has made protests against the Turkish
cross-border operations before and accused Turkey of violating
its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Over 21,000 people including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops have been killed in conflicts since August
1984 when the illegal organization started the guerrilla
war.

<HEADLINE> Irish Economy Set to Grow 5 Pct in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Ireland's
economic boom is set to continue this year with real GNP growth of
5 percent, according to a report of Ireland's independent economic
institute.
</P>
<P>
The Quarterly Economic Review from the Economic and Social
Research Institute estimated that real GNP growth in 1996 was
around 5.75 percent, after growth in excess of 7 percent for 1995
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The review predicted that a deceleration of growth in demestic
demand in 1997 will be offset by rapid expansion in export
volumes.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which was running at 1.6 percent in 1996, should
stay under control at around 2 percent in 1997, said the review.
</P>
<P>
It also said that although no estimate of economic progress can
be definitive, "the trends in the various major elements fit
together in a generally coherent manner."
</P>
<P>
Economic experts say that Ireland's healthy economic
performance is attributed to, among other matters, direct foreign
investment in fast-growing industries and the availability of a
qualified labor force.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The National Committee of the

<HEADLINE> China Makes Quality Improvement Outline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's
highest governing body, has developed a "Quality Improvement
Outline" to promote quality in industrial products, engineering
projects, and services in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
It said that at present, product quality, and that of projects
and services is not keeping pace with improvements in people's
standard of living and social development, and is lagging far
behind respective sectors in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
It also said that a number of internationally-competitive
industries and giant corporations need to be developed by the year
2000, and by the year 2010 the overall quality of leading
industries should be able to compete in the international economy.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, more than 75 percent of major industrial products are
expected to comply with advanced international standards and, by
2010 the figure will go up to 85 percent, and after-sale service
will improved accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The outline provided specific goals for raw materials, key
machinery and electronic parts, large-scale equipment, and
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
In regard to engineering projects, 90 percent will have to
qualify in first-round quality checks by the year 2000, and by
2010, that rate will have to go up to 96.
</P>
<P>
To improve service, the outline noted, the public will need a
better understanding of existing laws and regulations on improving
quality, and local governments and departments should improve
management and supervision, as well as law-enforcement in the area
of quality control.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the country will need enact more laws and
regulations to cover major trades, while urging various businesses
and institutions to improve their quality through more scientific
management techniques, technical improvements, and a system of
awards, as well as in other ways, the outline said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches First Air Strike on Hezbollah Bases in 1997 (I) (by Shao Jie) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out
this morning their first air strike on the guerrilla
bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in
south Lebanon, the first such assault in 1997.
</P>
<P>
No words on casualties were given by security sources, however.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes fired at least 10 air-to-surface
missiles at targets in Iglim Al-Toffah, a mountain area often
used by Moslem guerrillas of the Shiite Hezbollah as a
springboard to launch attacks against Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
In the first bombing at 9:20 a.m. (07:20 GMT) and
the second five minutes later, Israeli warplanes fired eight
missiles at the hills of Sojoud, Rihan and Loweizeh.
</P>
<P>
The air raids followed intensive fire by Israeli artillery
at Jabel Al-Rafih and vicinities of the villages of Sojoud
and Rihan, which started at 7:00 a.m. (05:00 GMT) and lasted for
two hours and a half.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops in the positions located in the middle sector of
the so-called "security zone" resumed the bombardments at 10:00
a.m. (08:00 GMT) targeting Iglim Al-Toffah, some 60 kilometers
southeast of Beirut, according to the security sources.
</P>
<P>
The shellings, with 120-mm and 150-mm mortars, were
concentrated on Jabel Al-Rafih, Tallat Mlita and Jabel Al-Safik.
</P>
<P>
At 11:05 a.m. (09:05 GMT), Israeli helicopters started
hovering over Jabel Al-Rafih and Tallat Mlita. And 25 minutes
later, the helicopters fired two missiles at the height of
Sojoud.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing 30 minutes, Israeli warplanes also launched
three successive air raids in Iglim Al-Toffah and fired
machineguns at suspected targets, security sources in the
area reported.
</P>
<P>
From earlier this morning and until noon, Israeli
warplanes carried out frequent reconnaissance flights over a
wide range between the south Lebanese coast town of Naqoura
to Iglim Al-Toffah to the east.
</P>
<P>
The security sources estimated that about 18 Israeli
helicopters carried out the air strike and reconnaissance missions
 over south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah,
announced that in retaliation for the Israeli aggressions, its
fighters launched counterattacks this morning on the Israeli
positions at Sojoud and Bir Kalab.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Gives First Death Penalties for 1994 Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A male nurse and a former official
were condemned to death today by a Rwandan court for participating
in the 1994 ethnic genocide against the minority Tutsis and
moderate Hutus, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The trial, the first of its kind by a court of Rwanda
concerning the massacres of at least 500,000 people, was held
on December 27, 1996. Some 90,000 Hutus in jail awaiting trial
for their parts in the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The defendants, Deogratias Bizimana and Egide Gatanazi did not
have defense attorneys and pleaded not guilty in a trial which
lasted only a few hours in a court in Kibungo, southeast Rwanda,
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Radio Rwanda as saying that the two men have two
weeks to appeal against the sentence in a higher court.
</P>
<P>
Bizimana, accused of joining massacres and leading "bands of
killers," said during the trial that he was forced to admit his
crimes after being tortured.
</P>
<P>
Gatanazi, accused of rape and looting, denied the charges and
accused the government of "conspiracy" against him, although his
own sister was among the witnesses who testified against him.
</P>
<P>
The two men were the first to be tried for the genocide in
Rwanda from April to July 1994, triggered by the death of Rwandan
President Juvenal Habyramana and his Burundian counterpart
President Cyprian Ntaryamira in a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
The bloody civil war which followed led to the massacre of
at least 500,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu
troops, militia and mobs.
</P>
<P>
The genocide ended when the Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwanda
Patriotic Front defeated the old Hutu government and took power,
sending millions of Hutu refugees fleeing into neighboring
countries.

<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Freezing weather from Siberia
almost paralyzed traffic in central and southern France Thursday
night and Friday morning, an Agence France-Presse (AFP) report
said today.
</P>
<P>
Snowfalls and frost left about 10,000 train passengers stranded
Thursday night in Lyon, the central region of Bourgogne and the
southern departments of Bouches-du-Rhone and Vaucluse.

Early Friday morning, the French state railway company SNCF
started evacuating passengers from trains stuck between Lyon and
the southeastern city of Valence via an emergency shuttle train.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two of some eight high-speed TGV trains which were
immobilized in Lyon on Thursday were still in the station this
morning, and the SNCF canceled Friday's train schedules down the
Rhone Valley.
</P>
<P>
Icy rain and snow also made driving treacherous on the highways
in several regions, including Bretagne, Auvergne, Rhone-Alpes and
Provence.
</P>
<P>
The Lyon to Marseille section of the main north-south highway
was closed Thursday after one man was killed and 16 others injured
in 18 traffic accidents Wednesday night alone.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 to 5,000 cars were stranded on the roads of the
department of Rhone Thursday night, and some drivers had to take
shelter in emergency rescue centers.
</P>
<P>
Officials from a Lyon-based emergency team said that conditions
on the roads around the city were improving slowly as the snow
stopped and snow-clearing work got underway.
</P>
<P>
The extreme cold weather, which started on Christmas eve, has
already claimed 22 deaths in France.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Regularizes Construction Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A management center was set up
in Beijing today to regularize the market of construction
businesses in the Chinese Capital.
</P>
<P>
Any construction project exceeding 500,000 yuan (over 60,000
U.S. dollars) in cost will have to submit a proposal to the
management center for public bidding. This also covers
construction projects with a floor space of more than 2,000 square
meters each.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zongli, director of the Beijing Municipal Construction
Committee, said that the center is an essential regulatory move by
the municipal government, and that it will help provide a more
open environment for competition in Beijing's construction market.
</P>
<P>
The center will help units in charge of construction projectors
with application, bidding, construction management, contracts, and
building quality, making the construction market better for buyers
and sellers.
</P>
<P>
Construction work in Beijing has made great progress in the
past decade, with more than 100 million square meters of housing
having been built and many national or municipal key projects
completed.
</P>
<P>
The number of units involved in construction in Beijing has
grown to over 2,400 with nearly one million employees from some 70
with about 200,000 employees in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Some problems occurred with all this prosperity, Wang said,
noting that the lack of bidding and filling in of application
papers, and the lack of supervision over quality have caused
damage to state and individual property, in turn affecting the
quality and efficiency of the market.

</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Telecommunication (Telkom)
Manager Hans Van de Groenendaal, adding that the lucky birds, who
are yet to be selected among the kids, will be connected to MIR
via Telkom lines from an amateur radio station in Durban.
</P>
<P>
"It is a a great opportunity for kids to ask Blaha questions
on space travel and for their parents and the public to
participate in the venture by tuning in," said Groenendaal.
</P>
<P>
Those who want to enter must provide a 100-word brief
discussion on why space exploration is important for mankind and
offer two questions.
</P>
<P>
"So far we have got 15 applicants, but there is still time for
interested youngsters to enter," he said, adding that the final
decision on the participants will be made by 10 a.m. on the
coming Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement signed between Washington and Pretoria two years

BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Lin Wenyi, who was appointed
vice-mayor of Beijing just a few days ago, joined state and
municipal officials and ordinary folk today in repairing part of
an old city wall.
</P>
<P>
The wall, which is located in the southeastern part of the
city, was constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and,
according to the vice-mayor, "is of great importance in protecting
cultural relics, and I expect more people to come and participate
in the renovation."
</P>
<P>
Decades ago, Beijing was surrounded by magnificent walls, but
only the part being renovated remains from the Ming Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two months, a municipal department in charge of
cultural affairs has been calling on local residents to give back
the walls' original bricks, and hundreds of people have handed
over more than 20,000 bricks they had saved for other use.

<HEADLINE> Cure for Hangovers Still a Long Way Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A cure for hangovers is probably
unattainable because the throbbing headache, tremors and sense of
anxiety are triggered by a cocktail of chemicals in alcoholic
drinks rather than by the alcohol itself, doctors said today in
The British Medical Journal.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ian Calder of the National Hospital for Neurology and
Neurosurgery, London, said that congeners -- complex organic
molecules such as methanol and acetones in alcoholic drinks -- are
more to blame than alcohol for the morning-after symptoms of a
heavy drinking session.
</P>
<P>
He said this explains why over-indulgence in drinks high in
congeners, such as brandy or red wine, tends to cause worse
hangovers than vodka or pure ethanol which are low in congeners.
</P>
<P>
The hangover "league table" runs from brandy and red wine at
the top, through rum, whisky, white wine and gin, to vodka and
pure alcohol at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Calder, says levels of alcohol in the blood do not relate
to the severity of a hangover. Hangovers are at their worst when
almost all alcohol has cleared from the blood.
</P>
<P>
But methanol and the chemicals into which it breaks down are
still present in the blood and research has suggested they may
relate to the severity of the hangover.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- At the beginning of 1997, Hong
Kong greeted another group of engineering students from Singapore
under an annual exchange program between two universities.
</P>
<P>
Eight students of the National University of Singapore arrived
in Hong Kong Thursday to take up training jobs in local industries
in the next six months. In return, eight students of the
University of Hong Kong will go to Singapore this summer for
two-month working placement.
</P>
<P>
Majoring in engineering, they form the 24th batch of
participants in the student exchange scheme, jointly launched by
the two universities since 1974.
</P>
<P>
Ng Chin Lee, a Singaporean student taking part in this year's
exchange program, believed that the industrial training experience
would broaden his horizon, help him make friends, and above all,
offer him an opportunity to eyewitness the historic moment on July
1, 1997, when China resumes its exercises of sovereignty over Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Ng and other seven third-year students were chosen from 70
applicants in the Faculty of Engineering of the Singaporean
university.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, more than 400 students have
benefited from the exchange scheme, said W. P. J. Brandon, dean of
students of the University of Hong Kong. "Either Hong Kong or
Singaporean students can gain an insight into industrial and
technological development in the other economy," said Brandon.
</P>
<P>
Each year the group of Hong Kong students carry out researches
on a theme topic during the trip to Singapore, such as environment
issues in Singapore, Singapore industries, high technology in
Singapore and comparative study between Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The dean said that the helpful program is the oldest student
exchange scheme developed by the University of Hong Kong, which
has launched a dozen with universities in Australia, Britain,
Canada and the United States.

JAKARTA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
determined to reduce the population growth rate by 0.15 percent to
1.51 percent this year from 1.66 percent in 1996, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve that goal, efforts will be made through the
'reproduction movement to achieve a prosperous family' which is an
extension of the family planning program," said State Minister for
Population Affairs Haryono Suyono at a workshop on research and
the development of a prosperous family here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the government would continue to develop
the self-supporting family planning movement, the prosperous and
healthy mother movement and the other already existing movements.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had a population of 199.7 million at the end of 1996,
the world's fourth most populous country after China, India and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Haryono said that Indonesia had at present 11.5
million families or 27.2 million people who were still living
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Haryono, who is also chief of the National Family Planning
Coordinating Board, said the board will do its utmost to reduce
the number of poor people to about 12 million by the end of the
Sixth Five-year Development Plan (1994-99).

BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a member of the
standing committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) Central Committee, today urged religious groups to
comply with the religious policies of the Communist Party and the
state.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the
remarks at the Sixth National Christian Conference in Beijing,
which he attended along with Wang Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the
CPPCC National Committee and minister of the United Front Work
Department of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Li congratulated those present at the conference on its
success, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council, saying that remarkable progress has been made by the
Chinese Christians over the past 40 or more years in running their
churches under the principles of self-administration,
self-support, and self-propagation (the 'three-selfs') and in
being actively involved in socialist modernization by holding the
patriotic and socialist banner high.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Closes Detention Center for Vietnamese Migrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Whitehead Detention Center
for Vietnamese Migrants (VMs) was closed here today as the VM
population in Hong Kong dropped to a record low of 6,300 at the
end of 1996, according to an official release.
</P>
<P>
More than 63,000 VMs had been repatriated under the voluntary
and orderly repatriation programs since 1989, said Acting Refugee
Coordinator Sally Wong.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 alone, 15,100 VMs were repatriated thanks to
accelerated pace, setting the highest annual repatriation record,
she added. The declining VM size had led to the closure of Tai A
Chau Detention Center in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The transfer operation today at Whitehead proceeded smoothly,
Wong said. The center's main camp was closed, with only minor
units left open for providing temporary facilities for some VMs
immediately prior to their repatriation.
</P>
<P>
She described Whitehead's closure as "a watershed in the whole
VM saga, signaling the beginning of the end of the problem."
</P>
<P>
The center was first opened in January 1989 when the VM
population in Hong Kong stood at about 11,000. When the VM
population reached its height of nearly 60,000 in October 1991,
the center provided accommodation for about 25,000.
</P>
<P>
"The government is firmly committed to resolving the problem of
the remaining VMs in Hong Kong as soon as possible," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the remaining VMs are now accommodated in High
Island Detention Center.
</P>
<P>
"Should the current rate of repatriation continue, it should be
possible to close all VM camps by the middle of this year," Wong
added.

He also said he hopes that the new leaders of the Christian

of the Protestant Churches of China will run the churches in
accordance with the three-self principles and contribute to
building a socialist country with Chinese characteristics by
getting Christians to work together with the country's ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangxun, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,
who is honorary chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement
Committee of the Protestant Churches of China and honorary
president of the Christian Council of China, also attended the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth National Christian Conference defined the continued
efforts to run churches well as adherence to the three-self
principles. It also elected the new leading body, which includes
Luo Guanzong, chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement
Committee of the Protestant Churches of China, and Han Wenzao,
president of the Christian Council of China, and approved a work
report of the Fifth Standing Committee of the two organizations,
and resolutions on a number of questions on the promotion of
ethical and cultural progress by the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Christians were called to improve their personal
qualities, so as to let the slogan "a good christian should be a
good citizen" become a guide for them in contributing better still
to ethical and cultural progress.

<HEADLINE> China Separating Banks from Trust, Investment Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China's four largest state-owned
banks basically withdrew from the trust and investment business by
the end of last year, the People's Bank of China said here today.
</P>
<P>
Since November, 148 trust and investment companies now operate
apart from the banks - 46 from the Industrial and Commercial Bank,
36 from the Agricultural Bank, 33 from the Bank of China, and
another 33 from the China Construction Bank. Another 33 have been
approved for transfer, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
The four banks previously had a total of 186 trust and
investment firms, but are now barred from the business under the
country's 1995 Commercial Bank Law.
</P>
<P>
Asset evaluations are still being done so that the trust and
investment companies can be transferred, the central bank said,
and the work has gone very smoothly, according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Up to some 100 billion yuan in assets of the trust and
investment companies have been transferred in full, with no losses
or payment problems during the process, the central bank noted.

<HEADLINE> Majority of China's College Students Paying Tuition Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese university students can
no longer look to the state for funding their education, and now
face the hard truth of paying for tuition by themselves.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission (SEC) said today that more than
64 percent of China's colleges and universities have started to
ask the students to pay tuition fees.
</P>
<P>
This practice is considered as part of China's reform on the
educational system of the institutes of higher learning for last
year. One SEC official says that about 966,000 freshmen recruited
by some 1,000 universities last year, among them 661 universities
began the practice.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Education Law, the SEC and the State
Statistics Bureau have supervised national educational input for
three years running. SEC has also adopted a provisional regulation
on tuition charging.

<HEADLINE> New Study May Lead To Vaccination Against Asthma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have come up with
evidence that childhood chest infections protect children against
asthma.
</P>
<P>
Their research suggests it may be possible to vaccinate against
asthma and other allergies using harmless bacteria related to
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
A study published in the journal Science today has linked the
decline in tuberculosis to the rise of an immune response that
underlies extreme sensitivity to dust, pollen and other allergens.
</P>
<P>
The findings show that it should be possible to produce
vaccines to overcome the current asthma epidemic in the UK and to
prevent other allergic responses.
</P>
<P>
There has been a steady rise in asthma among people in
developed countries this century. In Britain, there has been a 50
percent increase in childhood cases in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The study, by Dr. Julian Hopkin, of the Churchill Hospital,
Oxford, and colleagues in Japan, found that Japanese children with
a strong immune response to tuberculosis were relatively
insensitive to allergens such as dust mites and pollen, and thus
less prone to asthma.
</P>
<P>
"These experiments point to the possibility that immunization
with harmless bacteria, related to tuberculosis, might be helpful
in preventing and treating allergy," said Dr Hopkin. "Further
studies to test this idea are planned."

(about 1.2 billion US dollars) into housing for teachers, an
official with the State Education Commission said today.

More than 20 million square meters of the housing were added in
1996, the official said, bringing the average space for each

For years Chinese teachers have been troubled by limited living

effective way to prevent them from changing professions, he said.

How to stablize the number of faculty members was a major topic

<HEADLINE> Chain-store Competition Internationalized in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- As foreign chain stores are
creating a stronger presence in Shanghai, the competition for the
market share in the city is taking on a more international flavor.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, multinational giants such as Yaohan
of Japan, Carrefour of France, Royal Ahold of Holland, and Chia
Tai of Thailand have invested in chain stores in Shanghai, which
are considered the most promising form of commerce in the 1990s in
China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that the foreign companies have already
opened over 40 chain stores in Shanghai, which have been
successful and have a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
The chain stores under France's Carrefour, for example, are
able to sell commodities for 10-20 percent less than the market
price, and everyday promotional sales of 30 types of goods are
priced 30 percent lower than many of the store's counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investment is still expanding: Ahold plans to
transform 15 local department stores into chain stores within the
next year, and Youhan will increase the number of its chain stores
from 20 to 175 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
And in a similar show of spirit, local businesses have formed
28 chain store companies to run some 1,000 stores.
</P>
<P>
However, when compared with their counterparts, the local
companies still seem to lack muscle, market analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
One problem is their inadequate business scale, which prevents
them from setting up distribution centers that are crucial for
reducing costs.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the shortfalls, many local companies are considering
pooling their resources by merging and other forms of asset
reorganization.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Urges Scientists to Overcome West's Technology Denial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Deve Gowda
today urged Indian scientists to hit back at attempts of advanced
countries to deny frontier technologies to India.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 84th Indian Science Congress at the Delhi
University here, Gowda said that technology denials are widening
the gap between developing and developed nations and Indian
scientists should find suitable and effective alternatives to
tackle the barriers being created by the West.
</P>
<P>
The country should also be careful that obsolete and
environmentally harmful technologies that are being phased out
elsewhere are not passed on to developing countries in the name of
technology transfer, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent this, there is a need for a technology information
system that can help policy-makers adapt the right technologies
for national use, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the global challenges in the frontier areas of
technology, scientists should also ensure that these are made
available to users at affordable prices, he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Netanyahu's Coalition Suffers Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu is facing increasing rebellion among his
ministers over reaching an agreement with Palestinians on Israeli
troop redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Until now, seven out of 18 ministers within the Likud-led
coalition have already declared unequivocally that they would
not support the Hebron deal, while several others are still
wavering.
</P>
<P>
The seven ministers include Infrastructure Minister Ariel
Sharon, Ze'ev Beigin and Communications Minister Limor Livnat of
the Likud, Education Minister Zvulun Hammer and Transportation
Minister Yithzak Levy of the National Religious Party,
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan of the Tsomet and Yuli
Edelstein of the Yisrael Ba'aliya.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of worsening problem, Likud's Justice Minister
Tzahi Hanegbi declared Thursday that he might vote against the
Hebron deal if it was true that Israel had abandoned its
insistence on the Palestinian Authority's (PA) extradition of
suspected Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The ministers have been grumbling about their exclusion from
the Hebron talks despite Netanyahu's promise that he would
bring the deal to the cabinet for approval after its
signing.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been personally leading a three-man committee,
which also includes Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, to supervise the Hebron negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The rebellious ministers also claimed that the Hebron deal
was tantamount to abandoning the 450 Jewish settlers living
among 120,000 Palestinians in Hebron, where the Jewish holy
shrine the Tomb of Patriarchs is located. At least, they
demanded major revisions to the original agreement on Hebron
redeployment, which was reached by the previous Labor government
with the PA.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been trying but failed to achieve major
revisions to the original Hebron agreement after over three
months of marathon talks. The only compromises that he got
from the PA is to erect a buffer zone and to downgrade the
arms of the Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Eitan, who is Netanyahu's close election partner,
denounced the Hebron deal for opening the door for increasing
U.S. and European pressure to force Israel to make more
territorial concessions.
</P>
<P>
"Hebron is the gate way through which the Arabs will
march to destroy the entire Zionist entity," the right-wing
former Chief of Staff claimed in a letter to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Within Netanyahu's own Likud party, the anti-agreement
sentiment seemed decidedly as shown at the Likud political bureau
meeting held Thursday.

<P>
Sharon, the hardline former Defense Minister, complained about
the monoply of the negotiations by Netanyahu. "I had a better plan
which could have minimized the dangers. It's too bad no one saw
fit to talk to me and hear me out," he told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Beigin, another tough opponent of Hebron pullout, asserted
that the Hebron agreement will lead to a total pullback from all
the territories. "Hebron is the last dam, when it bursts, the
deluge will come," he said.
</P>
<P>
Opponents to such a Hebron deal already gave a warning to
Netanyahu during the Tuesday's vote in the Knesset (Parliament) on
the no-confidence motion against the government over the Hebron
talks, which was tabled by the extremist right-wing opposition
party Moledet.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu mainly relied on major opposition parties' indirect
support to avert a power crisis. The result of the vote is 47
against, two in favor and 34 abstentions. A large number of
coalition lawmakers refrained from voting for the government,
which could otherwise be toppled if the Labor, Meretz and Arab
lawmakers voted against.
</P>
<P>
In light of the strong opposition within the coalition
government, analysts said that the Hebron deal could be
torpedoed when it is brought to the cabinet for approval.
</P>
<P>
Noticeably, the beset Netanyahu held a meeting Thursday
with the opposition Labor leader and former premier Shimon
Peres. Tough no detail was disclosed about the meeting, some
observers guessed that Netanyahu is apparently considering the
option of forming a national unity government with the Labor.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the Hebrew daily Hatzofeh believed the
Natanyahu-Peres meeting was of "special significance" for forming
a unity government in light of Netanyahu's displeasure over
dissent within the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a unity government would the easiest way to
pull Netanyhau out of the current political quagmire, but it will
be impossible before he dramatically changes the Likud's hardline
policies that differ distinctively from those of the
Labor.

<HEADLINE> Ammunition Arrival Causes Tension in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The arrival of more than 70
tons of ammunition and weapons at north Mogadishu controlled by
warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed, has brought about tension once again
in the war-torn capital city here.
</P>
<P>
The munitions were off loaded from seven lorries in the day
time Wednesday at a store near the busy junction of Sana before
hundreds of ordinary people here.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said the munitions included 30 tons of rounds
for the assault rifles, 10 tons of the anti-tank b-10 rounds, 10
tons of mortar rounds and a truck of assault rifles of AK-47.
</P>
<P>
It was believed there were 20 tons of anti-aircraft missiles
unloaded at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Mohamed Aidid, another faction's leader, has accused
Ethiopia of offering weapons to his rival Ali Mahdi, his
spokesman Mohamed Qanyare Afrah said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia had provided 84 tons of arms and ammunition to
Ali Mhadi, said Afrah.
</P>
<P>
The weapons reached Mogadishu from the Ethiopian military base
of Shilabo, near te Somali border, and via the Hiran region of
central Somalia, Afrah quoted his faction's intelligence sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Afrah charged that Ethiopia has violated the UN resolution
733, issued in January 1992 to impose arms embargo on Somalia.
</P>
<P>
However, Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kadare, the press secretary of
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, denied the offer of weapons by Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
He described Afrah's accusation as baseless, saying Somali
merchants were also involved in the arms trafficking and that
there is no bans on his faction to buy arms from merchants.
</P>
<P>
People fear that the arrival of this large amount of
ammunition in Mogadishu would reignite the eased hostility in
Mogadishu since the recent fighting in Mogadishu had died down
after the warring factions had ran out of ammunition.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani caretaker Prime
Minister Malik Miraj Khalid today called for fair and just
resolution of basic differences between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Khalid made the appeal at the Council Session of the Afro-Asian
People's Solidarity Organization in Karachi, the southern port
city of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that one billion people of this region will continue to
live without peace unless basic differences between India and
Pakistan are resolved fairly and justly.
</P>
<P>
He said that the South Asian Association of Regional
Cooperation which came into existence because of the spade work
provided by Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization, has
played a role to bring peace in the region where people were
victims of basic conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The caretaker prime minister said that despite the fact that
Pakistan has attained independence and is a free country today,
"we are still victims of various prejudices."
</P>
<P>
"Under this faith we should have good wishes for entire
humanity and in keeping with this faith the Organization of
Afro-Asian Solidarity is the protagonist of the cause of humanity,
having no belief in the caste, color or creed," Khalid said.
</P>
<P>
The Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization is the best forum for
elaboration of the high principles of humanity, respect to
humanity and justice, Khalid added.

<HEADLINE> More Women Become Literate in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- With the deepening of the
poverty relief program, more than one million young women in
landlocked Gansu Province have become literate.
</P>
<P>
Located in northwest China, Gansu is a comparatively backward
province that constantly faces a shortage of funds for economic
and cultural development.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the province was reported to have more than
four million women who were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, Gansu has carried out two anti-illiteracy campaigns
and opened 60,000 educational training classes.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 200,000 women were encouraged to attend training
schools, and among them, 120,000 have received education.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that another 25 special classes have opened for
girl drop-outs in 15 poverty-stricken counties where ethnic groups
live in compact communities.
</P>
<P>
The enrollment rate of school-age girls has reportedly reached
90 percent, and nearly 7,000 poor girls received aid from local
authorities and returned to their classrooms, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
The training classes also teach practical skills to help local
women overcome poverty. Since 1986, four million women have taken
the courses, and 70 percent of them have grasp one or more
practical skills. In 1996, 500,000 women benefitted from the
courses.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Starts Repatriation of Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has started
repatriation of illegal immigrants with more than 1,200
Indonesians setting sail for home today, the Malaysian national
news agency Bernama reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesians, mostly from the Indonesian island of Java,
left Malaysia's Pasir Gudang port in Johore Bahru aboard an
Indonesian naval ship under the supervision of Indonesian military
personnel and the Malaysian Police Field Force.
</P>
<P>
These immigrants had been brought to the port by police trucks
from seven camps in various parts of Malaysia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the transport costs were shared by the
governments of Indonesia and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
This is Malaysia's first repatriation of illegal immigrants
since a six-month amnesty expired on December 31 last year. Some
300,000 illegal immigrants had registered themselves with the
authorities in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
According to Indonesian Ambassador to Malaysia Mohd Jacob
Dasto, the two countries will study the effectiveness of
repatriation via naval vessels and would continue the program if
it is found to be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Home Ministry Secretary General Samsudin Osman said
that his government hopes more countries whose nationals entered
Malaysia illegally would take them back to ensure their safe
return and save transport costs for Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
He said some 12,000 illegal immigrants were still staying at
eight detention depots in the country, mostly from Indonesia,
Bangladesh, Myanmar and India.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Host D-8 FM Meeting in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from eight
developing Moslem countries, known as "D-8", are to meet
Saturday in Istanbul, the largest city in Turkey, to discuss ways
to strengthen cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan is expected
to chair the opening ceremony of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also review the preparations for a D-8
summit meeting scheduled to be held in Turkey in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister meeting in Istanbul will be the second
gathering of the "D-8" countries. The first was held in Ankara by
high-ranking officials from the member countries, who agreed to
set up the D-8 headquarters in Istanbul to handle its daily work.
</P>
<P>
The D-8 bloc, which groups Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia,
Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey, was launched by
Turkey after the pro-Islamic Welfare Party led by Necmettin
Erbakan came to power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the Conference on Cooperation and Development held in
Istanbul in October last year, Erbakan proposed the creation of
the D-8 group, which was officially formed in November.
</P>
<P>
The Turkey-launched group has come across severe
criticism from other Moslem countries, especially the Central
Asian nations which are not invited to the bloc.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Expressway Company Purchases New Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Anhui Expressway Company Ltd.,
China's first highway enterprise listed on the overseas stock
market, has purchased the Tianchang section of No. 205 national
highway at a total cost of 210 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The No. 205 highway runs from Shanhaiguan in north China's
Hebei Province, to Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province, passing by Tianchang in east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Now that it holds the management right of the Tianchang
section, the Anhui Expressway company is bound to gain great
returns, said Wang Shui, chairman of the company, who predicts
that the daily flow of vehicles on the Tianchang section will
reach 8,000 to 9,000 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Tianchang section, with a total length of nearly 30 km,
opened on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
The road, a first-grade highway only for automobile use, is
also a part of the Nanjing-Lianyungang highway in neighboring
Jiangsu Province. It is expected to stimulate the economic
expansion in northern Jiangsu and the eastern part of Anhui.
</P>
<P>
The Anhui Expressway Company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange on November 13, 1996, raising 870 million Hong Kong
dollars of overseas funds.
</P>
<P>
The company now manages a superhighway from Hefei, capital city
of Anhui, to Nanjing, the provincial capital of Jiangsu Province.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Hardens Position on Hebron Deal: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
President Yasser Arafat has refused to meet Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu as he hardens position on reaching the Hebron
agreement, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat Thursday rejected U.S. Special Envoy Dennis Ross'
proposal to hold a summit with Netanyahu to initial the Hebron
deal. Israeli news agency Itim quoted Arafat as saying that
"several problems still require a solution."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's aides charged Arafat for backtracking on compromise
language reached earlier this week on the extent of Israel's
commitment to a deadline for the Israeli troop redeployment in the
rest of West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said that the Arafat-Ross meeting last
night was conducted in a tough atmosphere. The English daily The
Jerusalem Post quoted Arafat as telling Ross at one point that
"There are more burning issues than signing the agreement."
</P>
<P>
The alleged Arafat's hardening of position came after the
Wednesday shooting spree by an Israeli soldier in central Hebron
which wounded seven Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A day earlier, negotiators had been confident that the terms
had been worked out on clinching a deal and an Arafat-Netanyahu
summit would sign it Thursday.
</P>
<P>
One Netanyahu aide said that the original terms did not
obligate Israel to a hard deadline for further redeployment
while they were also acceptable to the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Wednesday once again blamed the PA for delaying
the signing of Hebron agreement. David Bar-Ilan, Netanyahu's
media adviser, blamed the PA for applying the old tactics of
footdragging in order to bring more international pressure on
Israel so to squeeze out more concessions.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite clear that the stalling is done by the
Palestinian Authority. The reasonable guess is that they feel
that this situation of no agreement favors them and is
detrimental to us," he said.

BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China has issued a notice urging
taxation agencies nationwide to step up their effort for
collecting and regulating the value-added tax on land.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to make the most of the role of the tax in

Most areas have done a great deal to formulate rules to
accelerate the collection process and to promptly hand over the
tax revenues to the state coffer, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, collection of the tax is satisfactory," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, some areas have been slow and inefficient in
collecting the tax, the notice noted, urging taxation agencies to
check and register contracts for the transfer and development of
real estates.
</P>
<P>
"A full check and registration of such contracts signed before
January 1 of 1994 should be launched, in an effort to examine
their qualifications for tax exemptions," the notice said.
</P>
<P>
It asked all areas to establish and keep improving a tax
declaration system and other regulations and rules for the
value-added tax on land.
</P>
<P>
All areas should launch a check on payment of the tax and on
implementation the tax rules in the near future, the notice said.

<HEADLINE> Third Israeli Arrested in Hebron Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A third Israeli soldier has
reportedly been questioned by the Israeli police after
Wednesday's shooting attack in the center of Hebron, which left
at least seven wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report this morning, the third
soldier, like Noam Friedman who carried out the shooting attack
Wednesday, is believed to serve in the Anatot army base on the
outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Friedman's close friend, 19-year-old soldier Yuval
Jibli, of Jerusalem, was also arrested, after Friedman told
investigators that Jibli knew his plans to kill Arabs in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Jibli, who also serves with Friedman at the Anatot army base
and reportedly went to an Arab village near his army base on
Wednesday and fired shots in the air, is suspected of "collusion
and failure to prevent a crime."
</P>
<P>
However, judge of the Petah Tikva Magistrate's Court only
agreed to remand Jibli for only four days, saying police did not
bring sufficient evidence for a longer remand.
</P>
<P>
Police refused to disclose exactly what proof they have that
Jibli knew of Friedman's plot, but a representative did say there
are indications of other conspiracies to harm Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Friedman who told reporters that he had fired to
thwart a redeployment agreement in Hebron, was to be remained
in custody until January 12 on suspicion of attempted murder
and incitement.
</P>
<P>
Police and the General Security Services also are
investigating whether more accomplices were involved in the
incident in Hebron and the possibility of a new Jewish
underground.

<HEADLINE> Most Zambian School Leavers Can't Go to Varsities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Only 1,000 out of 12,000 grade
12 school leavers who qualify to the University of Zambia (UNZA)
will this year be admitted due to lack of sponsorship, Times of
Zambia today quoted Education Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said here on Thursday that the government could not afford
tuition fees for all the pupils and at the same time the highest
institution of the country has no capacity to accommodate such a
big number of students.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that some of the 1,000 students to be
admitted to UNZA will have to pay for themselves because of
limitations in the budget.
</P>
<P>
''The bursaries committee and the Ministry of Education are
working out a mechanism to see how the two universities, (UNZA)
and Copperbelt University (CBU), can capture a big number of
students. The budget cannot capture all the students who
qualify,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye confirmed that UNZA has increased tuition fees for
the forthcoming intake but did not say how much it is.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for the government to open several
universities and so it is up to the private sector to takeerbelt the
challenge, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
There are only two universities in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Maize Yield May Drop in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Maize production may drop by 40
percent this year as more than 250,000 small-sized farms in
Zambia can't afford price-hiked fertilizer, the "Times of Zambia"
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Zambian National Farmers Union leader Ajay
Washee as saying that the maize output in the country may fall to
some 720,000 or 810,000 tons in 1997, down from 1.26 million tons
last year.
</P>
<P>
The expected decrease is majorly resulted by the new prices of
fertilizer, which doubled last month and caused a lot of
complaints from small farmers, the main producers of maize in
Zambia, said Washee.
</P>
<P>
It's a common knowledge that the small farms can't afford
fertilizer at so high prices, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The transportation of fertilizer is another question.
Fertilizer often arrives very late due to poor marketing
commercial system. And in most provinces, it even can't be in
farmers' hands due to the impassable roads there.
</P>
<P>
Only about 64 percent of the 1996 maize yield have been
marketed in Zambia, and the rest are restored by the farmers,
Washee added.

<TEXT>
<P>
"The situation of an irrational state economic structure must
not continue, and we should make our management more
quality-oriented than quantity-oriented," said Vice-Minister of
Finance Zhang Youcai.
</P>
<P>
While actively promoting enterprise system reforms and making
good use of the increased value in state assets, China should
place emphasis on liquidating its available assets and resolutely
carry out the policy to restructure its state economy, said Zhang,
who is also director of the State Administration of State Property.
</P>
<P>
"This is aimed at optimizing the distribution of state assets
and is the fundamental way to fully tap the leading role of the
state economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The focus of restructuring the state economy lies in
reshuffling the organizational structure of enterprises as well as
the sectoral and regional structures, Zhang said, adding that all
should be done in line with the overall plan for restructuring the
national economy and state industrial policies.
</P>
<P>
Both the issues of immobility and loss of state assets should
be tackled in the process, and mergering, takeovers and
bankruptcies of existing enterprises should be employed, Zhang
said.

JERUSALEM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel has denied involvement
in the Tuesday bus bombing in Damascus, capital of Syria, which
killed nine people and wounded 44 others, Israel Radio reported
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Following Syria's accusations against the Mossad, Israel's
intelligence service, for carrying out the bus bombing, Israeli
officials have dismissed the allegations as "ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
A statement by an unnamed government source, carried on the
official Syrian News Agency, said that "this terrorist, criminal,
cowardly act comes amid the escalation of Israeli threats by a
number of Israeli officials lately aiming to kill the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prime Minister's office said that there is no
basis in reality for the Syrian government to point a finger at
Israel as the responsible party for the attack.
</P>
<P>
David Bar Ilan, a senior aide to Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, termed the Syrian allegation "sheer nonsense," while
the U.S. administration called on Syria to back up its
allegations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said that it
was a very serious charge for one state to accuse another of
actually sponsoring bombing in its capital.
</P>

"The charge was wild and irresponsible if it was not back up
by evidence," Burns said.

Shah said that the government is trying to improve the
country's credit rating by bringing the figure down to 15 to 20
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The amount of accumulated loans could be cut considerably
through the process of privatization, Shah said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the financial situation of government departments,
such as the Heavy Mechanical Complex, the Karachi Electric Supply
Corporation and the Railways, have deteriorated to such an extent
that they cannot even pay salaries to their employees.
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible for the government to meet expenses by the
money collected through taxes and it is now essentially important
to privatize them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to strengthen the Privatization Commission,"
Shah said, noting that a considerable amount of revenue can be
obtained to ease the burden of internal loans by selling out
profit-making state-owned units to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Shah also said that the government has tried to make the
process of privatization more transparent by increasing members of
the commission and giving representation to the private sector in
it at the time of the commission's re-organization.

<HEADLINE> India Refuses to Comment on U.S. Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government and the
U.S. embassy here were non-committal on Thursday's press reports
that two U.S. diplomats have been asked by New Delhi to leave the
country for their alleged espionage activities, The Times of India
said today.
</P>
<P>
One of the two U.S. diplomats in question -- a woman in a
senior position in the embassy -- is allegedly the station
director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in India
while the other is a junior diplomat, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the two were accused of "hobnobbing" with their
Indian contact Rattan Sehgal, chief of the Counter-Intelligence
Division of the Indian Intelligence Bureau (IB).
</P>
<P>
Sehgal has "opted" for retirement, highly placed intelligence
sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the U.S. embassy refused to comment anything on
the issue beyond saying that "the news report is an internal
Indian government matter."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman of the Indian Ministry of External
Affairs said that "it is the policy of the government of India not
to comment on such reports."
</P>
<P>
According to The Times of India, New Delhi's downplaying of the
episode is in line with its policy to tackle spying activities
involving "friendly countries" in a quiet manner.

<HEADLINE> Last Decade Sees Fastest Industrial Growth Rate for Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- In the past decade, Beijing's
industrial sector has scored its fastest growth rate in the
history of the capital city, according to a communique.
</P>
<P>
The communique was released by the municipal office in charge
of the city's third industry survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, part of a national study, was conducted in the
first half of 1996 in accordance with a State Council decision.
</P>
<P>
Results showed that by the end of 1995, there were 34,293
industrial enterprises and production-type units in the city
proper, 5,894 more than in 1985. They had a total work force of
Over 2.4 million, up by 12.4 percent over 1985, and their assets
were valued at 269.7 billion yuan, up 8.1 times.
</P>
<P>
The city reported an industrial added value of 52.5 billion
yuan in 1995, an increase of 110 percent. The gross industrial
output value stood at more than 144 billion yuan, an increase of
2.1 times or an annual growth rate of nearly 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade or so, the state-run industry has maintained
its dominant status, in spite of the development of economies with
various ownerships. In 1995, the state-run sector accounted for
almost 73 percent of the gross industrial output value and 77
percent of the total assets in the sector.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of small enterprises grew in the industrial
sector. The number of light industries decreased, while that of
heavy industries rose, the results showed. The output value of the
heavy industry grew from 56.2 percent to 66.2 percent of the
total.

<HEADLINE> Four Million out of Illiteracy in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- China met its expectations in
its campaign to wipe out illiteracy in 1996, providing educational
opportunities for more than four million people, an official with
the State Education Commission (SEC) said today.
</P>
<P>
To date, six percent of Chinese people aged 15 to 47 are
illiterate, down four percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The SEC official said the move to make nine-year compulsory
education universal and eliminate illiteracy among young and
middle-aged people by the end of this century has been progressing
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The two targets of the first phase have been basically reached,
with 1,400 counties, or half of China's population, having met the
state-set requirement by the end of 1996, he said. Five counties
in the Tibet Autonomous Region have promoted the need
for education at the secondary school level.
</P>
<P>
SEC, along with the Ministry of Finance and 12 provincial
governments, co-conducted an extensive poverty relief education
program, investing 5.3 billion yuan (about 640 million US dollars)
in total, he added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that during the first half of the century,
illiterates in China made up 90 percent of the total

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Toy Company Increases Investment in Inland Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- VTech Group of Companies, a
Hong Kong-based conglomerate for making electronic toys, has
nearly finished construction of a workshop in south China's
Guangdong Province in the company's new science and technology
park scheduled for completion in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
According to an executive of the conglomerate, the building has
a combined floor space of 170,000 sq m, and will be located in
"VTech Scientific and Technological Park" in Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
By then, the group's investment in inland areas will increase
from 800 million to 1.1 billion Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1976, VTech conglomerate is mainly engaged in
designing, manufacturing and marketing of high-tech electronic
products, including educational games, computer-related products,
and cordless telephones.
</P>
<P>
After more than two decades, the company has grown into Hong
Kong's largest electronic enterprise. In 1995, it scored 700
million U.S. dollars in total sales.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the workshops in the new park started in March
of 1996. Located 20 km away from the existing workshops on Houjie
Street, the park has a planned area of 66.6 hectares, with an
entire investment of 1.8 billion Hong Kong dollars. The cost of
first-stage construction is 300 million Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
When completed, the park will be able to accommodate
40,000 to 50,000 workers, and will feature workshops with a total
floor space of 800,000 sq m, and an industrial production area.
</P>
<P>
The executive contributed the group's flourishing business to
the reform and opening-up policies of the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
"After 1997, Hong Kong's industries and interior areas'
abundant raw materials, labor and technological resources will be
more closely combined, and competitiveness will be enhanced rather
than reduced," the executive said, adding that now is the best
time for increasing investment in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, VTech has built workshops on Houjie Street in
Dongguan, which carry out the design, development, production,
quality control, packaging and export for most of the
conglomerate's products.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Hong Kong group does all of its manufacturing
and assembly business in these facilities, and has hired several
hundred engineers to develop new products in Shenzhen and Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
So far, workshops on Houjie Street have a total floor space of
280,000 sq m, generating five billion Hong Kong dollars of output
value each year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Production Expected to Rise 18 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco production is
expected to increase by about 18 percent this year following an
increase in the area under tobacco from 81,300 to 95,400
hectares.
</P>
<P>
In its latest quarterly guide to the economy, the First
Merchant Bank said a higher proportion of the crop was being
grown under irrigation and the average yield was therefore
expected to increase to about 240 million kg from 201.6 milloion
kg in the 1996 auction season.
</P>
<P>
''At an average of 2.94 US Dollars a kg, the revenue in 1996
reached a record 592 million US Dollars, and growers have hopes
that the good demand levels will keep prices firm again in the
auctions that will start in April 1997," said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the world's second largest tobacco exporter,
accounting for 22 percent of world exports. The world's largest
exporter of tobacco is Brazil which commands a quarter of the
world's export market. enditem

<HEADLINE> 40 Million Disaster Victims in China Well Accommodated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Many areas in China that were
stricken by severe natural disasters last year have maintained
sound social order, thanks to aid from the government and generous
public donations, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The 40 million hardest-hit disaster victims have been well
accommodated, provided with sufficient food, clothes, shelter and
medical care, and the public is calm," Fan Baojun, vice-minister
of Civil Affairs, said at a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
His remark was based on the ministry's recent inspection tours
in 14 provinces and autonomous regions where the most damage
occurred. The 40 million residents in those areas were most
heavily affected and in need of immediate help.
</P>
<P>
Relief funds from the central government in 1996 totaled 2.3
billion yuan (277 million US dollars), 21 percent more than the
budgeted sum, and 43 percent more than the amount earmarked in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at various levels also added 1.45 billion
yuan for the disaster victims.
</P>
<P>
The public donated 2.58 billion yuan in relief funds, and
overseas contributions came to 220 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that "public donations for the first
time exceeded the amount provided by the governments."
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in public donations was due to a national
charity campaign promoted by President Jiang Zemin. Storehouses
for non-monetary donations have been set up in major cities and a
management system has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
In addition to frequent floods, droughts, typhoons and other
natural calamities, 26 earthquakes measuring over five on the
Richter Scale also shook the country, causing great loss of life
and property.
</P>
<P>
Fan said over 100 million victims were relocated as part of
emergency relief efforts last year, and the number of deaths and
injuries was cut to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
The local governments were encouraged to shoulder part of the
responsibility of rescuing disaster victims in their own regions,
so that the funds from the central government can be given to the
most needy.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide auditing networks to oversee the spending of
relief funds have ensured the money goes straight to the victims,
according to the vice-minister.

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Safe in 1996 over Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai skies were reportedly
safe in 1996, despite the heavy air traffic over China's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai air routes carried 168,000 airplanes in 1996, 15
percent more than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The authorities attributed the safe year to the effective
precautions taken to detangle increasingly busy airways. As part
of the effort, one of the air passages leading to the Hongqiao
Airport was removed.
</P>
<P>
On the busiest routes, between Shanghai and Beijing, and
between Shanghai and Guangzhou, certain planes are required to fly
at designated altitudes, which shortens flying time and increases
the flow of air traffic.
</P>
<P>
A fan-shape air traffic control area has been opened
specifically for planes traveling south from Shanghai, where the
airways are excessively crowded.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has more roads and a
larger supply of power, gas and water, owing to the completion of
major infrastructure projects in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, the city completed 22 major construction projects
last year. Another 24 named on last year's list of key

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Minister for
Agriculture and Co-operatives Njelu Kasaka has said the government
will continue to own land, because it is national asset and has not
plans of selling it to any individual, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said this when talking to employees of the
National Ranch Corporation (NARCO), at Ruvu on Tuesday at the
beginning of his tour of Kibaha and Bagamoyo districts, in Coast
Region.
</P>
<P>
He was briefing NARCO employees on the new privatisation policy
which he said should spare selling land to individuals.
</P>
<P>
Kasaka added that this cannot be felt as a problem at the moment
since the country's population is relatively small. But, he said in
50 yeas to come, the population may have more than doubled, and
people will still need land for their development.
</P>
<P>
It would be unwise to let someone own a piece of land even when he
did not make use of it, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deputy minister advised the workers to buy shares in
the corporations which will be soon privatised.  enditem

CANBERRA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Chen Li of China has been
granted wildcard entry into the Australian Open which will be held
in Melbourne this month.
</P>
<P>
Leander Paes of India has also been given a wildcard entry in
the 128-strong main draws for the men's singles events for the
Open, a move designed to forge stronger links and develop tennis
within the Asia-Pacific Region.
</P>
<P>
Chen and Paes' world rankings of 134 and 128, respectively,
were insufficient to place them in the main draw, so both would
normally have had to gain entry through pre-tournament qualifying.
</P>

It will be Chen's first main draw appearance in a grand slam.
Paes, an Indian Davis Cup team member, won the bronze medal behind

URUMQI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The first book detailing the
modern history of the Uygur ethnic group has rolled off
press in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 800,000-character "History of Uygur Ethnic Group" (second
volume) was written by Liu Zhixiao in both Chinese and Uyger
languages. Liu is associated with the Xinjiang Academy of Social
Sciences, where he specializes in the histories of ethnic groups.

<P>
The work describes the development of the Uygur ethnic group
between the 1930s and 1949, when the People's Republic of China
was founded.
</P>
<P>
Critics have called it a systematic analysis and portrayal of
the nationality's historical growth, and political, economic and
cultural situations.
</P>
<P>
The "History of Uygur Ethnic Nationality" (first volume) was

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Strengthen Public Sector Undertakings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to catapult some of
the public sector undertakings (PSUS) as multinational companies,
the Indian government plans to empower them to acquire three main
attributes -- state-of-the-art technology, finance and
professional management, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Along with this, the government would also help these companies
merge group companies or acquire other public sector units working
in related areas in order to strengthen their core competency and
acquire the global size.
</P>
<P>
For the much-needed financial support for the globalization
efforts of the PSUS majors, the government is planning multiple
options including priority lending by domestic financial
institutions and allowing these companies to tap international
markets through global depository receipts issues.
</P>
<P>
A complete recast of the management of these PSUS by inducting
professionals and granting autonomy to the boards of these
companies is also on the cards.
</P>
<P>
On the technology front, the government's efforts would be to
facilitate quick technology tie-ups by these companies with the
multinational companies. This could be achieved by granting
autonomy to the company boards. Since latest technologies come
with a high price, the strategy would be mainly to join hands with
multinational companies for setting up overseas projects. The PSUS
majors could also make use of their core strengths to bring down
the prices to a realistic level.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Host Two Large Tourism Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuba will host a regional forum,
and a major national convention on tourism promotion in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Congress of the Confederation of Latin American
Tourism Organizations (Cotal '97) will be held on May 12 to 17 in
Havana.
</P>
<P>
It will be the third international tourism meeting there since
last March.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Cotal will coincide with Cuba's 18th Tourism
Convention, the most important annual commercial exchange in this
Caribbean island, said Fausto Garcia, the forum organizing
committee president.
</P>
<P>
As some 1,500 travel agents were expected to attend both
meetings, Cuba would take advantage of the occasion to intensify
the promotion of local tourism, which had been a consistent
foreign exchange earner for the Cuban economy since 1995, Garcia
said.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 saw many foreign companies invest in this
tropical island. An Italy company paid 16 million U.S. dollars in
May for a resort called "Mediclub", while Vancouver-based Wilton
Properties Ltd. invested 200 million dollars to cooperate in a
Cuban tourist resort, last July.
</P>
<P>
Last March the U.S. Congress approved the Helms-Burton Bill
threatening to punish foreign companies who do business with Cuba,
and was heavily criticized for this extraterritorial measure.
</P>
<P>
Cuba hosted a venture in culture tourism in Latin American and
Caribbean countries last November and the Second Iberoamerican
Meeting for the Development of Tourism in last March.
</P>
<P>
Cotal, the highest ranking regional tourism organization, is
formed by private enterprises in 21 countries. Its slogan for the
coming congress is "Forty years of tourism promotion in Latin
America."
</P>
<P>
Cotal annual forums, of which Cuba was the founder, will
return to Havana after 37 years. Cuba attended the Lima Meeting in
1993, said Garcia.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that in 1996 more than one million
foreign tourists visited Cuba. It was the largest number yet and a 30
percent increase over 1995. The island also enjoyed a growth of
7.8 percent in gross domestic product during the year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Prospects for Thai Bourse Remain Dim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The prospects for Thailand's
bourse in the Year of the Ox did not look bullish when share
prices dropped as much as 3.42 percent Thursday, the first trading
day of the new year.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index plunged 28.44 points
before the market closed at 803.13 points, a 51-month low.
</P>
<P>
On September 11, 1992 the indicator closed lower at 801.90
points.
</P>
<P>
Just minutes before the market closed Thursday, the index fell
below the 800-point psychological level, but bounced back on
bargain-hunting at the end of the day, in the worst year-opening
performance in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
The Thai bourse, hit by heavy declines in major overseas
markets and on weak Thai economic indicators, had a thin turnover
of 2.25 billion baht (88.24 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
On December 30, the last trading day of last year, the SET
closed at 831.57 points, only 4.14 points lower, with a trading
turnover of 4.7 billion baht (184.31 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the SET shed a total of 520.30 points, or 39.31
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Thursday investors sold out on concern of
Thai economic indicators. Investors, especially foreigners, were
concerned about the country's high current account deficit and
falling exports.
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index as announced by the Commerce Ministry
rose 4.8 percent year-on-year in December, unchanged from
November.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors, having been net sellers most of last year,
continued their sell-off Thursday. SET officials have been talking
about finding ways to reduce foreign investors' influence on the
bourse.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said sellers unloaded finance, bank and property
sectors after they bought them late last month.
</P>
<P>
The finance sector led the decline, losing 8.16 percent, the
property dipped 4.33 percent and the banking slipped 3.23
percent.
</P>
<P>
The finance sector's performance indicated that "loss-cutting"
rather than "profit-taking" was the reason behind the selling
pressure, according to Thanawat Patchimkul, an analyst with
Seamico Securities.
</P>
<P>
He felt the SET index could drop to 750 points in the next six
months as concerns over "window dressing" of institutional
investors' balance sheets and earnings growth heighten in the
first quarter and foreign investors continue to prefer other Asian
markets to the Thai bourse.
</P>
<P>
Brokers expected sustained selling pressure until the current
account deficit and exports showed improving trends.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM to Visit Bangladesh Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Deve
Gowda is scheduled to pay a two-day official visit to Bangladesh
from January 6 for furthering enhancing bilateral ties, official
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The visit assumes significance as it comes close on the heels
of the historic 30-year Ganges water-sharing agreement signed
between India and Bangladesh on December 12 during the visit of
Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to India.
</P>
<P>
Gowda will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising
External Affairs Minister I.K. Gujral, Home Minister Indrajit
Gupta, Foreign Secretary Salman Haider, Commerce Secretary P.
Prabhu and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Chakma refugee problems and optimum utilization of water
resources are likely to figure prominently during the talks
between the prime ministers of the two countries. India has been
asking Bangladesh for long to take back the Chakma refugees, who
are currently sheltered in camps in India's Tripura state.
</P>
<P>
When asked if any agreement between the two countries was on
the cards, official sources have said that as of now, nothing had
been finalized but all would depend on talks between Gowda and
Hasina.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Bangladesh, the Indian prime minister
besides meeting Bangladeshi leaders would address the Bangladesh
Federation of Industry, Chambers and Commerce in a bid to enhance
bilateral economic and trade relations, official sources said.

<HEADLINE> Italian Minister List Economic Priorities in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Keeping down inflation, reforming
fiscal system and public administration, and keeping up production
and consumption are the Italian government's priorities in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani made the remarks today
during a television interview, where he defended the government's
year-end fiscal decree and package of incentives.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal decree and package of incentives, designed to rescue
industrial sectors in crisis, are labeled by business and industry
circles as "going in the right direction but inadequate."
</P>
<P>
In his response, Bersani said the incentives valued at 1.78
trillion lire (1.17 billion U.S. dollars) and bonuses for new car
sales are "only a wedge in the government's industrial policy."
</P>
<P>
The first thing, he said, is to hold the ground already won in
lowering annual inflation down to around 3.8 percent in 1996, in
stabilizing the lire and in trimming interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The second, the minister noted, is to move on to an overhaul of
the fiscal system and the public administration, which will affect
the enterprising system in areas of employment and privatization.
</P>
<P>
The third priority is, Bersani said, "to give tone to 1997
because we are at a crucial passage, a difficult and sensitive
one, which requires support of production and consumption."
</P>
<P>
Bersani said the government's year-end fiscal decree was based
on the belief that 1997 "will be a year of recovery, for working
together" among all sides who take roles in economic activities.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Party Expects Five More Parliament Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main ruling party
expects to become the largest party in Parliament by winning all
the five vacant seats of the lower house to be elected in the
upcoming by-elections, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sher bahadur Deuba's Nepali Congress (NC) party,
which has 86 MPs in the powerful lower house, would concentrate
on the by-elections scheduled for later this month, newspapers
said.
</P>
<P>
After a Central Working Committee (CWC) meeting of the NC party
Thursday, a party spokesman said that the NC has given top-most
priority to the by-elections for five vacant house seats and hopes
to win all of the them.
</P>
<P>
Rumors here said that the NC party might press Prime Minister
Deuba to call for mid-term elections as his three-party coalition
government only has minority support in Parliament after a
no-confidence vote last week.
</P>
<P>
The 205-seat lower house Tuesday last week rejected a
no-confidence motion tabled by main opposition the Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), which has 88 MPs in
the house, with a vote of 101 MPs in favor and 84 MPs against the
motion. The motion required a majority of 103 votes to pass in the
house.
</P>
<P>
However, the NC spokesman Thursday said that the option of
mid-term elections was not the topic of the discussions at the
party's CWC meeting.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's computer industry is
expected to continue to boom in 1997 in both domestic and export
markets as demand surpasses supply, says the Thai Farmers Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's computer exports are expected to enjoy a more than
20-25 percent growth in the new year, while the industry will see
a 15 percent growth in the domestic market, the center says.
</P>
<P>
The center also indicates that the air-conditioner market in
the country will continue to expand this year as more and more
middle class people can afford the products, predicting a 15
percent growth in the domestic market and a 20-25 percent growth
in the export market for the products.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the research center believes that other
commodities, like information technology products, television
sets, cosmetics, vending machines, comic books, milk, fast food,
seasonings, frozen foods, fruit juice, and snacks, will sell well
this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- In a four pronged strategy
submitted to the Finance Ministry, the PHD Chamber of Commerce and
Industry (PHDCCI) has suggested export of services at par with the
merchandise export for giving boost to exports and encouraging
foreign exchange earnings, PHDCCI sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
PHDCCI analysis estimated that services export would constitute
more than 40 percent of their total exports by the turn of the
century and would be a high value commodity in future, PHDCCI
President Binjay Kumar said.
</P>
<P>
To encourage export of services, "service" should be defined to
include any type of professional services including management,
fashion designing, legal, accountancy, consultancy, etc., he said.
</P>
<P>
The PHDCCI president has also urged the need for total tax
exemption for service export instead of 50 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people went on a
burning and looting rampage Thursday in Sanggau Ledo district of
West Kalimantan province, Indonesia, the aftershock of ethnic
tension that broke out Monday claiming five lives, The Jakarta
Post newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
At 6:00 p.m., a mob of about 5,000 people were still rampaging
through the streets of the districts of Bengkayang and Samalantan,
and the villages of Marabu, Kampung Tengah and Jirak, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Most of the mob were men of the Dayak ethnic group. Of those
who died, two were Dayaks. The other three originated from Madura
Island, East Java. In addition, at least nine people were injured
with varying degrees of severity.
</P>
<P>
There were also "countless" houses being burned down by
rioters, the paper quoted a source in Marabu village as saying.
</P>
<P>
A curfew was imposed on the area Thursday. Neither the local
military office nor Regent Taryo Aryanto could be contacted for
confirmation last night, it added.
</P>
<P>
A mobile brigade and members of Battalion No. 643 have been
dispatched from the provincial capital of Pontianak, some 700
kilometers north of Jakarta, to contain the unrest.
</P>
<P>
The tension in Sanggau Ledo was sparked Monday by a brawl over
a woman between two groups of youths. In the incident that
occurred during a folk show, a Madura man reportedly stabbed two
Dayak tribesmen in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
News about the brawl circulated rapidly and prompted more
violence Tuesday and the days after.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expects Sharp Rise in Fiscal Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
expected to register a fiscal surplus of at least 22.82 billion
pesos (870 million U.S. dollars) in 1997, according to the
Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The projection more than tripled the expected surplus of 6.91
billion pesos (263 million dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Finance officials said the larger surplus would dampen the need
for the government to borrow, an activity which always drives up
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the fiscal balance of the government had been
in constant surplus since 1994 when the government enjoyed its
first surplus of 16.3 billion pesos (622 million dollars). In
1995, the fiscal surplus was 10.2 billion pesos (389 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The original target of the government fiscal surplus this year
was set at only 14.7 billion pesos (561 million dollars) but it
was later revised because the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program is
expected to be fully implemented this year and allow the
government to receive more revenues.
</P>
<P>
The country's fiscal surplus in 1996 is expected to be only
6.91 billion pesos instead of the targeted 17.5 billion pesos (667
million dollars) partly because of lower privatization proceeds
and accelerated infrastructure spending, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Refugees End Sit-in at Nepal-India Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Bhutanese refugees Thursday
called off their marathon sit-in protest at the Nepal-India
border, easing the tension at the eastern border area of Nepal in
the last few days, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of refugees had staged a sit-in at the Mechi bridge
since last Sunday, protesting against the forced deportation of
some 850 Bhutanese refugees from two camps in the Indian state of
West Bengal to Nepal by Indian police.
</P>
<P>
The protesters called off the sit-in Thursday after claiming
that the Indian side admitted its fault in deporting these
Bhutanese refugees.
</P>
<P>
They also allowed 13 Indian buses, used by the Indian police to
carry the deported refugees into the Nepali territory, to return
to India.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the refugees had said they would free the buses only
after India agrees to transport the deportees back to India.
</P>
<P>
The five-day stand-off at the Mechi bridge had paralyzed
transport in the border area and caused inconvenience to local
people, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Appeal Movement Coordination Council (AMCC),
a Bhutanese refugee group, said that the sit-in was called off
after series of dialogues between the AMCC and the Indian police.
</P>
<P>
He said the Indian police admitted they were wrong in deporting
the refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, a high-ranking Indian police officer denied any
understanding between the refugees and the Indian police, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been staying in Nepal and
India, most of them in eight refugee camps in eastern Nepal, since
they fled Bhutan six years ago due to the "one nation, one people"
policy adopted by the Bhutanese authorities.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Form Commissions to Sue United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Cuba will form commissions to
take the United States to the court of justice so that citizens
who are victims of actions promoted or supported by Washington can
present their claims, the country's top legislator said today.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly
of People's Power, said the commissions will be authorized to
decide the validity of the demands, as well as the responsibility
of the U.S. government in the cases raised by Cuban citizens.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the commissions followed the "Law of
Reaffirmation of Cuban Dignity and Sovereignty," which was
approved by the National Assembly on December 24, as a
countermeasure against the Helms-Burton Act of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly presidency and the Ministry of Justice
have started working on the prompt formation of the commissions,
which will bring together all the claims made by both private
parties and the Cuban government, Ricardo Alarcon said.
</P>
<P>
Under the new Cuban law, any future negotiations on
compensating the U.S. properties nationalized by the Cuban
government will, first of all, have to take into account the
damages inflicted on Cuba by U.S. armed actions, sabotage, trade
embargo, punitive measures and aggressions of all kinds.

BUENOS AIRES, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 7,779 Argentines
were killed in traffic accidents in 1996, with an average of 21
deaths a day, said an advocacy group here today.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Silveiro, president of the group "Let us fight for

He attributed the drop to the mass media's effective campaign
calling for travelers' use of safety belt.

Accidents taking place in the province of Buenos Aires claimed
more victims than in other provinces, with 3,428 people killed in

LIMA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian government has issued
a license for a Mexican commercial carrier to provide passenger,
cargo and mail transport services to and from Peru.
</P>
<P>
The three-year license effective immediately stems from an
earlier agreement between the governments of Peru and Mexico,

</P>
<P>
Under the bilateral agreement, the Peruvian Communications and
Transports Ministry allows Mexicana to fly round trips between
Lima and Cancun, a Mexican resort city, seven times a week.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Mexican airline is also approved to fly twice
a week between Lima and the Argentine capital city of Buenos Aires.

<P>
However, Mexicana is not allowed to offer direct or indirect
air transport services to and from Peru via an unauthorized third

COLOMBO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
have destroyed four more bases of the Tamil rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the jungles of the
Eastern Batticaloa district by Thursday evening, according to
military sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the troops, assisted by the airforce,
Thursday destroyed three bases -- a women's camp, a rebel workshop
and an administration base.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that signs indicated that all the camps had
been abandoned in a hurry as the troops advanced on them.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that on the previous day, government troops
attacked another camp which is a medical base. 14 rebels were
killed and 15 others who were injured fled away.
</P>
<P>
The operation, launched in the early hours of December 31 last
year, involved the movement of hundreds of troops into the Eastern
jungles.
</P>
<P>
So far during the offensive, there had been only two casualties
amongst the government troops, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 13-year guerrilla war for a
separate state in the north and east of the island country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Calls for Movement Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), the country's main opposition, called for a united movement
against the government in a resolution published here today.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that Bangladesh's "public life has been
virtually paralyzed due to the wrong policy, and undemocratic and
fascist behavior of the present government."
</P>
<P>
The BNP and its front organizations held a joint meeting
Thursday and discussed the overall political, economic and law and
order situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The present government has revived its fascist and autocratic
character by unleashing torture and arrest on BNP leaders and
workers and filing false cases against them. Even BNP Chairperson
Begum Khaleda Zia was not spared," said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the opposition party announced a fresh agitation
program to hold demonstrations and rallies on January 5 and 6 in
districts and stage protests in the capital city of Dhaka on
January 7.
</P>
<P>
In early November last year, BNP MPs walked out of the house to
press for the party's 10-point demands, including a "neutral role"
of the speaker and the state-run Bangladesh TV and halting
"repression" on its workers.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the party's willingness to give the parliamentary
democracy a solid foundation by making the house effective, BNP
Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan urged the government to
accept the demands immediately.

The move aims to stimulate the local debt instrument market by

Under the existing law, Thai state enterprises are not allowed

<HEADLINE> Colombia Closes 1996 With High Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Colombia closed 1996
with a 21.63 percent inflation, 4.63 percent over the target set
by the Bank of the Republic board of directors, said the National
Statistics Administrative Department (DANE) today.
</P>
<P>
Two percentage points over 1995, the annual inflation means
that if a Colombian had to make ends meet on 100,000 pesos (about
100 U.S. dollars) in January of 1996, he or she will have to spend
121,630 pesos (some 121.63 dollars) today for the same necessities.
</P>
<P>
However, the last month of 1996 saw a 0.72 percent inflation,
the lowest monthly average in the last 13 years, due to the fall
of the prices of some agricultural products that otherwise could
go up on a seasonal basis in December, DANE said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Overall in 1996, the official report said, the sectors that
contributed most to the increase in the cost of living were house
rent, public services and education.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Colombian government announced that surveillance
over those sectors will be stepped up to prevent price rises
surpassing the 18 percent target set for 1997.

<HEADLINE> Exit from IMF Programs to Top Manila's 1997 Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The exit of the Philippines from
the stringent economic programs imposed by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) will dominate Manila's economic agenda in
1997, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We've been bullishly preparing for this exit because this will
mean the eventual economic liberation and independence of our
country," Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the IMF-approved three-year exit program, the Philippines
will finally get out of the IMF clutches in June 1997, ending more
than two decades of almost uninterrupted recourse to its programs.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the IMF programs contained stringent
conditions that have ensured the country's repayment of foreign
debts but limited its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said the country's exit from the IMF programs has
been propelled largely by its export and investment-led economic
growth, growing international reserves, and greatly improved
fiscal position.
</P>
<P>
According to De Ocampo, the primary task of the government in a
post-IMF era is the establishment of fiscal responsibility and
monetary restraint to ensure the country's capacity to stand on
its own.
</P>
<P>
To secure the fiscal stability, De Ocampo said the government
has to work for the enactment of the three-pronged Comprehensive
Tax Reform Program, which is expected to increase government
revenues by more than 2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's monetary restraint has been enhanced
by the creation of an independent central monetary authority --
the Philippine Central Bank, which has been observing its mandate
to maintain a lower inflation and a stable foreign exchange.

HAVANA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Governor of Puerto Rica,
Pedro Rosello, started his second four-year mandate today
following his re-election in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
Rosello hopes to achieve during his second term the reform of
his country's legislative system which maintains Puerto Rico as a
free United States associated state, the official news agency of
Cuba, Prensa Latina, said today.
</P>
<P>
Rosello, President of the National Progressive Party which
supports statehood, won 130,000 votes, six percent more than his
opponent from the Popular Democratic Party in last year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
A proposal presented by the new governor in 1993 aimed at
turning Puerto Rico into the 51st American Union state was
defeated by a small margin, 48 percent against 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the official strategy includes the possibility of
calling for new consultation on the constitution of the islands in
1998.
</P>
<P>
A Washington bid for a referendum on the matter failed last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A new employment regulation in
north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will give
handicapped people more job opportunities in government
institutions and businesses.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, the regional government put into effect a
regulation which requires that all government institutions and
enterprises provide employment opportunities to the handicapped,
who should make up at least 1.5 percent of the total number of
employees.
</P>
<P>
There are now 964,000 handicapped residents in Inner Mongolia,
accounting for 4.22 percent of its total population; 493,000 are
capable of working.
</P>
<P>
In the past, governments at various levels have started welfare
enterprises and worked out preferential policies to raise the
employment rate of the handicapped. However, 273,000 people are
still without jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulation, handicapped people must be
actively recruited for positions in the government operations.
</P>
<P>
The work units which cannot meet their quota must pay
compensation to the employment agencies for the handicapped, in
accordance with local wage standards. Those violating the
regulation will be fined.
</P>
<P>
"The handicapped enjoy the same right to work as other
citizens, and both government and society have been offering
special aid and protection to the special groups," said Wang
Jinlong, an official with the region's Federation for the
Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
This year, the region will earmark 500,000 yuan to help some
handicapped residents find work. And labor service institutions
will be set up across the region, Wang said.

SOFIA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A 12-year-old boy died and 11
others survived an avalanche today in Bulgaria's southwestern
mountain area.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian News Agency said the avalanche happened at 11
a.m. when 12 skiers were walking at the foot of a mountain. All
the skiers were buried under the snow, including the dead boy,
Stefan Vasiliev.
</P>
<P>
The local government organized a rescue team immediately in
which 60 skiers and volunteers were involved.
</P>

By the noon, 11 skiers had been rescued, one of whom was
injured. Half an hour later, Vasiliev was found too, but because

The report said that an avalanche also occurred in the mountain
area last January and a skiing coach died.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's office property
market will remain dim this year as market supply surpasses
demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the Thai Farmers Research Center, office space
will continue to increase by 800,000 square meters nationwide this
year, although there is already a surplus of 1.5 million square
meters in the country so far.
</P>
<P>
In Bangkok alone, office space this year is expected to rise by
8.8 percent to 6.2 million square meters from 5.7 million square
meters last year.
</P>
<P>
The research center says that most of landlords this year may
opt for no increase in rents or merely 5-10 percent if they have
prime locations.
</P>
<P>
Office rents in Bangkok's business centers currently are
500-600 baht (20-24 US dollars) per square meter per month, while
the rates are 300-500 baht (12-20 dollars) in other key locations
and 250 baht (10 dollars) in the suburbs, it says.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Women Running Greater Risk Of Getting Lung Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Women in China's largest city
of Shanghai who breathe too much smoke produced by cigarettes or
cooking oil run a greater risk of developing lung cancer,
according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
Lung cancer caused by excessive smoke inhalation is a leading
health threat to women in Shanghai, with 999 cases of the disease
reported last year, according to information released by the
Shanghai Cancer Prevention and Control Office.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate of lung cancer among women between the ages
of 40 and 59 has increased rapidly in the past three years. The
number of new cases among women is nearly equal to the figure for
men, who commonly are more at risk of developing lung cancer, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Experts have suggested people use range hoods in their
kitchens, ventilate cooking areas, and avoid frying food -- the
most popular method of preparing Chinese food.
</P>
<P>
Although the city has launched a campaign to ban smoking in
public places from last year, experts continue to urge people to
reduce passive smoking.
</P>
<P>
Cancer prevention and control institutes in Shanghai, Tianjin,
Harbin and Shenyang will jointly carry out a program aiming at
preventing lung cancer in Chinese cities this year, the report
said.

the greatest growth in rice and flour of 16.7 percent, followed by

KUWAIT, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Thomas Muster, angered
by mobile phone users, dropped a set and took more than two hours
to beat Norway's Christian Ruud for a place in the quarter-finals

WUHAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Huangshi, a raw materials producer
on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, in China's Hubei
Province, now has cleaner air as a result of increased
environmental pollution control efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the city, which has a lot of
metallurgical industry because of non-ferrous ore found nearby,
invested 48.29 million yuan (one U.S. dollar equals to 8.3 Chinese
yuan) in dealing with 247 pollution sources from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The city has also adopted measures to prevent new pollution,
and environmental protection has become a must in designs for all
new industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, the city started 57 new projects, with a
total investment of one billion yuan, 55.5 million yuan of which was
spent on building of environmental protection facilities.
</P>
<P>
While increasing environmental pollution awareness, the city
authorities have also encouraged local industries to
turn potential pollution sources into commodities with economic
benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Daye Non-Ferrous Metal Company, for example, recycled the
sulfur dioxide it discharges to produce sulphuric acid, using 95
percent of the former polluter, while the Huangshi Power Plant
turned coal dust into walling materials, with a utilization ratio
of 63 percent.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: ASEAN Has lots of Things to Do </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said Indonesia and Thailand as well as other member countries of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) still have a
lot of things to do to reach its goals.
</P>
<P>
"Like Thailand, Indonesia also sees ASEAN as a pole for the
implementation of our foreign policies. We should therefore
continue to strengthen our relations to reach ASEAN's goal," the
president said in a welcome dinner hosted in honor of Thai Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh at the Merdeka Palace here last
night.
</P>
<P>
He said ASEAN had brought great benefits to Southeast Asia
since its establishment 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The first informal summit of ASEAN which was held in Jakarta in
November, 1996 after the formal summit of the regional grouping in
Bangkok in December, 1995, produced various decisions including
the plan to expand its membership up to 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"The prestigious achievement of ASEAN had further strengthened
our relations in various fields in efforts to create peace,
stability and prosperity in Southeast Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soeharto said, Indonesia and Thailand had for a long
time established close bilateral economic relations.
</P>
<P>
As many as 26 Thai companies are running their business in
Indonesia and 12 Indonesian companies are operating in Thailand,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit arrived here on Thursday for a two-day visit to
Indonesia. this is his first overseas visit since he was appointed
prime minister of a coalition government on December 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto and Chavalit are scheduled to hold formal talks this
morning.

<HEADLINE> Rio Begins Year with Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Three of Rio de Janeiro's
four leading clubs have threatened to boycott this year's state
championship because they don't agree with the rules of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
In a row that has almost become a part of local soccer
tradition, Flamengo, Fluminense and Botafogo said they would walk
out on the tournament unless the Rio de Janeiro federation backed
down on a decision made on Monday to change the rules.
</P>
<P>
"This state championship is financial suicide," said Flamengo
director Michel Assef on Thursday, referring to the new set of
rules. "We will not accept this formula under any circumstances."
</P>
<P>
Originally, the federation had agreed a somewhat strange
formula under which the 12 clubs would take part in the first
stage with the major four -- Flamengo, Fluminense, Botafogo and
Vasco da Gama -- automatically going into the second stage. They
would be joined by the best four of the remaining clubs. The
second stage would then have been contested on a straightforward
round-robin basis.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, approved at a meeting on Monday, the
winners of the first stage will meet the winners of the second
stage in a final which will decide the competition.
</P>
<P>
Under the original option, the first stage would have been
merely academic for the major clubs.
</P>
<P>
But this suited Flamengo, Fluminense and Botafogo, who had
planned to field junior teams and send their first-choice squads
to play in a more lucrative Rio-Sao Paulo tournament and
friendlies around the country.
</P>
<P>
Arguments over the formula of the competition, which varies
from year to year, take place almost annually.
</P>
<P>
The formulas are decided at rowdy meetings which frequently
turn into battles between an alliance of Vasco and the smaller
clubs on one hand and Flamengo, Fluminense and Botafogo on the
other.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the only major country to hold regional
championships, which take place in the first half of the year.
The Brazilian championship itself lasts for just four months.
</P>
<P>
There has been criticism of the system for years, with the
major sides complaining that the regional championships force them
into too many loss-making fixtures against minor sides.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Swimming Coach Predicts Performance in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- "Altough they are young, they
are part of China's best. Let's see how they can do at the World
Cup meet here," Deputy Head Coach Zhang Xiong of the Chinese
national swimming team said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told reporters after the Chinese arrived at the Kai Tak
airport this afternoon for the coming Epson Swimming World Cup
Hong Kong '97, the opening leg of this year's eight-leg World Cup
short course swimming series.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 13-swimmer team are teenagers, among whom were such
Olympians as female swimmers Nian Yun, 14, and Chen Yan, 17.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the main purpose of his team here is to have
the younger ones tested for getting mature. He admitted that it's
hard for some of the national team's veteran members to hang on
till the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We have to get ourselves ready as early as possible for the
Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the national team's elite members are to be sent to the
six European stops of the series in such cities as Espoo of
Finland, Malmo of Sweden and Paris.
</P>
<P>
As for the national swimming team, the Eight National Games
slated for October in Shanghai is the number one event on the
year's calendar. "We have to arrange our training and
competitions with priority left on the Games," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also said that some of the current team here would be
part of an elite task force which sets its sight on Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the performance by a relatively young side at last
summer's Olymoic Games in Atlanta, Zhang said that the swimmers
did what they could, although short of somwhat too high an
expectation from home.
</P>
<P>
With only three of the 21 Olympic swimers being from the last
Olympics, Zhang said it was almost impossible for them to achieve
what Chinese swimmers had at Barclona.
</P>
<P>
The current younng swimmers are realy doing well, both through
international competitions," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"That's the only way to get mature," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Hong Kong meet starts on Saturday. A
record-setting entry of 28 teams is to be fielded, according to
the organizers.

WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department on
Thursday declined to comment on two U.S. diplomats who have been
reported to leave India quietly as a result of links with an
Indian intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
told reporters: "I really have not much to give you on that,
except to say that, from what I understand, this is an internal

India's newspaper Hindustan Times reported on Thursday that
Indian would ask two U.S. diplomats to leave after an Indian
intelligence official was accused of having unauthorized links

Department "may have some information, but we're not willing to
share it" with others.

WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Four letter bombs were found
today in the offices of an Arabic newspaper in Washington by the
Saudi royal family.
</P>
<P>
Two bombs were found in the morning and two others discovered
late in the day in the National Press Building, which houses the
London-based Al-Hayat newspaper, numerous other media offices and
a shopping mall, leading to two evacuations.
</P>
<P>
Two of the devices were detonated and the other two were
disarmed in order to preserve evidence.
</P>
<P>
The building, located two blocks east of the White House, was
first evacuated after an employee at the newspaper partially
opened a letter and suspected that it was a letter bomb. Police
found a second suspicious letter when they searched the
newspaper's mail.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns against Syrian Charges on Israel over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- the United States on Thursday
cautioned Syria against unsubstantialed accusations of Israeli
agents for a bomb attack in Damascus earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Syria blamed Israel's secret service for a
bus bombing in Damascus on the New Year's Eve, that killed nine
people and injured 44.
</P>
<P>
Syria issued an statement following the Bus blast, saying:
"Mossad agents took the opportunity of preparations for
celebrating the new year and the gathering of people... and put a
bomb inside a bus, which exploded shortly after the bus began
moving...."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian Arab News Agency accused the Mossad, the Israeli
intelligence service, of setting off the explosion, saying: "this
terrorist, criminal, cowardly act comes amid the escalation of
Israeli threats by a number of Israeli officials lately aiming to
kill the peace process."
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns, in answering
reporters' questions on the incident, said: "It is a very serious
charge for one state to accuse another of actually sponsoring
bombings in its capital."
</P>
<P>
"If the Syrian government and the Syrian press cannot back up
what they are saying, well they ought not to make that charge.
It's a wild and irresponsible charge if in fact it is not backed
up by evidence," he added.

<HEADLINE> Dow Avoids Steep Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 2, (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average avoided another steep drop at the first trading session of
1997 today under a late round of buying spree.
</P>
<P>
But most stock measures suffered sizable losses after another
unexpectedly strong economic reading heightened worries about
inflation and sent interest rates soaring in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow lost 5.78 to 6,442.49, having bounced back from an
88-point deficit over the last 30 minutes. The blue-chip barometer
slid more than 95 points in the morning after a surprisingly
robust report on the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE volume totaled 461.03 million
shares, more than 395.21 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 3.75 to 736.99, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 2.77 to 389.53.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.33 to 1,280.70, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.18 to 569.16.
</P>
<P>
Dow plunged 101 points at its year-end sell-off on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported a
strong manufacturing economy and also a jump in costs for
manufacturing supplies.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond jumped as high as 6.76 percent, up from late Tuesday's 6.64
percent. By late afternoon, the yield stood at 6.74 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the Labor Department reported today that first time claims
for unemployment benefits rose to the highest level since summer.
And early reports from major retailers show that the Christmas
shopping season wasn't as strong as many had expected.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Extends U.S. Sanctions on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Thursday extended U.S. sanctions on Libya on the ground of what
he said was the crisis between the United States and Libya not
being resolved.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in a letter to Congress that he was continuing the
sanctions, first imposed by former President Ronald Reagan in
1986, because "the crisis between the United States and Libya...
has not been resolved."
</P>
<P>
"The government of Libya has continued its action and policies
in support of terrorism, despite the calls by the United Nations
Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton took the action before the sanctions would have expired
on January 7.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Libya executed six senior officers and two
civilians, sentenced to death by the Supreme Military Court on
charges that they had used equipment supplied by the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) to spy for the United States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials dismissed the trial as a propaganda ploy.
</P>
<P>
"They look like a propaganda ploy for internal consumption,"
one official said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns just asked
journalists not to believe everything Libya has said.
</P>
<P>
"We would not believe everything that they've saying in
public," he said, complaining that Libya has always used the
United States as "a convenient scapegoat."

<P>
BELGRADE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The ice on roads and streets in
Yugoslavia on Thursday took two lives and left many people with
serious fractures and other injuries.
</P>
<P>
Milijan Maric, 34, and Zoran Blagojevic, 32, were killed when
their tractor overturned due to ice and deep snow in the village
of Gornji Branetici on Mount Suvobor in western Serbia, Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
About 30 people with serious fractures and concussions sought
medical help in Belgrade in the morning hours alone, head of the
emergency ward at the Banjica Orthopedic-surgical Hospital, Prof.
Milenko Stevanovic, said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow covered most of Yugoslavia on the New Year's eve,
forcing many people to stay at home. Ice rain on Wednesday and
early Thursday made traffic even worse.
</P>
<P>
The situation was no better in the Banat and Backa regions in
Serbia's northern province of Vojvodina, which were hit by ice
rain in the afternoon, leaving many injured, Tanjug added.
</P>
<P>
Floating ice covers 40 percent of the Danube river at the city
of Novi Sad, the capital city of Vojvodina, but did not affect the
navigation on the river.
</P>
<P>
Snow and ice on roads have slowed down the traffic across
Yugoslavia and made winter gear a must on roads in high parts.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Seize Unregistered Muslim Army Munitions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led Stabilization
Force (SFOR) said Thursday it would confiscate tank ammunition
donated to the Muslim-Croat Federation Army within a U.S. military
aid program because the ammunition had not been properly
registered.
</P>
<P>
SFOR spokesman Tony White said SFOR troops discovered in a
storage site early this week 474 tank rounds which the Federation
army did not register, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The tank rounds were found in the storage site in Koracina, 10
km northwest of Livno in western Bosnia, which was under SFOR's
British command, White said.
</P>
<P>
The 105 mm tank ammunition was delivered to the Federation last
month within the U.S.-sponsored train and equip program that aims
to bolster the Federation army.
</P>
<P>
SFOR troops in Bosnia strictly enforce peacetime rules which
require rival armies to fully register all weapons or ammunition
stored at designated depots, White said.
</P>
<P>
"If it's existing equipment or received through train and equip
(program) it doesn't make any difference," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A Sarajevo spokesman for the train and equip program said
11,000 tank rounds for 45 U.S. tanks had been shipped to the
Federation and placed in storage sites.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Reiterates Plan to Pay U.N. Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
restated its plan to pay off its 1.3 billion U.S. dollars of debt
to the United Nations, but stressed its expectation for further
U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The United States government, the Clinton administration,
wants to pay off our debt to the United Nations," said State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns at a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"None of us feel that it's appropriate for a power like the
United States to be, in effect, a deadbeat donor at the United
Nations," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Burns took the opportunity to congratulate new U.N.
Secretary-General Koffi Annan on assuming his responsibilities and
said "the United States thinks very highly of him."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Burns said, "We expect from Secretary-General Koffi
Annan's leadership a resurgent effort and vigorous effort to slim
the United Nations, to make it more focused and more effective and
less bloated."
</P>
<P>
He said that his country will support further U.N. reforms.
"And as long as that continues, there's every reason for the
Congress and the executive branch here in our government to agree
that the necessary money should be appropriated to pay off that
debt," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
On the sum of the debt, Burns said that there must be some
controversy about whether it was 1.3 billion U.S. dollars or 1.5
billion U.S. dollars. But he said the figure should be around 1.3
billion dollars.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Koffi Annan, the new U.N.
secretary-general, began his first day of work on Thursday and
immediately pledged to reform the world body.
</P>
<P>
At the same time Annan, who was greeted by an honor of guard of
U.N. police and a cheering crowd, said he expected member states
to honor their commitments to the world organization.
</P>
<P>
"This is my first day. It is like the first day in school.
Everyone expects a lot from you and you get into it with
considerable trepidation," he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
"But there is a lot to do. There is a lot good will. And we
have a lot of dedicated staff and member states have made it clear
that they want changes and they have given us unanimous support."
</P>
<P>
"And I think together we can achieve a lot, bring about the
reforms that are necessary, encourage the member states to work
together, to honor their commitment to the organization and
together work for changes that are required if we are to make the
United Nations as relevant as it ought to be as we move into the
21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The gray-bearded soft-spoken Annan, who was the
undersecretary-general for peacekeeping operations, is the seventh
U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
He is also the first from sub-Saharan Africa and the first to
have risen through the ranks of the U.N. bureaucracy. He succeeds
the 74-year-old Boutros-Ghali of Egypt, who left for his home on
Tuesday and intends to live in France for several months to write

WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people were
killed in Oregon and Washington and damages worth hundreds of
millions of dollars were reported in five states in Northwest U.S.

</P>
<P>
More than 40 counties in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho
and Nevada have been declared disaster areas because of damage

</P>
<P>
In Napa, California, the Napa River rose to more than a meter
