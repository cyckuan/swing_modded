<HEADLINE> 25 Injured in Police-Traders Clash in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 25 people were injured as
angry traders, protesting against the government's plan to expand
tax net, Wednesday clashed with riot police in Rawalpindi, twin
city of Islamabad, a local trader said.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested several dozens of traders during the five-hour
protest at the center of the city, according to Hanif Abbasi,
chairman of a local trader organization, Tajir Action Committee.
</P>
<P>
Police fired tear gas and used batons to disperse the
procession of around 2,000 traders, Abbasi said.
</P>
<P>
The clash started when some demonstrators pelted stone at
several shops which were open in Raja Bazzar, a downtown market.
</P>
<P>
The traders also burnt tires and threw stones at the police,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The protest took place after the longest strike of traders last
month against the tax survey by the military government which
intended to bring more businessmen under the tax net through the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Though the government has started collecting the survey forms,
traders are still divided over the new procedure. Traders in
Multan of Punjab province and Peshawar of Northwest Frontier
Province had also clashed with the police.
</P>
<P>
Despite the protest, the government is determined to go ahead
with its plan to expand the tax net. According to the Central
Board of Revenue, over 400,000 tax survey forms have been
distributed, of which roughly 90,000 have been collected.

<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The presidents from
China, Tajikistan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan on Wednesday
vowed to defend sovereignty under the Charter of the United
Nations and not to interfere in others' internal affairs under the
pretext of "humanitarianism" or "human rights."
</P>
<P>
They made the remarks in a joint statement inked at their one-

<P>
The statement stressed that every state has the right to choose
its own political system, economic model and path of social

other to safeguard their state sovereignty, independence,
territorial integrity and social stability.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the five countries promised to scrupulously

<HEADLINE> "Shanghai Five" Nations Stress Unconditional Respect for ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUSHANBE, Tajikistan, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The "Shanghai Five"
nations reiterated here Wednesday that the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) treaty must be unconditionally maintained and
strictly respected.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after the annual "Shanghai Five"
summit, China, Tajikistan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan
stressed that the ABM treaty, which forbids any deployment of
national missile defense system (NMD), plays as the cornerstone of
global strategic stability and basis of further cut of strategic
offensive weapons.
</P>
<P>
The five nations agreed that the Asia-Pacific region will see
its stability and security destroyed by an eventual deployment of
the theater missile defense (TMD) system, which will lead to an
escalation of arms race.
</P>
<P>
Every member of the "Shanghai Five" said it supports China with
regard to its opposition to any nation's attempt to build a TMD
system with Taiwan as part of it.
</P>
<P>
The United States recently proposed to adapt the ABM treaty to
permit deployment of NMD and TMD. Arms control experts said the U.
S. plan runs against the trend of the times and will have a major
adverse impact on global and regional strategic balance and
stability.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, the "Shanghai Five" nations also expressed
support to endow the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons with an authentic universality.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed 30 years ago, is time-tested as an effective
tool to hold back the menacing nuclear proliferation and has
actually reduced the danger of nuclear conflicts, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
All five nations expressed support for Uzebekistan's proposal
to build central Asian non-nuclear zone, saying that it accords
with the principles of existent documents.

<HEADLINE> Ottey Hopes to Run faster than ever in Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey,
who was cleared to run on Monday after failing a drugs test,
Wednesday said she hoped to run faster than ever at this year's
Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Ljubljana, Ottey said: "I have not
been competing for a year and I do not know what to expect. But I
hope to run faster than ever, below my personal best of 10.74
seconds."
</P>
<P>
40-year-old Ottey has been competing at the highest level for
two decades and won two silver medals in the sprints at the 1996
Atlanta Games. Sydney will mark her last major competition.
</P>
<P>
Ottey was banned after testing positive for the controversial
steroid nandrolone last July.
</P>
<P>
She denied ever knowingly taking the drug and an International
Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) arbitration panel ruled on
Monday that "there were not the grounds to maintain her suspension
from competition", ending it with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
Ottey will compete in the Jamaican Olympic trials on July 21
and 22.
</P>
<P>
She is presently training with her Slovenian coach Srdjan
Djordjevic in Ljubljana.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Stealing Peacekeeping Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has denied peculating money
paid to it by the UN for the allowance of its soldiers taking part
in the UN Mission in Sierra Leone, saying the money was "very much
intact".
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria Wednesday quoted the country's Chief
of Army Staff Victor Malu as saying that the money disbursed to
the country's 3,229 peacekeeping soldiers had not been paid to
them as payment modalities were still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
Speaking late on Tuesday at a press conference in Lagos, Malu
said that the 7.5 million U.S. dollars, which was paid in three
instalments, fell short of the 18 million dollars due to the
country from the UN, adding that an outstanding amount of more
than 10 million dollars was still expected.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of Army Staff said the change-over from the West
African Peace Keeping Force, called ECOMOG, to the UN mission
necessitated a change in the allowance paid to the Nigerians,
hence the need to work out new modalities for payment.
</P>
<P>
He explained that while the soldiers were paid five dollars per
day under ECOMOG, they were entitled to 30 dollars per day under
the UN mission.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that Nigeria could not afford to pay 30
dollars, but would pay 20 dollars to its troops so as not to
jeopardize discipline among them.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's contingent to UNAMSIL is made up of four battalions,
a tank company and headquarters staff.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Keep Stance on Migration Dialog with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's government said Thursday it'
ll keep unchanged its stance on migration talks with the United
States, whose last round should have taken place in New York at
the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Aymee Hernandez said that
both countries will return to talks on matters such as the Cuban
Adjustment Act, which grants automatic residence to Cubans
arriving on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez also mentioned among these discrepancies human
contraband that's promoted from the United States by Florida radio
stations that promote illegal immigration on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and the United States, which have no diplomatic relations,
signed in 1994 and ratified in 1995 an accord to regulate, order
and legalize migratory flux toward American land.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 and 1995 immigration accords, 20,000 Cubans are
allowed to immigrate to the United States legally.
</P>
<P>
In line with those accords, Cubans trying to enter the United
States illegally who are intercepted at sea must be returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
But unlike other illegal immigrants, Cubans who manage to evade
the Coast Guard and reach U.S. shores are allowed to seek legal
residency and work permits under a U.S. law passed in 1966.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council Urges Afghan Parties to Resume Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council Thursday urged the warring parties in Afghanistan,
particular the Taliban, to resume negotiations under United
Nations auspices without further delay and any preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The move came when the 15-member Security Council was briefed
by Under-Secretary-General Kieran Prendergast on the latest
situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed concern at the resumption of
major hostilities on July 1, 2000 and warned the parties not to
undertake new attempts to pursue a military solution to the
conflict in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council reiterated its call to all Afghan parties
to work together for peace and the establishment of a broad-based,
multiethnic and fully representative government.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its serious concern about the plight of
the Afghan people suffering from the continuing war, including
summary executions of prisoners and shelling of civilian populated
areas, which adds to the severe humanitarian situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Council insists that all parties take responsibility for
the safety and the security of the civilian population and of
humanitarian personnel in areas of Afghanistan under their control
as well as in areas of conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Council also expressed its concern at the restrictions
imposed on the work of humanitarian organizations and urged all
parties to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to all
those in need.
</P>
<P>
The Council reiterated its serious concern at the continuing
use of the Afghan territory, especially under control of the
Taliban, for the support to the international terrorist activities
and production and trafficking of illicit drug, as well as serious
violations of human rights, in particular, those of women and
girls.
</P>
<P>
The Council reiterated that continuing disregard by the
Taliban of the demands made in relevant U.N. resolutions was
totally unacceptable and confirmed its determination to ensure
full compliance by the Taliban without conditions with its
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan and a
north-based opposition alliance resisting it holds the remaining
10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Industrial Producer Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The euro zone industrial producer
price index was 0.8 percent higher in May compared to April,
European Union (EU) statistical office, Eurostat, reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The index had edged up by 0.1 percent in April. The 0.8 percent
increase was the highest since July 1999.
</P>
<P>
The May increase stems from the intermediate goods sector which
advanced 1.2 percent in the euro zone. The 11 euro zone countries
are Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland. Britain, Sweden,
Denmark and Greece are now outside the euro area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prices in the whole EU region (EU) were
unchanged in April and increased 0.7 percent in May. The rise was
also the highest since July 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the Eurostat, France and Finland recorded both an
increase of 1.3 percent in May and prices were 0.9 percent higher
in both Italy and the Netherlands. Producer Prices in Spain (0.4
percent) and Germany (0.6 percent) advanced less than the 15-
nation EU average and the index was unchanged in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The available data shows that producer prices continued to
increase on an annual basis. They were up by 6.5 percent in the
euro zone and 5.7 percent in EU compared to May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The rise in April had been 5.8 percent in the euro zone and 5.1
percent in the EU. The increase stems again mainly from the
intermediate goods sector, where the index was 10.9 percent and 9.
9 percent higher in the euro zone and in the EU15 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The index shows changes in capital goods and durable consumer
goods were below one percent. The index for non-durable consumer
goods was 1.4 percent higher in the euro zone and 1.3 percent in
the EU15.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Board Concludes Pilot Error Caused Kennedy Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a final report issued Thursday on last year's July 19 crash
of the aircraft near Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State, the
United States,the NTSB said Kennedy, son of the late U.S.
president, had become disorientated during a descent over water at
night.
</P>
<P>
Killed were Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33,
and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
The crash probably occurred because of "the pilot's failure to
maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at
night," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's piloting difficulties were likely to have been caused
by "spatial disorientation," a problem when pilots lose track of
the position and motion of their plane relative to the earth's
surface, it added.
</P>
<P>
This type of disorientation is one of the leading causes of
fatal aircraft accidents, according to a U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration report.
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they could not find any mechanical problems
with Kennedy's Piper Saratoga II, and autopsies on all three
victims found no abnormalities.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia PM Hails Performance in Last Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government has
done a good job during the just-ending fiscal year, Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a report presented to the 24th regular meeting of the
Council of Peoples' Representatives, Meles said his cabinet has
successfully accomplished the three set tasks, namely the defense
of the country's sovereignty, fighting the drought and holding
national elections.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the restoration of the country's
sovereignty has led to a stage where border demarcation is about
to start based on international law and border treaties.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of Ethiopian sovereignty refers to the latest
round of its border conflict with Eritrea in May, during which
Ethiopia claimed to have recaptured all its territories occupied
since May 1998.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the drought situation, Meles said the natural
disaster has caused great losses to human lives in spite of
concerted efforts made at all levels alongside the national
defense effort.
</P>
<P>
Meles said that real casualties have been considerably reduced
as a result of the prompt action taken by the Ethiopian government
to purchase food from domestic markets for distribution among
drought victims.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the international community had not provided
 satisfactory response to appeal for humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that as the people volunteered to carry
the burden of the war, no problem had occurred in inflationary
trends or in fluctuation of foreign currency market. As to the
May 14 national elections, Meles said the elections was carried
out successfully in all parts of the country with the exception of
the re-election held in the Southern Nations, Nationalities and
Peoples State due to some electoral irregularities.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Elders to Burden African Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Social security schemes in
sub-Saharan African countries stand to face a heavy burden between
now and the year 2020 when the proportion of elderly population in
the region is expected to double.
</P>
<P>
Eyitayo Lambo, managing director of the International
Management and Health Consultants, sounded the warning here
Thursday when speaking at a meeting of directors of social
security organizations in English-speaking Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said demographic trends have very important repercussions on
social security schemes and that an increase in aged population,
which in the past was not considered a major task for Africa, is
becoming an issue of concern.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the problems could be solved through
increasing the revenues into the systems by generating additional
revenue through the extension of coverage and increasing taxable
earnings under social security.
</P>
<P>
Social security's costs are driven by demographic and economic
trends that influence the relative size of the worker and
beneficiary populations and the average benefit payment.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, given the demographic projections, it is
clear that social security administrators should be wary of the
impact of the demographic changes on the financing of social
security schemes.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the major demographic changes and projections in
the sub- Saharan region as higher fertility rate, increased infant
mortality and adult mortality rates, a drastic drop of life
expectancy at birth in countries hardest hit by HIV/AIDS and a
remarkable increase in life expectancy among the aged population.

</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abu Zeid, speaking to reporters, said that during his

<HEADLINE> Iraq Earns Over 1 Bln Dlrs In June Through Oil-For-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq earned some 282 million
U.S. dollars in the last week of June from exporting over 10
million barrels of oil, the figures of the United Nations Office
of the Iraq Program said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Since the program's current six-month period, or "Phase VIII,"
began on June 9, Iraq has earned an estimated 1.068 billion
dollars, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Overall, since the program began in December 1996, Iraq has
exported more than 1.871 billion barrels of oil valued at more
than 30 billion dollars, according to the office.
</P>
<P>
Equipment for the oil industry and humanitarian supplies,
including almost 82,000 tons of wheat, as well as infant formula
and school furniture, continued to arrive normally through the
three land border points and the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr, the
office said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The oil-for-food program began to be implemented in late
1996, aiming to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people caused by
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannot be lifted until the United Nations
notifies that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction. U.N. arms inspectors have not returned to the country
since the U.S-led military strikes in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Office of the Iraq Program administers the U.
N. humanitarian program known as oil-for-food.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
provide 20 million euro humanitarian aid for victims of conflict
in Congo, the European Commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> WWF Book Reveals Root Causes of Biodiversity Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
released Thursday a wake-up-call book, "Root Causes of
Biodiversity Loss," the first study ever to provide a
comprehensive overview of the driving forces behind the loss of
biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
Based on case studies conducted in Brazil, Cameroon, China,
Danube Basin, India, Mexico, Pakistan, the Philippines, Tanzania
and Vietnam, the book developed an analytical approach to
understanding the root causes of biodiversity loss and applied it
to varying situations and countries.
</P>
<P>
The study identified the root causes of biodiversity loss as
being factors such as population growth, poverty, international
trade, macroeconomic policies and poor environmental law or weak
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
As the book observed, the world is losing species and
biodiversity at a rate unprecedented in history. The causes go
deep, and the losses are driven by a complex array of social,
economic, political and biological factors at different levels.
Immediate causes, such as over-harvesting, pollution and habitat
change, have been well studied. But the socioeconomic factors
driving people to degrade their environment are less well
understood.
</P>
<P>
The book, published by Earthscan, examined the underlying
causes. It provided analyses of the 10 case studies around the
world and integrated them into a new and interdisciplinary
framework for understanding what is happening.
</P>
<P>
From these results, Alexander Wood, Pamela Stedman-Edwards and
Johanna Mang, editors of the book, were able to derive policy
conclusions and recommendations for operational and institutional
approaches to address the root causes and reverse the current
trends.
</P>
<P>
While releasing the book, WWF, the conservation organization,
warned governments and international organizations that action at
local level is not enough to prevent biodiversity loss, and called
on them to take into account the global forces behind
environmental degradation when designing development policies.

<HEADLINE> U.N., Cambodia End Talks on Khmer Rouge Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations said
Thursday that the talks between the U.N. and Cambodia on the trial
of former Khmer Rouge leaders had concluded.
</P>
<P>
The talks were conducted between Hans Corell, U.N. legal
counsel, and Sok An, Cambodia's chief negotiator and chairman of
the Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the U.N. spokesman's office said Hans
Corell had completed formal discussions with the Royal Government
of Cambodia on the establishment of a tribunal to try Khmer Rouge
leaders early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal envisaged would be a Cambodian court with the
participation of international judges and prosecutors, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Because the outstanding substantive issues were resolved by the
U.N. secretary-general and the Cambodian prime minister, the
discussions focused on technical issues involved in forming the
tribunal, and were frank and comprehensive, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Corell provided his Cambodian counterpart, Sok An, with a draft
Memorandum of Understanding that would govern the relationship
between Cambodia and the United Nations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Memorandum of the Understanding would be singed by the
United Nations and Cambodia after the Cambodian parliament passes
legislation that is in keeping with the understanding between the
parties, it said.
</P>
<P>
As Corell and Sok An agreed at a post meeting press conference,
the responsibility for moving the process toward completion now
lies squarely with the government of Cambodia, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations ended after four rounds of talks since the U.N.
team arrived in Cambodia Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Corell had five rounds of talks in Phnom Penh in March, leaving
then without resolving conflicts over the right of a foreign
prosecutor to indict suspects.
</P>
<P>
That hurdle was worked out between U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen before Corell and his
team returned to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been involved in getting a trial set up
since 1997.

Papandreou Thursday discussed with U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State for European Affairs James Dobins the latest developments in
Cyprus, the Greek-Turkish relations and the EU-Turkish ties as
well as issues concerning the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their two-hour talks, Dobins, who arrived here
from Turkey for a working visit, voiced satisfaction over his
talks with Papandreou, who also described the talks as "very
constructive."
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the U.S. was cooperating very closely with
Greece in the Balkan region, Dobins said that Greece, the only EU
member state in the region, had a particularly important role in
the area.
</P>
<P>
He praised Greece for its very important role in the
restoration of peace in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which also contributed to stability in the Balkans
through the Stability Pact, was a model for the rest of Balkan
countries that desired to join the EU, the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Dobins is expected to meet with Greek
Public Order Minister Michalis Chrysochoidis, who will visit the U.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Meets Italian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met here
Thursday with Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato and they
exchanged views on bilateral relations and international issues of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
Amato told Zhu that the Italian-Chinese relations have been
developing smoothly and the people of the two countries have all
along cherished friendly feelings toward each other.
</P>
<P>
Italy highly values China's status as a big power and the
positive role it plays in international affairs, Amato said,
noting that the two countries hold identical or similar views on a
series of major issues.
</P>
<P>
Amato reiterated that Italy will continue sticking to the one-
China policy.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who arrived here Wednesday on an official visit, gave a
positive evaluation on bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said Sino-Italian relations have been developing soundly
since the establishment of diplomatic ties three decades ago and
there are no difficult problems.
</P>
<P>
China and Italy share broad common interests on major issues
concerning world peace and development and the two sides have had
excellent cooperation in international affairs, especially in U.N.
organizations, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Italian government for sticking to the one-China
policy and for its support for China's speedy accession into the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also expressed appreciation for Italy's championship of
dialogue and objection to confrontation on the issue of human
rights, where the two sides have differences.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Italian economic and trade relations, Zhu said
bilateral trade volume has shown a positive momentum of
development over recent years. Italian investment in China has
been increasing year by year and Italy has become China's second
largest partner in scientific and technological cooperation in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also praised the effective cooperation in agriculture,
culture and the protection of historical relics between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Amato expressed his agreement with Zhu's views, adding that
Italy's small and medium-sized enterprises are highly developed
and these enterprises have great interest in participating in
Chinese economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The two sides should work together to promote to a new level
their economic and trade cooperation, which has bright vistas,
Amato said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that the Chinese government attaches great
importance to the relations with Italy and to Italy's important
role in the European Union and in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government is willing to work together with
the Italian side to move bilateral relations to a new high.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to further increase their exchanges
and step up understanding, to strengthen consultations and
cooperation in international affairs, including at the United
Nations and other international organizations, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China and Italy have also agreed to broaden the channels for
economic and trade cooperation and to promote interactions between
the small and medium-sized enterprises of the two countries, the
Chinese premier added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu's meeting with Amato was proceeded by a warm welcoming
ceremony. The two prime ministers answered reporters' questions
after their talks.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also met with Fawzi Hemad Al-Sultan,
president of the World Food Program, and Catherine Bertini,
executive director of the International Fund for Agriculture
Development.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed China's thanks to the World Food Program and the
International Fund for Agriculture Development for the help they
rendered China for the past 20 years. Zhu said the Chinese
government will continue to support the two world institutions and
is willing to explore new aspects of cooperation with them.
</P>
<P>
Bertini and Al-Sultan expressed their satisfaction over their
projects in China. They said that China's outstanding performance
in implementing cooperation projects with the two institutions has
not only provided successful experience for other countries, but
also enhanced the determination of international institutions in
wiping out poverty in the world. They told Zhu that they will
continue their cooperation with the Chinese government and
contribute to the comprehensive development of China's agriculture
and the wipe-out of poverty in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier also met with leaders of the Italy-China
Association for Economic and Cultural Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived here Wednesday on an official visit to Italy, the
fifth leg of his current tour of six European nations and the
headquarters of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Before Italy, the Chinese premier had visited Bulgaria, Germany,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands. He is scheduled to wrap up his
Italy tour Sunday and travel on to Brussels on an official visit
to Belgium and the EU headquarters based there.

<HEADLINE> Air Pollution Causes as Many Deaths As Road Accidents in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll through air
pollution was comparable to that for road accidents in Greece, the
Greenpeace said in a report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current situation in Greece as not tolerable,
the Greek bureau of the environmental organization said that it
estimated the social costs at 548 million drachmas (about 1.6
million U.S. dollars) in the short term and 2,096 billion drachmas
(about 595 million dollars) in the long term.
</P>
<P>
Attributing air pollution mainly to cars, the Greenpeace
called for measures be taken to deal with this problem, such as
the increasing use of non-pollution trams, railways and renewable
energy sources as well as the protection and development of
forests around cities.
</P>
<P>
Greece is the only EU member state in which the number of road
accidents is steadily increasing instead of decreasing.
</P>
<P>
Greece's traffic accident rate is among the highest in the 15-
member EU countries, with nearly 3,000 people killed and 30,000
others injured annually in accidents.

<HEADLINE> Gore Promises to Spend Billions of Dollars to Help Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Thursday promised to spend billions of dollars to shore up the
Medicare system as his "progress and prosperity" tour is going to
end this week.
</P>
<P>
In a campaign stop in Chicago, the Democratic vice president
told senior citizens that he will spend a total of 339 billion
dollars over 10 years to prop up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
He has offered a 75 billion dollar plan to extend the Medicare
Trust Fund until 2030, and a 255 billion dollar plan to add a
prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
Gore criticized the spending proposals of Republican
presidential contender George W. Bush, saying his rival offered
even "not one dime" on the Medicare system.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Bush of wanting to bury the budget surplus with giant
tax cuts and new spending plans, Gore said Bush's plans raise
questions about the future of health care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
"If Medicare is important to you, these questions are something
you should know the answer to," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to fight for you, I want to fight for people, not the
powerful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore said the issue of money for Medicare is crucial because
the 39 million people currently eligible will grow quickly to 81
million.

<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Thursday called on the French population to vote for the
shortening of the seven-year presidential term to five years in a
referendum to be held on September 24.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction of seven years to five years of the presidential
mandate will give our country a better democratic respiration," he
said in a statement broadcast on radio and television.
</P>
<P>
"A five-year term will let people participate more often --
personally and directly -- in public debate. In an epoch marked by
the profound and rapid changes everywhere, in France, in Europe
and in the world, it will adapt our institutions to the rhythms of
our time," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac first announced the plan to shorten the presidential
term one month ago after most of France's political parties and
public opinions approved such an amendment of the Constitution of
the 5th Republic drafted under General de Gaulle in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The French parliament has also approved the government draft
law on the reform.

<HEADLINE> Blair's Son Arrested for Being "Drunk and Incapable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair's
16-year-old son Euan was arrested for being "drunk and incapable,"
the prime minister's office said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The teenager, who was celebrating the end of his school exams,
was found by police officers in Leicester Square, in London's West
End, Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
An ambulance had to be called after Euan was discovered
vomiting on the pavement, but paramedics decided there was no need
for the teenager to go to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he was taken to Charing Cross police station where he
initially gave his name as Euan John, gave an old address and told
officers he was 18.
</P>
<P>
He was then searched and his true identity discovered.
</P>
<P>
Special Branch officers sent to the station confirmed he was
Blair's oldest son, and he was released without charge and driven
home in the early hours of Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister had been up late writing a speech on
opportunity and responsibility when he was told the news.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about family and community values at a Faith in the
Future conference in Brighton Thursday, Blair referred to the
incident.
</P>
<P>
"The values that you represent are the values I hope that we
all share -- respect, tolerance, the family, trying to bring up
children properly," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Being a prime minister can be a tough job, being a parent is
probably tougher, and sometimes you don't always succeed. But the
family to me is more important than anything else."
</P>
<P>
He told his audience he had turned for comfort to a poem by
Longfellow and quoted the lines, "For thine own purpose, thou has
sent. The strife and the discouragement."
</P>
<P>
The Blairs will have to return to the police station with their
son at a later date, when Euan could face a formal warning or a
caution.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street issued a statement saying Euan was "very sorry."
</P>
<P>
"He is in no doubt of the seriousness of it and the view that
his parents take of it. They will of course fully cooperate with
any further action the police propose to take," it added.
</P>
<P>
The incident comes two and a half years after Home Secretary
Jack Straw's teenage son William was cautioned after being caught
selling cannabis to a tabloid newspaper reporter.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Criticizes Foreign Interference in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The newly concluded parliamentary
election was not only a fight between the ruling party and local
opposition parties but also with foreign enemies, said Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing members of the Political Bureau and new Members of
Parliament of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (ZANU-PF), Mugabe said the greatest opposition during the
June 24-25 election was that of Britain.
</P>
<P>
"We were not dealing with a local enemy, but a foreign one," he
said, noting that "the totality of the weaponry of the British,
all newspapers, all televisions, all of them were mobilized to
fight us."
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the British sought support from
Europe and America for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to
beat ZANU-PF.
</P>
<P>
MDC was a mere shadow or agency of greater opposition from
Britain and it was a mammoth task for ZANU-PF to win in these
circumstances, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To have achieved a historic victory, this must go down as a
very precious win," he told the parliamentarians, stressing that
this "natural act of success" has saved the party from extinction.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that his party had not done well
partly because membership at the grassroots was not cohesive and
the party had to appeal to traditional leaders to win support in
areas where structures were disorganized.
</P>
<P>
He urged party members to understand the party's strengths and
weaknesses so that they could build on them to overcome problems.
</P>
<P>
In the country's fifth parliamentary election, ZANU-PF won 62
of the 120 contested seats while MDC gained 57 and ZANU (Ndonga)
one.

<P>
Describing the 26-year civil war between the government troops
and the rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) as "so long and so painful", Hain said that the world will
not continue to tolerate rebel leader Jonas Savimbi's lies and
obstructions.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA should have its voice heard through the votes in
ballot boxes but not the gun barrels, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain is committed to the implementation of the U.N.
 sanctions against UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
"We want to impede them from selling diamonds and block their
supplies of fuel and munitions until they are obliged to lay down
their arms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hain is currently in Angola for a two-day visit. He has met
with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Foreign
Minister Joao Miranda.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Thursday reiterated that he will not include members of the
opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) in the new
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Addressing members of the Political Bureau and new Members of

He urged the new ZANU-PF lawmakers to put across their
criticism in a constructive manner and not to lose sight of whom
they are representing when going to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He also reminded them to keep in mind the ideologies of the
party to which they belong.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe's fifth parliamentary election, ZANU-PF won 62 of

<HEADLINE> Disasters Blamed for Worsening Poverty in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chancellor of Africa University
Rukudzo Murapa Thursday blamed both man-made and natural
disasters for worsening poverty and suffering of people in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a two-week workshop on leadership,
communication and management skills at the university near Mutare
of east Zimbabwe, Murapa said "we are concerned that natural and
man-made disasters are a force in the perpetuation of poverty in
Africa."
</P>
<P>
He singled out cyclone Eline floods as one of the natural
disasters which hit five African countries without warning.
</P>
<P>
Africa should be equipped with relevant preparedness and
emergency rescue skills to react promptly against such disasters
and serve life, he said.
</P>
<P>
The cyclone Eline which was experienced in February and March
this year in Botswana, Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa and
Zimbabwe has caused serious damage to economic infrastructure and
claimed many lives.
</P>
<P>
Murapa also noted that the bloody civil wars in many countries
on the continent continue to wreak havoc and cause untold human
suffering.
</P>
<P>
According to the vice chancellor, the board of directors in
Africa University has agreed to establish an Institute for Peace
and Governance where issues related to disaster management will
remain central in the proposed curriculum.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, which was attended by 25 field officers from non-
governmental and state organizations from 13 African countries,
seeks to train participants in emergency rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
The participants are expected to hold similar workshops and
train people in their home countries.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Attempts to extract oil from a
sunken carrier off Cape Town have so far met with little success,
said South African Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa) Captain Bill
Dernier on Thursday.

The Treasure was carrying 1,200 tons of fuel oil when it sunk.
</P>
<P>
"Divers are connecting up the string of hoses to the port side
of the vessel's deep tank and pumping will start as soon as the
hoses are connected," Dernier said.
</P>
<P>
He said oil was spotted stretching out on the sea Thursday
morning and clean-up operations are under way.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Beefs Up Efforts to Develop Water Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia, traditionally
depending on natural rainfall for its agricultural production, has
begun to attach importance to the development of water projects in
the country, Ethiopian News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Resources Development was quoted as
saying that it had undertaken the feasibility study and design
works of nine water projects with an outlay of nearly 95 million
birr (1.1 million U.S. dollars) during 1999/2000 fiscal year that
ends on July 7.
</P>
<P>
Gulilat Birhane, a senior official with the ministry, said that
the water projects include study and design on small-scale
irrigation schemes, medium-scale hydropower generation, surface
water development as well as construction of buildings for
meteorological services.
</P>
<P>
A network of meteorological services will be established at a
cost of 17 million birr (about two million U.S. dollars) in
various parts of the country, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is nicknamed "Water tower of East Africa" for its
plentiful of water resources resulted from rainfall. However, the
Horn of Africa country suffered a lot from drought due to uneven
rainfall in the country in last three years.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 million Ethiopian people, mainly living in the rural
and pastoral areas, were reportedly facing starvation after
their homeland was subjected to successive years of drought.
</P>
<P>
To change the condition of living off rainfall, the Ethiopian
government is determined to take measures to construct as many as
possible man-made water irrigation system to guarantee
agricultural production.

According to the latest edition of the Export Review from the
Export Board of Zambia, which was obtained on Thursday, the NTE's
contribution to the economy has climbed from a paltry 10 percent
in 1990 to 39 percent in 1999.

The export board predicts a further boost in the sector to
achieve its set target of 400 million U.S. dollars in a few years
time.
</P>
<P>
"This justifies the importance that government has placed on
non- traditional exports, especially after realizing that copper
as a traditional export is not an everlasting foreign exchange
earner for the country," says the board.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Has 700,000 Orphan Population: UNCEF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has an estimated 700,000
orphans and vulnerable children population, according to the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
UNICEF Resident Representative Peter McDermott told a workshop
which opened here Thursday that Zambia had a large population of
orphans and vulnerable children due to the combined effects of
HIV/AIDS and high levels of poverty, although the country enjoys
relative peace compared with other countries on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that over 75 percent of Zambians live in
abject poverty, while one in every five persons in the country is
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
McDermott said that if the trend did not change the population
of orphans in Zambia and other countries in the region would
collectively reach 11 million by the year 2010, a situation he
described as disastrous to mankind.
</P>
<P>
McDermott took a swipe at developed nations, criticizing that
they concentrated their efforts and committed billions of U.S.
dollars on the research in animal sciences rather than helping
poor African countries fight the AIDS pandemic, which had
devastated the continent.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Facing Serious Unemployment Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Malawian government has called
upon its people to brace up for a serious unemployment crisis in
the coming years, according to reports reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The country's Ministry of Labor and Manpower Development said
at least 1. 5 million more job seekers will flood the already
saturated job market.
</P>
<P>
Since available jobs cannot sustain such an influx of job
seekers, the ministry foresees "a dramatic increase in
prostitution and violent crime".
</P>
<P>
Already, Malawi is facing an unemployment crisis following the
unsatisfactory performance of the agriculture sector that supports
90 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco, the country's chief money earner, and cotton are
performing poorly on the market, putting thousands more jobs on
the line.
</P>
<P>
Paul Gondwe, an official with the labor ministry, said there
was an imbalance between the rate at which new entrants were
joining the labor market and the rate at which the economy created
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
"This means that over a million new labor force entrants will
have to seek livelihood from subsistence agriculture and any other
ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gondwe added that the impact of rapid population growth on the
labor market would continue reducing employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
To match the increasing labor force, the Ministry of Labor and
Manpower Development urges Malawians to invest in family planning
in order to control population growth and to prepare the youth for
self-employment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were injured
Thursday morning by stones pelted by Israeli soldiers at the Fatma
Gate along the Lebanese-Israeli border, Lebanese National News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The injured, a father and his five-year-old son, were sent to
hospital immediately after the incident.
</P>
<P>
Local people, angered by cuss broadcast through a tweeter in the
Israeli side in Arabic upon the Lebanese people, anti-Israeli
Hezbollah guerrillas and some Lebanese religious leaders, hurled
stones at the Israeli side along the border. The two were injured
when Israeli soldiers threw stones back.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, one Israeli soldier was
seriously wounded by a stone hurled across the Fatma Gate by
Lebanese demonstrators at the border fence on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh blamed Lebanon for
not deploying its army in the evacuated zone, which was left after
Israel withdrew its troops from south Lebanon on May 24. He also
accused the Lebanese government of organizing anti-Israeli
demonstrations along the border.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister said Israel has thus far lodged 82
complaints with the United Nations over these disorders, which
could touch off a dangerous escalation along the borders.
</P>
<P>
Israel has announced that its soldiers can open fire to stop any
invasion into the Israeli territory, including attacks with stones.
So far, no fire has opened at stone-pelters.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticized for Setting up New Check Point in Southeast Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Defense Minister Socrates
Hasikos Thursday criticized Turkey for violating the status quo in
southeast Cyprus by establishing a new check point in the area.
</P>
<P>
The check point was set up by the Turkish military with a view
to restrict the movement of U.N. peacekeepers on the island, the
minister told the House Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It looks as if we are going to see a permanent situation,
created in the area of Strovilia, especially after the hoisting of
the Turkish flag and that of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot regime
in occupied Cyprus," Cyprus News Agency quoted the minister as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government is taking the matter seriously and is
taking all the necessary steps to revert the situation to its prior
state, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
The action, taken by the Turkish Cypriot side last Friday, is
certain to have the full backing of Ankara, Hasikos said, stressing
that it is a "clear extension of the occupation."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has lodged protest to the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash over the move, but so far has received no response.
</P>
<P>
Hasikos said this matter not only affected a small place like
Cyprus, but also humiliated the U.N. too.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cyprus government is in touch with Athens on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been divided into
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkish
forces invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed coup in Nicosia seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared a republic in
northern Cyprus in 1983 which is only recognized by Turkey.

JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The National Religious Party
(NRP), a partner of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government, decided
on Thursday to quit the ruling coalition ahead of the summit of
Palestinians, Israel, and the United States slated for July 11 near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The party's cabinet ministers and key members met at the office

</P>
<P>
The party discussed the three-way summit and the wide

coalition, the announcement added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will make decisions at the summit which
will force the NRP to resign from the government, the announcement

make decisions we can not accept."
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers of the NRP, which has five members of the
Knesset (parliament), has also decided to submit their resignation

Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks and reach a framework
agreement ahead of a September target for a final peace deal.

more territories to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Majlis, Guardians Council Call for Mutual Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran's reformist Majlis (parliament)
and its conservative rival, the Guardians Council (GC), on Thursday
called for mutual cooperation between the two bodies, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the Majlis and the GC will serve to remove
the problems facing the Iranian people, Majlis speaker Mehdi
Karrubi was quoted as saying in a meeting with several members of
the GC.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member GC supervises elections and examines legislation
passed by the Majlis to ensure it accords with the country's
Islamic principles.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Karrubi cautioned against escalation of tension
between political parties which he said will only dishearten the
people.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the GC not to make hasty judgment about
criticism voiced by Majlis members but to approve Majlis
legislation within the framework of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
In response, Mohammad Yazdi, former judicial chief and currently
a leading member in the GC, called for Karrubi's contribution to
help hold negotiations between the Majlis and the GC to solve the
disputes between the two bodies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Several other GC members at the meeting also called for a
meeting between the GC and the Presiding Board of the Majlis to
reinforce "understanding and coordination" between the two bodies.
</P>
<P>
Iran's sixth parliament, dominated by reformers supporting
President Mohammad Khatami's liberal programs, officially replaced
its conservative predecessor on May 27.
</P>
<P>
It has vowed to overturn conservative laws passed by the fifth
parliament, including amendments to the press law which intended to
put more restrictions on the country's reformist press.
</P>
<P>
Following the overwhelming victory of reformers in February's
parliamentary election, the conservative GC has cancelled election
results in a number of constituencies, in some cases even
transferring the victory of reformers to the conservative hands.
</P>
<P>
A number of seats in the 290-seat new parliament are still
vacant due to the cancellations. Many analysts believe the new
parliament will face a lot of obstacles in passing reformist
legislation, as its power is severely restricted by the
conservative GC.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami is
to pay an official visit to Germany from July 10 to 12 at the
invitation of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, the presidential
office said in a statement here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Khatami is to meet with Schroeder, German
President Johannes Rau and a number of other high ranking
officials, said the statement quoted by the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
Khatami will also deliver a speech to German industrialists and
have discussions with German scholars on the idea of "dialog among
civilizations."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said on
Thursday Berlin welcomes the upcoming visit of the Iranian
president, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview broadcast on Channel two of the German TV,
Fischer dismissed as "unjustified and meaningless" the demands of
some members of parliament that Khatami's visit to Germany be
cancelled, the report said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that Khatami's visit to Germany will
serve to strengthen the reform movement in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Fischer paid a visit to Iran in March following the country's
parliamentary election, in which reformers won an overwhelming
victory over their conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
The visit came two months after Iran and Germany finally ended a
long-running legal and diplomatic dispute which caused tension in
the two countries' traditionally good trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The dispute began after a German court in 1997 accused Iran of
involvement in the assassination of exiled Iranian dissidents and
Iran arrested a German businessman accused of having illegal sex
relations with an Iranian woman.

CAIRO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will
visit Cairo within the coming few days before flying to Washington
to attend the July 11 summit with Israeli and U.S. leaders, said
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Thursday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on Wednesday Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will meet with him on Tuesday in
the presidential retreat of Camp David to try to reach a final
peace agreement by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, a frequent visitor to Cairo, is expected to coordinate
stances with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and seek his advice
on the negotiations with Israel for a final settlement of the
thorniest issues including borders, Jerusalem, Jewish settlements
and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the summit will be held at a critical time and Egypt
is closely following the situation in view of the enormous impact
of the Palestinian issue on the Middle East peace process at
present and also in the future.
</P>
<P>
Egypt hopes the three-way summit will succeed in bridging the
gaps between the Palestinians and Israelis, end up by realizing the
much touted and aspired "peace of the brave" and reach a just
solution to the Palestinian question which is at the core of the
Arab-Israeli conflict over the past half century, Moussa said.

independent Palestinian state ahead of an upcoming summit by U.S.,
Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the United States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on Wednesday Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will
meet with him next Tuesday in Camp David near Washington to try to
reach a final peace agreement by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Arafat, Abdullah said Jordan
hopes the three-way summit will make substantial progress on the
Palestinian track to pave the way for a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Arafat thanked Abdullah for supporting the course
of the Palestinians and commended the efforts exerted by the
monarch and his kingdom toward a just and comprehensive peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Jordan believes a solution to the Palestinian issue is the core
of the Middle East peace process, without which there will be no
just and genuine peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright on Wednesday, Abdullah also called on all
parties concerned to do their utmost to guarantee a success of the
summit, and to reach a peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians by the September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been a major peace broker between Israel and its
Arab neighbors since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994
as the second Arab country after Egypt to reach such a peace deal
with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan stands for a just, durable and comprehensive peace for
all peoples in the region and has been persistent in its support
for the Palestinians to restore their legitimate rights in the
final status talks, including the establishment of an independent
state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The final status talks mainly touched upon the thorniest issues
of borders, the status of Jerusalem, refugees, Jewish settlements
and water sharing arrangements between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has vowed to declare an independent
Palestinian state by September 13 with or without an agreement with
Israel during the final status talks.

<HEADLINE> Direct Flight to be Staged to Protest U.N. Embargo on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A direct flight from Paris to the
Iraqi capital Baghdad will be staged in September to challenge the
decade-old U.N. embargo against Iraq, an official of the Iraqi
Peace, Solidarity and Friendship Organization said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The flight will most probably be organized by Jean-Marie
Benjamin, a French priest and also a film maker, who declared the
plan in May.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on May 9, Benjamin said he will organize
another flight from Paris to Baghdad by taking a Boeing passenger
plane with some 300 people on board.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, along with three other people from Italy, arrived in
Baghdad on April 3, becoming the first group flying to Baghdad
without getting prior permission from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed an embargo on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. Every flight to or from Baghdad must be authorized by the
U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that as many as 1.3 million people, mostly children
and the elderly, have died as a direct result of the crippling
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin, who is a resident in Italy, said some pro-Iraq Italian
figures have called for an investigation into the use of depleted
uranium bombs by the U.S. and Britain against Iraq during the 1991
Gulf War, terming it "a crime committed against the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed radioactivity from the depleted uranium bombs
used by the U.S. and British forces in the Gulf War is the main
cause for the increasing number of cancer patients, which rose from
4,341 in 1991 to 6,158 in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Ex-French President to Boycott Helsinki Accords Ceremony in Vienna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing will boycott the ceremony commemorating the 25th
anniversary of the Helsinki Accords to be held on July 19 in the
Austrian capital of Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted the secretary's office of d'Estaing
as saying Thursday that the former president decided to boycott
the ceremony because it will only celebrate the part of the
accords concerning humanitarian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Helsinki Accords include four parts which respectively
cover security in Europe, cooperation in the economic field,
science, technology and environment, questions relative to
security and cooperation in the Mediterranean, and cooperation in
humanitarian fields and others.
</P>
<P>
D'Estaing has sent a letter to Austrian Foreign Minister Benita
Ferrero Waldner, whose country is the current president of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe which
organizes the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relations between France and Austria are tense
because of dispute over European Union (EU) sanctions against the
Austrian government which has the far-right Freedom Party members
in it.
</P>
<P>
Austria has called for the lifting of the sanctions imposed in
January, while France, which took over the EU rotating presidency
this month, wants to keep it in force until the European Court of
Human Rights makes a decision.

<HEADLINE> Russia Vows to Pursue Operation in Chechnya to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia vowed Thursday to pursue the
mopping-up operation in the volatile republic of Chechnya to an
end and destroy all Chechen rebels refusing to lay down their
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Russia's anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus "will
be carried out to the end, and the hotbed of international
terrorism will be wiped out. Normal, peaceful life for this part
of the Russian population... will be restored," Col. Gen. Valery
Manilov, deputy chief of Russia's general staff, told a news
conference in Moscow Thursday, hours after President Vladimir
Putin reprimanded officials for lax security in the war-torn
region.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no parallels with the 1994-1996 Chechen war,
there will be no repeat of that tragedy," Manilov said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the most recent terrorist bomb attacks in a
number of Chechen communities did not produce the results expected
by their organizers.
</P>
<P>
The general said certain responsible individuals will be
brought to court for not providing proper security, making the
terrorist acts possible and leading to many deaths.
</P>
<P>
Putin had earlier made an unscheduled stop on his way back from
a summit in Central Asia to hold late night talks Wednesday at a
military base in Mozdok, just outside Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The president issued televised warnings to contrite-looking
officials and ministers who took turns to stand up as he spoke to
them from behind a desk about the need to tighten security.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said there were fewer than 2,000 bandits remaining in
parts of Chechnya's southern mountains not held by Moscow. They
used nighttime attacks to give the appearance that they exist
throughout the war-ravaged republic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security measures have been indefinitely tightened
up in some key Chechen cities and districts, such as in Chechnya's
temporary capital city of Gudermes, Argun and the district center
of Shali, 40 kilometers south of Grozny, he said.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Use Trout to Test Toxicity from Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada is introducing a trout
survival rate as a national standard to test toxic discharge from
mines, the Globe and Mail newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a new LC-50 test (lethal concentration of 50 percent), some
of the discharge will be dumped into an aquarium and, then, 10
rainbow trout will be added to see if half the fish survive after
96 hours.
</P>
<P>
The idea is that a 50-percent survival rate in the discharged
solution will be non-toxic to trout once the chemical cocktail is
diluted in the streams and rivers where it is dumped.
</P>
<P>
With the newly proposed standard, the federal government will
not impose specific limits on the discharge of mercury and cadmium,
the two highly toxic substances from mines across Canada.
</P>
<P>
But the new regulations propose that the allowable limits of
total suspended solids be reduced to 15 milligrams a liter from 25
milligrams under the Metal Mining Liquid Effluent Regulations
adopted in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations come after seven years of consultation
among the mining industry, environmentalists, scientists and the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
The proposals do not take effect until they are published in
the Canada Gazette later this year, the newspaper said.

<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday again warned the
United States of the dangerous consequences from developing its
National Missile Defense (NMD) system, whose tests are due to
resume Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the United States does not make the decision
without measuring the consequences for their European allies and
the reactions of China and Russia," said French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NMD risks provoking negative and dangerous
reactions from certain countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The reaction of France and other member countries of the
European Union (EU) will depend on that of Russia," he told
representatives of parliament members of the EU countries and
those of 12 candidates for EU membership who met here.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that France and other EU members will give a
strong response if the United States unilaterally launches the NMD
without obtaining the agreement of Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The reaction will be different if (Russian) President Vladimir
Putin gives his agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Disarmament Concludes Second Part of 2000 Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament
concluded here Thursday the second part of its 2000 session with
its president warning that the continued paralysis of the forum
would erode confidence in the future of disarmament and non-
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Celso Amorim of Brazil, the incoming president of
the conference, said that despite strenuous efforts to try and
bridge the differences that had prevented it from agreeing on a
program of work, it had been unable to embark on any substantive
work after 16 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian ambassador said that the continued paralysis of
the conference could not but cast doubt over the value of progress
achieved elsewhere, and warned that confidence in the future of
disarmament and non-proliferation would be eroded if the main
multilateral negotiating body remained paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
Amorim said that two considerations had to be born in mind in
relation to how the current deadlock in the conference could or
should be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
First, it was imperative that the forum build upon recent
political steps which were particularly meaningful for the
conference. The important political message from the Non-
Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, in which the five nuclear-
weapon states had assumed an unequivocal undertaking to accomplish
the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, had to be
translated into urgent action.
</P>
<P>
The second consideration was that the conference would
naturally continue to be influenced by developments in the
international strategic scene, but it did not have only a passive
role. If the conference was capable of initiating meaningful work,
it would to some degree have a positive influence on policies,
decisions and developments outside its framework.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes U.N. Ban of Sierra Leone Diamond Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- France welcomed Thursday the United
Nations Security Council resolution banning diamond trade in the
western African state of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman of the French Foreign Ministry, Anne Gazeau-
Secret, said that the re-establishment of peace in Sierra Leone
will depend on a control of diamond trade which is used illegally
by the rebel United Revolutionary Front as a financial resource in
a great part of its war effort.
</P>
<P>
She said that the installation of a regime for controlling
Sierra Leone's diamond production will complete the efforts
undertaken by the Security Council in other African states,
notably Angola.
</P>
<P>
It will also give back legitimacy to the diamond trade which
should contribute to peace and development in Africa, she added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Takes Crucial Step Towards Ending Sierra Leone War (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Wednesday voted to impose a worldwide ban on the purchase of rough
diamonds from Sierra Leone, where a thriving gem-for-gun business
fans the hard-to-end warfare.
</P>
<P>
The ban imposition sends a strong signal that the U.N.
Security Council, which, under the U.N. Charter, has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security, intends to get at the root of the conflict in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
Diamond is at the heart of the tragedy of Sierra Leone. This
precious resource has become the cause of human suffering on a
terrible scale, rather than a source of wealth for national
development.
</P>
<P>
"We have always maintained that the conflict in Sierra Leone
is not about the ideology, tribal or regional difference," Ibrahim
Kamara, the Sierra Leonean permanent representative to the United
Nations, told an open Security Council meeting Wednesday. "It has
nothing to do with the so-called problem of marginalized youths or,
as some political commentators have characterized it, an uprising
by rural poor against the urban elite. The root of the conflict is
and remains diamonds, diamonds and diamonds."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Security Council intends to choke off the
financial sources for the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
to buy weapons or to drag on the conflict in the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent of Sierra Leone's diamonds, considered to be
of high quality, are under the control of rebels, who smuggle the
rough stones out of the country through Liberia to international
markets. Sales of diamonds falsely labeled as Liberian provide
money to buy guns and other war materials for continuing the fight
in the former British colony.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor is close to the RUF, the
main rebel group in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Diamond, gold, iron ore and bauxite accounted for about two-
thirds of Sierra Leone's exports before war in the 1990s wrecked
the economy of the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The diamond embargo makes it illegal to buy Sierra Leonean
diamonds, except those that have a certificate of origin from the
government. Since there is no certification process yet in place,
the ban would initially cover all diamonds sales.
</P>
<P>
The London-based organization Global Witness reported in
October that rebels earned 200 million U.S. dollars a year from
1991 to 1999 in illicit diamonds sales.
</P>
<P>
"The illicit export of Sierra Leone diamonds is not only the
root and fuel of the conflict, but also constitutes a major
obstacle to its peaceful resolution," Kamara said.
</P>
<P>
The ban is not against the Sierra Leonean government, which
welcomes the U.N. action.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the U.N. move is a necessary and critical step to
assist the government of Sierra Leone in re-establishing authority
over its diamond-producing regions, and this is one of the
conditions to the lifting of the global embargo, which runs for an
initial period of 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The Council vote and the resolution itself show how the
international community is seriously concerned at the negative
role played by the diamonds in the conflict in Sierra Leone, but
the implementation is another matter. To keep the embargo
effective and equitable requires strong political will and
decisive actions from all governments because their positive
response can help the Sierra Leonean people return to the quiet,
peaceful and productive life they deserve.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Up 4.1 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories
rose 4.1 percent in May, the largest increase since the end of
1992, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders shot up to a seasonally adjusted 385.8 U.S.
billion dollars in May, up from 370.4 billion dollars the month
before. May's rise marked the largest gain since a 4.9 percent
increase posted in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
In April, factory orders fell 3.8 percent, a smaller decline
than the government previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Labor Department said new claims for
unemployment benefits fell by a bigger-than-expected 12,000 last
week to 296,000. Claims had shot up the previous two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts consider claims below 300,000 an indication of a tight
labor market, meaning employers are having trouble finding
qualified workers to fill openings.
</P>
<P>
In the factory orders report, the government said that orders
for electronic and electrical equipment, including household
appliances and communications equipment, surged 26.4 percent in
May. That was the largest increase since August 1997. In April,
electronic orders fell 17.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Transportation equipment orders rose 3.3 percent in May
following a 6.3 percent drop the month before.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation category, factory orders
grew 4.3 percent, the biggest jump since January 1980.
</P>
<P>
Orders for all durable goods, big-ticket manufactured items
expected to last at least three years, rose 6.1 percent in May,
the strongest pace since December. In April, such orders fell 5.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for non-durable goods, such as food and fuel, grew by 1.
7 percent, following a 1.2 percent drop in April.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a barometer of current production, rose 1.9 percent
in May, the largest gain since April 1996 and the seventh increase
in the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times since
June 1999 to slow the economy and keep inflation from escalating.
Some economic reports have suggested the Fed's rate increases are
working to slow growth.

OTTAWA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada is to amend aviation
regulations to curb what is described as "a growing problem"-- air
rage, said Canadian Transport Ministry spokesman Wednesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges African Nations to End "Malaria Taxes" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
Thursday called on African countries to follow the lead of Uganda
and Tanzania to scrap taxes and tariffs on mosquito nets and
insecticides used in the fight against malaria.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the fastest country to respond to the hard-hitting
pledges made at the historic African Malaria Summit in Nigeria
last April to waive malaria-related taxes and tariffs, said WHO in
a press release here.
</P>
<P>
It has completely scrapped taxes and tariffs on mosquito nets
and insecticides used in the fight against malaria in its June
budget.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania was the first African country to take action on the "
malaria tax" last year by reducing taxes and tariff duty to five
percent, making mosquito nets more affordable at an average price
of 3.5 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, malaria kills more than one million people a
year worldwide, with nine out of 10 cases in Africa, while it can
be easily prevented by using insecticides and bed nets to stop
mosquitoes that transmit the disease.
</P>
<P>
Prices for nets vary widely across Africa, with prices reported
to be as high as 45 dollars in Swaziland and 30 dollars in Sudan,
putting them completely out of reach of most Africans.
</P>
<P>
WHO estimates that only about three percent of families in
malaria endemic countries use insecticide treated nets, with cost
thought to be a major obstacle for wider use.
</P>
<P>
Most tax and tariff authorities continue to view insecticide
treated nets as textiles instead of pharmaceutical materials with
the potential to save lives.

<HEADLINE> Greece, Portugal Record Highest Rate of Road Deaths in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Portugal and Greece recorded the
highest road death rate in the 15-nation European Union (EU), the
EU statistical office, Eurostat, reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the data, the road death rate varies considerably
among the EU member states. In 1998, the average road death rate
was 114 per million inhabitants. The highest rates in the EU were
Portugal with 243 and Greece with 212. France and Spain recorded
152 and 151 respectively, also well above the EU average.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the safest roads were in Sweden and Britain, with 60
and 61 deaths per million inhabitants, respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990s, the road death rate fell in almost every EU
member state, but the only exception was Greece, where the rate
was up by five percent between 1990 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the previous decade, the biggest reductions occurred in
Austria (-41%), and Finland (-40%), while Britain and Spain (both -
35%), Sweden (-33%), Germany (-32%), and Denmark (-31%) all
performed better than the EU average (-26%) in cutting deaths.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said road accidents caused the death of 42,600 people
in the EU in 1998. In spite of increasing traffic, the number of
road deaths in the EU fell from 56,400 in 1990 to 43,500 in 1996,
a reduction of almost 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, with the number of deaths remaining virtually
unchanged from 1996 to 1998, progress in road safety seems to have
been more limited in recent years because big differences still
remain, though the death rate has fallen in most EU countries.

<HEADLINE> Venus Williams Wins Family Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams of the United States
won the battle of the Williams sisters, defeating Serena 6-2, 7-6
(7-3) in an enthralling women's semi-final contest at the
Wimbledon tennis championships on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The elder of the two always seemed to be in control despite the
numerous breaks of serve which the players gave away on a frequent
basis.
</P>
<P>
After a comprehensive first set Serena found her feet in the
second but with every powerful stroke she struck the return was
often far better and the tie-break proved to be a step too far as
Venus booked a place in her first Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
After the game a slightly jaded Venus admitted that the match
was always in the balance.
</P>
<P>
"If it was the final it would have been different," said the
winning Williams sister.
</P>
<P>
"It could have gone either way but I was able to stay tough. I
played so well because Serena played well. We were relaxed before
the contest but once it had started it was chins down," she said.
</P>
<P>
The opening set looked to be going to serve until the fourth
game when Venus made her younger sister pay for a number of
uncharacteristic double faults.
</P>
<P>
But Serena recovered in the following game as she matched Venus
with some terrific cross-court shots to break back.
</P>
<P>
However the elder of the pair used all her experience to take
the next game on Serena's serve, and it then seemed a formality
for Venus as she cruised to a 6-2 opening set advantage.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed Venus had reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals for
the last two years and it always appeared that she may go one
better at the expense of her sister.
</P>
<P>
Serena had time to collect her thoughts in the one-minute break
between sets and came out of the stalls prepared to remedy the
situation in which she had found herself in.
</P>
<P>
Her youthful exuberance shone through as she played her Venus
around the entire surface of Center Court to win a valuable break
in the first game of the second set.
</P>
<P>
The watching crowd were now being treated to power and
precision as the athleticism of the sisters came to a fore,
spreading returns from side to side of the court like a swinging
pendulum.
</P>
<P>
The match was going to be decided on temperament - the sister
who could steady her nerves on their way to winning the crucial
points.
</P>
<P>
The eighth game saw Serena wilt as Venus raced away to a 40-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
The eighth seed's shoulders began to droop as she struck an
over-hit shot to hand her break advantage back to Venus.
</P>
<P>
The elder sister nearly gave away a break in the 11th game,
when she was hauled back to deuce after being 40-0 up, but Serena
failed to capitalise when she struck a forehand shot fractionally
wide.
</P>
<P>
The tie-break saw five points out of the first seven go against
the server as both sets of players had to contend with some
immaculate returning.
</P>
<P>
But it was Venus again who proved that experience is
irreplaceable as her sister began to make mistakes on her service
giving away a double fault on the deciding point.

established football countries. He congratulated head of the
German bid committee Franz Beckenbauer for Germany's victory.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, South Africa had been tipped to win the vote,
with unofficial reports saying its margin of victory might be as
high as 14-10 following Brazil's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, as well as a host of
German sporting personalities were also in Zurich to lend weight
to the country's bid.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Beckenbauer thanked FIFA for its confidence in
Germany, and said he was "a little surprised but very happy" with
the result.
</P>
<P>
The votes were as follows:
</P>
<P>
In the first round: England 5, Germany 10, Morocco 3, South
Africa 6. Morocco was eliminated.

BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-based Zhongguancun
Technology Zone has opened a liaison office in Silicon Valley in
the U.S. state of California, hoping to facilitate cooperation
between the zone and the Silicon Valley.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Top Auditor Fingers Malpractice (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Li Jinhua, auditor-general of China
's National Audit Office, today openly attacked some ministerial
financial departments for malpractice and other wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Li's criticism came at the ongoing 16th session of the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress, when he
delivered a report on auditing work.
</P>
<P>
Li began his report by praising the financial departments for
implementation of the central budget and their contribution to the
reform, development and stability, but then he turned to complain
that some of these departments had been involved in wrongdoing and
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the mistakes are very serious," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed four major cases concerning the Ministry of
Finance discovered by auditors, as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- The ministry concerned failed to recover 231 million yuan
allocated for subsidizing loss-making state-owned enterprises in
1998;
</P>
<P>
-- The allocation of one million yuan for the Tourism
Development Fund did not comply with the relevant regulations;
</P>
<P>
-- The rectification and recovery of circulating funds by
financial departments was slow; and
</P>
<P>
-- Special allocations were wrongly turned into regular bank
deposits.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that last year state tax departments in 12
provinces were found to have illegally or wrongly handled 9.37
billion yuan, reducing the financial income of the central
government by 2.79 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 11 customs offices checked by the National Audit
Office were found to have illegally or mistakenly handled cases
involving 1.12 billion yuan, resulting in losses of taxes worth
346 million yuan, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The National Audit Office audited 55 State Council departments
and subordinates, and discovered that 18 of them had failed to
hand over budgetary income worth 1.728 billion yuan; 36 had
wrongly used financial allocations worth 2.109 billion yuan for
investment in office buildings and hotels, administrative expenses
and illegal loans; 20 had unlawfully held central funds worth 5.
655 billion yuan; and five had collected illegal charges worth 45.
64 million yuan from subordinate units.
</P>
<P>
The state auditors have uncovered severe misuse of special
funds allocated for water projects, poverty-eradication programs
and resettlement of people affected by state development projects,
the official said. Ten percent of the entire special allocations
from the central government were misused last year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The state auditors also detected 10.l billion yuan in non-
budgetary funds from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
and the Construction Bank of China, causing losses worth more than
10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 747 non-budgetary funds, valued at 790 million yuan,
were illegally held by the two banks.
</P>
<P>
Of the 73 state-owned or state-held enterprises, some had
turned state companies into collectively-owned or private ones,
bringing about seven billion yuan in losses to the government.
</P>
<P>
The people who were involved in such criminal activities have
been handed over to judicial departments for punishment according
to law, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the central allocation of subsidies to local
governments be brought under stricter control, financial
management in central government departments strengthened, the
management and supervision of funds raised through issuing
government bonds reinforced, the supervision of state banks
further strengthened and the quality of bank assets improved.

<HEADLINE> PSA Records Double-Digit Throughput Growth over First Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Port of Singapore Authority
Corporation Limited (PSA) recorded double-digit throughput growth
both in Singapore and overseas in the first half of 2000 and has
been accorded the highest credit ratings by two international
credit rating companies, its chairman Yeo Ning Hong pleasantly
told a press conference here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yeo affirmed that PSA has achieved a strong year-on-year
throughput growth of 12.8 from January to June 2000, handling a
total of 8.6 million twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) at its
container terminals in Singapore, and its overseas terminals
handled a total of 1.26 million TEUs which represented a growth of
more than 70 percent over the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that PSA has been accorded a corporate credit
rating of "AAA" by Standard &AMP; Poor's (S&AMP;P) and an indicative
rating of "Aa1" for its prospective unsecured long-term foreign
debt securities by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's).
</P>
<P>
He described the throughput growths and credit ratings as four
happiness to his company and ask all present to share with him the
happiness.
</P>
<P>
Commenting the performance of PSA's two joint ventures in
Dalian and Fuzhou, China, he said "China has been doing very well
in first half of this year in terms of container throughput,"
adding it registered "a high double-digit growth."
</P>
<P>
"To my mind, China is doing very well in its economy and imports
and exports really reflect overall economy of China," he said
further.
</P>
<P>
On the ratings, Yeo said that "AAA" is the highest credit
rating assigned by S&AMP;P and he was "extremely happy" and "extremely
honored".
</P>
<P>
"The credit ratings assigned by S&AMP;P and Moody's reelect their
assessment of PSA's re-eminent strengths in its industry and very
strong financial position," he said with full smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
Yeo stressed that the rating is given to PSA as a company, on
the basis of PSA's financial standing and PSA's performance, not
because of its link or relations with the government.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, a total of 15.9 million TEUs, around 80 percent of
which were transshipment containers, passed through PSA's ports in
Singapore and PSA's financial position was very strong with
revenues around 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, profit after taxes
approximately 450 million U.S. dollars and assets of around 4.7
billion U.S. dollars.

HANOI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has mapped out an overall
plan of foreign trade with annual export and import growth rate of
between 14 and 15 percent in the next five years, Vietnam's
official news agency VNA reported Thursday.

In another move to help boost exports and prevent the trade
deficit from growing, the MoT is proposing solutions to combine
exports with imports through barter trade with the Philippines,
Myanmar, Laos and Thailand.

<P>
The Vietnamese government plans to improve the legal framework
for import-export activities while local authorities will focus on
realizing trade policies and managing their implementation by
businesses.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has unveiled
a series of policies aimed at improving food security in the
country, Rwanda News Agency reported on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Food Problems Persist in Eritrea: WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite a recent peace agreement
between Eritrea and Ethiopia, hundreds of thousands of
war-affected Eritreans will continue to need large amounts of food
aid for some time to come, the World Food Program (WFP) said here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The food organization announced that it will be providing food
relief until next April to 750,000 internally displaced and
war-affected people in Eritrea, while the non-governmental
organizations and other agencies will supply food for another
320,000 displaced in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Kofi Owusu-Tieku, WFP's Emergency Coordinator in
Eritrea, a great number of people are still uprooted and as there
will be no harvest for them, they will be dependent on
international food aid this year and well into next year.
</P>
<P>
Kofi noted that the bulk of displaced civilians are farmers
from the Gash Barka region, Eritrea's breadbasket, which produces
between 60 to 80 percent of grain consumed in Eritrea.

<P>
Most of the people in need of food assistance are women and
children who carry on living in make-shift camps, dry riverbeds
and caves, Kofi said.
</P>
<P>
The full cost of providing 126,000 tons of food to the 750,000
displaced and deportees is estimated at 79 million U.S. dollars,
WFP said, promising to continue its food supply to 94,000 Eritrean
refugees who fled westward into neighboring Sudan during the
conflict between the two countries in May this year.
</P>
<P>
These people will still need food aid when they return home,
the U.N. agency said.
</P>
<P>
Since May this year, WFP has provided 5,415 tons of mixed food
commodities such as cereals, pulses, vegetable oil and corn soya
blend to Eritrea and 1,250 tons to the refugees in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> OECD Calls on France to Continue Privatization, Opening Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) Thursday called on France to
continue privatizing enterprises and opening up market to
competition.
</P>
<P>
In a report on French economy, OECD also confirmed an earlier
prediction that the nation's gross domestic product will grow by 3
percent this year and 2.9 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
However, it pointed out that French economy is not successful
in creating more enterprises though growth does provide more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The number of new enterprises created each year has been
falling since 1994, despite a slight improvement in 1999, and the
number of newly created enterprises this year was even smaller
than that in the mid-1990s, said the report.
</P>
<P>
OECD blamed the French government intervention for the poor
performance of enterprises and expressed its hope that France will
also open up its electricity, natural gas, railway and post
service after having done so with its telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The organization also warned that France's economy might be
restrained in the future by "over-heating symptom" such as tension
in labor market.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A car explosion killed two policemen
in Makhachkala, capital of the Russian republic of Dagestan
bordering Chechnya, on Thursday, reported the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The two Dagestani police officers were killed on the spot and a
third was injured when their Niva-make car exploded suddenly at
around 1:00 a.m. Thursday morning Moscow time (2200 GMT Wednesday)
in the third Ordzhonikidze street of the city, Interfax cited a
Dagestani Interior Ministry duty officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two officers who were in the car have already been
identified, parts of their bodies were collected at the scene of
the explosion, Makhachkala Prosecutor Sultan Salautdinov told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The wounded, Senior Sergeant Salam Abdulayev, serving with
Dagestan's highest post and patrol service, was taken to the
hospital, where he was diagnosed with "a mild concussion and minor
injuries to the face and body," said the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was privately owned and two Makarov pistols and
fragments of a third one were found at the scene, said the police.
</P>
<P>
The Dagestan Prosecutor's office has initiated a criminal case
about the illegal storage of explosives.
</P>
<P>

possibility of an act of terrorism by explosive device or an
accident in the transportation of explosives, according to a live
report of Russia's NTV television.
</P>
<P>
An investigation is still underway.

<HEADLINE> Stojkovic to Replace Boskov as Yugoslavia Coach - Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's veteran midfielder
Dragan Stojkovic will replace Vujadin Boskov as national team
manager, the daily Sportski Zurnal said on Thursday citing sources
in the Yugoslav Football Federation (FSJ).
</P>
<P>
Veteran playmaker Dejan Savicevic, who missed the Euro 2000
finals owing to injury, will join Stojkovic as the technical
director, the daily said, adding that the appointments would be
decided at a session of the FSJ executive board on July 22.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said it expected Stojkovic, 35, to take over from
Boskov at the end of the year after three 2002 World Cup
qualifying matches against Luxembourg, Russia and the Faroe
Islands.
</P>
<P>
Several Yugoslav media called for Boskov's resignation after
the team was crushed 6-1 by the Netherlands in the Euro 2000
quarter-finals, having scraped through to the last eight.
</P>
<P>
Many said Stojkovic, who is based in Japan and nearing the end
of his playing career, would be an ideal replacement for the 69-
year old manager.

<HEADLINE> South African President Laments Soccer Bid Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- President Thabo Mbeki on
Thursday expressed deep disappointment at South Africa's failure
to win the bid for the 2006 soccer World Cup, saying it was "a
tragic day for Africa".
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Pretoria, he said this development was a setback to
efforts to gain for Africa the recognition it deserved on the
sporting world. His address was broadcast live on national
television.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he believed South Africa's bid was sound but the
executive of soccer's world body, FIFA, obviously had a different
view.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's executive voted 12-11 in favor of Germany hosting the
tournament. One member of the executive, New Zealand's
representative, abstained from the vote.
</P>
<P>
The bidding process had been a hard fought and even bruising at
times, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated Germany for its victory, saying South Africa
would support the bid winner.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said South Africa's bid committee and the South African
Football Association had made South Africa a "very proud nation
indeed".
</P>
<P>
"Your efforts cannot be faulted and I'm sure the experience in
bidding was an empowering one," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki thanked South Africa's bidding team chief executive Danny
Jordaan and its president, Irvin Khoza, for their hard work and
sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mbeki was flanked by former president Nelson Mandela
and Deputy President Jacob Zuma as they awaited the announcement
in a big circular room in the Union Buildings in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki ended his speech by saying that there would be other
opportunities for the country to host major sporting events and
South Africa should learn from this in order to equip itself for
other events.
</P>
<P>
"The next time we will win," he said.

<HEADLINE> South Africans Slam European Domination in Soccer Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africans slammed
European domination of world soccer following Germany's narrow
victory over South Africa in voting on bids for the 2006 soccer
World Cup on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Durban mayor Obed Mlaba labelled the decision "international
racism" while South African bid committee member Selwyn Nathan
described the announcement in Zurich as a further proof of "the
gulf between Africa and Europe".
</P>
<P>
"A large majority of FIFA (soccer's governing body) still see
Africa as backward. To them soccer is a European sport and not a
global one," said Nathan.
</P>
<P>
Mlaba also lashed out at New Zealand's decision to abstain from
the final vote saying that it was a cunning ploy to defeat FIFA
president Sepp Blatter and his ideal to take soccer to all corners
of the globe.
</P>
<P>
Twelve members of FIFA's executive voted for Germany and 11 for
South Africa, with Charles Dempsey of New Zealand withdrawing at
the crucial moment.
</P>
<P>
Former South African soccer coach Clive Barker slammed the
inconsistency of the voting, saying it was scandalous that New
Zealand abstained at the death.
</P>
<P>
Barker cited the first two rounds of voting as being completely
inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
"How can England get five votes in the first round and only two
in the second? Surely the delegates who voted for England in the
first round should have voted for them in the second.
</P>
<P>
"How can they just change tack in a matter of minutes?" Barker
asked.
</P>
<P>
South African Bid Committee president Irvin Khoza also lashed
out at Dempsey.
</P>
<P>
"Dempsey has betrayed the South African people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see how a man can vote in the first two rounds and
then not vote in the third and final round. FIFA should
investigate this," he added.
</P>
<P>
Bid committee chief executive Danny Jordaan hit out at FIFA's
failure to address the European domination and expressed his
disappointment at having been blocked at the final hurdle.
</P>
<P>
"Africa is one of the biggest blocs in FIFA," Jordaan told a
news conference after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
"There is often a reference to the FIFA membership as the '
footballing family'. You can't have a family and feed only one
child and leave the others to starve," Jordaan said.

<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China is taking further steps to
regulate public bidding activities, in a move to make sure that
potential bidders obtain relevant information equally,
conveniently and accurately.
</P>
<P>
The provisional regulations for public bidding, issued on July
1 by the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), are the
latest effort to make sure that the public bidding law, which went
into effect early this year, is fully implemented, an SDPC
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
For quite a long time, public bidding activities were limited
to a narrow scope, and in some areas illegal intervention was
prevalent in the process, causing unfair competition and
resentment.
</P>
<P>
Bidding reports for all projects should be made public via such
designated media as the China Daily, China Economic Herald, China
Construction News and the website: http://www.chinabidding.com.cn.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists' successful
involvement in the global Human Genome Project (HGP) has prompted
enthusiasm at home for this type of research, according to a
Chinese researcher.
</P>
<P>
Professor Yang Huanming, director of the HGP Center under the
Genetics Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),
expressed his gratitude here today to the Leqing city government
in east China's Zhejiang Province, which provided eight million
yuan (about one million U.S. dollars) in loans to the center to
aid their HGP research.
</P>
<P>
Only with the loan and broad support from society were Chinese
scientists able to complete their mission in the global effort to
decode the genome, said Yang, chief scientist of the HGP in China.
</P>
<P>
In the just-revealed first rough map of the HGP, Chinese
scientists completed one percent of the sequencing of the human
genome, but the significance of that one percent was great, Yang
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shunyi County, north of Beijing, where the HGP
center is located, has provided the center with 3,800 sq m of land
near the Capital International Airport for free use for two years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at a meeting here today suggested that more local
governments and entities be encouraged to back key scientific
research projects.

expenditures were 823.894 billion yuan, up 27.8 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
This results in a deficit of 179.16 billion yuan, 1.143 billion
yuan less than the goal of 180.303 billion yuan approved by the
National People's Congress (NPC), the nation's highest lawmaking
body, said the minister in his report this afternoon to the
ongoing 16th Session of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
Xiang attributed the achievements to the pro-active fiscal
policy adopted by the Chinese government and the reform of the
central financial budget administration system.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that in 1999 the central financial budget was based
on the budgets of various ministries which were based on those
worked out by various grassroots units, which proved to be more
efficient, scientific and comprehensive. "This way of making the
budget not only simplifies the procedures, but also benefits the
supervision and implementation of the budget," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister also presented the ministry's working plan for the
second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
"The ministry will continue to bring its new fiscal policy into
full play to boost economic development," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also in his report called for strengthening taxation work,
budget administration reform and supervision of finance work.

<HEADLINE> HK's First Coastal Defense Museum to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Museum of Coastal
Defense, the first of its kind in Hong Kong, is near completion
and scheduled to open to the public on July 25, Director of
Leisure and Cultural Services Paul Leung Sai-wah said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The museum, located on the headland to the south of the Lei Yue
Mun Pass in Shau Kei Wan, is developed on the former Lei Yue Mun
Fort, covering an area of 34,200 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the Permanent exhibition at the museum is "Six
Hundred Years of Coastal Defense in Hong Kong." In the 11 casemate
galleries, different periods of development in the coastal defense
of Hong Kong and its neighboring area are illustrated.
</P>
<P>
From the museum's exhibition galleries, visitors could trace
the history of Hong Kong's coastal defense over the past six
hundred years.
</P>
<P>
The Lei Yue Mun Fort was built in 1887 by the British to defend
the eastern approach to the Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the museum began in October 1997 and was
completed in 1999, with a budget of around 300 million HK dollars
(38.46 million U.S. dollars). The museum was then handed over to
the Museum management for exhibition fabrication.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HK Int'l Airport to Scale New Heights  by Ou Sa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong International Airport (
HKIA), which celebrated its second anniversary Thursday, is
consolidating its position as a major passenger and cargo hub.
</P>
<P>
"Already 28 percent of passengers at HKIA use the airport to
transfer to other destinations. As the government of Hong Kong
negotiates more air services agreements to expand our network of
air routes, we are putting in place measures to better serve the
needs of this rapidly growing segment of our business," said Dr.
Victor Fung Kwok-king, chairman of the Airport Authority (AA), on
the occasion.
</P>
<P>
HKIA has much to celebrate on the anniversary, with a
succession of new records for passenger and cargo growth set in
the past few months, including more than 31.6 million passengers
and 2.11 million tonnes of airfreight that passed through HKIA in
the 12 months until May this year. The calendar year records to
date are 30.8 million passengers in 1996, and 1.9 million tonnes
of cargo in 1999.
</P>
<P>
AA was undertaking the necessary planning in anticipation of
continued robust growth, particularly of cargo, according to Dr
Fung.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, four more cargo aircraft stands would be
added, bringing the total number of dedicated cargo aircraft
stands to 17.
</P>
<P>
Tenders were also invited recently to work on the new airport
master plan, the Strategic Overview of Major Airport Development
Study, which would serve as the blueprint for growth as the
airport progresses towards its ultimate design capacity of 87
million passengers and 9 million tonnes of cargo.
</P>
<P>
AA has planned to provide new and improved services and
facilities to achieve quicker turnarounds for airlines and
passengers. These include moving bags of transfer passengers
between aircraft at a faster rate and positioning connecting
aircraft at gates that were closer to each other.
</P>
<P>
Other developments bode well for the airport. The tourism
sector was showing good signs of recovery with 10.7 million
visitors in Hong Kong last year.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Tourist Association expected that number to
increase by 6.8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The opening of Hong Kong Disneyland theme park in 2005 and
China's anticipated entry to the World Trade Organization would
have profound impacts on air traffic and airport operations for
many years to come, said Fung.
</P>
<P>
HKIA's role as a gateway to the Chinese mainland will develop
strongly following the conclusion of the air services agreement
between the mainland and Hong Kong in February this year.
</P>
<P>
"We now enjoy direct air links to 40 cities across the mainland,
" Dr Fung said. "This impressive network, combined with our
extensive international flights, place us in an enviable position
to capture the potential of this vast and immensely promising
market."
</P>
<P>
Fung said the development of logistics centers and a marine
cargo handling facility would allow the airport to evolve into a
major transshipment center for the Pearl Rive Delta and southern
mainland cities.
</P>
<P>
Studies were also underway to transform HKIA's vast commercial
land bank into "a great Airport City of East Asia," including
facilities such as an exhibition and convention center, hotels,
commercial offices, and recreational complexes.
</P>
<P>
HKIA, located on a 1,248-hectare site at Chek Lap Kok on the
northern side of Lantau Island, began regular services on July 6,
1998, after Chinese President Jiang Zemin officially opened it on
July 2.

ISLAMABAD, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will export wheat to
Afghanistan and an agreement to this effect will be made shortly,
an official at the Ministry of Food and Agriculture here said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The issue was discussed during a recent high level Taliban
delegation's visit to Pakistan, the sources said, adding that
another Taliban delegation will visit here shortly to finalize the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the Taliban regime has expressed its
desire to import a maximum of one million tons of wheat from
Pakistan on a rational price.
</P>
<P>
Owing to unprecedented drought in 30 years, Afghanistan is
expected to suffer from shortage of wheat soon.
</P>
<P>
There is no ban on "government to government" supply of wheat
to Afghanistan despite the U.N. Security Council sanctions on
Afghanistan, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He further said that Pakistan is enjoying a bumper wheat crop
this year and is in a position to earn 500 million U.S. dollars
through the export of this commodity.
</P>
<P>
According to official estimates, there will be a surplus of
around two million tons of wheat in Pakistan and the export of one
million tons will not create any shortage in the country.

laboratory for every national high school for 1,000 high schools,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Predicts 3.8% GDP Growth for 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Belgium on Thursday revised
prediction of this year's economic growth, expecting its gross
domestic product (GDP) to increase by 3.8 percent instead of 3.2
percent as previously forecast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Belgian Planning Bureau predicted a 3.1 percent
growth for the coming year, up from a former figure of 2.6 percent.
This is compared with a 2.7 percent and a 2.5 percent growth
respectively for 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The office based the results mainly on increase in the
country's exports and domestic demand, and on an increasingly
improved employment rate, which, at 58.2 percent in 1999, is
expected to reach 59.0 percent this year and rise further to 59.6
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The planning bureau added that Belgium's inflation rate would
fall to 2.1 percent this year and further to 1.4 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
It expected investment in small and medium-sized enterprises to
increase to a level as high as at the beginning of the 1990s.

GENEVA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany had the last smile on
Thursday as they won the right to host the 2006 World Cup finals
by a single vote.
</P>
<P>
Germany won 12 votes from FIFA's 24-member executive committee
to 11 for South Africa with one abstention in a third and final
round of voting.
</P>
<P>
Germany and South Africa both polled 11 votes after the first
two rounds which saw the other two candidates Morocco and England
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
Morocco crashed out in the first round after polling just three
votes. England received five, South Africa six and Germany 10.
</P>
<P>
In the second round Germany and South Africa both polled 11
with England two and therefore out of the running.
</P>
<P>
In the neck-and-neck struggle only one of England's votes went
to Germany in the third and final round, the other being an
abstention.
</P>
<P>
Had the vote been 12-12, Blatter would have had a casting vote.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Fengyun 2 meteorological
satellite, which was recently launched by China, has sent back its
first visible light nephogram (picture of clouds) to the State
Satellite Meteorological Center.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Wen Kegang, director of the
China Meteorological Administration.
</P>
<P>
The nephogram clearly shows the eastern coast of Africa, the
entire Indian Ocean, the western part of the Pacific Ocean, the
whole of Asia, and the continent of Australia. China lies in the
upper-central part of the nephogram.
</P>
<P>
The good quality of the nephogram indicates that the
multichannel scanning radiator, the satellite's functions and the
digital receiver are all working well, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Having analyzed the nephogram, a group of experts observed that
there is a frontal cloud system affecting Lake Baikal in Russia,
the western part of Mongolia and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another cyclonic cloud system is covering the
country's northeastern and northern areas, the Yellow River and
Huai River area, the Yangtze River and Huai River area, and the
eastern part of southwestern China, the meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
Also clearly seen are clouds of the No.3 typhoon in the Pacific
Ocean and clouds belonging to the No.4 tropical storm which has
hit the eastern part of the South China Sea.

<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Strong precipitation over the past
few days has alleviated the drought in north China, but the region
is still short of water, the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters said here today.
</P>
<P>
From July 3 to 6, much of the region received 25 to 50 mm of
rain. Parts of Beijing and Hebei got as much as 200 mm of rain.
</P>
<P>
The rain has greatly improved the soil moisture content, and
will benefit the growth of autumn crops, said officials at the
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
As the precipitation has been short and the drought severe,
some parts of the region are still facing shortages of drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over the past six months, rainfall in much
of north China has been 20 to 60 percent less than in normal years.

<HEADLINE> Gathering Marks Discovery of Dunhuang Library Cave (With Details) ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A grand gathering to mark the
centennial of the discovery of the Dunhuang Library Cave and the
birth of Dunhuang studies was held here today at the Great Hall of
the People.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, the Gansu
provincial government and the State Cultural Heritage
Administration, is a major event in the country's two-month
commemoration of the world-stunning find.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the meeting, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing expressed
his gratitude to researchers, archaeologists, heritage protectors
and other experts for their great contributions to Dunhuang relics
preservation and Dunhuang studies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people should carry forward all the outstanding
cultural traditions of the nation while eagerly learning from
foreign countries to build a modern socialist culture with Chinese
characteristics, Li said.
</P>
<P>
As an important cradle of Chinese civilization, the western
region, where Dunhuang is located, has abundant cultural relics.
The westward development project decided by the central
authorities provides the western region with a historic
opportunity, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li also urged the western localities to staunchly safeguard
their cultural heritage while speeding up the development of
tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
(CASS), told the meeting that he hopes that scholars and experts
nationwide would continue to compile, study and publish the
precious Dunhuang documents.

<P>
Minister of Culture Sun Jiazheng, who also attended the meeting,
said that Dunhuang art reflects both European and Asian cultural
features, and exemplifies the outstanding achievements made by the
ancient people of China.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 experts and officials participated in the
commemorative meeting.
</P>
<P>
In 1900, Taoist priest Wang Yuanlu discovered a cave at the
Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, containing more than 50,000 sutras,
documents and paintings from nearly 10 dynasties, ranging from the
4th to the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang, popularly known as the Thousand
Buddha Caves, were carved out of sandstone cliffs stretching about
1,600 meters along the eastern side of Mingsha Hill, 25 km
southeast of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
A Tang Dynasty inscription records that the first cave in the
Mogao Grottoes was carved in 366 A.D. Despite erosion and man-made
destruction, most of the 492 caves are well preserved, with
frescoes covering an area of 45,000 sq m, more than 2,000 colored
sculptured figures and five wooden eaves overhanging the caves.
</P>
<P>
According to archaeologists, the caves are the greatest and
most consummate repository of Buddhist art in the world. The
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (
UNESCO) put the Mogao Grottoes on the World Heritage List in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large-scale exhibition of Dunhuang art is now
being held at the Museum of Chinese History here.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Participants at the 16th Session of
the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (
NPC) convened here this afternoon again to review reports on the
central finance budget and audit.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC, the nation's highest lawmaking
body, attended the meeting, which was presided over by NPC Vice-
Chairman Jiang Chunyun.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng delivered a report on the
central finance budget.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiang, in 1999, the central finance revenue
amounted to 644.734 billion yuan, up 17.5 percent over the
previous year, and the total expenditure was 823.894 billion yuan,
up 27.8 percent over the previous year, thus resulting in a
deficit of 179.16 billion yuan, 1.143 billion yuan less than the
1999 budgeted deficit approved by the NPC.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinhua, the country's top auditor, began his report by
praising the financial departments for implementation of the
central budget and their contribution to the reform, development
and stability, but then turned out to complain that some of these

<HEADLINE> 50-50 Chance for Three-Way to Succeed: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Thursday the chances were 50-50 for his summit with U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be an important opportunity for Israel and
Palestinians to resolve the key issues concerning the peace
process, but it is hard to say for now whether the summit could
achieve satisfactory results, Barak said in an interview with
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the Israeli delegation will do everything possible to
reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that he will not sign an agreement that may
threaten Israel's national security.
</P>
<P>
He will not agree to return to the 1967 border line and that
almost 90 percent of the Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories will remain under Israeli sovereignty, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday to hold a summit
with Barak and Arafat starting next Tuesday at Camp David near
Washington. The summit will try to reach a framework agreement on
final-status issues such as Jerusalem, borders, refugees, Jewish
settlements and water.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the summit received mixed reactions among
Barak's coalition partners and other political parties in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky of Yisrael Ba'aliya, Barak's
coalition partner with four seats in the Knesset (parliament),
announced on Wednesday that his party has decided to resign from
the coalition and he will submit the resignation letter to Barak
during next Sunday's cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky blamed Barak of keeping the coalition party leaders in
the dark about the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
He also accused Barak of making too many concessions to the
Palestinians regarding territorial transfer.
</P>
<P>
Barak's One Israel bloc's largest coalition partner Shas party
called on Barak to finalize the "red lines" that should not be
crossed in the negotiations. Shas said its leader Eli Yishai will
not be joining the delegation to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party said it will leave the coalition if
Barak goes to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party has prepared a no-confidence motion
against the Barak-led coalition in the Knesset to expressed its
objection to the summit.
</P>
<P>
But Meretz party leader Yossi Sarid said the summit would be "
the last chance for peace with the Palestinians...and that chance
must be used."
</P>
<P>
Sarid added that the party would back Barak if he works for
peace and the party "trusts Barak to arrive at the best agreement
possible and will support any agreement signed."
</P>
<P>
Barak said he will call a cabinet meeting before going to the
summit.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Syrian Hijacker Shot Dead Aboard Jordanian Plane by Wang Bingfei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Security officers on board a Royal
Jordanian (RJ) Airbus-320 liner shot dead a Syrian national
Wednesday night as he was hijacking the plane.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen passengers on board were slightly injured by shrapnels
as a hand grenade set off by the hijacker exploded.
</P>
<P>
Police told Xinhua on Thursday that the hijacking happened 10
minutes after the national flag carrier airliner took off from the
Queen Alia International Airport in southern Amman Wednesday night,
when the Syrian rose from his seat with a pistol and a grenade in
his hands.
</P>
<P>
He demanded that the plane be diverted from its course to Syrian
capital Damascus to any airport in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The man, identified as Mohamood Reezq, a Syrian national in his
late 30s, was seeking political asylum in Germany after he failed
to obtain a visa from German embassies in the region to join his
German wife there.
</P>
<P>
A brother of the hijacker and a son and a daughter from his
German wife were also on board the plane, but they did not take
part in the highjacking effort, police said.
</P>
<P>
Security officers on board the airliner shot dead the man when
he was trying to break into the cockpit, but the plain-clothed
officers were unable to prevent the Syrian from setting off his
grenade.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation lasted about two minutes, a police officer who
asked not to be named told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The crew on board managed to pilot the plane back and safely
landed it at the Queen Alia airport.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of the some 80 passengers aboard were slightly injured
in the explosion but none of the security officers were hurt,
police said.
</P>
<P>
The injured were rushed to the King Hussein Medical Center, a
military hospital compound in western Amman, for emergency cares
soon after the plane touched down.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Manmood al-Yamani, a senior surgeon and member of the
rescue team at the military hospital, said none of the victims was
seriously injured and 14 of them have been released from the
hospital by Thursday noon.
</P>
<P>
Security measures have been tightened at the Queen Alia airport,
one of the three international airports in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence officers are investigating how the Syrian hijacker
sneaked into the plane with a gun and a pistol without being
detected.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem District Attorney Suggests Netanyahu Not Be Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Jerusalem district attorney
has recommended that former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not
be indicted for alleged bribe-taking, Israel Radio reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Moshe Lador, said the testimony of state witness
Avner Amedi is problematic and there is no sufficient evidence to
convict the ex-premier.
</P>
<P>
State Attorney Edna Arbel has reportedly not yet taken a
decision on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police recommended in late March that Netanyahu be
arraigned on corruption charges in a bribery and theft case,
following a seven-month investigation on allegations that Netanyahu
and his wife had illegally accepted free services from a private
contractor, Avner Amedi, and kept official gifts after he left the
office last July.
</P>
<P>
It is up to the state attorney to decide whether to put
Netanyahu on trial.
</P>
<P>
The police launched the probe last October after contractor
Amedi, realizing that Netanyahu was no longer able to fulfill
promises after leaving office, sent a bill worth 110,000 U.S.
dollars to the Prime Minister's Office for his services. 
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, in which 100 people were questioned,
the police also found that Netanyahu continued keeping scores of
valuable gifts including paintings and silver and gold objects he
received while in office. 
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli laws, the gifts should have been handed
over to the state after Netanyahu left office July 1999, two months
after he was trounced by Ehud Barak in the national elections.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in three years that the police
suggested criminal charges against Netanyahu. In 1997, the police
recommended that he be charged with fraud and breach of trust for
appointing a crony as attorney general in an alleged attempt to
influence a corruption investigation against one of his political
allies.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors dropped that case after failing to find sufficient
evidence to support the charges.
</P>
<P>
If finally granted an acquittal, Netanyahu may still have
chances to make a comeback to the political arena. He is enjoying a
rising popularity as a Gallup Poll recently found.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Malaysia's Weapon Heist Drama Ends with Surrender of 27 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The arms heist and hostage-
taking drama in Malaysia since Sunday ended Thursday evening when
all 27 members of the group involved gave themselves up.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two of them have been arrested and five admitted to
hospital with gunshot wounds, two of them seriously injured,
Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The security forces took steps to get the group to surrender,
including throwing a tight cordon around their hideout at Bukit
Jenalek in Sauk in the northern state Perak, the minister told a
press conference at the Kati police station near Sauk, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi told a media conference here that the government is
thankful that the Sauk hostage-taking and the Gerik arms heist
episode has ended bloodlessly with the surrender of the 27
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
"This is achieved through excellent cooperation and
coordination between the police, the armed forces and the various
other agencies," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government made no offers or deals with the arms
robbers but instead adopted a strategy of convincing them into
giving up.
</P>
<P>
However, the whole drama has claimed at least two lives as two
men who surrendered Thursday morning told the security authorities
that their gang executed two of their three hostages.
</P>
<P>
The surrender of the two Thursday morning indicated an early
end to the drama.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government Wednesday made the appeal to the group
to surrender.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen members of the group impersonating senior army officers
raided two army camps in Gerik in the Perak state on Sunday
morning and got away with a huge cache of weapons including
grenade launchers, machine guns and more than 100 assault rifles
and thousands of rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The gang was led by an ex-serviceman identified as Amin Razali
while its members included highly-qualified people such as
accountants, auditors and multi-media engineers, according to the
home minister.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the episode occurred, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said
poor security check and weapon control system allowed
impersonators to cart away the assortment of weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The incident showed that procedures relating to security
maintenance at key installations such as weapons depot are ignored,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The security forces cordoned the area since Monday night after
the discovery of three four-wheeled-drive vehicles believed to
have been used by the weapon stealers and a combined police-
military massive manhunt tracked the weapon stealers hiding in
Sauk in the state early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The security forces called for reinforcement Tuesday morning
upon locating the group's hideout among orchards in the area.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the security forces shot and wounded one of
weapon stealers during a brief skirmish with them.
</P>
<P>
The arms heist drama came less than three months after the
abduction of 21 people by armed gunmen in Sipadan Island, off
Sabah, East Malaysia, last April. The hostage case is yet to end
as the hostage-holders are still holding 20 of them in southern
Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes Consultations on Special Powers Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
planning to hold consultations with various sectors of society on
a proposed measure to give the president special economic powers
to speed up rehabilitation and development efforts in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said
Thursday that the inputs from the consultations would be
considered in a draft of the Mindanao Crisis Act to be submitted
to the congress by the government.
</P>
<P>
"We'll see what we can get from the various sectors. This is
just a draft, and nothing is final at this stage," Puno said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Puno also said it is up to the congress to determine the
composition of the proposed oversight committees that would
monitor the use of these special powers.
</P>
<P>
In a separate radio interview, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora said that despite opposition from some lawmakers, the
government remains determined to push through with its bid to seek
special powers for the president to accelerate Mindanao's
development.
</P>
<P>
House Majority Leader Eduardo Gullas, on his part, said
Thursday that the congress has the last say on the scope of the
special power that can be extended and the length of time it can
be exercised, or if it should be granted at all.
</P>
<P>
Gullas said in a statement that he is inclined to favor the
granting of special powers to the government "only if it is
intended to revive the battered economy of war-torn Mindanao."
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the congress enacted the Electric Power Crisis
Act in 1993 and gave President Fidel Ramos special powers to solve
the country's energy supply problem.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the congress also enacted the Water Crisis Act to give
President Ramos emergency powers to lick the nation's water supply
crisis, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In both instances, the government was able to fast-track
implementation of vital projects that ultimately solved our power
and water problems," Gullas recalled.

<HEADLINE> Urbanization Improves Living Standards of Peasants (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China gives priority to the development of towns such as Dawang
and regards the growth of towns as the only way to truly modernize
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, in 1999 nearly 15 percent of the surplus laborers
who left their villages found jobs in towns and cities, 5.3
percentage points higher than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The number of urbanites now is only 30 percent of the nation's
population, less than the rate of 40 percent which is required for
the sustained economic development in the country, economists said.
</P>
<P>
China's advanced urbanization is expected to help increase the
nation's domestic demand, and support the development of township
enterprises, which are a powerful force for narrowing the economic
gap between rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Township enterprises are regarded as the economic mainstay in
towns and also the key factor in boosting urbanization in the
country.
</P>
<P>
During the 1978-1999 period, township enterprises across the
country annually provided jobs for an average of six million out-
of-work peasants.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of laborers engaged in agricultural
production accounted for 93 percent of the nation's total
population in 1978, the year China introduced the reform and
opening-up policy, far above the current 61 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers employed in township enterprises is
estimated to rise from the current 125 million to 137 million by
2005.

<TEXT>
<P>
The migrants now earn a living by running stores and working in
township-enterprises in Dawang, seeing the move as the best way to
improve their living standards.
</P>
<P>
For years, the Chinese government tightly controlled the flow
of peasants from rural to urban areas by invoking the permanent
resident system.
</P>
<P>
Chinese peasants used to be able to improve their circumstances
by joining the military or entering university, then moving on to
cities to work and live there.
</P>
<P>
But major changes have occurred since the Chinese government
and economists realized that urbanization is key to the sustained
economic development in the country, allowing peasants to leave
rural areas for urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization helps give jobs to the surplus rural laborers, who
otherwise would be unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, an additional 3,000 villagers have resettled into
Dawang, according to local office in charge of residents'
administration.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, in Shandong Province alone, as many as three
million peasants have moved to towns and cities to work annually,
giving a big push to local economic growth.

JINAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- People in a remote small town in east
China's Shandong province now live a modern-day life, partly
because they have access to consumer goods like Coca-Cola and
fashionable cosmetics that were once only available in big cities.
</P>
<P>
Now on sale in a 40-sq-m supermarket in Dawang Town are
varieties of foreign-brand goods and a number of luxury items.
</P>
<P>
Yan Shousong, 39, owns the store, which is the only one in town
and provides the Yan family's sole source of income. It is
difficult to determine the social status of Yan, who was born to a
peasant family, and whose ancestors lived for generations in Yanji
Village about four km away.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Yan and his family moved out of the small
village and settled in Dawang, a place now seen as an ideal choice
for families seeking the good life.
</P>
<P>
"Dawang is certainly incomparable to big cities like Shanghai
and Beijing, but we could live nearly the same life as urbanites
there," Yan said.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Dawang has been modernized with wide streets, parks,
Yan's supermarket, and entertainment centers. Its population has
risen from just 500 eight years ago to the present 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The influx of peasants from neighboring villages is mostly
responsible for Dawang's reform.

<HEADLINE> China to Put 10 Meteorological Satellites into Orbit in Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China plans to develop and project
ten advanced meteorological satellites into orbit in the coming
decade to improve the accuracy of its weather and natural disaster
forecasts, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Yan Hong, deputy director of the China Meteorological
Administration (CMA), told Xinhua the Chinese Government has
approved a plan by the administration to develop and launch the
satellites at a cost of several billion yuan (several hundred
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The satellites, together with the five meteorological
satellites still orbiting the earth, will help China form a
complete meteorological satellite system in the near future, the
deputy director said.
</P>
<P>
The system will have significant impact on the development of
China's national economy, national defense, disaster prevention
and reduction as well as the everyday life of the general public,
he added.
</P>
<P>
It will facilitate the modernization of the meteorological
industry, increase the capability for long- and medium-term
weather forecasts, and help monitor the ecological conditions in
the western part of China, an ecologically fragile area facing
massive development in the coming century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dong Chaohua, director of the National Satellite
Meteorological Center under CMA, said that of the ten satellites,
the planned Fengyun-3 polar orbit satellite will be used for
global numerical weather prediction, climate forecasts, and
natural disaster and ecological environment monitoring.
</P>
<P>
China has sent five weather satellites, all belonging to the
Fengyun series, into orbit since 1988, and became the third
country in the world to design and launch both solar and earth
synchronous orbit meteorological satellites after the United
States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Fengyun series meteorological satellites, designed by
Chinese experts, shot precise images of various weather conditions
including rainstorm and typhoons, and reflected the images of
landform, sea, vegetation, floods and snowstorms.
</P>
<P>
The satellites have helped to monitor flooding along China's
large rivers including the Yangtze River and forest fires, predict
agricultural production, and search for fishing grounds in the
past decade.

<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China will enroll a group of
researchers to do follow-up studies of the human genome sequencing,
said Yang Huanming, a chief scientist of the Human Genome Project
(HGP) in China today.
</P>
<P>
China has called together a large group of talented personnel
within a short time last year to complete the one percent of the
human genome sequencing.
</P>
<P>
Since the country has developed its genome sequencing capacity
to a higher level, it needs more scientific workers to continue
projects in this field, said Yang.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Genomics Institute has already worked out a plan to
provide positions for several dozens of people from home and
abroad who can either be college graduates, ordinary researchers
or senior experts in this field.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars who are now working overseas are also welcome
to cooperate with the institute to do relevant projects, said
Zhang Meng, a spokesman for the institute, adding that they will
also try to attract more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The institute has introduced 30 sequencers (gene sequencing
machine) from the United States in May, enabling the country to
have a gene sequencing capacity five times bigger than before.
</P>
<P>
The institute has already carried out some genome research
projects which include a project on hybrid super paddy rice and
another on the pig gene sequencing.
</P>
<P>
The institute now has more than 200 staff members, 70 to 80
percent of them had college education, and about one-fourth of
people have postgraduate or doctorate degrees. There are ten
research professors at the institute, half of whom are Chinese
scholars back from abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen people were killed by
armed bandits at a hilly settlement at El-Danaba, Kenya's North
Eastern Province, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Eight other victims, mostly women and children, were seriously
injured in the raid which occurred on Wednesday morning on the
border of Wajir and Mandera districts in northeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the attackers suspected from the
Ajuran clan, said to number over 100 and wielding rifles, raided
the settlement mainly inhabited by the Garreh and Degodia
clansmen.
</P>
<P>
Mandera District Commissioner James Seriani described the
attack as inhuman, and local police suspected the incident was a
revenge attack.
</P>
<P>
Seriani said security personnel, on learning of the attack,
repulsed the raiders who fled into Wajir North, adding that due
to ferocity of the attack, the government had to use artillery
and mortar bombs to beat off the bandits.

<HEADLINE> Former U.S. President Urges Nigerian Govt Branches to Work Harmoniously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Former U. S. President Jimmy Carter
Wednesday called up Nigeria's executive and legislative branches
of government to cooperate to stabilize the nascent civil
government.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Thursday quoted him as saying that when people
have a feeling that their president and congress can not work
together in reasonable comfort, it opens the door for military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's top legislature, the National Assembly, has been seen
lately in constant conflicts with government led by Olusegun
Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo administration often criticizes the National Assembly
for its tardiness in passing bills of vital importance for the
country, while the country's top legislature in turn accusing
from time to time the government of acting arbitrarily.
</P>
<P>
At the same occasion, the visiting former U. S. president
extolled the qualities of Nigerians, saying that the country had
the capacity to lead Africa, if its human resources were properly
harnessed.
</P>
<P>
He said that there were about 27,000 Nigerian medical doctors
practicing in the U.S., and attributed it a clear demonstration of
how intelligent Nigerians were.

<HEADLINE> AOC Stops Doping Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The probe into claims of drug
abuse among top domestic athletes came to an abrupt end on
Thursday after the whistleblower refused to give names.
</P>
<P>
Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) had appointed judge Tricia
Kavanagh to lead an independent inquiry into allegations made by
the dual Olympic discus thrower Werner Reiterer.
</P>
<P>
In his book "Positive" which was released on Wednesday,
Reiterer claimed that officials helped him avoid testing positive
to drug use.
</P>
<P>
He also alleged that swimmers and track athletes were using
illegal human growth hormones, which were undetectable through
conventional doping methods.
</P>
<P>
But the AOC gave up the investigation after the 32-year-old
refused to give names concerned.
</P>
<P>
Reiterer said during a press conference at Sydney that the
corrupt officials he knew of were either retired or were not going
to be involved in an official capacity at the upcoming Sydney
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Believing that identifying individual drugs cheats was not a
solution to the problem, Reiterer said he could not provide any
more details to investigators.
</P>
<P>
Although the AOC inquiry will not go ahead, Reiterer, who had
confessed use of steroids for five years, still faces a two-year
ban from the AOC.
</P>
<P>
The AOC said the investigation could reopen at any time
Reiterer was prepared to cooperate.

<P>
GENEVA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Germany and South Africa drew level
before the final round of voting by the FIFA Executive Committee
to decide the host nation for the 2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
England and Morocco, the other two candidates, crashed out
after the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
Germany and South Africa both polled 11 votes after the second
round of voting by the 24-man executive. The result after the
final round of voting will be announced by FIFA president Sepp
Blatter at 1200 GMT.
</P>
<P>
A bid needs at least 13 votes to be declared the winner. If the
vote is not decisive in the first round, the bottom team will be
eliminated and members will be asked to vote again.
</P>
<P>
Morocco were eliminated in the first round after polling just
three votes. England received five, South Africa six and Germany
10.
</P>
<P>
In the second round Germany and South Africa both polled 11
with England two and therefore out of the running.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that the two votes for England will now
be switched to Germany in the final round giving them a winning 13-
11 margin.

BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A Ministry of Health report

<P>
In 23 of these areas, 70 percent of the iodized salt sold to

The Tibet Autonomous Region is the only provincial area where
children between ages 8 and 10 failed to pass tests on the iodine

his annual report last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was also found to have diverted state funds for
non-budgetary use, such as stock market speculating in 1998. So
far, 85.2 million yuan, or 71.8 percent, of the misused money has
been recovered, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Officials responsible for the unlawful acts have been given
penalties by the Ministry of Supervision, he said, without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Li claimed most of the other departments of the State Council
have redressed their mistakes exposed in his work report last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials and individuals in the Ministry of Finance who used
state treasury funds to start up new companies and erect new
hotels and office buildings have returned the money, according to
the auditor-general.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Taxation last year collected 72
percent of the due revenue that should have been collected in 1998,
and the customs recovered 46 percent of the due tariffs for 1998,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The State Planning Commission, Foreign Ministry and the State
Administration of Civil Aviation also paid back misappropriated
money, he said.

<HEADLINE> Spain Supports Kenya's Rural Electrification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Spanish government has approved
a further credit of 770 million shillings (about 10 million U.S.
dollars) to finance Kenya's rural electrification projects across
the country, Kenyan Energy Minister Francis Lotodo has said.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers in the capital Nairobi Thursday quoted Lotodo as
saying the new credit brings to a total of 1.56 billion shillings
(about 20 million dollars) that Spain has granted to the Kenyan
government for the rural electrification.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks on Tuesday when he handed over
seven vehicles acquired with the Spanish credit to ABB Kenya Ltd.
which has been contracted to implement 32 rural electrification
projects in the first phase of the program.
</P>
<P>
Lotodo said since the inception of rural electrification, his
government had spent 4.5 billion shillings (about 60 million
dollars) on connecting 70,000 consumers to the national grid.
</P>
<P>
He said that electrification of rural areas was part of the
government's primary objective of industrialization and poverty
reduction, and called on other donors to consider financing the
program.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the French government has already committed
itself to financing part of the project in the next three years.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Install Satellite for Rural Coverage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Fidelis Mando, deputy minister of
Zambian Information and Broadcasting Services, has announced that
his ministry will put up a satellite this year to ensure that all
areas in the country have radio and television coverage.
</P>
<P>
Since the program was a presidential directive, it was high on
the ministry's agenda, he was quoted as saying by Thursday's
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He said the satellite would be mounted this year because the
current terrestrial satellite did not cater for rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Mando said because of lack of adequate satellite to transcend
terrestrial transmission, most of the areas in the country
received no television and radio coverage.
</P>
<P>
It was important that rural areas also had access to
communication through both the print and electronic media, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mando, who was speaking in an interview in Lusaka early this
week, said due to physical barriers such as mountains which
blocked the process, the current terrestrial transmission was
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
The government was not only working on the satellite but would
also install rural telephones and other better services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mando said the satellite would be in place once the on-going
negotiations with cooperating partners were concluded.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Hits Romania, Causes Economic Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A heat wave in Romania that
upgraded thermometers to their highest in July in a hundred years
has caused economic damage in the country, especially in the field
of agriculture, media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The phenomenon is unprecedented," and never since temperature
started being measured in this country has this time of the year,
that is early July, recorded such temperatures, said Vladimir
Ivanovici, scientific manager of the National Institute of
Meteorology and Hydrology.
</P>
<P>
Calafat reported 43.2 degrees centigrade and Turnu Severin 42
degrees. Both towns are situated in the southern part of the
country, by the Danube, where the record temperatures of July so
far had been 41.5 and 40 degrees respectively, Ivanovici said.
</P>
<P>
These high temperatures, with the severe drought of the past
few months, caused big damage to agriculture. In some areas, the
cereal crops are spoilt to a great extent. On the other hand,
numerous fires damaged some pastures, hayfields and forests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as three people were reported dead due to the hot
weather, the authorities have taken steps to protect employees.
</P>
<P>
In the noon hours, passenger trains run at slower speed and
freight trains do not run at all, as high temperatures cause the
rails to buckle in the heat.
</P>
<P>
Water consumption has been rationed in some places.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters announce that the heat wave will continue
into the coming days, although they hope for somehow lower
temperatures.

make unremitting efforts to work for the setting up of a new world
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
"With the advent of the new century, what kind of a new
international order should we establish is a question that we must
think carefully," Jiang said during his talks with Turkmenistan
President Saparmurad Niyazov, according to officials with the
Chinese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
On this question, Jiang said, China stands for upholding the
principles of maintaining peace and opposing the use of military
force, mutual respect and equality of sovereignty, independent
choice of ways of development and mutual accommodation, and
mutually beneficial cooperation for common development in the
process of setting up the new world order.
</P>
<P>
All disputes between countries should be solved through
negotiations and consultation, and not through military force or
the threat of using military force, he said, noting that the Cold
War mentality and all forms of hegemony must be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, countries in the world, big or small, rich or poor,
strong or weak, are all equal members of the international
community, and therefore, all have the rights to be involved, or
have a say, in the world affairs, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Every country, he said, has the right to independently choose
the way of social development in accordance with the specific and
indigenous national conditions.
</P>
<P>
The differences in historical background, in culture and
tradition, in social systems, and in values and ideologies should
not become hurdles in the way of developing normal state-to-state
relations. Rather, the difference should be the root cause and
driving force for exchanges and cooperation, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president called on countries in the world to join
hands in equal and mutually beneficial cooperation in an effort to
promote common development.
</P>
<P>
It is only with mutual coordination and close cooperation of
the international community can the world solve the global
problems of the deteriorating eco-environment, poverty, drug
trafficking, and rampant organized crimes, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Wednesday evening on a three-day state visit,
the first by a Chinese head of state to Turkmenistan, after a two-
day state visit to Tajikistan, where he also attended the fifth
summit meeting of the "Shanghai Five" nations.
</P>
<P>
The "Shanghai Five" nations are China, Tajikistan, Russia,
Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Says China Wants Closer Ties With Central Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASHKHABAD, Turkmenistan, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin said here Thursday morning that China was willing to
continue strengthening ties with the five neighboring Central
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Such ties are being developed on the basis of the Five
Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other universally
recognized norms governing international relations, Jiang said
when meeting with the press alongside Turkmenistani President
Saparmurad Niyazov after the two heads of state held their formal
talks.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, on a three-day state visit to this Central Asian nation,
told the press that the development of the long-term, steady good-
neighborly and mutually beneficial relations with the five nations
in Central Asia "constitutes an important part of China's foreign
policy."
</P>
<P>
The five nations referred to are Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
"China respects the development path chosen by people in
Central Asian countries on the basis of their national conditions,
and appreciates and supports their efforts for safeguarding
national independence and sovereignty, and for promoting national
and regional stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
On economic and trade cooperation between China and these
countries, Jiang said that China is ready to expand economic links
with them on the basis of equality and mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese President, mutual investment will be
encouraged and protected. New ways and means will be explored to
fully tap the resources and the compatibility of different markets
in the region for common development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He particularly mentioned that China will enhance its
cooperation with Central Asian nations in the area of
communication. All parties are encouraged to take advantage of the
Euroasia Land Bridge, an inter-continental railway system running
from China's coastal area to European harbors, and the existing
inter-state highway system for "the revival of the ancient Silk
Road," as Jiang put it.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all countries in the region to strengthen
cooperation on regional security and stability. Effective measures
should be taken to crack down upon all forms of separatism,
terrorism and extremism to create an environment favorable for
regional development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"We are opposed to any outside forces, in particular military
blocs, which destabilize and undermine the interest and security
of nations in this region," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> China's Fund Market Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The securities investment fund
market in China was still in a correction today.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Stock Exchange Fund Index, which represents 12 new
funds in Shanghai, closed at 1010.93 points today, down 0.34
percent from 1014.41 points at the last close.
</P>
<P>
Among the 26 funds on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets, four
rose, seven remained unchanged and the rest declined. As to the
five funds that dropped more than one percent, Fund Jintai fell 1.
69 percent and the other four were all restructured funds. In
particular, Fund Tongzhi, Fund Yuze and Fund Zhujiang descended 7.
2 percent, 4.03 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The four funds that rose today include Fund Xinghua, Fund
Hanxing, Fund Pufeng and Fund Jintai. Fund Xinghua, which rose 1.7
percent today, may have something to do with the Bird Co., Ltd.
which made its debut on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and had its
share priced at more than 35 yuan today.

<HEADLINE> Chinese T-bond Market Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasury bonds market saw
broad but moderate pickups today, with trading volume on the
market expanding by 390 million yuan to 48 billion yuan compared
with Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The most active performer on the market, the 10-year 010004
with the interest rate floating by 0.62 percentage points above
the benchmark interest rate on one-year deposits, gained the most
by closing 0.20 percent higher at 101.94 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Bond 000696, an 11.83 percent bond due 2006, ended the session
up 0.15 percent, or 0.21 yuan at 142.65 yuan, pressing the yield
down 0.03 percentage points to 3.81 percent. All the other bonds
finished up less than 0.10.
</P>
<P>
The Export and Import Bank of China (Eximbank) issued five
billion yuan (602 million US dollars) worth of financial bonds on
the interbank bond market on Wednesday. The basic interest spread
was set at 0.555 percent. As the current one-year rate for
deposits at China's financial institutions stands at 2.25 percent,
the nominal annual interest rate for the bonds is 2.805 percent
before the central People's Bank of China (PBOC) revises the one-
year rate.
</P>
<P>
The issuance was the first time the policy bank chose a
floating rate to circumvent interest rate risks, marking major
progress in its market-orientated bond issue reform.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine financial institutions, including commercial banks,
insurance companies and urban and rural credit co-operatives,
entered bids, oversubscribing the offer by more than six times and
demonstrating the abundance of funds held by the bidders.
</P>
<P>
Though the new financial bond issuance was on the inter-bank
market, it has drained some money from current treasuries and
partly explained for the thin T-bond trade.
</P>
<P>
Today the trade volume on three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-
day repo transactions climbed by 4.73 billion yuan to 6.74 billion
yuan. However, the interest rate on the three-day transaction
edged down slightly by 0.05 percentage points to 3.75 percent.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopes to Resume Talks With MILF Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it is hopeful that it can resume peace talks with
the secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) sometime
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
said Thursday that this was the assessment he got from chief
government negotiator Edgardo Batenga.
</P>
<P>
"I talked with General Batenga Wednesday. He said the peace
talks with the MILF will push through," Mercado said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
Mercado made this clear even as he belied persistent reports
that he gave the military a deadline to overrun Camp Abubakar, the
headquarters of the MILF in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned our objective is to degrade the
military capability of the MILF. That's what we're doing now," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But Mercado also scored the MILF for its use of civilians as
human shields in protecting itself from military attacks. He
branded as an old excuse the MILF's claim that Camp Abubakar is
only a collection of communities composed mostly of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Mercado reiterated the government's position that it will not
allow the MILF to conduct harassment operations against soldiers
and civilians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Presidential Palace said the government continues
to maintain open lines of communication and pursue back channeling
peace efforts with the MILF in its desire to secure a just and
enduring peace in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said that the two conditions set by
President Joseph Estrada -- for the MILF to renounce its bid for
an independent Islamic state and for it to stop its terrorist and
criminal acts --- must be satisfied for the talks to progress.

BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Today's cultural relics news briefs:
</P>
<P>
 Ancient Tool Made of Antler Discovered in Ningxia
</P>
<P>
A tool made from an antler dating back to the Western Xia
Dynasty (1308-1227) was recently discovered in Haiyuan County,
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The tool is 12.9 cm long and is carved with an image of an
animal's head. Experts said the tool was used to help untie ropes
which fastened tents.
</P>
<P>
They said that Li Yuanhao, founding emperor of the Western Xia
Dynasty, had a temporary dwelling place in Haiyuan County.
</P>
<P>
 More Relics of Han Dynasty Unearthed in Chongqing
</P>
<P>
A batch of relics from the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. - 220 A.D.)
have been unearthed at a group of Han tombs at Luozhouba, Wulong
County of Chongqing Municipality in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Among the items is a man-made money tree with a copper trunk
and copper coins hanging from its branches. The tree once stood on
a porcelain pedestal, said experts. A round mirror, with a 6.2 cm
diameter, has four birds carved on its back. Several coins from
the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220) were also excavated at the same
time.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Cause of Explosion in South China Determined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Police have determined that
Monday's explosion in a water tunnel of south China's Gaohu
Reservoir was caused by a bomb planted by local people angry about
a controversial water diverting project.
</P>
<P>
Six people near the tunnel at the time of the blast died from
suffocation, said police in Puning City, Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The water diverting project, built by Daping township
government, is located on the border of Daping and the township of
Shuichun, whose residents oppose the plan.
</P>
<P>
Shuichun residents worried that the project would negatively
affect the township's irrigation and the hydro-electric power
generating.
</P>
<P>
The criminal case, which has drawn concern from the provincial
government, is under intensive investigation.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai B-share Market Down at Thursday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market
remained bearish throughout the Thursday session, gradually
widening its early losses in late trading on mounting selling
pressure.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index dropped 1.17 points, or 2.11 percent, to 54.
37 at the close.
</P>
<P>
Turnover extended to 15.14 million U.S. dollars(RMB 125.66
million), compared with 12.30 million U.S. dollars on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The selling pressure increased late in the session as investors
continued to fret about corporate earnings and could turn nowhere
else to determine the direction, said Homeway, China's leading on-
line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outpaced advancing shares by 44 to 3, with
seven unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Sh Refrig Comp rose 3.81 percent to 0.118 U.S. dollar, while
Rubber Belt inched up 0.78 percent to 0.260 U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
ST Steel Tube slipped 4.84 percent to 0.118 U.S. dollar, while
Shanghai Hero fell 4.80 percent to 0.238 U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The market will continue to trade in a narrow range and with a
negative bias as broad-based weakness has been too much for the
market to overcome, said Homeway analysts. Many investors may want
to sell positions and head to the sidelines to wait for some
direction towards the end of the week.

Ltd. made their debuts today. They were also the top gainers with

<HEADLINE> Syria's New Leader to Visit Turkey on First Foreign Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The first foreign visit of Syria's
new leader Bashar al-Assad will be paid to Turkey, which will turn
a new page in Turco-Syrian relations, Turkish Daily News quoted
Syrian charge d'affaires in Ankara Said al-Bunni as saying on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Damascus is expecting an official invitation from Ankara for the
visit.
</P>
<P>
Bashar, son of late President Hafez al-Assad who died of heart
attack last month at age 69, is the hand-picked heir of his father.
He is poised to be elected Syrian president in the public vote
slated for July 10.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the young Syrian leader recently expressed his
decision to pay his first official visit to Ankara in response to
Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer's presence at his father's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, the Turkish president vowed to work with
Syria's new leader to iron out problems in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian trip was Sezer's first foreign visit since he took
office on May 16. He was also the first Turkish president to visit
Damascus since 1990, when the late President Turgut Ozal visited
Syria on a regional tour following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that both countries were prepared to improve
bilateral relations to strengthen economic cooperations and
domestic developments.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian diplomat said that following Bashar's visit, a number
of Syrian ministers are also expected to visit Ankara, indicating
that a new stage of relations between the two neighbors is on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria have long been at odds over a series of issues,
ranging from Damascus' support for Kurdish separatist rebels
fighting the Ankara government to the sharing of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Tensions peaked in 1998 after Turkey threatened a military
offensive if Syria continued to support Kurdish rebels in southeast
Turkey and shelter the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK),
Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The crisis lasted several weeks until Egyptian and Iranian
mediators oversaw an accord signed between them in the southern
Turkish town of Adana.
</P>
<P>
Damascus was worried about the increasing strategic partnership
between Turkey and Israel, which is still occupying the Golan
Heights it seized from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Sharing the waters of the Euphrates and Tigris, which originate
in Turkey and flow down to Syria and Iraq, is another major point
of contention between Turkey and drought-stricken Syria.
</P>
<P>
Damascus claims Turkey's construction of dams on the rivers has
reduced the water flow to Syria, while Turkey says it releases to
Syria more than the 500 cubic meters of water per second as agreed
in a 1987 bilateral protocol.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Reduce Production Costs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Several multinational corporations
in Zambia may relocate their operations after the implementation
of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Free
Trade Area (FTA) if production costs continue to rise in Zambia, a
Zambian official has said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) spokesman Kark
O'Donnell explained that the current high production costs in
Zambia would render its produced goods uncompetitive within the
regional market and most exporters would lose out, Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted O'Donnell as saying most companies, multinationals in
 particular, would rationalize and relocate their activities to a
cheaper location in order to be able to compete in the regional
market.
</P>
<P>
"This is not merely a distinct possibility, it will happen
since it's a rational way of doing business," O'Donnell said.
</P>
<P>
He said that most multinationals would locate to coastal areas
with readily accessed port facilities where their inputs like
electricity and fuel costs were comparatively lower.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured goods from such cheaper locations would then be
distributed to markets within the region.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the need for dialog between the private sector
and the Zambian government as a way of finding way towards
adjustments in policies which would assist the local manufacturer
to compete.
</P>
<P>
Foremost among the policy adjustments should be the levels of
duty on imported raw materials, the costs of electricity and fuel
and the non tariff barriers being imposed by some members of
COMESA.
</P>
<P>
He cited stringent sanitary regulations, certification
requirements and the 15 percent price disadvantage provision as
among the non tariff barriers that would work against exports.
</P>
<P>
Under the 15 percent price disadvantage provision in the
countries where it is applicable, local companies can be given
tenders even when their bids are 15 percent higher than a foreign
bidder.

<HEADLINE> China, Turkmenistan to Expand Economic, Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASHKHABAD, Turkmenistan, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China and
Turkmenistan agreed here on Thursday to further expand their
bilateral cooperation in economy and trade so as to keep in pace
with the development of the overall friendly relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a meeting between visiting
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who arrived here Wednesday evening
on a three-day state visit, and Turkmenistan President Saparmurad
Niyazov.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement, signed by the two presidents, was issued
after their talks earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said that in an earnest and friendly
atmosphere, the two leaders had an indepth exchange of views on
bilateral relations and on regional and international issues of
common concern, and reached broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that the state visit by Jiang, the
first by a Chinese head of state to Turkmenistan, was successful
and helped bring the Sino-Turkmenistani friendship to a new height.
</P>
<P>
They promised to continue high-level exchanges and promote
bilateral contacts and exchanges in all fields, so as to
continuously expand the friendly cooperation between them.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed on the need to further develop
bilateral trade and economic relations, pointing out that there is
a great potential and excellent prospects in the area of trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They assured each other of the willingness of their respective
countries to further expand bilateral economic and trade
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents attached particular importance to the
mutually beneficial cooperation in the field of energy, with China
expressing its willingness to encourage Chinese enterprises to
take part in Turkmenistan's effort to develop the country's oil
and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint statement, the two countries decided
that with the implementation of China's project to transport
natural gas from the western part of the country to its east, the
two countries will conduct feasibility study on the construction
of a natural gas pipeline linking Turkmenistan with China.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to promote bilateral exchanges
and cooperation in science and technology, culture, education,
health, media sports and other fields.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that China and Turkmenistan will strengthen
their coordination and take effective measure to fight against
separatism, terrorism and extremism, and crack down upon illegal
arms sales, drug trafficking, illegal immigration and other
criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
The two countries promised that they will not allow any
organizations and forces to engage in any forms of activities in
one country to undermine the sovereignty, security and stability
of the other, the joint statement said.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan reiterated its position that the government of the
People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government
representing the whole China and Taiwan is an inseparable part of
the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenistan is opposed to any attempt to create "two Chinas,"
or "one China, one Taiwan" as well as the independence of Taiwan
and Taiwan's entry into any international organization with the
membership of statehood, the statement said. It reaffirmed that
Turkmenistan will never establish any official relations with
Taiwan and conduct any official exchanges.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, senior officials from the two countries signed
a framework agreement under which China will provide preferential
loans to Turkmenistan and an agreement on bilateral cooperation on
oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Wednesday evening after a two-day state

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-share Market down at Thursday Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market index
ran on another losing streak and easily breached the
psychologically important 110 points in the morning as selling
pressures mounted up.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index plunged 2.99 points, or 2.68 percent, to
close narrowly off its session lows at 108.56.
</P>
<P>
Turnover broadened to 141.30 million HK dollars (RMB149.78
million), which was 75.82 million HK dollars or 115.79 percent
more than Wednesday's total.
</P>
<P>
Foshan Huaxin Packaging Co. Ltd rose as much as 20.24 percent
in its debut on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, amid the investor
enthusiasm for the first new issue of B-shares foreigners can buy
in two years on the exchange, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The company's successful listing helped lift investor interest
in two other initial share sales by Chinese companies, which was
in the meantime draining money from those already-listed shares
and left the door open to a rather steep southward move in the
market.
</P>
<P>
Losers overwhelmingly beat gainers by 49 to 5, with one
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Among other advancers, Shzh Tellus rose 1.74 percent to 1.75 HK
dollars, while ST Pro &AMP; ResDev added 0.81 percent to 1.25 HK
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan Boiler cut 6.54 percent to 1.43 HK dollars, while Chiwan
Base shed 6.27 percent to 2.39 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The market will continue to trade within a narrow range and
with a negative bias, analysts with Homeway said. Investors may
either want to sell positions to leave money for the purchase of
new shares or head to the sidelines to wait for some direction
towards the end of the week.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton will convene a summit with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat next Tuesday at Camp David, a
remote presidential retreat in Maryland, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Barak, however, immediately suffered a coalition setback when
Interior Ministry Natan Sharansky announced his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Barak had called upon his coalition partners, particularly
Yisrael Ba'aliya led by Sharansky and the National Religious Party,
to remain in the government for the time being. He said Israel will
be much better going to these crucial negotiations with as broad a
base of support as possible.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak said on Wednesday that he will lead the Israeli
delegation to next week's three-way summit meeting "with a heavy
sense of responsibility for the future of the Jewish people."
</P>
<P>
Barak said he would strive to "achieve separation from the
Palestinians and create relations of good neighbors with them,
while maintaining our red lines."
</P>
<P>
During his just-concluded trip to Europe, Barak told reporters "
Even if I stay with nine (cabinet) ministers and one quarter of the
Knesset (parliament) behind me, we will do it."
</P>
<P>
President Clinton of the U.S. acknowledged there were "no easy
answers and certainly no painless ones." He said an attempt would
be made to reach an agreement before September 13 - when the
interim agreement expires and the Palestinians may declare an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Supreme Court President Aharon Barak promised that a
verdict on non-Orthodox conversions would come soon, after an 11-
justice panel concluded its hearing on the matter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the hearing, the state appealed a decision by Jerusalem
District Court President Vardi Zeiler recognizing, for identity
card purposes, dozens of Reform conversions, carried out in Israel
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Political instability and public pressure has led the
Treasury to extract nine articles, including some seen as key
elements, of the proposed Ben-Bassat Committee tax reform
recommendations, Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shochat said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The abridged plan takes into account the changes demanded by the
Histadrut labor federation - which threatened to call a general
strike if its demands were not met - and by other pressure groups.
</P>
<P>
Shochat said that "in financial terms, 70 percent of the
original plan remains, but a great deal more remains in terms of
quality." The tax reform plan was drawn up by a blue-ribbon
commission of 11 experts headed by Finance Ministry Director-
General Avi Ben-Bassat.

<P>
ANKARA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Wednesday that
all political parties except Nationalist Action Party (MHP) were
sharing the consensus for lifting the death sentence in Turkey,
adding that the abolishment was a must for Turkey' accession to the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
He said that he proposed to a summit of the three ruling
partners to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit expressed pessimism
about the result of the third round proximity talks on Cyprus held
in Geneva on Wednesday, saying that the Greek Cypriots refused to
recognize the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that some European Union members were
encouraging Greek Cypriots to pursue such a rigid attitude toward
Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Zaman:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James Dobbins, who is
responsible for European affairs, concluded his three-day visit to
Turkey on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Turkish officials, both sides exchanged
views on various issues ranging from Cyprus, European Security and
Defense Identity (ESDI) to Turco-Greek relations and Turco-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- In Istanbul's two prisons, prisoners took guards hostages and
rioted on Wednesday, protesting the transfer of their fellow
inmates to other prisons.
</P>
<P>
Because of the rebellion, extra police and fire brigade teams
were sent to the area. Negotiations between the prisoners and the
police were under way.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Lawmakers Propose Inspection of Prisons: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian lawmakers have proposed to
inspect the prisons around the country in a bid to "better protect
the legal rights of the inmates," local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There may be violations of standards or trampling of rights in
prisons, so "we are going to send a delegation to check into the
cases," said Musavi Khoeini, a reformist deputy from Tehran and
co-sponsor of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Khoeini cited as an example in point the case of Akbar Ganji, a
reformist journalist who was jailed in April on charges of
violating Islamic values and principles and advocating U.S.-style
reforms. Ganji was said to have been mistreated and was not allowed
to contact his family.
</P>
<P>
Ganji was able to make himself heard, but there may be a lot of
others in prisons who are hardly known and are unable to voice
their grievances, Khoeini said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Majlis has the right to supervise government
departments, including the conservative-controlled Judiciary which
in the past few months closed some 18 reformist papers and journals
and sent a number of reformist journalist into prison.
</P>
<P>
The tension between reformists and the conservative
establishment heightened following the February 18 parliamentary
elections, which resulted in the overwhelming victory of reformers
supporting President Mohammad Khatami's liberal programs.
</P>
<P>
Although reformers have absolute control in the new parliament,
which started work on May 27, their power is limited, as all bills
passed by the legislative body have to be approved by the
conservative Guardians Council. The conservatives also control many
other key state organs, including the military.
</P>
<P>
Khoeini, a member of the reformist Islamic Iran Participation
Front, said a parliamentary delegation would be sent to all
official prisons of the country after the proposal was approved by
the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the delegation could be dispatched before the
Majlis' summer vacation which begins on July 22 and lasts for 15
days.
</P>
<P>
On the possible reaction from the judiciary to the proposal,
Khoeini said the Judiciary should welcome the initiative.
Otherwise, "the ambiguities in the public opinion would be
increased," he said.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Leader Acknowledges Challenge Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- East Timor leader Xanana Gusmao
said here Thursday his country still faces difficult challenges as
it moves towards independence next year.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao, in New Zealand for a six-day visit, made the remark
when he was briefing a New Zealand parliamentary select committee
on the current situation and future prospects for his country.
</P>
<P>
Last September saw the people of East Timor vote overwhelmingly
for independence in a UN sponsored referendum after 24 years of
occupation by Indonesian forces.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao said his country was facing a difficult challenge as it
moves towards its first general elections, which may be held in
August next year.
</P>
<P>
"Full independence will not be an easy job as East Timorese
haven't had experience in decision-making or held positions in
high government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the most immediate issues are to address the crimes
against humanity and dealing with the problem of refugees still in
West Timor.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao said East Timor appreciates the help and assistance it
has been receiving from the international community, but is aiming
for self sufficiency and wants to develop relationships based on
mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said his country is weighing up the advantages and
disadvantages of belonging to either the Association of South East
Asian Nations (ASEAN) or the Pacific Forum. But he indicated his
country is interested in joining a forum of small countries.

<HEADLINE> New Zealanders Deeper in Debt Mire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders are sinking into
more and more debt, with household liabilities more than doubling
in the 10 years, the Evening Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper quoted figures released by the
New Zealand central bank, Reserve Bank, as showing that household
debt as a percentage of personal disposable income remained at
about 50 percent between 1978 and 1987. It then started to climb,
hitting 100 percent in 1997 and is now at about 111 percent.
</P>
<P>
That means that even if every New Zealander put every cent of
their earnings for one year into paying off their loans, they
still wouldn't be debt-free.
</P>
<P>
In the five years to December 1999, household borrowing
increased by 30 billion NZ dollars (14.1 billion U.S. dollars) or
70 percent. A factor is the introduction of tertiary loans for
students last decade, which now make up 4 percent of total
household debt.
</P>
<P>
"As we've borrowed more, we've saved less. In 1981 we saved 11
percent of our income; in 1998 our savings rate fell below 0
percent for the first time, which means we're not saving anything
at all," the paper quoted Reserve Bank economist Clive Thorp as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Three Wildfires Still Burn in U.S. Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Three wildfires in western
Colorado were burning out of control Wednesday, scorching more
than 13,100 acres, local officials reported.
</P>
<P>
The Cone Mountain fire 60 kilometers southwest of Grand
Junction, Colorado, has consumed 3,300 acres and has quadrupled in
size since it was detected on Monday, said Bill Kight, spokesman
for the U.S. Forest Service Interagency Dispatch Center.
</P>
<P>
Access to the rugged site has hampered firefighting efforts,
and the fire is threatening three homes and several historical
mining-camp structures, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kight said firefighters from local state and federal agencies
are on site, fighting against the wildfire. Meanwhile, they also
battled two other wildfires on Colorado's northwest plateau near
the Utah border.
</P>
<P>
The largest blaze, the Buster Flats fire in the Dinosaur
National Monument, has burned 9,000 acres since it erupted Monday.
Authorities have ordered local residents to evacuate to the nearby
Gates of Ladore and Brown's National Wildlife Refuge campgrounds
as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
The most recent blaze, the Klinger fire 30 kilometers southwest
of Rangley ignited sometime Tuesday and has consumed 800 acres by
late Wednesday afternoon, said Robin Sill, spokeswoman for the
Craig Interagency Dispatch Center.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the cause of the blazes was unknown.
</P>
<P>
The fire season is shaping up as the worst since 1996,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho. It
began more than a month ago with blazes engulfing areas of Florida
and the Southwest, most notably in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
About 44,300 fires covering more than 1.2 million acres have
been recorded nationwide so far, with drought getting worse in the
West.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Latinos Still Get Low Wages Despite Booming Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A report released here said
Wednesday that while the booming economy provided a lift for many
American workers, Hispanics earned half what whites did in 1998,
with many stuck in low-paying jobs that offered little promise of
advancement.
</P>
<P>
A growing but poorer Hispanic work force could hurt the
nation's ability to compete globally and fund government programs
such as Social Security, said Sonia Perez, a labor researcher for
the National Conference of La Raza and editor of the 230-page
report.
</P>
<P>
"This isn't about being nice to Latino people. This is about
America's future and our best interests as a nation," said Perez.
The report was released at La Raza's annual conference.
</P>
<P>
La Raza President Raul Yzaguirre said an increase in the number
of part-time and low-skill jobs has played a part in keeping
Latinos in lower paying jobs. But he said such factors are not
unique to the Latino community.
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when a strong back and an ability to read and
write would mean a good job in the manufacturing sector,"
Yzaguirre said. "That is no longer the case. Now we are seeing
extremely well-paying jobs or very low paying jobs."
</P>
<P>
Latinos face other barriers to better jobs, including having
less education compared to whites and blacks, said Perez. She said
more federal funding should be allocated to programs like Head
Start, in which Hispanics are underrepresented nationally.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income for Hispanics rose 4.5 percent to 11,434 U.S.
dollars in 1998, while per capita income for blacks rose 3.3
percent to 12,957 dollars and white per capita earnings rose 3.2
percent to 22,952 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The median income for Hispanic married-couple families was 34,
816 dollars, compared to 54,736 dollars for white families.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Prepares for Flood Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Wuhan, an important industrial city
on the middle reaches of Yangtze River, has been making tense
preparations for this year's flood season on the mighty river.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, Wuhan, the capital of central China
's Hubei Province, has rebuilt and repaired 16 major dangerous
sections of the embankments on both sides of the Yangtze, and
conducted carpet examinations over all reservoirs in the city so
as to find and solve the hidden dangers in advance. It has also
upgraded equipment at the city's 15 major pumping stations.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city has prepared plenty of equipment and
material needed for combating possible flooding, including 245,000
cu m of sand and stone, 200,000 pieces of jute bags and 5,400 life
vests and buoys.
</P>
<P>
A local flood control official told Xinhua that they have
prepared more flood control material this year than they did in
1998, when serious floods occurred on the Yangtze, causing serious
economic damages.
</P>
<P>
Though Wuhan had been hit by a major drought early this year,
the average monthly water level in the Yangtze from January to
April of this year was nevertheless higher than that in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists and hydrologists believe that this year's flood
control task will not be lighter than before as more rainfall had
been predicted in valleys and on the upper reaches of the Yangtze
and Hanjiang River, a main tributary of Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the first flood peak on the Yangtze has
passed Jianli, a major hydrological station on Yangtze, and is
expected to reach Wuhan this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
By 14:00 hours yesterday, the water level of the main stream of
the Yangtze monitored at the Wuhan Tower was 24.97 meters and by
Saturday when the first flood crest is passing, the water level
may climb to 25.65 meters.

<P>
The bullish market has clearly attracted more investors. In mid-
June, the number of investors with accounts in the two bourses
increased to 50 million, or 10 million more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, 50 new stocks were listed on the two
bourses, making the total number of listed stocks to 1,081,
including 973 A share stocks and 108 B share stocks.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts here said the bullish market is a
reflection of the positive changes in China's macroeconomic
situation.
</P>
<P>
They cited growth in gross national product, social retail
sales and other key economic indices as proof that the country's
economy has emerged from its slump and is moving into a new period
of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji seems to share that view. He claimed
recently that the Chinese economy has moved out of the shadow of
the Asian financial crisis and is entering a benign cycle.
</P>
<P>
The market regulators' new policies such as allotment to
secondary market investors in new stock issuance, allowing
insurance companies buying mutual funds and mortgage loans for
securities dealers, also helped boost the market, the analysts
said.

<HEADLINE> West Developing Strategy Good Chance for SOE Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Wu Bangguo has said
that the west-developing strategy has brought about good
opportunities for the restructuring of local state-owned
enterprises (SOE) in China's underdeveloped areas.
</P>
<P>
The official made the remark during an investigation trip in
the southwest provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou from June 29 to July
5. During his stay, Wu visited nine major local SOEs and talked
with local officials and managers.
</P>
<P>
Calling the strategy a significant move of the central
leadership, the vice premier urged western provinces and ethnic
autonomous regions to fully recognize its political and economic
importance.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be made to enhance the living standards of local
people so that they can truly feel the generosity of the Party,
the correctness of central policies, and the advantages of
socialism, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the strategy will require the long, hard effort
of several generations of local people to lessen the gap between
the eastern and western parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan and Guizhou, both rich in natural resources, should make
use of their own advantages, the official said. Furthermore, he
noted, the provinces are well developed in certain fields such as
biomedicine and electronics.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankans Warned Against Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS  By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankans, especially migrant
workers and military personnel, have been warned against
vulnerability to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) despite a low prevalence in this
South Asian island country.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes as some 178 countries are preparing to send
delegates to attend the 13th World AIDS Conference which is due to
be held in Durban, South Africa from July 9. The week-long
conference will focus on breaking the silence over the disease
which has killed millions, according to conference organizers.
</P>
<P>
The first HIV/AIDS positive case in Sri Lanka was reported in
1987. Since then the number of those infected has been increasing.
The United Nations has estimated that at present there are up to 8,
000 Sri Lankans who are infected with HIV, and warns that the
number could increase 10-fold over the next five years if no
action is taken.
</P>
<P>
While Sri Lanka is seen as a low prevalence country at present,
medical experts and other academics here said the disease could
spread rapidly due to Sri Lanka's proximity to India, the high
number of Sri Lankans working abroad, long-running civil war and
lack of awareness.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Tudor Silva of Sri Lanka's prestigious University of
Peradeniya said one of the main factors that contribute to the
vulnerability is Sri Lanka's proximity to India, which is "soon to
become an epicenter for transmission of HIV/AIDS."
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations, one quarter of the some 31
million people infected worldwide live in Asia and India is now
the country with the largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Although Asia has avoided a large-scale epidemic, a cooperation
action is needed to halt its spread as Asian developing countries
"cannot afford the human and financial toll of an AIDS epidemic,"
Vice-President of World Bank for South Asia region Meiko Nishimizu
told the fifth international conference on AIDS in Asia held in
Kuala Lumpur in October, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka's battle against HIV/AIDS, migrant workers and
military personnel have been identified as new high risk groups as
large numbers of women seek employment abroad and the ethnic civil
war drags into the 17th year.
</P>
<P>
The migrant workers are important for this cash-starved Indian
Ocean island. Sri Lankans working abroad have topped the list of
foreign exchange earners in recent years, sending home 923 million
U.S. dollars in 1999. According to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign
Employment, the total number of Sri Lankan workers abroad is
estimated to be around 788,000, of whom 65 percent are females
mostly as housemaids. Some housemaids are sexually exploited by
their employers.
</P>
<P>
Health officials expressed fear that the large number of Sri
Lankan workers returning from abroad might be bringing the deadly
disease with them. They said they were planning to carry out large-
scale AIDS prevention measures, including blood-testing in the
country.
</P>
<P>
At least five HIV-positive cases have been identified early
this year. All of them had been affected while they were abroad.
The latest two victims were detected when they came for treatment
complaining of phlegm and fever. One victim, a married woman, had
recently returned from Germany and the other, was a 23-year-old
youth who returned from Bangkok after three years.
</P>
<P>
Apart from external threats, Sri Lanka faces internal war
situation which leaves the country vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Large
number of soldiers have been stationed in Sri Lanka's north and
east to fight Tamil Tiger rebels who are waging a war to carve out
a separate homeland called Eelam since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, who are separated from their families and normal
society, are the perfect target for the commercial sex trade. "It
is only natural that a sex industry gets established," said Prof.
Silva.
</P>
<P>
He added that soldiers are not the only group made vulnerable
by the war, wives of soldiers and war widows face similar problems.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey to gauge awareness among young people about HIV/
Aids revealed teenagers are mostly ignorant about the killer
disease. Some even believe that the HIV virus is transmitted by
mosquitoes, swimming, kissing, sharing cups and plates, wearing
each-other's clothes, handling money and hugging. In many schools
in Sri Lanka, AIDS is a "four-letter" word -- that is taboo to
talk about.
</P>
<P>
To create awareness among young people, the AIDS Coalition for
Care, Education and Support Services (ACCESS), a top non-
governmental group involved in AIDS/HIV education, has launched a
"Youth for AIDS awareness" project.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kamalika Abeyratne, chairwoman of ACCESS, said one of the
main problems faced by those HIV/AIDS sufferers was isolation.
</P>
<P>
"Make one small mistake with this deadly virus - in my case the
mistake was not even mine - and you will suddenly find that you
have become less than human," she said, who being a practicing
doctor was infected by a contaminated needle.
</P>
<P>
To counter the emerging menace of HIV/AIDS spread, Sri Lanka
launched its first telephone counseling service on HIV/AIDS in
March this year. The AIDS helpline, which is open four hours a day,
was funded by the Australian Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
The new helpline, which is staffed by volunteers, is aimed at
preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS as well as making contact
with those already affected and their families by offering
information and support.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said the helpline is only a first step. They said
the spread of HIV/AIDS in Sri Lanka can be stopped only if
everyone takes responsibility and prevention -- including public
awareness of safe sex -- should be given top priority.

<HEADLINE> Drought Cuts Production in Southern U.S. States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Georgia, peanut farmers, hit by drought, cheap imports and
low prices, expect to harvest their smallest crop since 1982.
Georgia produces almost half of the nation's domestic peanut
supplies, much of it for peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
Sugar cane stalks in Louisiana have virtually stopped growing,
says Howard Cormier, a specialist with the Ag Center in Vermilion
Parish.
</P>
<P>
Honey production has suffered, too. Experts say that dry
conditions mean flowering plants do not produce as much pollen, a
main source of protein and vitamins for bees. The plants also do
not produce as much nectar, the sweet liquid bees collect from
flowers to make honey, they added.
</P>
<P>
Ideally, honey bees need ample rainfall in the early spring and
then dry conditions in May, when the bulk of the honey is produced.
But "when there's enough of a drought, something has to give,"
says Keith Delaplane, a bee specialist with the University of
Georgia Extension Service in Athens.
</P>
<P>
In Louisiana, where rainfall is 20 inches (about 0.5 meter)
below normal along the state's vast coastal marshes and salty
water from the Gulf of Mexico is seeping into fresh water
estuaries, oyster fishermen are hauling up increasing numbers of
empty shells.
</P>
<P>
Rice crops are being hard hit, as saltwater creeps into
aquifers beneath the fields, contaminating wells used for
irrigation and causing rice to expel water, rather than absorb it.
So far, 130,000 acres (about 526 square kilometers) in Louisiana
have been lost, according to local officials who said farmers were
also planting less than they would in a regular season.
</P>
<P>
In Florida, the Department of Agriculture said last month that
crops such as cotton, soybeans, corn, watermelons, hay and some
vegetables have suffered across 90 percent of the state's counties.
</P>
<P>
U.S. production of winter wheat is down 3 percent this year,
due in part to severe crop damage in Texas. The state is expected
to produce just 70.4 million bushels, compared to 122.4 million
bushels in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Farmers growing non-edible crops are also being hurt, as the
drought kills trees that provide shade and beauty for homeowners
and cash for landowners who grow them to feed pulp mills and
lumber yards. Dry weather has killed thousands of pine seedlings
planted in the spring, and it has made mature pines more
susceptible to disease and insects, CNN said.

<HEADLINE> Globalization of Internet Economy Demands Multilingual Sites: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Multilingual Web sites are no
longer optional as the Internet economy is becoming global, a U.S.
research firm said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since half of all online sales will be conducted outside the
United States by 2004, building a multilingual site has become
critical to those U.S. companies serious about winning in the
Internet economy, said Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
When offered in multiple languages, Forrester said, customer
service features such as product data sheets and technical "
frequently asked questions" (FAQs) provide differentiation, build
brand loyalty and cut support costs.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, Forrester believes that a set of globalization
software and services will emerge as Web-based localization
ascends and legacy translation agencies diminish. In addition,
today's e-business applications that offer random multilingual
capabilities will evolve into more language-agnostic products by
the end of 2001. Finally, although qualified third-party
assistance for multilingual sites is scarce, e-commerce
integrators will increase globalization efforts.
</P>
<P>
Right now English still dominates the Web. According to a study
by Vilaweb, a Web site in the language Catalan, English accounts
for 68 percent of the Web's pages, with a total of 214 million
pages, followed by Japanese, 5.8 percent; German, 5.7 percent;
Chinese, 3.8 percent; French, 2.9 percent; Spanish, 2.4 percent,
and Russian, 1.9 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese courts have for the first
time published verdicts on the Internet to shed their clandestine
image.
</P>
<P>
The first 20 judgments were broadcast by the Shanghai No.1
Intermediate Court this week at a special website. All of the
cases, including some bribery cases, have triggered public outcry.
</P>
<P>
A court spokesman said that the move is a follow-up to the new
open trial practice, which aims at letting more ordinary people
attend trials and watch the judicial system at work.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, court verdicts were kept off-the-record and
only a small number of people had the right to go to trials.
Chinese people have long complained that some secretly-made unjust
charges were made in courts.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the court's transparency should be
increased, and ordinary people should be given the right to
inquire about verdicts.
</P>
<P>
However, files containing a person's privacy, national secrets
and confidential material of commercial companies are not allowed
to be published.

<HEADLINE> Legal Assistance Hotlines Cover Almost All of China (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A legal service hotline number "148
" has been opened in almost every corner of China's vast rural
areas to help farmers use legal measures to resolve disputes and
protect their legitimate rights, Minister of Justice Gao Changli
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The hotline is now available in 2,942 counties, or 96.4 percent
of China's total, and soon the entire nation will be covered, the
minister told a national teleconference on the expansion of the
hotline.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that government-employed legal consultants
received 3.4 million hotline phone calls from the beginning of
1999 to the end of last May.
</P>
<P>
"A great number of cases and emergencies that might lead to
social disorders have been calmed or resolved through the
operations of the 148 hotline," the minister said, noting that it
also helped avoid or retrieve 3 billion yuan of economic losses
for the public.
</P>
<P>
The hotline, first launched in March 1998 by the Dongming
County Justice Bureau of Shandong Province, has since been
extended to cover the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The phonetic pronunciation of "148" sounds like "seeking
justice" in Chinese.

</P>
<P>
More than 31,000 people across the country are working in these
hotlines.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Justice show that the hotline
office workers had also received 660,000 visitors with legal
problems in the past 17 months.
</P>

At the same time, justice bureaus across the country handled a
total of 400,000 legal cases transferred from the hotlines and
succeeded in mediating 220,000 disputes.
</P>

However, the work of local hotline offices is yet to be
improved, the minister said, citing the fact that some employees
in the offices are not professional enough to offer correct legal
advices and some cannot solve problems in time.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenal success has drawn the attention of foreign

BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Cross travelling and trade along
the Thai-Lao border have returned to normal, following clashes
between Lao government's troops and an armed dissident group on
Monday, the Thai News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Businesses along the border was re-opened with increasing
volumes of trade, as Thai and Lao people had continued their cross
travelling via the Chong Mek checkpoint in the Sirindhorn district
of the northeastern province of Ubon Rachathani, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Travelling and trade were temporarily suspended on Monday after
a group of armed Lao dissidents, claming to be members of the so-
called White Lao Force, stormed a customs and immigration office
in the Sirindhorn district. There was a deadly clash, resulting in
five deaths and several deaths of the group.
</P>
<P>
Twenty eight members of the armed group escaped into the Thai
territory and were detained at a police station in the Sirindhorn
district.
</P>
<P>
The Lao government asked on Wednesday for the return of the
detained to be tried in Vientiane.
</P>

CANBERRA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer Thursday welcomed a decision by the Fiji military
to enforce an exclusion zone around the country's parliament where
coup leaders continue to hold hostages.
</P>
<P>
Downer said coup leader George Speight should now take the
opportunity to release the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that now Mr. Speight has lost support throughout
most of Fiji, there is very little community support for Mr.
Speight, and Mr. Speight has no further options," Downer told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's martial law authorities clamped a new exclusion zone
around the country's parliament Wednesday night, giving coup
supporters until midnight Friday to move out.
</P>
<P>
"He should take the opportunity of releasing the hostages,
doing the one honorable and decent thing he can do," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"That is to give up the hostages who he has held so cruelly for
so many weeks and allow the interim civilian government ... to
take steps to move Fiji back towards a democratic constitution
which is multi-racial in nature and will provide for an inclusive
parliament and an inclusive government of Fiji in the years ahead,

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Plans Land Reclamation in Bengal Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is seeking foreign
assistance for land reclamation in the Bay of Bengal in the wake
of fast depletion of agriculture land in the country, an official
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As farmlands are shrinking by an astounding rate of one million
hectares per decade, the government finds land reclamation the
only effective way to face the emerging problem of food insecurity,
Senior Information Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture AKM
Neserudding Bhuiyan told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is seeking foreign aid and
investment for land reclamation in the Bay because the country's
food production would decrease as time goes on due to land
scarcity, despite increased productivity per hectare.
</P>
<P>
Every day the country is losing 221 hectares of cropland owing
to industrialization, urbanization and river erosion.
</P>
<P>
However, the government is hopeful about emergence of a huge
chunk of fertile land from land reclamation in the Bay of Bengal
and that may be as big as Bangladesh is. Bangladesh has to explore
the possibility and it needs money for reclamation from the donor
countries.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the area of cropland was more
or less static at around nine million hectares from the mid-1960s
to mid-1980s. However, in the last one decade over one million
hectares of cropland disappeared.
</P>
<P>
With the pressing needs for urbanization and infrastructure
development, more agricultural land will have to be sacrificed in
the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The country would have to grow an additional five to six
million tones of foodgrain by 2020 in a land area two million
hectares smaller than what it is now to feed the country's
population of 173 million.

LOS ANGELES, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The global merger market
outpaced the downtrodden U.S. market in the first half of 2000, a
leading data firm said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, the value of
international deals climbed 25 percent to 1.85 trillion dollars,

<HEADLINE> Two Weapon Stealers in Malaysia Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Two of the 15 weapon stealers,
being surrounded in Bukit Jenalek in Sauk in Malaysia's northern
state of Perak, Thursday surrendered to security forces, Defense
Minister Najib Tun Razak announced.
</P>
<P>
The two surrendered to security forces at about 5.30 a.m.
Thursday, he told reporters at the operations room at a police
station near Sauk, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
With the latest development the government decided to extend
until further notice the deadline for the remaining gang members
to also give themselves up, Najib said.
</P>
<P>
"The duo indicated that more from the gang may follow suit,"
the minister said, adding the duo expressed willingness to
approach again the remaining gang members at their hideout in the
hillock and persuade them to accept the government's surrender
offer.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government Wednesday made the appeal to the group

<HEADLINE> Nepal Tightens Security at Nepal-India Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Security has been beefed up at
the Nepal-India Customs post in Birgunj, about 600 km Southwest of
Kathmandu, to check the growing cross-border irregularities, the
Kathmandu Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police was compelled to tighten vigilance at the border posts
due to the growing cases of abduction, unauthorized arms
intrusions and other cross border crimes in the busy metros in
Birgunj and other parts of Parsa district that borders India's
Bihar state, a District Police Office source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It is done to ensure the law and order situation in the
district," said Superintendent of Police Krishna Karmacharya. "If
other districts bordering India follow our initiative, the cross
border crimes could be substantially curbed."
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India have 1,700 km long open border which encourages
cross-border crimes and irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has a strong law regarding the cross border crime. If
anyone is found sneaking into the country with unauthorized arms,
the person will get two-year imprisonment. But due to lax security
screening at the border posts, the laws hardly have any practical
significance.
</P>
<P>
Police estimates that one out of every 20 households and one
out of every 50 persons in Parsa district carry unauthorized arms,
most for self-defense and rest for their vested interests.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll conducted recently by a media house of Nepal
revealed that 85.5 percent of Nepalese want the Nepal-India border
regulated and almost 50 percent want passport system to be
introduced.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Cuts Import Tariffs of 542 Items of Industrial Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand on Thursday cut import
tariffs of 542 items of industrial products in order to help
reduce production costs and boost the country's export
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction will also help reduce costs to consumers and
support economy recovery," Thai Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda was quoted by a government source as saying
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of those industrial goods, whose tariffs are now reduced
from 5-30 percent to 0-10 percent, are raw materials unavailable
locally, including primary products, intermediate factors of
production, machinery and other goods.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the tariff cuts will cost the country
revenues of 3.3 billion baht (85 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
However, Tarrin said, this could be compensated by rising
revenues of income and value-added taxes, as producers could gain
more profits due to lower production costs and increasing sale
volumes.
</P>
<P>
The move is also believed to help boost Thai exports to
regional and world markets, and is in line with the Association of
Southeast Asia Nations' free trade agreement, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Local industry executives welcomed the reductions, saying it
will reduce distortions in which some raw materials were taxed at
a higher rate than finished products.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, UNTAET Agree to Form Timor Border Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia government and the
United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET)
have agreed to establish a joint committee that will determine the
definitive border between East Timor and West Timor (East Nusa
Tenggara province of Indonesia).
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the third round of border
negotiations between Indonesia and UNTAET which ended in Surabaya,
capital of Indonesia's East Java province, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a press statement issued by the Foreign Affairs
Ministry, the Joint Border Committee will discuss the border and
examine a border convention that was signed by the Netherlands and
Portugal on October 1, 1904. The committee will also discuss
relevant international regulations.
</P>
<P>
"It has been agreed that the final decision on the border must
be approved by the Indonesian government and the next
administration in East Timor," the press statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said Indonesia rejected a UNTAET proposal to give East Timor
road access to the Oecussi enclave through Jakarta-controlled West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
"This rejection is based on security considerations and rules
of law, but also because the streets are impossible (to pass),"
the statement was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the East Timorese administration "did not object" to
accepting Jakarta's offer to allow Oecussi and the rest of East
Timor to be connected by sea routes.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting, the Indonesian delegation was led by
the Foreign Affairs Ministry's Director of International
Organization Sudjadnan Purnohadingrat, while the United Nations
was represented by Peter Glabraith of the UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations are to follow up on a joint communique issued
by Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab and Special Deputy to the United
Nations Secretary General Sergio Vieira de Mello on February 9,
2000," Sudjatnan said.
</P>
<P>
Sudjadnan added that six problems had been discussed on the
basis of the joint communique including the establishment of an
Indonesian representative office in Dili (East Timor), the opening
of a UNTAET office in Jakarta, and a UNTAET liaison office in
Kupang (capital of East Nusa Tenggara), and finding a solution to
issues relating to the transfer of power, such as state assets,
archives on East Timor, demarcation, pensioners and others.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are scheduled to meet again in Bukittingi, West
Sumatra, in early September to discuss various issues.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, voted for independence
from Indonesia's rule on August 30 last year. The territory,
currently administered by the U.N., is expected to hold its first
general elections in autumn next year.

HANOI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment inflows into
Vietnam in the first six months of this year fell by 35 percent to
520 million U.S. dollars against the same period last year,
according to a report of the latest issue of Vietnam Investment
Review (VIR).

<HEADLINE> S. Lanka's Rupee Devalues to Maintain Export Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's National Chamber of
Exporters (NCE) said that last month's snap devaluation of the
rupee against the dollar was to maintain the country's export
competitiveness and counter the increase in the current account
deficit, the Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Consequently export earnings in rupee terms could increase,
provided exporters maintained present price levels and sales
volumes in international market, the NCE sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan exporters had already come under pressure by foreign
buyers to reduce prices of certain export products. The
devaluation would then maintain their market shares by reducing
prices.
</P>
<P>
On the impact of devaluation, the sources said if the
elasticity of demand is high, they could be in a position to
increase volume and earn a higher sales turnover.
</P>
<P>
All products would enjoy these benefits in general irrespective
of whether the export product had a higher or low content of
imported raw material. However, products with a higher domestic
value addition would enjoy greater benefits.
</P>
<P>
The NEC had long pressed for devaluation to encourage growth in
the export sector, but were also concerned about the burden
imposed on other sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
The prices of imported products will increase as a result of
the devaluation, said the sources, adding that This in turn will
push up the general price level since the economy is highly import
dependent.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka's national Central Bank announced on June 20 that
it would allow the depreciation of the Sri Lankan rupee by
allowing a wider rupee-dollar trading band to boost the flagging
exports.
</P>
<P>
The spread between its buying and selling rates for the U.S.
dollar was widened by five percent from the earlier two percent.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the bank's announcement the rupee fell to 78 to the
dollar and fell further to 79.4 on June 21.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Parliament Passes Law for Election of President by Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Moldovan parliament voted
Wednesday by an overwhelming majority in favor of a constitutional
amendment allowing deputies, rather than the public, to elect the
president, Moldovan state media in Chisinau reported.
</P>
<P>
The amendment was approved by 90 out of the 101 deputies in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
To become fully effective, the new law needs to be endorsed by
President Petru Lucinschi.
</P>
<P>
The law would take effect on January 15, 2001, when Lucinschi's
mandate ends.
</P>
<P>
Lucinschi criticized the vote, saying the power increase of
parliament would lead to a political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
If he vetoes the change, lawmakers said, they will vote again
to force him to accept it.
</P>
<P>
The vote is a blow for Lucinschi, who has been trying to
increase his own power through constitutional amendments since he
took office in early 1997.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Navy Vows to Attack Vessels Carrying Weapons to Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Navy Chief Admiral
Achmad Sutjipto warned against those trying to smuggle weapons to
warring groups in the riot-torn Maluku.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that if any vessel allegedly carrying weapons
ignores the warnings, the Navy will sink the vessel.
</P>
<P>
"If the vessel retaliates, we will attack and sink it,"
Sutjipto was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Navy chief said that until now the Indonesian Navy had only
given warnings to any vessels allegedly bringing weapons to Maluku.
He added he had told his staff to take stern action against
intending arms smugglers.
</P>
<P>
Sutjipto said the action was necessary to support a peaceful
solution to problems in the area as well as the recovery process.
Operations are aimed to help the local military command put an end
to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Navy had already detained 17 vessels in waters
surrounding Maluku, confiscating weapons and poisonous arrows.
</P>
<P>
In Manado, capital of North Sulawesi, the Navy Wednesday
arrested Rusdin Damunwayang, commander of the Jihad Force in
Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Maluku and North Maluku have been fueled by the
arrival of 2,000 hard-line Muslim fighters from Java island, who
have vowed a holy war, last month.
</P>
<P>
In the riot-stricken Ambon, capital of Maluku, thousands of
terrified residents fled the city on Wednesday following days of
rioting that had left many houses and buildings leveled to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Many of the people, mostly from ravaged villages of Poka and
Rumahtiga, used boats, the Jakarta Post reported, adding that some
of them were seen swimming across the water to the nearby village
of Galala.
</P>
<P>
Maluku province and the neighboring province of North Maluku
have witnessed communal bloodshed involving Muslims and Christians
for nearly two years. More than 3,000 people have been killed
during the bloodshed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's GDP to Grow by 3-4 Percent in Second Half of 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia's central bank, Bank
Indonesia, has projected that the country's gross domestic product
(GDP will grow by between 3 and 4 percent in both second and third
quarters this year.
</P>
<P>
But, although the economy will enjoy up to 3 to 4 percent
growth, it will be faced with a number of heavy problems in the
third quarter, local leading newspapers Thursday quoted a reported
issued by the bank.
</P>
<P>
The biggest problems Indonesia has to face are the strong
inflation pressures and the weakening of exchange rate of rupiah,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
"The government's plan to raise prices of fuel and salaries of
civil servants and the police in the next few months is set to
raise the inflation rate this year," said the report, adding that
it is worried that the continuing inflation pressure will surpass
its fiscal 2000 target of 5 to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also sees the flow of base money which continues to
move above the indicative target as a problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it seems that the rupiah will continue to fall as it
hit a 16-month low when it closed at 9,385 per U.S. dollar on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government set the exchange rate of rupiah in current
fiscal year at 7,000 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the continuing fall of rupiah has
something to do with the current political instability in the
country.
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded at the attorney general office (AGO) on Tuesday
and two other bombs were also founded the following day at the
same building causing fears that the political terror would impede
economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> China's Coal Export Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China exported 20.93 million tons
of coal in the first five months this year, up 45.6 percent over
the same period of last year, according to the State
Administration of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
The increase of coal export has effectively eased the domestic
situation of coal supply exceeding demand, a senior official with
the State Administration of Coal said.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained favorable growth in coal export since the
beginning of this year and it expects to export a record 45
million tons by the end of this year, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is expanding coal export and world market
shares by stepping up construction of export coal production bases
and improving coal quality.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that to expand coal export is of great
significance for the reduction of coal stockpile, the balance
between coal supply and demand and the sustainable development of
the country's coal industry.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia to Maintain Tight Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia said it would
continue its tight monetary policy and allow a further increase in
interest rates to help curb inflationary threats and strengthen
the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The policy was aimed at achieving the basic money target, the
central bank said in its second quarter report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, however, admitted that the increase in
interest rates could threaten the country's economic recovery
efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We realize that the tight policy and higher interest rates
could hinder the nascent economic recovery," the report was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia cautioned that a high interest rate environment
would also inflate the government's bank recapitalization cost and
impede the debt restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank also conceded that a monetary policy which
tended to be "accommodative" would create a higher inflation
expectation.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark interest rate on one-month Bank Indonesia short-
term promissory notes increased to 12.69 percent at Wednesday's
weekly auction, compared to 12.33 percent the previous week. This
is the ninth consecutive weekly increase, and the highest rate
level since late last year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank initially predicted that the benchmark
interest rate would be between 10 percent and 12 percent by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
But Bank Indonesia had been forced to allow interest rates to
increase over the past two months amid an increase in interest
rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the weakening of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed at 9,385 rupiah per U.S. dollar on Wednesday,
hitting a 16-month low. This was much lower than the government
target of 7,000 rupiah per U.S. dollar for this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has said that the current weakening of the
rupiah has been largely due to domestic political uncertainty,
particularly in the run up to the General Session of the People's
Consultative Assembly in August.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia expected interest rates to go down again after
August, along with lesser pressure on the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that it would continue to let the market
determine the exchange rate of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Market intervention through the selling of its U.S. dollars
would be done selectively and in a limited amount, Bank Indonesia
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Ukraine reached 3.7
percent in June, the Ukrainian State Statistics Committee said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Food prices increased by 3.3 percent in June, compared with 3.1
percent in May, non-food goods rose by 0.7 percent as against 0.4
percent in May, while services went up 6 percent, compared with 1.
1 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for June doubled what the Ministry of
Economy had earlier predicted.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate was 1.7 percent in April, 2 percent in March,
3.3 percent in February and 4.6 percent in January. Annual
inflation was 19.2 percent in 1999 and 20 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The government now predicts an inflation rate of 18.5 percent
for 2000 instead of an earlier forecast of 15.9 percent due to
rises in housing and utility costs and as a result of money
printing at the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Agriculture Ministers Reach New Deal on Farm Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Canadian agriculture ministers have
reached a new deal of 5.5 billion Canadian dollars (about 3.7
billion U.S. dollars) on farm safety programs, federal Agriculture
Minister Lyle Vanclief announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Federal and provincial agriculture ministers agreed Tuesday at
their annual meeting in Fredericton, New Brunswick, that Ottawa
provides 3.3 billion dollars (about 2.2 billion U.S. dollars) and
the provinces add another 2.2 billion (about 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars) to establish a framework for farm stability over three
years, Vanclief said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of money in each province varies according to the
size of the agriculture industry.
</P>
<P>
An annual 225 million dollars (about 151 million U.S. dollars)
will go to Canada's most populous province Ontario, which makes up
almost 25 percent of agriculture and food production in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In New Brunswick, Ottawa is expected to contribute 5.3 million
dollars (about 3.6 million U.S. dollars), while the province's
share is estimated at 3 million (about 2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ministers are yet to work out detailed programs to
compensate farmers devastated by natural catastrophes caused by
floods, drought or vagaries of markets.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Leukemia Sufferer Draws Public Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese collage student is
suffering from leukemia. If he has no money for medical treatments,
he will die.
</P>
<P>
People are trying their best to help Ding Jian, a 20-year-old
student in Shanghai-based Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
In June last year, Ding felt his eyesight was worsening, and
medical check-ups have shown that he was suffering from leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Marrow suitable for Ding must be found to save him. After
months of search, doctors found that two young people from Taiwan,
both aged 21, have marrow matching for Ding.
</P>
<P>
However, Ding from a common family in Jinhua, east China's
Zhejiang Province, is short of 250,000 yuan (about 30,000 U.S.
dollars) to undergo operation.
</P>
<P>
Students and teachers at Fudan University have made donations.
Other people have also provided assistance after they learnt Ding'
s story from media reports.

<HEADLINE> Seasonal Floods Threaten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Seasonal floods, mostly in mountain
regions, have caused at least 400 deaths since the beginning of
the rainy season in China, today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, at least 400 people have reportedly died in
floods or resulting landslides," the English language paper quoted
an official from the State flood-control department as saying.
</P>
<P>
The estimated death toll does not include ten other people
washed away by mountain torrents on Monday in the city of Dazhou
in Sichuan Province. The floods in Dazhou have caused an estimated
133 million yuan (16 million US dollars) in damages.
</P>
<P>
Local governments, especially those in northern regions that
have been suffering from drought, were urged to closely monitor
the rising water levels of rain-swollen rivers to prepare for
floods. China's peak flood season runs from late July to early
August.
</P>
<P>
Of China's existing 80,000 reservoirs, 25 percent have
dangerous sections, experts said, warning that disasters could
ensue if incidents occurred at these reservoirs in flood season.
</P>
<P>
The season's first flood peak on the Yangtze river has, since
Tuesday, entered Hubei Province in central China with a massive
waterflow of 50,000 cubic meters per second.

this field, began in Shanghai Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 scholars and experts in the field of automation
and control participated in the event. Over half of the

</P>
<P>
The conference, entitled "21st Century-Oriented Automatic
Technology," will focus on the cutting edge of control theory and

"It is a very important conference that will allow for the
exchange of technology and information about control theory and
its applications," today's "China Daily" quoted Zheng Yufan,

</P>
<P>
Among the more than 800 papers submitted to conference
organizers, 597 were chosen to be presented during the 103

<HEADLINE> Unilever to List A Shares in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Unilever, one of the world's
biggest producers of consumer goods, is trying to be the first
foreign company to list domestic A shares in China.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistance minister of the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation, was quoted by today's "China
Daily" as saying that China welcomes foreign investors to list on
China's stock markets.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson with the Shanghai headquarters of Unilever (
China) said that the news was encouraging because the company had
been considering a domestic listing since the middle of last year.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that our customers here in China can also become our
shareholders as an incentive for us to upgrade our services and
expand our market share," she said.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that China's securities regulatory
authorities are considering revising regulations concerning the
criteria for companies seeking domestic listing, which could allow
foreign capital's entry into A shares available to domestic
investors.
</P>
<P>
But a senior researcher with a government think-tank said
allowing foreign companies to list A shares will take some time.
</P>
<P>
Today, most of the A-share stocks are State-owned companies and
foreign investors are still not allowed to list or trade A shares.
</P>
<P>
Unilever has set up 14 joint ventures in China, with a total
investment of 800 million US dollars, company statistics indicate.

<HEADLINE> Sampras and Agassi on Course to Wimbledon Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Top two seeds Pete Sampras and Andre
Agassi are well staying on course for the Wimbledon tennis final
with respective victories in quarter-finals here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champion and top seed Sampras, who is now within two
wins of a record 13th Grand Slam title, defeated fellow American
Jan-Michael Gambill 6-4, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4 while second seed Agassi
crushed 10th seeded Australian Mark Philippousis 7-6, 6-3 and 6-4
in the cloudy day.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals, Sampras will meet Belarussian qualifier
Vladimir Voltchkov and Agassi takes on another Australian 12th
seed Pat Rafter.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was made to work for his victory by the 23-year-old
Gambill who was making his first appearance in a Grand Slam
quarter-final and had defeated seventh seed Lleyton Hewitt in the
first round and number nine Thomas Enqvist on his way to the last
eight.
</P>
<P>
Gambill briefly led after taking the second set on a tie-break
7-4 but failed to break Sampras's serve once in the match and the
defending champion eventually wore his opponent down to win in two
hours 46 minutes on center court.
</P>
<P>
Voltchkov became the first qualifier since John McEnroe in 1977
to reach a Wimbledon men's semifinal when he squeezed past
Zimbabwe's Byron Black 7-6, 7-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Neither Voltchkov nor Black played anything like inspired
tennis, squandering leads and swapping service breaks regularly
and each finding it difficult to serve out a set.
</P>
<P>
Rafter beat German Alexander Popp 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 on Court One.
The twice U.S. Open champion needed only to play solid serve and
volley tennis to overcome the 23-year-old Popp whose jangling
nerves caused him to make a string of errors including five
doubles faults in his first service game.
</P>
<P>
The towering Popp, who beat current and former French Open
champions Gustavo Kuerten and Michael Chang, in earlier rounds did
show flashes of brilliance on the backhand and he broke Rafter's
serve to force the third set tiebreak.
</P>
<P>
But he could not match Rafter's touch and anticipation,
dropping four of his service games during the match and losing the
tiebreak 7-1.
</P>
<P>
Venus and Serena Williams warmed up for their singles semifinal
by bludgeoning 43-year-old Martina Navratilova and her South
African partner Mariaan de Swardt out of Wimbledon 4-6, 6-2,6-1 in
the women's doubles quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
In a battle of power against precision, the sisters showed no
mercy in the match and ended Navratilova's chances of winning a
record-equalling 20th Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
"That was fun," Navratilova said afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Asked if this would be her last Wimbledon, Navratilova, the
holder of 19 Wimbledon titles, said: "I am not sure."
</P>
<P>
Navratilova and her partner Mahesh Bhupathi were knocked out of
the mixed doubles in the first round.

SHENYANG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Clouds of locusts have landed in
northeast China's Benxi city and eaten up 3,333 hectares of wheat
and corns.
</P>
<P>
Reports say people were astonished to find that there were more
than 10,000 locusts gathering in an area of one square meters.
</P>
<P>
Many locusts are so hungry that they have begun eating tree
leaves that are not their normal diet, causing serious threat to
forests.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the plague to the drought that is
hovering over north China, adding that if the high temperature
continues, the situation will get worse.
</P>
<P>
At least five species of locusts have flied into the city,
making the eliminating job a hard nut, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
Locusts have also been rampant in other parts of north China,
including Hebei province and the suburbs of Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Jilin Province to Build "Optical Valley" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China has started to build an
optical electronics industrial park in this capital of Jilin
Province, in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
The park, to cover 2,120,000 sq m, will focus on the optical
electronics, instruments and information technology industries. It
will include development and research buildings, office buildings,
workshops for making optical materials and precision instruments.
</P>
<P>
The park, nicknamed "optical valley", is being set up by the
Institute of Optical Precision Machinery and Physics, the branch
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Changchun and the Changchun
Economic Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment budget of 18 billion yuan (about 2.2
billion US dollars), the park will be constructed by two phases
over a period of five years and hopes to achieve a yearly revenue
of more than 30 billion yuan (about 3.6 billion US dollars) after
completion.
</P>
<P>
Wang Daheng, a leading optical scientist, said that the park
will be a center of the national research on optics and trade in
related products. It will also, hopefully, become a research and
production base of optical devices and an exchange center for
international scientific communications.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the country's optical electronics industry
will create 5,000 billion US dollars in revenue within this
century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other cities in China, such as Shanghai, Wuhan and
Guangzhou, are now constructing "optical valleys" of their own.

<HEADLINE> Cook sees British euro membership as "inevitable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said on Thursday that Britain's eventual membership of the euro,
the European single currency, was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
As one of Prime Minister Tony Blair most pro-euro ministers,
Cook said Britons could be won over to support it. But he also
made it clear that he was not calling for Britain to join the
single currency immediately.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at a meeting of pro-European trade
unionists, the foreign secretary said the long term attraction of
the euro appeared irresistible despite widespread public
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the fact that in those opinion polls which show the
majority of the public are against joining the euro, they all show
the same two thirds majority believe joining the euro is
inevitable," a Reuters report quoted Cook as saying.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China on World's Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Without the economic
development in the great number of developing countries, there
will be no real development, prosperity or stability for the whole
world, China stressed here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Wang Yingfan, the Chinese Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, at the high-level segment of
the substantive session of the United Nations Economic and Social
Council on the role of the information technology resolution in
the development, to be held from July 5 to 7 at the Headquarters
of the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang said starting from the 1990s, the development
of information and communication technologies(ICTs), represented
by the Internet, has experienced leaps and bounds with each
passing day.
</P>
<P>
It has not only served as a strong boost to the process of
economic globalization, but also led to the realization of the
global allocation of resources and the cross-border flow of
capital, technology and commodities, thus having greatly enhanced
productivity across the world, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
" However, for all the benefits and opportunities brought by
ICTs, we also deeply aware of the concomitant negative impacts,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The grim reality is that the quick pace of science and
technology has failed to bring about the realization of common
prosperity for all nations in the world and the gap between the
North and the South has widened as a result of the digital divide,
casting a shadow over the good hopes for common development and
prosperity of the whole humanity," the Ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Every country should conform to the tide of history and take
strong measures to grasp the opportunities for development brought
by informatization and for this purpose, developing countries in
particular should work even harder, give priority to education and
technological progress, formulate information-based development
strategies suitable to national circumstances, increase the input
of manpower, material and financial resources and choose a path to
national prosperity through science and technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community should create a favorable external
environment for developing countries to upgrade their
informatization levels," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations should play a crucial role in actively and
effectively guiding and coordinating the promotion of ICTs for
development. The United Nations should become an important
intergovernmental forum for exchanging experiences and promoting
international cooperation in the field of ICTs as well as a major
multilateral institution for formulating relevant laws and
technical standards," he added.
</P>
<P>
The high-level meeting is expected to issue a ministerial-
level declaration which will endorse a global action plan
involving the U.N., international agencies, countries and the
private sector.

OTTAWA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Four children and their parents were
reported dead in an apparent murder-suicide Thursday morning in
Kitchener, some 145 kilometers west of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Local police have confirmed the "multiple murder" without
identifying any of the family members.

The country's press service said that the family's neighbors
reported the tragedy to police, who arrived at the victims' two-

with the yellow police tape.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors described the children as being from three month

<HEADLINE> Senior U.N. Official to Assess Humanitarian Needs in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations
relief officer is on her way to the Horn of Africa to assess the
humanitarian situation there after devastating droughts and armed
conflicts ravaged the region, a U.N. spokesman announced here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Carolyn McAskie, acting Emergency Relief Coordinator, left New
York Wednesday for a 10-day mission during which she will also
review the U.N.'s existing coordination arrangements for meeting
the needs of the affected populations, the spokesman, Manoel de
Almeida e Silva, said.
</P>
<P>
During her trip, McAskie will visit Ethiopia, Eritrea and
Kenya, as well as Burundi, where she will visit "regroupment"
camps of internally displaced persons and discuss with the U.N.
Country Team the implications of the country's peace process for
the humanitarian community.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan dispatched a
reconnaissance mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea in order to devise
plans for a U.N. peacekeeping mission along their bitterly
contested frontier.
</P>
<P>
The mission, headed by Major-General Timothy Ford of Australia,
included military, political, legal and humanitarian experts, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said he was
following up on a cease-fire accord signed by the two Horn of
Africa countries -- Ethiopia and Eritrea -- last month that called
for U.N. peacekeepers to patrol the border.
</P>
<P>
Any troop contingents still have to be approved by the
Security Council, which met on the issues behind closed doors on
Thursday, although members have said they were in favor of the
force, estimated between 2,000 and 4,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea signed the cease-fire pact in Algeria on
June 18 under the auspices of the Organization of African Unity
that ended the fighting. Tens of thousands of people were killed
and more than one million were uprooted from their homes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Kenya Takes Measures to Combat Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Li Jinqi
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Following the government's decision
to waiver duty of imported maize in mid-June, millers in Kenya
will import 600, 000 tons of maize from South Africa in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
As one of the urgent steps to fight the famine caused by the
worst drought in the past 40 years, Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi announced on June 14 to waiver duty on imported maize to
encourage millers to import more and build up the depleted food
reserve.
</P>
<P>
Tahir Sheikh Said, a leading miller at the Indian Oceanic port
city of Mombasa in southeastern Kenya, expected that the first
consignment of the imported maize would be in the country in
August.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, Kenya has witnessed vicissitudes of
a dry spell in 1992, heavy rains and floods in 1997 and 1998,
followed again by the current dry spell in most parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the prevailing drought, maize production in Nakuru
District in Rift Valley Province, the country's breadbasket in the
central part of Kenya, will drop by 60 percent, from 1.5 million
bags (90 kg per bag) in 1999 to 700,000 bags this year.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, President Moi once again appealed for international
 assistance for emergency food relief for three million Kenyans in
30 districts affected by the severe drought.
</P>
<P>
He said due to circumstances which are beyond the government's
control, Kenya is in the grip of very worrying natural calamities
which include extreme drought conditions and a spreading and
deepening famine.
</P>
<P>
The president estimated that the country required 150 million
U.S. dollars from local and international donors to tackle the
crisis, of which food will take 85 percent, while water and
sanitation among others take the rest.
</P>
<P>
To combat the famine effectively, Moi on June 8 appointed an
11-member crisis committee consisting of cabinet ministers and a
bank governor to coordinate and monitor the distribution of famine
relief food.
</P>
<P>
Moi promised donors that his government would establish more
relief food distribution points and incorporate non-governmental
organizations and U.N. agencies to ensure transparency in aid food
management.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, the Office of the President announced in a
statement that the government has distributed 811,600 bags of
maize to drought and famine-hit areas, leaving only less than
60,000 bags as relief stocks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Kenyan government has set aside 500 million
shillings (about 6.5 million U.S. dollars) to buy 303,000 bags of
commercial maize which will be converted into relief food for
needy districts.
</P>
<P>
The Relief and Rehabilitation Department under the Office of
the President has also made strong representation to the Treasury
for three to four billion shillings (about 40 to 53 million
dollars) which will cater for purchase of approximately 2.2
million bags of maize for stock reserves.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, government officials at various level have
urged farmers in drought-hit areas to plant more drought-resistant
crops such as cassava, potatoes and bananas as a way of easing the
raging famine menace.
</P>
<P>
President Moi's appeal for emergency food assistance received
timely and positive responses from Italy, Britain, Japan, the
Netherlands and the United States among other countries, as well
as U.N agencies and non- governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government, through its ambassador to Kenya,
pledged to provide 2,555 tons of relief food including wheat and
rice, worth 55 million shillings (about 725,000 dollars) to help
save Kenyans from starvation.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) also immediately promised to send
7,273 tons of aid food such as maize, beans and edible oil to
Kenya's Tana River region, one of the country's 18 worst
drought-hit districts.
</P>
<P>
So far, the U.N. agency has assisted a total of 2.7 million
drought- stricken Kenyans at a cost of 43 million dollars, with
emphasis on the 12 worst hunger-hit districts.
</P>
<P>
In order to tackle growing hunger in Kenya, David Fletcher,
WFP's Deputy Country Director for Kenya, on July 5 urgently
appealed for 88 million dollars to feed 3.3 million Kenyans until
the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Quick Step being Urged for Transgenic Food Regulations in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's provincial agriculture
ministers urged the federal government to move quickly to
establish clear regulations for transgenic foods Thursday in
Fredericton, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the annual meeting of federal and
provincial agriculture ministers, Ontario Agriculture Minister
Ernie Hardeman said that Canadian farmers "are looking for some
direction, as quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
Hardeman and his counterparts said Canadian farmers are looking
for government to conclude the discussions on labelling so as to
get things done for the production of tansgenic foods, which have
become important cash crops since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Federal Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief told the meeting
that discussions on labelling need caution and prudence.
</P>
<P>
"Before you can have any kind of labelling on anything, there
must be a set of criteria that can clearly demonstrate to the
producers that the labelling is credible, meaningful and
enforceable," he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said Canadian farmers are making their own decisions, rather
than waiting for governments to tell them what to do with
engineered products.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers don't just blindly plant. They want to grow what they
can market, not try to market what they grew," he argued.
</P>
<P>
Under a global Biosafety Protocol adopted by more than 130
countries in Montreal in late January this year, a label is
required for transgenic foods indicating that they might be a
product of genetically modified organism.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Denies Allegation at Parliamentary Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 6 (Xinhua)-- Former German chancellor Helmut Kohl
Thursday denied the allegation that he had destroyed evidences of
his illegal funding scandal.
</P>
<P>
Appearing at the parliamentary hearing here, Kohl blamed his
successor Gerhard Schroeder for hutching a plot to ruin his fame.
</P>
<P>
"Behind this screenplay is the chancellery. All those things
began after my time," Kohl told the special parliamentary
committee that was investigating his scandal.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the allegation by deputy parliamentary president
Burkhard Hirsch that he should be responsible for the missing
files that might be evidences for his scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Hirsch report said large amount of computer files-equal to
1.2 million pages of paper--in Bonn chancellery had been erased
after Kohl was defeated in the election in September 1998 and
before Schroeder took over the power.
</P>
<P>
Including in the files were records about Germany's sale of
Leuna petroleum complex to France and the armored-vehicle deal
with Saudi Arabia in early 1990s. Kohl and his Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) were suspected to take kickbacks from the
deals.
</P>
<P>
As before, Kohl still refused to point out who had anonymously
donated millions of marks to his CDU, but he said there were not
so many donators as the media had reported, saying, "They are not
a legion."
</P>
<P>
The former chancellor accused German media for "falsification"
in the report on his scandal. He said the ARD and WDR, two
television networks that first covered the illegal donation of CDU
last November, were "incomparably stupid."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Thursday gave his strongest hint yet that he expects to take
Britain into euro, the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
In some of the most pro-euro remarks yet from the British
premier, Blair told BBC television that if the time came he was
prepared to lead from the front in a referendum to ratify a move
to join euro.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain has the lowest inflation in Europe and if it
carries on that way, the euro would be good for the nation.
</P>
<P>
"If we rule out the euro, we're turning our back on the future
of this country," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was clearly trying to clarify his position
as he came under fire from anti-euro audience members during the
BBC Question Time programme.
</P>
<P>
He said he would recommend joining the euro if it was good for
jobs, mortgages and industry, even if it was unpopular.
</P>
<P>
His Labor government's long-standing position is that if five
key economic tests are met, it will hold a referendum and
recommend people vote to join.
</P>
<P>
When asked why Britain would not join the euro immediately,
Blair defended his decision by saying that if Britain joined now
it would be bad for its economy.
</P>
<P>
Blair's government repeatedly said it is united in favor of
joining the euro in principal, providing five economic conditions
are met. If those tests are met it would put the issue to a
referendum after the next election.

<HEADLINE> EU Court Confirms Decision against Volkswagen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Court of First
Instance ruled Thursday that German car maker Volkswagen should be
fined with 90 million euros (86 million U.S. dollars) for its
violation of European Union (EU)'s competition law.
</P>
<P>
The court in a judgement upholds a decision of the European
Commission, the EU's executive body, against Volkswagen
establishing very serious infringement of EU Competition Rules",
the EU Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive has accused the Volkswagen of preventing its
Italian importer and its dealers in Italy to sell new cars to non-
residents, in particular German and Austrian consumers. Therefore,
the EU decided in early 1998 to fine the German car maker with 102
million euros (97 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, Volkswagen appealed against this decision with
the Court of First Instance, by rejecting the Commission's
findings and considering the amount of the fine as totally
inadequate. Now the court in its judgement only slightly revised
the sum of fine to 90 million euros.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner Mario Monti said that this ruling is good news
for European consumers. "The possibility to buy goods at better
prices in other member states is indeed one of the key advantages
of the single market," he said.
</P>
<P>
