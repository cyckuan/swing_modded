<HEADLINE> Former Rebels in Philippines to Fight Against MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF) members who have been integrated into the Philippine
military will eventually fight against rebels in Mindanao possibly
including members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Renato de Villa said here today that once the
MNLF members have been integrated into the military, they could be
assigned in units which would fight against MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
"That would be just a normal occurrence or consequence. That is
part of what we expect from them," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, some 1,100 MNLF regulars joined the Armed Forces of
the Philippines in Mindanao. According to the agreement signed
last year by the MNLF and the government, 6,400 more MNLF members
would also be allowed to join the military and police forces.
</P>
<P>
De villa said that in the beginning, the MNLF regulars would be
deployed as "separate units" under the control and supervision of
the armed forces. But after a certain period, they would be
considered as regular units and "deployed anywhere".
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a 12,000-member rebel group, is a splinter faction of
the mainstream MNLF which signed the peace agreement with the
government last September.
</P>
<P>
The government is pursuing formal peace talks with the MILF.
Peace panels from both sides have held two rounds of preliminary
talks this year and signed a local ceasefire in February.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides exchanged fires again on Sunday night.
The MILF accused government troops of conducting the attack first
and killing 10 pupils and a teacher inside its camp in Buldon in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The military, on the other hand, denied the accusation.
President Fidel Ramos and the Defense Secretary had ordered an
investigation of the incident.

<HEADLINE> WHO Announces Breakthrough in TB Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) today announced a breakthrough in tuberculosis (TB) control
that will make it possible to save millions of lives and
dramatically reduce the threat of multidrug-resistant strains in
the next decade.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough, known as DOTS, or Directly Observed Treatment
Short-course, is causing the global TB epidemic to level off for
the first time in decades, according to a WHO press release.
</P>
<P>
"DOTS is the biggest health breakthrough of this decade, in
terms of the lives we will be able to save," said Hiroshi
Nakajima, WHO Director-General.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that at least 10 million deaths from TB will be
prevented in the next 10 years with the introduction and extensive
use of the DOTS strategy."
</P>
<P>
A global assessment reveals that use of the DOTS strategy has
virtually stopped the epidemic's upward surge. Computer
projections of the future impact of wide scale use of DOTS show
that it can quickly cut the current annual number of TB cases in
half during the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"This is the single most important development in the fight
against humanity's oldest and most deadly infectious disease since
Robert Koch discovered the TB bacillus in 1882," said Arata Kochi,
director of the WHO Global TB Program.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we have the means to reverse the TB
epidemic not only in wealthy countries, but the world's poorest
countries as well."
</P>
<P>
"Additionally, epidemiological projections indicate that if
seven out of 10 existing TB patients are treated with the DOTS
strategy, not only will they be cured, but the annual number of
new TB cases will drop remarkably within a decade," said Kochi.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, roughly six to eight million people worldwide
have been becoming sick with TB each year. With the wider use of
DOTS, that can be reduced to less than three to four million new
cases per year within the next ten years. Without the use of
DOTS, the TB epidemic is projected to increase to nearly nine
million annual cases by 2005."
</P>
<P>
Nakajima called on all health officials to begin making plans
to use the DOTS strategy more widely. "The epidemic will continue
to kill more people each year, and the TB bacilli will grow more
resistant to drugs, unless we move quickly to put the DOTS
strategy into use in every country."
</P>
<P>
DOTS is a strategy that combines a powerful multidrug therapy
with a new state-of-the-art health management system to make it
nearly a certainty that every TB patient treated will be cured.
</P>
<P>
One of the unique features of the DOTS strategy is its use of
"patient observers" to watch TB patients swallow each dose of
medicines.
</P>
<P>
This helps overcome one of the most difficult problems that has
hindered TB control efforts to date: patients who take enough of
their medicines to feel better, but fail to finish the course of
treatment so that they are completely cured and no longer able to
spread the disease to others.
</P>
<P>
The unsupervised use of TB medicines has led to the emergence
of multidrug-resistant strains which are over a hundred times more
expensive to treat and almost impossible to cure.

<HEADLINE> Dondo Declares Zaire's Vote in Parliament Illegal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa
Dondo today announced that the vote by Zaire's Parliament on
March 18 is "a flagrant violation of the constitution of Zaire".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Dondo was sacked by a vote of Zairean
parliament only hours after he left on Tuesday for Nairobi for a
regional summit on Zaire crisis, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here today, Dondo said that "the
required condition to have a quorum to decide to overthrow the
government was not met."
</P>
<P>
The censure of the government was not originally on the
agenda, said the release, adding that therefore "it is illegal
since it violates all the clauses of the constitutional act and
the internal rule of the parliament."
</P>
<P>
Dondo arrived here yesterday to attend one-day regional summit
for the first time, which is aiming at seeking lasting solution
of the eastern Zaire crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government boycotted the previous two Nairobi
summits held last November and December in Kenya's capital as it
demanded the withdrawal of all foreign forces in eastern Zaire
before attending.
</P>
<P>
After talks this morning between Dondo, South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo and European envoy Aldo Ajello, they all
hoped for a ceasefire in Zaire to pave the way for a political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
"A ceasefire in Zaire is important because it would be the
foundation for any political process," Nzo was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The on-going summit was reported to seek ways to achieve a
ceasefire in Zaire as the conflicts between the government forces
and the rebels led by Laurent Kabila are continuing to escalate.

<HEADLINE> Archbishop Tutu to Undergo Cancer Treatment in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission chairman, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, is planning to undergo radiotherapy in
the United States for his cancer, which he says may move beyond
his prostate gland.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today in Cape Town, Tutu said he had
decided to undergo a combination of hormone treatment and
radiotherapy after discussions with American medical specialists
and consultations with his doctors.
</P>
<P>
After initial prostate surgery in January this year, Tutu had
been presented with several treatment options, radical surgery,
radiotherapy, hormone treatment, or a combination of the last
two, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Tutu had been inclined before his recent visit to the US to
choose surgery, which had seemed to give the best chance of
completely removing the cancer.
</P>
<P>
A group of medical specialists in Cape Town would begin a
three-month course of hormone treatment on Thursday ahead of
Tutu's planned radiotherapy at a clinic in the US, added the
statement.

ROME -- The Italian cabinet today declared a state of emergency
throughout the country until June 30 to deal with the
larger-than-expected entry of Albanian refugees into the country.
</P>
<P>
At today's cabinet meeting, the government adopted a decree
granting "temporary" protection to a flood of Albanian refugees
who poured into following the fall of their homeland into anarchy
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
However, the decree also gave law enforcement officials wider
power to expel refugees who they considered dangerous to public
security and who committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini cautioned that
the exodus had brought more than 10,000 Albanians across the
Adriatic Sea since March 13. He said the consequences of the
influx "involved not only Italy but all Europe."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Believe Earthquakes Unpredictable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Can scientists tell when and
where there will be an earthquake? The title of an article in the
latest issue of journal Science says it all: "Earthquakes Cannot Be
Predicted".
</P>
<P>
Despite more than three decades of intensive research, no
identifiable precursors of seismic activity have emerged, four
U.S. seismologists write in the article.
</P>
<P>
Attempts to predict quakes in the short term have long
captivated the public imagination, but when scientists are trying
to do something flashy and glamorous like telling when an
earthquake is going to occur, it's tempting to lose sight of the
methodical approach that really makes science work, the
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
"Is prediction inherently impossible or just fiendishly
difficult? In practice, it doesn't matter," the four scientists
conclude.
</P>
<P>
"The current probability of successful prediction is extremely
low, and the obvious ideas have been tried and rejected for over
100 years," they say.

LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba called here today for concerted efforts to protect
Lusaka, capital of Zambia, from further environmantal
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
In a speech read on his behalf by Vice President Godfrey
Miyanda at the opening of a consultative meeting on sustainable
development for the city of Lusaka, Chiluba said that more than
half of Zambians now live in towns and cities and a majority of
these urban dwellers live in sub-standard housing, lacking in
basic necessities such as water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the problem is getting worse because an ageing,
decaying and neglected urban environment cannot keep up with an
exploding urban population," said Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
He called on every city in his country to fight and put the
problems under control such as dirty business premises,
paralysing traffic, pollution of air and water, drugs, crime, the
resurgence of epidemics like cholera and old diseases such as
tuberculosis and the spread of new ones such as hiv/aids.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said his government will encourage active
participation of local governments, the private sector,
non-governmental organizations, community based organizations,
residents and academic and scientific communities to forge
partnerships in the fighting for environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
"We must combat urban inequality and environmental degradation
in order to sustain the future," said Chiluba.

as U.N. representatives here are attending the five-day workshop.

LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The total number of people out of
work in Britain fell by 68,000 last month to a six-year low of
1.746 million, or 6.2 percent of the workforce, according to
figures released today by the Office for National Statistics
(ONS).
</P>
<P>
February's fall of the jobless total, or in Jobseeker's
Allowance claims, is the 12th in a row and was the largest ever
February fall as well as the third largest of all months since
record began 26 years ago, the ONS said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major, facing a general election on May 1,
hailed the fall in unemployment as "proof that Britain is
booming".
</P>
<P>
"Falling unemployment, stable prices, lower taxes, higher
living standards -- people's hard work has created a turbo-
economy," Major said.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition Labor Party accused the Tories of
fiddling jobless figures, saying that in one in five households,
families have no one in work.
</P>

Labor's Education and Employment Secretary David Blunkett said
that the way figures were calculated had changed more than 30
times since the Conservatives came to power in 1979.

<HEADLINE> India Announces Licensing Policy for Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government has
announced a new licensing policy for exploration of crude oil and
gas which provides a level playing field for the national oil
companies on par with the private corporates, The Hindustan Times
said today.
</P>
<P>
As per the new exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), the
incentive structure for national oil companies as well as the
private companies would be same.
</P>
<P>
In effect, the state-owned companies would be paid
international prices of oil for discoveries made in the blocks
offered under the new policy. However, these companies will have
to bid for exploration blocks as other private corporates.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the state-own oil companies were paid only 7.6 US
dollars per barrel of crude oil in blocks explored by them. But,
for oil explored under joint-venture contracts, international
price at 20 dollars per barrel was being paid. This anomaly has
been removed though the NELP.
</P>
<P>
The new licensing regime will end the concern of private
foreign and domestic investors in oil exploration that only blocks
with poor prospectivity were being offered for their investments.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Y. Museveni
has appealed to the United Nations secretary-general to assist
Uganda to have Ugandan abductees being held in Sudan released.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan here
today, the president drew the attention of the secretary-general
especially to the plight of 24 school girls from St. Mary's
college aboke, northern Uganda who were kidnapped on 10th October
1996 by bandits of the rebel lord's resistance army who are being
supported by the Sudan government.
</P>
<P>
He informed Annan that on that day, 30 girls were kidnapped
from aboke of whom six were later rescued by Ugandan government
army while the rest are currently being held in Aruu, southern
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Referring to evidence given by hundreds of escaped abductees
and others who were rescued bys the army, President Museveni
informed Annan that the abducted girls are part of thousands who
have been abducted into Sudan by agents of the Sudanese
government. Many of these, according to evidence, are sold into
slavery and others are gang-pressed into banditry activities.
</P>
<P>
Museveni informed Annan that the government of Uganda would no
longer accept the criminal acts by agents of the Sudanese
government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government of Uganda would reserve the right
to take all legitimate measures to end such criminality against
the population of Uganda, especially the children.
</P>

He furnished the secretary general with the names of all the
aboke girls still in captivity in the letter.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for More Emphasis on Economic, Social, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Alternate Representative
Wang Min today called on the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights to pay more attention to economic, social and cultural
rights and the right to development after mentioning its
achievements in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has not been able to give full play to its due
role in facilitating the realization of economic, social and
cultural rights and these rights have long been neglected in the
commission," he said at the ongoing session of the commission. "At
present, among the 32 Special Rapporteurs appointed by the
commission, only one deals with economic, social and cultural
rights, and of the 85 resolutions adopted by the commission at its
last session, only six are directly related to these rights."
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, the North-South gap is widening with the
economic conditions of the least developed countries becoming
critical. According to the 1996 figures published by the United
Nations in Geneva, the world's poverty population has risen from 1
billion in 1990 to 1.5 billion in number, with 90 percent of them
living in the developing countries. The number is still growing at
a rate of 25 million per year," Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
On the causes of the above-mentioned problems, Wang said, "The
present irrational international economic relations, unfavorable
external economic environment and stalling international
development cooperation aggravate the situations of the developing
countries and impedes the realization of the economic, social and
cultural rights as well as the right to development of their
people. The imposition by some Western countries of their
political models on developing countries, in disregard of the
latter's national conditions, also constitutes one of the main
causes."
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out, "The Chinese delegation maintains that the
full realization of the economic, social and cultural rights and
the right to development is the urgent task with practical
significance for the developing countries."
</P>
<P>
Wang listed the following points for the international
community and the commission to focus their efforts on:
</P>
<P>
1. Equal attention should be given to economic, social and
cultural rights. As indicated by the development process of many
developing countries, there is no civil and political rights to
speak of if without economic and social development. However, when
talking about the issue of human rights, some developed countries
tend to regard civil and political rights as the basis and
preconditions for the realization of all human rights and neglect
economic, social and cultural rights. Practical actions should be
taken by this commission to redress the present situation in which
economic, social and cultural rights are being neglected.
</P>
<P>
2. The right to development warrants our due attention and
correct understanding. The Chinese delegation is of the view that
the right to development represents a great leap forward in the
evolution of the concept of human rights, and its significance has
gone beyond that of the other human rights. It is closely linked
to and has a special meaning for the international community and
in particular, the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
3. International cooperation should be strengthened and the
obstacles to the realization of the right to development be
eliminated. To promote the realization of the right to
development, it is necessary for each country to draw up their own
effective economic development policies in light of their national
conditions. However, it is also indispensable for the
international community to take effective measures to remove the
existing obstacles at the international level. The international
community should make much more efforts to establish a just new
international economic order and carry out broad international
cooperation. Particularly, the developed countries should show
more political wills in fulfilling their commitments in such core
areas as capital, debt, trade and technology, in order to create a
favorable economic environment for the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
4. The development approaches chosen by different countries
should be respected. Countries of the world have different social
systems, value standards, historical traditions, religious beliefs
and cultural backgrounds. The people of different countries have
the right to choose the social system, development path and living
style in light of their national conditions and free from
interference by any other country. Any attempt to impose a
specific model on others in disregard of the multiformity of our
world will never be successful. This point is amply demonstrated
by the turmoils occurred in certain countries in recent years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Up Moderately in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States saw a
moderate 0.3 percent increase in consumer prices in February, that
further supports economists' belief that inflation is not a
problem despite strong economic growth and tight labor markets.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted rise in the Consumer Price Index,
reported by the Labor Department today, was higher than many
economists anticipated due to a sharp rise in fresh vegetables and
energy costs. But the so-called core prices -- excluding fuel and
energy -- rose a more modest 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall inflation for the year so far was running at a 2.3
percent annual rate, compared with 3.3 percent for all of last
year. Core inflation advanced at a 2.2 percent rate, lower than
the 31-year low of 2.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Food prices in February rose 0.3 percent, erasing a 0.3 percent
gain in January. Because of a late January freeze in Florida, a
major vegetable growing area, the price of fresh vegetables surged
8.9 percent in February, the worst in 22 months. Tomato prices
jumped 9.3 percent; fresh fruit, 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, dairy products fell 1.1 percent, the fourth
consecutive monthly decline following an 8.5-percent rise over the
previous four months. The prices of meat, fish and eggs also fell,
but that of baked goods was up.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices increased 0.3 percent in February, the sixth in a
row. Natural gas prices jumped 1.2 percent, bringing the rise over
the past 12 months to 14.4 percent. But fuel oil declined 1.6
percent, the largest seasonally adjusted decline since July.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Government to Be Formed in Indian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (XINHUA) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have decided to form a
coalition government in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh with the
chief ministership going to the two parties by rotation every six
months.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between top leaders of the two
parties on Tuesday night, BSP General Secretary Ms. Mayawati will
be the chief minister for the first six months and BJP leader
Kalyan Singh will occupy the post for the next six months, Press
Trust of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the post of speaker would go to the BJP
which has a strength of 176 in the 425-member state assembly. The
BSP has 67 seats.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of both BJP and BSP are reaching Lucknow, capital
of the state, tonight to stake their claim with the governor.
</P>
<P>
The decision to reach a coalition agreement between the two
parties ends five months of political stalemate in the most
populated state of India.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has imposed presidential rule on the
state since last October when the state assembly election resulted
in a hung house.

<HEADLINE> EC Questions Denmark's Total Ban on Metal Cans of Drinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Wednesday that Denmark's total ban on the use of metal cans for
beers and soft drinks may be contrary to EU packaging rules.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said that on the one hand, EU packaging rules
are aimed to reduce the environmental impact of packaging waste,
but on the other hand, the rules also ensure the functioning of
the internal market and avoidance of obstacles to trade and of
distortion and restriction of competition.
</P>
<P>
"Having carefully looked into the Danish reasoning for
maintaining its ban on metal cans and on the reasoning of the
commercial interests concerned, the Commission was not convinced
that the Danish ban was compatible with the (EU Packaging)
Directive," the Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In a Letter of Formal Notice, the Commission has asked Denmark
to explain further why it considers that its strict measures are
not contrary to EU rules.

<HEADLINE> More Ethiopian Peasants Participate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Ministry of
Agriculture announced today that about 800,000 peasants all over
the country are taking part in the agricultural development
extension program this year, twice the number of last year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by extension team leader in the ministry
Belay Ejigu when he was speaking to local journalists here.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government encourages peasants to participate in
the agricultural development extension program and supplies them
with improved seeds and fertilizers. Last year, about 400,000
peasants were organized under the program and used advanced
farming methods.
</P>
<P>
Belay said agricultural inputs for the agricultural
development extension program are being distributed to regions,
adding that selected seeds are being transported to various
regions and fertilizers are also being distributed to regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to Belay, agricultural professionals who
will foster execution of the extension program have attended a
one-week trainers training course recently. They will train
peasants on how to promote the cultivateion of economically
viable crops, liverstock development, post production technology,
production of select seed, fertilizer distribution and marketing.

<HEADLINE> EU Says Poor Banana Exporters Under Threat by WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- African, Caribbean and
Pacific(ACP) banana exporting countries face economic disaster if
the World Trade Organization(WTO) forces the European Union to end
import benefits, a European Commission spokesman said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The warning came as the WTO delivered an interim report on
Tuesday claiming that the benefits granted under the Lome
Convention discriminate against bananas from U.S.-owned
plantations in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously any changes to the banana regime would have very
serious social, political and economic implications for the ACP
banana producing countries," Commission agriculture spokesman
Gerard Kiely said, adding that the Caribbean countries would be
the worst affected.
</P>
<P>
"Since October 1994 the US authorities have pursued a strategy
which if successful would lead directly on the destruction of the
Caribbean banana industry," the Commission said in a memorandum on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Caribbean Banana Exporters' Association,
Caribbean producers - Belize, Surinam, Jamaica and the Windward
Islands - account for only three percent of World banana exports
and represent only seven percent of the EU market.
</P>
<P>
Kiely said the Commission was carefully studying the WTO report
which was only the first of four potential steps before a final
decision is taken by the WTO trade disputes panel, possibly in
August.
</P>
<P>
The Commission said almost two-third of EU banana imports are
supplied by Latin America. In 1995, the EU imported 2.65 million
tons of bananas under a reduced tariff quota, almost exclusively
from Latin America. Duty free imports from Caribbean and African
exporters totaled just under 680,000 tons.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has pledged to give 15 tank
trucks to drought areas of the Somali region in order to
facilitate provision of water to victims of the chronic shortage
in the areas.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Jijiga, capital of the Somali
region today, an official of the UNHCR told the Somali regional
administration that the trucks will reach the region next week.
</P>
<P>
The official said water vessels, chemicals, other necessary
accessories and a vehicle to be deployed to monitor the overall
activities of the tank trucks will be delivered to the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, efforts will be made to sinking
water wells in the areas.
</P>
<P>
It was recalled that the Somali region administration declared
a state of emergency on March 6 to contain the disaster. Some
areas of the region have had no rains since last September and
about 600,000 people are facing acute shortage of drinking water.

<HEADLINE> Strong UK Economic Data Increase Rate Rise Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Latest retail sales and average
earnings figures released today by the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) have heightened chances of a UK interest rate
rise, local press reports say today.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales, a key indicator of consumer confidence, rose by
0.5 percent last month, much higher than City economists'
expectation of an increase of just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales in January were also revised up from an increase of 0.6
percent to 0.7 percent, according to the ONS.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, average earnings in January rose by an unexpected
five percent annually, the highest figure since November 1992,
compared with December's 4.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had forecast unchanged average earnings figures.
</P>
<P>
Economists believed that the strong economic figures, together
with another big fall in UK unemployment total in February also
announced today by the ONS, increased the pressure for a rise in
interest rates, now at six percent, in order to tackle
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
According to the minutes of the last meeting between Bank of
England governor Eddie George and the Chancellor Kenneth Clarke on
February 5, George had called for an immediate quarter point rise
in base rates.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that a move in base rates from six percent to
6.25 percent was needed if the government wanted to hit its
two-year inflation target.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Ease Border Rules for Own Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union should take
action to make it easier for citizens of member countries to cross
borders to work, study or unite their families, an EU advisory
group was quoted as saying by today's International Herald
Tribune, a daily newspaper published in The Hague, the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Despite being promised freedom of movement by the EU treaty,
many EU citizens still face obstacles in matters regarding
residence cards, taxes,, car registrations, pensions, training
certifications and health care, the panel said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The eight-member group, headed by Simone Veil, former French
social affairs minister, proposed some new laws but put the
emphasis on better information, cooperation among national
authorities and enforcement of existing rules.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the group made 80 recommendations,
including introduction of a one-year European residence card that
could be used by students, trainees, volunteers and artists who
move temporarily to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The group also said the EU should amend its rules to make it
easier for workers who cross borders to be joined by family
members and possibly also by unmarried partners.

<HEADLINE> Canada Changes Rules for Immigrant Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian families who want to
bring along overseas relatives will have to prove they have enough
income to live up to their obligations under a new government
plan.
</P>
<P>
The plan will make it more difficult for low-income families to
sponsor overseas relatives because current income rules are not
always enforced, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Current sponsorship agreements do not constitute a binding
contract. But the changes unveiled Tuesday will enable government
officials to pursue deadbeat sponsors in court.
</P>
<P>
"We need to ensure that family-class immigrants coming to this
country can be adequately taken care of by the people they have
come to join," Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, over 68,000 family-class immigrants came to Canada,
sponsored by relatives who are supposed to support them.
</P>
<P>
Yet, in Toronto alone, the government paid some 250 million
U.S. dollars last year for the 14 percent of people who defaulted
on their sponsorship deals.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want the community to have to pick up the tab
because sponsors have made irresponsible promises they will not
keep," Robillard said.
</P>
<P>
The minister insisted the new rules will not reduce the number
of family immigrants coming to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, bankrupt individuals and prisoners will no
longer be able to sponsor their relatives to Canada.

<HEADLINE> Senior Greek Official Tours Southern Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Undersecretary
Yannos Kranidiotis returned home today after his two-day tour of
Southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
During his visit there, Kranidiotis met on Tuesday with
representatives of the armed rebels in Gjirokaster and Sarande who
control southern Albania, as well as local representatives of
political parties and government.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from Gjirokaster to northern Greek city of
Ioannina, Kranidiotis said he would convey the views expressed by
the representatives he met not only to the Greek government but
also to the Albanian government and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"Greece's aim is for Albania to return to normality,"
Kranidiotis said, expressing the hope that Albanian President Sali
Berisha's refusal to give in to the rebels' ultimatum to step down
would not lead to an exacerbation of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Albanian Foreign Ministry lodged today a
demarche with the Greek embassy in Tirana concerning the meetings
between the Undersecretary and Rebel representatives in southern
Albania.
</P>
<P>
The demarche notes that the rebel representatives have no
institutional competency for such meetings and Kranidiotis's visit
should not have taken on such a nature.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the demarche, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said Tirana had been aware of the visit, which constituted
the continuation of initiatives aimed at ushering in a new period
for relations between the two Balkan neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the Albanian demarche would not affect
the course of Greek-Albanian relations.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Government Resigns, New PM Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- King of Jordan Hussein today asked
Abdul Salam Majali, a former prime minister, to form a new
government after accepting the resignation of the current Prime
Minister, Abdul Karim Kabariti, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
The king accepted Kabariti's resignation during a half-hour
meeting at the Royal Palace, which was attended by the outgoing
30-member Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said in a speech this afternoon that he resigned on
the demand of the Royal Court, which wanted someone else to carry
on the ongoing economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Majali, 71, is a former army general who served as prime
minister between May 1993 and January 1995.
</P>
<P>
He headed Jordan's delegation in peace negotiations with
Israel since the launch of the Madrid peace conference in October
1991 and signed Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Majali formed his first government in May 1995 and handed over
the helm to Kabariti in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Among the immediate tasks facing the Majali government is
supervising the next parliamentary elections as well as a series
of legislations mostly related to economic liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Palace officials said the king was expected to leave for the
United States in a few days and the Majali government could be
sworn in before his departure. Expectations were that the
swearing-in could take place Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet shuffle came as a surprise and Kabariti admitted
he didn't expect the change. "Events, changes and developments
whether locally or regionally always surprise us," he said after
chairing his last Cabinet meeting earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, a member of parliament who served in several
previous cabinets as foreign minister, minister of labor and
minister of tourism, took office in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Since assuming the premiership, He has pushed through a
serious of political and economic reforms that all his
predecessors had hesitated to introduce.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti also led efforts that resulted in a dramatic
improvement in Jordan's relations with some of the Gulf states
strained during the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis sparked by the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> 30th Cairo International Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 3000 companies from 51
countries and regions will show their best quality of products at
the 30th Cairo International Fair that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The fair, the largest annual trade extravaganza in the Mideast
and Africa, is hosting a record number of global attendants and
providing the most spacious ever display floor this time in its
30-year history, said Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed
Goweili at the opening ceremony today.
</P>
<P>
China, marking its 12th turn-up at the gathering, has sent a
200-strong delegation to explore business opportunities here with
its world counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one hundred Chinese companies are standing with baited
breath to show off their hottest lines at the well-arranged booths
in the Fair Ground in a Cairo suburb.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Egyptian companies participated in the exhibition,
which will run throughout March 28. It is part of the country's
sustained efforts to attract investment and partners.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel is conspicuously absent from the fair, saying
that it is a not profitable event.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has addressed invitations to 28 trade ministers in
addition to chairmen of Arab and foreign chambers of commerce to
attend the inauguration of the fair.
</P>
<P>
The countries that participated in the exhibition for the first
time are Bosnia, Herzegovina, Thailand, Belarus and Mali while
some others are showing up again after a long absence such as
Argentina, Brazil, Cameroon, India, Pakistan, Malaysia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture, housing, scientific research, maritime
transport, petroleum, information and banking sectors will have
pavilions at the fair.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Israel Settlement Policy Gets Peace Nowhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Bulldozers would not lead to peace
but rather to destruction, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said today as the controversial Israeli settlement construction in
East Jerusalem entered its second day.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Presidential headquarters, Moussa
stressed the importance of complete rejection of "any unlawful
practices under Israel's settlement policy."
</P>
<P>
Amid an international chorus of condemnation, Israel today
continued the construction of the 6,500-unit new Jewish
neighborhood in Arab East Jerusalem, where the Palestinians want
as the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
In Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the southeastern outskirts of
Jerusalem, bulldozers and steam shovel went back to work under
heavy security guard. The Palestinians have set up protest tents
nearby but much-feared conflicts did not break out so far.
</P>
<P>
These have seriously violated the Palestinian-Israeli peace
accords and damaged the foundations of peace, said the top
Egyptian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the current situation is threatening to thrust
the region into a no peace-no war era, Moussa said "I don't think
matters would reach this extent."
</P>
<P>
As Arab frustration are mounting over what they see as an
Israeli attempt to tighten grip on Jerusalem, the Cairo-based Arab
League has accused Israel of dragging the Mideast into a state of
"no war no peace" as in the post-1973 period.
</P>
<P>
Moussa called up the world community including the Islamic
Conference member states, to throw weight behind the Palestinians
and stand up against the Israeli settlement activities on occupied
Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost, they must firmly reassert their full
rejection of the Israeli settlement policy which is illegitimate,
breaches all the principles of peace and threatens the peace
march," he said.
</P>
<P>
A fresh round of international efforts is under way to secure a
U.N. Security Council resolution that is similar to the one
adopted recently at the General Assembly barring Israeli
construction on Arab lands, according to Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"I wish there would not be any attempts to veto an
international resolution on this matter," said the Egyptian top
diplomat, otherwise he warned Netanyahu will pick up the signal
and go ahead.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the U.S. vetoed a Security Council draft
resolution that condemns Israel's Har Homa project, a move Egypt
said has eroded Washington's credibility as a fair mediator and
encouraged Israel to be bold.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, outraged by Israeli decisions on the new housing
project and limited further redeployment in the West Bank, missed
the March 17 deadline for talks on a permanent peace accord with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator of the peace process and strong advocate
of the Palestinian cause, make peace with Israel in 1979 but ties
have deteriorated since Netanyahu took power last June.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) announced today it is seeking
115 million U.S. Dollars for its operations to repatriate about
783,000 refugees in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The plan was outlined in a U.N. consolidated inter-agency
appeal for 324 million U.S. Dollars issued by the Department of
Humanitarian Affairs for 1997 operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
The region is currently hosting 385,000 Rwandans, 305,000
Burundians and 92,000 Zaireans, according to UNHCR's estimates.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR's attention is centered in eastern Zaire where refugees
need international protection and assistance in repatriating to
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are being made to track down large numbers of refugees
who have moved from one makeshift camp to another as fighting
escalated. Ten of thousands of them have also vanished in the
equatorial rain forest, said the UNHCR press release.

<HEADLINE> Zaire Conflicting Parties Urged to Accept UN Peace Plan Unconditionally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- African leaders, gathering here
today to seek a peaceful solution to the Zaire crisis, urged "all
parties to the conflict to unconditionally accept and implement"
a five-point peace plan set forth by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was included in a communique issued at the end of
the one-day regional summit meeting chaired by Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the summit examined developments
in the Great Lakes region since Nairobi Summit II last December
and expressed "grave concern over the rapidly deteriorating
situation in eastern Zaire".
</P>
<P>
The African leaders reaffirmed the urgent need for the
implementation of the February 18th peace plan approved by the UN
Security Council, which provides for an immediate ceasefire, the
withdrawal of foreign forces, negotiations and elections and the
protection of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government has accepted the peace plan while the
rebels led by Laurent Kabila who have occupied one-fifth of Zaire
refused to a ceasefire before negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The summit urged the parties to the conflict to immediately
cease hostilities, and create the necessary environment to
facilitate a negotiated settlement, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
It also underscored the importance of establishing a mechanism
for monitoring the implementation of the UN peace plan and will
invite the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution to meet in Lome, Togo on March 26 to address this
issue.
</P>
<P>
The summit resolved that diplomatic efforts should be
intensified in the search for a lasting solution to the Zaire
crisis, added the communique.
</P>
<P>
The regional summit meeting, a continuation of the Nairobi II,
was also participated by President Rober Mugabe of Zimbabwe,
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa, Prime Minister of
Cameroun Peter Musonge.
</P>
<P>
President Pascal Lissouba of Congo and Zairean Prime Minister
Kengo wa Dondo attended the meeting at special invitation. The
first presence of Zaire at such a summit was welcomed by the
African leaders.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the summit, President Moi said:"I
believe that with Zaire's participation, the search for peace
will indeed gain considerable momentum."
</P>
<P>
Also participating in the summit was Mohamed Sahnoun, joint
special representative of the UN and the OAU, and Secretary
General of the OAU Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, President Moi championed two Nairobi summits
on the Zaire crisis, but Zaire refused to attend them for the
presence of Uganda and Rwanda which are accused of supporting the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Despite those peace efforts, however, the Zaire crisis is
still continuing to escalate.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was a good
example to other African countries such as Zaire and Angola on
how to resolve their political conflicts, visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on his arrival at Cape Town
International Airport, Annan said South Africa had a major role
to play internationally, particularly in peace-keeping operations
and in negotiations to help resolve conflicts on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
"The international community played a role in your own
successful struggle and you have a role to play as a partner in
the world community," said the U.N. Chief.
</P>
<P>
Annan is in the country for a four-day visit at the invitation
of President Nelson Mandela. This was Annan's first official
visit to Africa since his inauguration in January this year.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that Africa could not develop economically
and socially unless its political conflicts were resolved.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in South Africa, Annan is expected to hold
talks with Mandela and his Deputy Thabo Mbeki on the Zairean
crisis, the Angolan peace process and the U.N. reform.

JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israelis and Palestinians
should avoid any initiative that would impede the peace process
in the Middle East, visiting United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said today.
</P>
<P>
Annan made the remarks at a press conference in Cape Town on
his start of a four-day visit to South Africa at the invitation
of President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Israeli government's controversial building
of a new Jewish housing project in disputed East Jerusalem, Annan
said: "I am on record as saying that both parties should avoid
any initiative that would impede the peace process. The region
has been in conflict for many years."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Chief stressed that the world body had been involved
in the Middle East peace process from the very start, hoping that
the major difficulty could be managed in a manner that it would
not block the on-going peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians on Tuesday called on the U.N. Security
Council to demand an immediate halt to the building of 6,500
homes in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Last week the U.N. Assembly passed a resolution, with the
opposition of Israel and the United States, appealing the Israeli
authority to immediately stop the house-building project, which
caused strong opposition in the Arab world.

JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- As the construction of a new
Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem continued for the second day
today, a senior Palestinian official said Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu, "with his policy, has killed the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Minister of Jerusalem Affairs
Faisal Husseini said that the Middle East peace process has died.
</P>
<P>
Despite Strong opposition by the Palestinians, as well as the
international community, Israel Tuesday started the construction
at Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim), on the southeastern outskirts of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with council-generals from the European Union at the
Orient House in Jerusalem, Husseini said that he does not believe
the peace process is existing anymore (after the start of Har Homa
building).
</P>
<P>
Husseini, who held a sit-in strike in last two days at a tent
set up at a nearby hill top of Har Homa, said that the
Palestinians have been trying to defend the peace process by
peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
He called on Israeli public to join the Palestinians in
non-violent demonstrations against the building at Har Homa, and
to rescue the peace.
</P>
<P>
Husseini called out his sit-in protest today, but stressed
that "the battle is not over."
</P>
<P>
The PNA official said that the Palestinian people "must try
everything to defend their land, defend their lives and defend
the peace process."

<HEADLINE> Cattle Lung Disease Breaks Out In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A lung sickness of cattle,
known as contagious bovine pleuro pneumonia (CBPP), has broken
out in Chunya District in Mbeya Region of southern Tanzania,
sources from the Ministry of Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
A quarantine has been imposed in the district and no cattle or
animal products shall be moved in or out of the district without
written permission from authorized veterinary officers, according
to Dr. Bonaventura Juma Mtey, a senior epidemiologist in the
Agricultural Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Mtey said the whole local market has been closed effective
from March 13, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the disease was reported in the nearby regions of
Rukwa and Tabora, and apparently Mbarare District and the entire
Usangu Plains in Mbeya Region is now under risk.
</P>
<P>
The Regions with the disease already reported are Mara,
Arusha, Kagera, Kigoma, Shinyanga and Singida.
</P>
<P>
There is surveillance and vaccination process going on and
when there is an outbreak of the disease other measures are taken
on the spot, Mtey noted.
</P>
<P>
He added Mbeya Region is part of a regional CBPP Control
Program which involves three countries of Malawi, Zambia and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The control project is intended to prevent the spread of the
disease from spreading further south of Tanzania to the remaining
two countries of Malawi and Zambia. It is also a Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) technical cooperation project
which started a few months ago with a budget of 380,000 U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, regional and district veterinary officers from
border districts of Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania are meeting in
Mbeya to discuss problems of the outbreak and how to contain it.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Cairo Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
is due here tomorrow amid mounting tensions in the Mideast as the
international pressure has failed to discourage Israel from its
controversial new settlement project in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
latest developments of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations track,
which is virtually stalled at the moment, Egypt's MENA news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will be their second this month, will focus
on Israel's recent practice to build 6,500 Jewish homes in Har
Homa and close four Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to brief Arafat on his recent visits to
France, the U.S. and Morocco, where he sought international
support for the Palestinian cause and pitched against Israel's
policy.
</P>
<P>
Amid an international chorus of condemnation, Israel today went
ahead with the Har Homa construction works in East Jerusalem, a
traditionally Arab land captured in 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Outraged by the Israeli housing project and limited
redeployment plan in the West Bank, Arafat decided to put the
final status talks on hold, saying the measures have bulldozed the
peace process and invited violence.
</P>
<P>
Despite increasing criticism from hardline groups for his
peaceful approach, Arafat today called for restraint among his
compatriots and avoiding violence in reaction to the Jewish
construction.
</P>
<P>
Only minor incidents were reported on Tuesday night in response
to the ground-breaking of Har Homa as the Palestinians have set up
protest tents nearby.
</P>
<P>
During Arafat's last visit, Egypt reaffirmed its support to the
Palestinian demand for establishing an independent state with
Jerusalem as its capital and said the status of the holy city has
to be decided in the talks on a permanent peace accord between
Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator of the peace process, has hosted the
Palestinian leader frequently. Ties with Israel have deteriorated
since Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu took power last
June.

<HEADLINE> Report: Netanyahu Promises More Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu has promised right-wing members of Knesset (parliament)
a major boost in settlement activity in order to keep his
coalition intact, said English bi-weekly the Jerusalem Report.
</P>
<P>
The Greater Israel Front -- over 20 legislators from all the
right-wing parties including Netanyahu's Likud -- has extracted
Netanyahu's promises on new by-pass roads for Jewish settlers in
the West Bank; "filling in" the belt of settlement around
Jerusalem, and building in the Jewish sector of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Michael Kleiner, chairman of the group, told The Report that in
an hour-long meeting with Netanyahu in early March, the prime
minister promised him "everything." And, he said, Netanyahu has
already authorized construction that would link the Settlement of
Ma'aleh Adumim in the West Bank with Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
For now, in light of the prime minister's pledges, the group
has shelved plans to topple the government in a no-confidence
vote. But, said Kleiner, it will keep up the pressure.
</P>
<P>
The Front intends to focus on a single issue at a time,
according to Kleiner, threatening to desert the coalition and vote
Netanyahu out -- as it did in late February when it forced a
government decision to build 6,500 Jewish homes on the East
Jerusalem site of Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
That move was a key factor in arousing international pressure
on Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
To increase its pressure on Netanyahu, the Greater Israel
Front also aims at pushing through an amendment to the Direct
Election Law, making it possible for a majority of 61 Knesset
members -- and not the 80 currently required -- to depose the
prime minister without forcing new parliamentary elections. With
the support of the Labor opposition, that change could well be
approved, according to Kleiner.
</P>
<P>
He added "That would give us added leverage. I hope we won't
have to use it. My aim is not to topple him, but to get him to
mend his ways."

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriot Unions Join Forces on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Greek and Turkish Cypriot
trade unions today urged Cypriot political leaders and
international community to facilitate a peaceful solution to the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
In a joint declaration issued at the end of the three-day
All-Cyprus Trade Union Forum Study Conference, the 16
participating trade unions from both communities reaffirmed their
previous joint declaration issued on January 18, 1995.
</P>
<P>
They called on international and regional trade unions, the
United Nations, the European Union, Cypriot political leaders and
all other parties to help find a settlement to the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The opening and closing sessions of the conference were held in
the government-controlled southern part of divided Nicosia, and
the second-day meeting was held in the Turkish-controlled
northern town of Lapithos.
</P>
<P>
The declaration demanded a quick and just solution to the
Cyprus problem based on the 1977 and 1979 high level agreements
between the two communities and relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions stressed the need to safeguard within a
future federated state, one system of employment and labour
relations, one social insurance system, unified standards of wages
and salaries, the freedom of association and movement throughout
the island and protection from discrimination of any kind.
</P>
<P>
The Greek and Turkish Cypriot trade unions also declared their
unanimous approval of Cyprus' accession to the European Union (EU)
which will bring benefits to workers and the people of Cyprus as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration also expressed the trade unions'
willingness to expand their contacts and broaden the spectrum of
their cooperation by organizing working groups on social
security, wage, industrial relations and educational issues.
</P>
<P>
The conference is a follow-up of the successful 1995
All-Cyprus Trade Union Forum, which focused on labor
issues.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Greek and Turkish Cypriot trade unions also
discussed issues concerning free movement of capital and labor.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the EU, was also attended by
U.N. resident representative Gustave Feissel and representatives
from European trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Kyriakos Nathanael, a delegate from the Greek Cypriot trade
union POAS, said after the meeting that the conference is proof
that Greek and Turkish Cypriots share the wholehearted wish to
work together in a common homeland in achieving equal working
conditions for both communities.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM Pays Lightning Visit to Belgrade, Skopje </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos returned to Athens this evening after a lightning one-
day visit to Yugoslavia and Macedonia, where he met with the
leaders of the two countries to discuss the crisis in Albania.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Belgrade, Pangalos held talks with his
Yugoslav counterpart Milan Milutanovic and met with President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos said afterwards that the two sides have reached
agreement on three points, namely: to seek the promotion of
security and political stability through the restoration of
democratic procedures in Albania, to put strict policing of
borders to avert side-effects from the crisis, such as smuggling,
and arms and drugs running, and to cooperate between the two
countries' ministries of defense and public order on the matter.
</P>
<P>
He also said it was agreed there should be frequent contacts
among Greece, Yugoslavia and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
(FYROM), with a view to formulating a common position at the
meeting of Balkan foreign ministers in Greek city of Salonika on
June 9.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Skopje, capital of FYROM, Pangalos held
four hours of talks with FYROM's leadership, including President
Kiro Gligorov, Prime Minister Branco Crvenkovski, Foreign Minister
Lubomir Frckovski and the ministers of defense and the interior.
</P>
<P>
He said talks in Skopje also touched on protection of Greek
exports and the sizable Greek private investment in FYROM,
cooperation in the fields of river water management and crime
issue as well as issue of the name for the former Yugoslav
Republic.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Minister Vows to Fight Judaization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians will not sit idle
when Israel tries to complete Judaizing Jerusalem and control
Palestinian land before the final status talks, Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) International Cooperation Minister Nabil
Shaath said today.
</P>
<P>
"The Mideast peace process is facing a serious 11th-hour
battle," Shaath, who is currently visiting Egypt, told reporters
after his talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
The PNA so far has been able to curb the Palestinian anger, but
this does not mean that the Palestinians "will stand with tied
hands either in peaceful mass action or intensive political action
on all levels," Shaath cautioned.
</P>
<P>
"We will raise the settlement issue at the upcoming Rabat
Jerusalem Committee meetings, the Islamabad Islamic summit and the
Arab League meetings this month," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians will also press for the U.N. Security Council
to adopt a resolution to protect the peace process, despite the
previous U.S. veto that had killed a similar one, which condemned
the Israeli plan to build 6,500 Jewish homes in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On the Har Homa housing project, Shaath said it is an attempt
by Israel to "use violence, tanks and bulldozers to kill the peace
process, lay siege to Jerusalem and Bethlehem and tear up
Palestinian land."
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel has over the past few days confiscated
land surrounding Jerusalem and is expelling Palestinian Bedouins
living in Marshland in a bid to map out what the Israelis want to
impose at final-status talks without negotiations.
</P>
<P>
All this is happening with armed force and not with peace and
negotiations, he pointed out. The Palestinian-Israeli talks have
virtually stalled at the moment and no new date for the final
talks is set.
</P>
<P>
On the American stance on Israel's current practices, Shaath
said the Palestinian side has been informed of contacts by the
U.S. with Israel in a bid to stop the new settlement project.
</P>
<P>
This means the U.S. is not satisfied with what is going on, but
it fell short of taking more clear-cut steps to press Israel from
giving up the plan, Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side will keep on asking the U.S. to adopt
a more vigorous attitude in this regard through a joint
Palestinian, Arab and international drive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported today that
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat is due here Thursday amid
mounting tension in the Mideast as the world has so far failed to
discourage Israel from its controversial new settlement project in
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Minister Calls for European Contribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides today called for European effective contribution to
the solution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides made the appeal to the European Parliament, the
European Union (EU) Council and the Commission at a meeting of the
EU-Cyprus Joint Parliamentary Committee, which concluded here
today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Cypriot minister made reference to the
recent postponement of the EU-Cyprus dialog in Brussels following
EU members discussed Turkish Cypriots' participation in the
island's accession talks.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he is pleased that during his recent tour of
six European capitals, his colleagues assured him that accession
talks will begin with the Cypriot government as scheduled, six
months after the end of the Intergovernmental Conference.
</P>
<P>
"What is more important is that this is now the stance of the
15 member states, as expressed at the informal EU Council meeting
at Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, last week," Michaelides added.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Cyprus will very soon submit proposals
aiming at harmonizing its legislation and policies with those
adopted by the EU, in a bid to implement most of them by the time
accession talks begin.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware that our accession to the EU does not aim
at securing a free entrance ticket," he said, stressing that "our
ambition is to become an equal member."
</P>
<P>
Michaelides also spoke about the ongoing U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish communities which
would lead to direct negotiations between President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the EU and the U.S. have shown increased
interest in helping these efforts. But he stressed the need for a
coordination of actions so that "the outcome of those efforts will
be productive."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took control of 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup. It applied for full EU membership in
1990.

<HEADLINE> Swaziland to Recruit Nigerian Nurses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Swaziland Ministry of
Health is planning to recruit Nigerian nurses to help relieve an
acute shortage of trained nurses in the kingdom's hospitals and
clinics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Mbabane, capital of the kingdom,
Principal Secretary of Health Almon Mbingo said a number of
Nigerian doctors were already working in Swaziland, either on
contract or in private practice.
</P>
<P>
Mbingo said a batch of 20 Nigerian nurses, along with five
doctors, a laboratory technician and a pharmacist, would arrive
in the country by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
All of them were volunteers and paid by the Nigerian
government while the Swaziland government provided free
accommodation and gave them a small allowance.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland had for years experienced a shortage of trained
doctors and nurses due to lack of training facilities, rapid
population growth and a drain of trained Swazi nurses opting for
better pay in neighboring South Africa and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Croatian Government Urged to Protect Minority Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
urged on Wednesday the Croatian government to take further
measures to protect the minority Serbs, particularly by restoring
law and order in the Serb-populated areas.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council remains deeply concerned that, although
the government of Croatia maintains that it has deployed the
necessary number of police officers, Croatian Serbs continue to
live in conditions of serious insecurity throughout the area which
has been designated United Nations Protected Areas," said a
presidential statement.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern that there continues to be little progress
with regard to the return of Croatian Serb displaced persons and
refugees to the former U.N. protected areas, the council also
called upon Croatia to accelerate its efforts to improve
conditions of personal and economic security, to remove obstacles
to the rapid issue of documentation to all Serb families and to
resolve promptly the property issue.
</P>
<P>
To remove uncertainty of Serb population about the
implementation of the amnesty law, the council called upon the
Croatian government to finalize without delay the list of war
crime suspects on the basis of existing evidence and in strict
accordance with international law, and to put an end to arbitrary
arrests, particularly of Serbs returning to Croatia.

the United Nations expressed here today its disappointment at the
lack of progress on the implementation of the plan for the

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Side Backs Peace Process, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Greek Cypriot side has the
political will to move forward the peace process with the Turkish
community on the Cyprus problem, Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides said here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that "the proximity talks are
underway and our side will try and will do all it can to see this

<P>
Last week, U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel started indirect talks through bi-weekly separate
meetings with President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash, attempting to broker a direct meeting before
the end of June.
</P>

should be made to create a better climate, and facilitate the
whole process," pointing out that these moves could be made by
both sides or unilaterally.

"Creating an increasingly improved climate is helpful," he
added.

crucial to the course of the ongoing talks. "We have the
political will to move ahead to direct negotiations," he added.

Clerides that the U.N. expects that the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides will soon make unilateral good-will gestures to give a push
to on-going efforts to reach a solution to the Cyprus problem.

<P>
He said the good-will measures are being discussed in the
preparatory meetings he began last week, stopping short of giving
details.
</P>

Feissel also said U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan "is
determined to make every effort to get to those face-to-face
talks and our hope is that we'll get there by the middle of this
year".

The U.N. envoy is expected to meet Denktash Thursday and will
have a second meeting with Clerides on Friday.

JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U. S. First Lady Hillary
Clinton planted a tree with South African social activist
Archbishop Desmond Tutu today in a special garden of remembrance
commemorating those who died in struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Clinton told a gathering at Cape Town's trauma center for
victims of violence and torture that their ceremony proved that
rage and anger could be turned to hope and possibility.
</P>

Those who had lost loved ones in the liberation struggle could
have given themselves over to hatred and violence, but instead
South Africans had chosen the much harder path of forgiveness,
truth and reconciliation, Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Children could one day play under the tree, and people could
visit the tree to remember their lost ones, she said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to today's tree-planting ceremony, Mrs. Clinton also
told a gathering of hundreds of women in Cape Town, the
legislative capital of South Africa, that building a democracy
was the work of all the country's people and not just that of the
government.

<HEADLINE> Krupp, Thyssen Start to Negotiate Merger of Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Controversies over a hostile
takeover bid by Germany's second-largest steel concern
Krupp-Hoesch for its larger rival Thyssen might be solved in a
more friendly way.
</P>
<P>
The two companies agreed to start negotiations on a merger of
their steel production units, German media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new development followed talks Tuesday evening between
Krupp-Hoesch boss Gerhard Cromme and his Thyssen counterpart
Dieter Vogel, under the mediation of Jahannes Rau, premier of the
North Rhine-Westfalia state where both companies are located.
</P>
<P>
In a surprising move, both companies agreed to hold
negotiations in the following eight days in order to seek a merger
of their steel units.
</P>
<P>
If a viable concept can be found, then the hostile takeover
attempt launched by Krupp-Hoesch would no longer be a topic, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Untouched by the new announcement, thousands of Thyssen steel
workers who walked off their jobs Tuesday continued their protests
in Duisburg today, fearing that even a merger could not avoid mass
job losses.
</P>
<P>
At a time when German unemployment already lies at a record
high, the prospect of mass layoffs could ignite a new round of
labor unrest in Germany's heavy industry heartland in the Ruhr
Valley, where mass demonstrations were held earlier this month in
protest against the federal government's plans to cut state
subsidies to the region's coal miners, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, a spokesman for German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
said Kohl was watching the Krupp-Hoesch takeover bid "with great
concern."
</P>
<P>
Chancellor spokesman Peter Hausmann said that Kohl warned at
the "negative effects for jobs" and called on both companies to
find a reasonable solution at their negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sharply Criticizes NATO Expansion on Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helsinki, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia sharply criticized the
expansion plan of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on
the eve of the summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Helsinki, Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
Russia's presidential press secretary, said that if the alliance's
expansion becomes true, it will be the "strategic mistake" and
"worst" decision after the end of the Cold War and the West will
pay a high price for it.
</P>
<P>
He said through an interpreter that NATO has no reasons at all
to expand since there are no more different ideologies or
confrontation following the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions of the NATO expansion have already undermined
the trust between Russia and the West built after the end of the
Cold War," he said, adding that they "have thrown shadows" over
the relations between Russia and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
NATO expansion will dominate the two-day summit. But neither
side has signaled any concessions over the issue. The two
presidents are also expected to discuss arms control and bilateral
economic relations.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's New Government Swears in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 19 (Xinhua) - Jordan's new Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali, together with his 24 ministers, swore in here
tonight in a ceremony attended by Jordanian King Hussein and Crown
Prince Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Majali's cabinet is seven member smaller than the last Cabinet
headed by Abdul Karim Kabariti, the state-run Jordan Television
reported.
</P>
<P>
Hussein was quoted as saying that the new government is
expected to bring about a new modern state of Jordan through a
series of sweeping reforms in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Among the 24 ministers, five are from the Kabariti government,
13 are new faces in Cabinet and the rest ever served the
government before the Kabariti Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The new government's foreign policy should be based on
contrinued committment to the peace process, continued
contribution to Arab issues and keeping contacts with world
organizations by keeping an international identity, Hussein said.
</P>
<P>
The king singled out poverty and unemployment as priorities for
the government.
</P>
<P>
The king asked Majali, aged 71, to supervise the coming
parliamentary elections in a free and honest manner.
</P>
<P>
Hussein accepted Kabariti's resignation at noon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month in a television interview, the king said
that it was then too early to say whether Kabariti was the prime
minister to be entrusted with the tasks which included major
reforms in the administrative system as well as approaches to many
internal issues.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, who served in several previous cabinets as foreign
minister, minister of labor and minister of tourism, took office
in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Given the mandate of carrying out a "white revolution,"
Kabariti pushed through a series of economic reforms that all his
predecessors had hesitated to adopt.
</P>
<P>
Having overcome the crisis, Kabariti was expected to lead
further economic reforms, and the current reshuffle in government
came as a surprise to many who had predicted that the deputy from
Aqaba, Jordan's port city, would continue his job and supervise
the next parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti also led efforts that resulted in a dramatic
improvement in Jordan's relations with some of the Gulf states
strained during the 1990-1991 crisis triggered by the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Majali, who headed Jordan's delegation in peace negotiations
with Israel since the Launch of the Madrid peace conference in
October 1991, formed his first government in May 1993 and managed
to guide the negotiations that led to the signing of the
Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty in October of that year.
</P>
<P>
His government was followed in January 1995 by a cabinet headed
by Sharif (now Prince) Zeid Ben Shaker, who handed over the
helm to Kabariti in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Among the immediate tasks facing the expected Majali government
is supervising the next parliamentary elections as well as a
series of legislations mostly related to economic liberalization,
in the interim as temporary laws.

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:

<HEADLINE> Large Chemical Fiber Plant for South China </HEADLINE>

<P>
NANJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on a large
chemical fiber plant started Tuesday in Beihai, a coastal city in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The venture is one of the region's key construction projects
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), and will cost
1.6 billion yuan (about 200 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The plant is designed to produce 20,000 tons of viscose short
staple and 50,000 tons of artificial fiber pulp, basic materials
for viscose fiber.
</P>
<P>
The fiber, which can be used to produce new chemical fabrics,
now enjoys brisk market worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Beihai and the surrounding areas have an abundance of
eucalyptus trees, key raw materials for the production of viscose
fiber. The city now has 4.3 hectares of eucalyptus forests and
another 4.6 hectares of land suitable for the trees, which could
be used for the new chemical plant.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pays Lightning Visit to Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
arrived here today on a lightning visit for consultations with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Israel's Har Homa Jewish
settlement project in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders' meeting, the second this month, came two days
after Israel sent in bulldozers to Har Homa, the site of a
6,500-unit new Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem, where the
Palestinians want to establish the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to discuss how to confront Israel's practice
to change the Arab features of East Jerusalem, while Mubarak
warned Wednesday it is thrusting the peace process into "a new era
of violence."
</P>
<P>
Israel has urged the Palestinians to wrap up talks on a final
peace agreement within six months and resolve all the sensitive
issues including the future of Jerusalem and the Palestinian
statehood,
</P>
<P>
The call virtually bypasses other issues like planned Israeli
further redeployments from the West Bank and other Israeli
commitments under the 1995 interim deal. Arafat has not made a
response to it.
</P>
<P>
The two sides missed the March 17 deadline for final talks and
Arafat said he would not meet Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu until the Har Homa plan is reversed. He said the Israeli
decision violated Oslo agreement which provides for keeping the
current status of Jerusalem until the final talks on a permanent
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Under increasing criticism by hardliners for his soft approach,
Arafat Wednesday called the Palestinians to restrain from violent
response.
</P>
<P>
So far international diplomacy has failed to discourage the
Israeli housing project despite the UN General Assembly adopted a
resolution barring the Israeli settlement in occupied Arab land
last week.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of International Cooperation and Planning
Nabil Shaath said here Wednesday they have called for an
immediate meeting of the UN Security Council to adopt a similar
resolution that had been aborted by a U.S. veto.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will brief Arafat on his recent U.S.-Euro-Arab tour
where he sought international support for the Palestinian cause
and pitched against Israel's policy.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's phone conversations with Arafat, King Hussein of
Jordan, Netanyahu and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in the past
few days, however, have produced no options to contain the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, warnings of imminent armed attacks inside Israel are
rife, and fears fanned by calls from Islamic rejectionist groups
for a resumption of the Palestinian popular uprisings as a protest.
</P>
<P>
With the new Israeli housing decision, Palestinian-Israeli
relations have plunged to their worst.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator of the peace process, has hosted the
Palestinian leader frequently. Ties with Israel have deteriorated
since Netanyahu took power last June.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Cui Tiankai told a conference in Beijing today that
China hopes for close Sino-British cooperation in the final 100
days before Hong Kong's return to the motherland so as to make the
transition smooth.
</P>
<P>
He also said such cooperation is in the interest of Hong Kong,
China's inland areas, and Britain.
</P>
<P>
"China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong is a major
event that attracts attention from the rest of the world, and July
1 is what all the Chinese people at home and abroad are longing
for," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's "one country, two systems" is a great concept put forth
by Deng Xiaoping, Cui said, calling the return an important step
toward the reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
He said the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) serve as the
legal principle and legal basis for solving the Hong Kong problem,
and the solution of the problem has become a model for resolving
historical issues and international disputes through peaceful
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Last year saw the choice of Tung Chee Hwa as the first chief
executive of the HKSAR, and the formation of the Provisional
Legislative Council, and not long ago, the HKSAR Executive Council
was formed by Tung, and the main officials of the first regional
government were nominated by Tung and appointed by the central
government.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong now enjoys social stability, and the situation is
encouraging," the spokesman said, noting that over the past
century the people of Hong Kong have built their home with hard
work and wisdom, which is typical of the Chinese nation as a
whole, into an important international trade, financial and
shipping center.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, the HKSAR will maintain its status as a free
trade port and a center of international trade, finance, shipping
and information, he stressed, and that the people of Hong Kong are
optimistic about Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
According to surveys, 73 percent of the people of Hong Kong are
confident about Hong Kong's continued prosperity and stability,
and the number of applications for emigration has been declining
in recent years, and the percentage of those who have come back
after emigrating has been increasing, Cui said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's GDP in 1996 had an average growth of 4.7 percent,
and economic growth for 1997 is estimated at more than 5 percent,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the international community has complete
confidence in the return of Hong Kong, and that many foreign
businessmen there still view the "Pearl of the East" as a good
target for investment after 1997.
</P>
<P>
By the second half of 1996, there were 4,523 large foreign
companies with subsidiaries in Hong Kong, a 12 percent increase
over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the destinies of the people of Hong
Kong and of the Chinese nation as a whole are always connected,
and so are their development. He added, "We believe that Hong
Kong, under the principles of 'one country, two systems,' 'Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong' and 'high autonomy,' will be a
more prosperous and stable area. It is going to be more beautiful
tomorrow."

<HEADLINE> South Korea's GDP Rises 7.1 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South Korea achieved a 7.1 percent
rise in gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996, the central bank
said today.
</P>
<P>
The increase narrowly exceeded the projected rate of seven
percent. Economists don't, however, consider the situation
perfect.
</P>
<P>
Initial statistics of the Bank of Korea show the country's GDP
in 1996 reached 38.998 trillion won (484.6 billion U.S. dollars,
with one dollar equal to 804.75 won), rising 7.1 percent compared
with the previous year, against an 8.9 percent growth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
While the figure was good, it didn't necessarily mean 1996 was
a complete success, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that inflexibility in production operations
lifted total stockpiles to 2.333 trillion won (2.9 billion
dollars), which partially offset the GDP increase.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose 14.1 percent, while imports jumped 14.8 percent,
widening the commodity trade deficit to more than 15 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year's current account deficit ballooned to 23.7 billion
dollars against 8.95 billion in 1995, the central bank figures
showed.

<HEADLINE> Measures Being Taken in Pakistan to Revive Economy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Finance Minister
Sartaj Aziz said today that the government was taking short term
as well as long-term measures for the revival of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The packages for industrial revival, exports augmentation and
institutional reforms would be presented in phases to check
chronic fiscal deficit, balance of payments problem and high
inflation, said Aziz when addressing a seminar on "Macroeconomic
Issues in Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He underscored the need for making drastic surgery of the
institutions especially in the financial sector to redress their
problems.
</P>
<P>
First priority of the government, he said, was the revival of
the industrial sector to enhance the growth of the economy.
</P>
<P>
While next package, he said, would be for the exports
promotion, followed by measures for institutional reforms which
were grossly ruined.
</P>
<P>
By improving industrial growth and stepping up export earnings,
"we can begin to recover growth rate and if we succeed, there will
be visible improvement in macro economy," Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The packages and measures accompanied by good policies could
start yielding good results within three to six months, the
finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
The exports at present, he said, could be enhanced by utilizing
existing capacity of industrial sector under short-term revival,
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
The National Debt Retirement program, he said, would provide
cushion while exports package would be floated after industrial
sector revival.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was one of the major cotton-exporting countries, he
said, adding that the export of yarn worth one billion dollars
could earn three billion dollars by converting it into cloth
exports.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the degeneration of the institutions, Aziz
observed that both economic and political institutions were
threatened by decay due to the mismanagement and financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
The corporations, he added, were even unable to meet their own
financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, excessive staff, bad loans and high administrative
costs had increased the cost of money which could be reduced by
checking all these aspects, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani finance minister underlined the need of improving
the savings and investment rate which were at present around 13
percent and 17 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
With improvement in savings rate and investment with more
foreign investment, growth rate could be sustained at seven
percent per annum, he said.

<P>
SOFIA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- One out of four Bulgarians suffers
from hypertension, a condition associated with various
cardiovascular diseases which threaten the eastern European
country with only a population of eight million.
</P>
<P>
About 800 out of 100,000 women die annually of cardiovascular
diseases. The figure for men is 600 out of 100,000, Nina Gocheva,
an associate professor from a Bulgarian cardiovascular diseases
institute, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She said that in 1995, 100,000 people died of cardiovascular
diseases, accounting for 62.2 percent of the country's total
deaths from illness. A decade ago, only 1.11 percent of the
illness-related deaths were attributed to cardiovascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition, smoking, pressure and lack of treatment all
contributed to the high incidence and high mortality of
cardiovascular diseases in Bulgaria, the professor added.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese JLG Signs Six Summaries of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) today signed six summaries of talks concerning the
transition of Macao, wrapping up the 28th plenary session of the
joint body.
</P>
<P>
The summaries were on the establishment of an office
representing the Foreign Ministry of the People's Republic of
China and the establishment of the Macao consulate of the Republic
of Portugal, on the air agreement between Macao and India, and on
Macao's renewal of its member status to four international bodies.
</P>
<P>
The four bodies involve the world consumers' body,
International Libraries Association, International Archives
Committee and the East Asian branch of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jiading, chief representative of the Chinese side on the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, described the three-day meeting as "quite
fruitful".
</P>
<P>
"After hard work of the two sides during the past several days,
we have come to quite fruitful results," Guo told reporters
tonight at a press conference. "That is in accordance with the
spirit of talks between leaders of the two countries."
</P>
<P>
During Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio's visit to China last
month, he and Chinese President Jiang Zemin reached a consensus
that both Portugal and China should start from a strategic point
of view and for the general benefit of friendly cooperation
between the two countries, and quicken the working procedure of
the JLG in handling issues concerning the transition in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The two sides promised to make further efforts in the three
leading issues -- the localization of civil service, of law, and
the implementation of Chinese as an official language, according
to a joint communique subsequently issued today.
</P>
<P>
They also held talks on a wide-range of issues concerning the
transition in Macao, which include the nationality issue of some
Macao residents, pension of retired civil servants, agreements of
some franchise businesses whose term runs beyond 1999, the
transfer of archives, the establishment of a Portuguese-speaking
school, among others.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint communique, the two sides have scored
substantial progress in the much-disputed issue of the "Oriental
Foundation." They will continue their consultation on the issue in
a "constructive spirit" so that it could be solved soon.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to hold their next plenary session
as of June 19 in Lisbon.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges Coal Workers To Improve Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Coal workers should continue
efforts to get the money losing industry out of the red this year,
Premier Li Peng said today during a national conference on
improving the money-losing situation in the coal industry.
</P>
<P>
Li commended the coal workers for their contributions to
China's economic development since the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949, and especially since the reform and
opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the coal industry, which might well get out of the
red and show some gains this year, provides a good example for
other industries with difficulties to emulate.
</P>
<P>
The coal industry has had a strategy of diversifying management
while sticking to coal products as their basic item for the past
few years. This guideline is correct and has provided economic
returns, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Coal production must fit the demands of the socialist market
economy, he said, and that production must be in keeping with
demand and coal mines are encouraged to set up direct links with
major users.

Vice-Premiers Zhu Rongji and Wu Bangguo also attended the

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is committed to
cooperating closely with Mozambique in a wide range of activities,
King Tuanku Ja'afar said tonight.
</P>
<P>
It is Malaysia's earnest hope that through greater efforts on
the part of both countries, the current low level of economic
activities would become a thing of the past, he said at a state
banquet in honor of Mozambiquean President Joaquim Alberto
Chissano who arrived here Wednesday on a four-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
The King said that in the spirit of South-South cooperation,
Malaysia would do its utmost to help Mozambique in its efforts for
its national reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia is also ready to share its experience in cultivating
and exporting primary commodities as well as in manufacturing,"
Tuanku Ja'afar said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is encouraged by both the economic openness and
integration taking place within Africa as well as with Africa's
openness to the rest of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian private sector had responded positively to the
government's call to go abroad and invest in countries of the
South, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made modest inroads and we hope that through these
efforts we will be able to contribute towards economic growth and
help our friends, both near and far, to prosper," the King said.
</P>
<P>
The King has the view that "domestic peace and stability are
absolutely essential if the countries of the South are to
contribute to regional and international peace and security."
</P>
<P>
"A politically stable and economically progressive Mozambique
means a peaceful nation which, in turn, will contribute to
regional peace," he added.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique today welcomed
Malaysian business community to engage in joint ventures and other
forms of participation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to build a strong government and private partnership
with Malaysia, visiting Mozambique President Joaquim Alberto
Chissano said his country needs the support and assistance from
the international community for its development programs.
</P>
<P>
"We will welcome our friends from Malaysia so that together we
may build a more prosperous Mozambique and bring at the same time
benefits to your country," he said at a state banquet host in his
honor by Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar here tonight.
</P>
<P>
"We would like therefore to encourage your business community
to engage in Joint-ventures and other forms of participation of
mutual benefits in Mozambique," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Chissano said Malaysia and Mozambique should envisage
practical forms of cooperation in projects of regional impact in
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) such as energy,
transport and telecommunications and the use of suitable
technologies to combat plagues and for the preservation of
environment.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said his government was in the process of implementing
its five-year program which draws the main guidelines for the
social and economic rehabilitation of the country.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the program's activities was highly
positive and encouraging, he said, adding "nevertheless, such
results are still far from satisfying the needs of the population
for the country which has just come out of a 16-year war that had
destroyed a great deal of social and economic infrastructures and
many human lives."
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the desire of seeing Malaysia to participate
in the collective efforts for the development of the SADC
sub-continent.

<HEADLINE> Lehman Brothers Predicts Good Profit Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Lehman Brothers, a renowned
global investment bank, predicted good profit prospects for Hong
Kong banks in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Based on the satisfactory performance last year, the banking
sector will record an average increase of 11 percent in earnings
this year, Lehman Brothers' senior regional banking analyst
Raymond Lee said here today.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd.
(HongkongBank), local banks will be even proud of a 19 percent
profit gain in the year, he added.
</P>
<P>
HongkongBank, a member of the HSBC Group headquartered in
London, is the largest bank incorporated in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Falling loan provisions, according to the analyst, are among
the underlying factors for the optimistic forecasts.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing last year's banking performance, Lee said, Hong Kong
still housed the most profitable banks in Asia, with profit growth
accelerated to 21 percent for the whole sector, or 11 percent
excluding HongkongBank.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 was a year of intense competition, featured by
fierce mortgage war and narrowed interest margins, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that smaller banks continued to outperform
bigger ones, with the year's chart of earnings growth led by First
Pacific Bank Holdings, Dah Sing Financial Holdings as well as
other small institutions.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that the China-funded Bank of China (BOC)
Group, whose performance was not represented in his charts,
enjoyed a 21 percent earnings growth last year.
</P>
<P>
The analyst expected one or perhaps more members of the group
to be suitable candidates for listing in Hong Kong as the group
has taken a relatively large share on local deposit, loan and
mortgage markets.

<HEADLINE> Rare Swatch Watches for Exhibition in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A shipment of more than 1,600
Swatch watches worth about 200,000 Cyprus pounds (about 400,000
U.S. dollars) have been stolen on their way from Italy to
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The watches were due to go on show Friday at an exhibition in
Nicosia, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
They included several rare timepieces, one of which, worth
30,000 U.S. dollars, is owned by the Pope. The star exhibit, the
Kiki Picasso, worth 46,000 dollars, was also gone along with
several other rare watches.
</P>
<P>
The report said the container carrying the watches arrived at
the Limasol port on March 13 from Venice, Italy, and had remained
at the port under guard until Wednesday, when it was opened by
Customs officials, who found that nothing remained except the
smashed locks on the individual display cases.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot police is now investigating the incident in
cooperation with Interpol.
</P>
<P>
Nino Michaelidou, Director General of M.P. Michaelides Ltd,
sole agent for Swatch in Cyprus, said today that the theft must
have happened before the cargo reached Cyprus, as the container,
in which the watches were traveling, arrived in Cyprus sealed.
</P>
<P>
He said the opening ceremony of the exhibition is canceled,
but the exhibition will take place Saturday, as the Swiss
company has a second set of exhibits, which will be sent to
Cyprus by air in two shipments.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Firms Dominate Russian Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish firms have become the
leading contractors in Russia's booming construction market,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspaper Daily News, Russian Trade
Representative Victor Koptevsky made the remarks in a two-day
symposium entitled "Turkey and the International Construction
Market" in the largest Turkish city of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
"At present, Turkey's companies are in the first place in
the Russian construction market among the foreign companies,"
the representative said.
</P>
<P>
He added some 150 Turkish contractors were working on more
than 200 construction projects in Russia, involving a total volume
of 5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkish contractors such as Enka, Entes, Alarko, Gama, Tekfen,
Baytur and Tekser have been involved in construction in Russia for
the past 15 years, Koptevsky said, adding that even a large number
of small companies joined competion at the thriving construction
market there.
</P>
<P>
The Russian trade official, however, noted that these small
companies, most of them without international contracting
experience, did not do a satisfactory job, thus affecting the
reputation of the Turkish construction industry.
</P>
<P>
Koptevsky noted that a severe shortage of fund in Russia had
resulted in the reduced scale of the country's major construction
projects, and he urged Turkish banks to extend more loans to the
Russian construction market.
</P>
<P>
According to a report jointly prepared by the Turkish
Contractors' Association and the Union of International
Contractors, Turkish companies implemented nearly half of their
foreign contracts in Russia between 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Turkish contractors are also very active in many other
countries, including Libya, Kazakhstan, Germany, Turkmenistan,
Kuwait, Belarus, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, sponsored by the Ankara-based Contractors'
Association, ended on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Becomes Major Turf Grower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
has broken the foreign monopoly on the turf that China uses by
providing about ten million sq. m. of it for sports fields across
the country.
</P>
<P>
Before 1978 when China started reform and opening-up, the
country had practically no turf growers, making it difficult for
China to hold international footable matches.
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1985, Professor Ren Jizhou of the Gansu Grassland
Ecology Institute started a company to develop turf with the help
of colleagues. They co-operated with many overseas companies and
organizations, and finally selected 40 finalists from more than
100 types that are suited to growing in the different areas and
climates of China.
</P>
<P>
The company has laid more than 100 patches of turf on golf
courses, football fields, and parks in 30 cities, provinces, and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
During the 11th Asian Games in 1990, the quality of the turf on
the sports grounds got good comments from foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The company has started to provide grass seeds and techniques
for some Middle Eastern and African countries and has signed a
contract for laying turf on a Russian sports ground.

<HEADLINE> Rare Book of Ancient Short-lived Writer Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)
block-printed edition of a collection of a short-lived writer from
some 1,400 years ago has been found in a county library in central
China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that the book, found in Tanghe county, is
the only existing copy.
</P>
<P>
The works, a "fu" (descriptive prose interspersed with verse),
29 poems, and three funeral orations, were written by Xie Huilian,
a cousin of Xie Lingyun, a minister and one of the most renowned
writers in the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589).
</P>
<P>
Standing side by side with his famous cousin in the history of
literature, Xie Huilian, however, died at the age of 27, with few
of his works remaining.
</P>
<P>
The newly found edition, according to the experts, will
contribute to the study of the achievements of the writer who was
thought of as highly literary.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM: Israeli Policy to Bury Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri warned here today that Israel's hardline policy will turn
the Mideast peace process into destruction.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who is currently on a two-day visit to Egypt, made the
remarks after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
his Egyptian counterpart Kamal el-Ganzoury.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Egypt hold identical views regarding the recent
development in the peace process which is in "a critical stage",
Hariri said. "We fear the Israeli hardline government will bury and
destroy the peace march," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, a key component in the Mideast peace process, has no
diplomatic ties with Israel. In 1985, Israel in defiance of
U.N. resolutions established a 1,100-kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon to guard against guerrilla attacks on its northern
border.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who arrived here Wednesday night for talks with
Egyptian leaders on trade dispute as well as the Mideast peace
process, stressed that Egypt and Lebanon need to further
coordinate their positions and demands with the European Union
(EU) in their requests for an EU partnership deal.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's visit to Egypt came after a decision made by the
Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture two weeks ago to ban imports of
potatoes that drew sharp criticism from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian press hinted that Cairo might freeze its bilateral
trade agreement with Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural fracas aside, Hariri said that the "historical
friendship" between Egypt and Lebanon has been "firm and strong."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Egypt are seeking to conclude EU partnership deals
which will help expand cooperation between Europe and the Arab
Mediterranean countries with a view to establishing a free trade
zone by 2010.

<HEADLINE> Water Purification Plants Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Mogadishu is being relieved
from water related diseases by the recent inauguration of three
water purification plants.
</P>
<P>
The three water plants are operating simultaneously in the
capital for the first time in more than seven years. The largest
of these water plants, Dayah (moon) situated in north Mogadishu
produces 5000 liters of clean potable water every day.
</P>
<P>
Professor Mohamed Abukar, the general director of Dayah
factory, said that his plant has the capacity to produce enough
water for the consumption by Mogadishu and its neighboring
districts and villages. However, their production is controlled
and limited by the demand of the market.
</P>
<P>
According to the technicians who operate these water
machineries, they extract the iron and magnesium from the water
and also desalinate the water and neutralize the acid after
killing all kinds of germs that would hurt the well being of the
human being. According to professor Abukar, they follow the
international standard of water purification systems recognized
by the World Health Organization of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The second largest water plant, Euro-water, also in north
Mogadishu produces only 1000 liters of extra clean water. Mr
Abdullahi Muse Sumuni, the chairman of the plant, told that his
factory which was built last year has the capacity to produce 20
liters of clean water every minute which makes 11800 liters per
day.
</P>
<P>
Like wise the smallest factory, Habgal, situated in south
Mogadishu produces even smaller quantity of water.
</P>
<P>
The owners of these three water plants agree that their
clients are increasing by the day as the time passes by, and that
their production has been handicapped by the ignorance of people
about the use of the clean water. However, professor Abukar
admitted that their clients had increased since the public
awareness programs against the spread of cholera by UNICEF had
started.
</P>
<P>
These factories sell their clean water in two ways. They
either pour them in bottles of 1.5 liters and sell them Somali
shillings 3000 which is US dollars 0.40 cents or sell them in
litters without containers. People may get 20 litters and the
factories also teach the people how to clean the water
containers. The other advantage of these factories is they
operate on both electrical and mechanical.

</P>
<P>
Spokesman for AVIC Sun Guangyun said at a press conference

</P>
<P>
The exhibits include aircraft, aeroengine, airborne equipment,
foreign trade and commercial machinery products. In addition to
real-size models, eight real aircraft will also be on display.
</P>
<P>
A series of activities will be held concurrently during the
show, which include technical seminars jointly with related
universities and science and technology committees in Hong Kong,
visitors interviewing chief designers and test pilots of exhibited
aircraft and giving of related souvenirs.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Seizes Largest Quantity of Ecstasy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police seized 30,000
tablets of ecstasy -- the largest quantity of the kind of drugs
ever found in the city -- which could fetch about nine million HK
dollars (1.15 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In an operation on Wednesday afternoon, officers of the
Narcotics Bureau smashed a dangerous drugs trafficking syndicate,
captured the ecstasy tablets wrapped in 30 packets and arrested
four men.
</P>
<P>
Police said the drugs were imported from the Netherlands for
distribution in Hong Kong. They warned members of the public
especially the youngsters to stay away from all dangerous drugs
which are addictive and can cause death.
</P>
<P>
Ecstasy is an illegal drug used especially by young people to
give a feeling of happiness and energy in night clubs and at
parties.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, only one tablet of ecstasy
was found in Hong Kong in 1993 while in 1996 alone 20,000 tablets

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Arrive in Helsinki for 11th Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Yeltsin arrived in Helsinki today for the 11th summit, the
toughest since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who will pay a working visit to Finland after the
two-day summit, arrived about three o'clock p.m. local time. He
was greeted at the Helsinki Vantaa airport by Finnish President
Martti Ahtisari.
</P>
<P>
A welcome ceremony for Yeltsin was held at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a smiling Clinton got out of the plane in a
wheelchair that is first moved into a catering truck lifted to the
gate of the plane. He has to be driven to the hotel in a mini-van
instead of a limousine. His right knee was injured in a fall more
than one week ago.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which should have taken place in Washington, but
moved here in accommodation with Yeltsin's health, is going to
kick off with a grand dinner hosted by Finnish President Marti
Ahtisari this evening.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Ahtisari are due to meet on bilateral relations
prior to the dinner.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russian presidents will begin their formal talks
on Friday with NATO's expansion, arms control and the economic
relations high on the agenda. The most important subject is the
alliance's enlargement, which will change security order in Europe.
</P>
<P>
As neither the U.S. nor Russia is willing to soften their
positions over the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), hopes of a breakthrough in the row have faded.
</P>
<P>
On her arrival in Helsinki, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright today reaffirmed that NATO will implement its eastward
expansion plan as scheduled regardless of any opposition from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Helsinki late Wednesday, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, Russia's presidential press secretary, said that if
the alliance's expansion becomes true, it will be the "strategic
mistake" and "worst" decision after the end of the Cold War and
the West will pay high price for it.
</P>
<P>
He said through an interpreter that NATO has no reasons at all
to expand since there is no more ideological confrontation
following the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"There are none of reasons for NATO to move eastward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions of the NATO expansion has already undermined
the trust between Russia and the West built after the end of the
Cold War," he said, adding that they "have thrown shadows" over
relations between Russia and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's approach to NATO expansion will not change regardless
of any summits, bilateral meetings and negotiations,"
Yastrzhembsky told reporters.
</P>
<P>
NATO's move also undermines arms reduction negotiations between
Russia and the U.S. The implementation of the START II treaty has
stopped while process of starting talks on START III is slowing
down, said Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate solution to the issue is the denial of taking new
members, or postponing acceptance of new members," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. takes a same firm position. U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said that the alliance's enlargement will go
ahead despite of the strong opposition from Russia.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian officials say that progress could be made in
arms control and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky said that the summit is important to both sides
since it takes place after the two presidents haven't seen each
other for a long interval, and against the background that they
were both reelected not long ago.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will review bilateral relations since the
end of the Cold War and the summit also offered a chance for them
to "lay down an outline for Russian-U.S. partnership in the 21st
century," Yastrzhembsky said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM: Israeli Policy Will Bury Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri warned here today that Israel's hardline policy will blow
up the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hariri, who is currently on a two-day visit to Egypt, made the
remarks after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
his Egyptian counterpart Kamal al-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said the two sides discussed the obstacles in the way of
the peace process and the outcome of Mubarak's tour of France, the
U.S. and Morocco in addition to bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Egypt hold identical views as regards the recent
developments in the peace process, which the Lebanese leader
described as in "a critical stage." "We fear the Israeli hardliner
government will bury and destroy the peace march," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri came to Cairo amid mounting Arab uncertainty over
Israel's real intention for peace when the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks have virtually deadlocked due to an Israeli decision
to build new Jewish homes at Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem, a
move which drew strong criticisms from Arab countries and the
Islamic world at large.
</P>
<P>
His visit coincided with that of Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara who also held talks with Mubarak today. It is feared that
the Har Homa crisis will make peace prospects on the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks even more remote.
</P>
<P>
On a European proposal for "full peace for full security" on
restarting the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli peace tracks,
the Lebanese premier said there have been no viable suggestions so
far.
</P>
<P>
"European Mideast envoy Miguel Moratinos has no new proposal
but rather a serious will to contribute to making a breakthrough
in the deadlocked negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All Arabs are committed to the land-for-peace principle which
is a basis of the Madrid conference and insist on that talks
restart from the point where they stopped," he added.
</P>
<P>
The EU played a major role in realizing an April 26
U.S.-sponsored understanding which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz on
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, a key component in the peace process, has no
diplomatic ties with Israel. Since 1985 the Jewish state has
occupied a self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon, in
defiance of relevant U.N. resolutions, which stipulate a full
withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral ties, Hariri said that the "historical friendship"
between Egypt and Lebanon have been firm and strong. Lebanon and
Egypt are both seeking EU partnerships which will help expand
cooperation between Europe and the Arab Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and Lebanon need to further coordinate their positions
and demands with the EU in this respect," said Hariri, who
arrived here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Hariri is also expected to ease a trade fracas during his talks
with Egyptian leaders. The Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture
decided two weeks ago to ban imports of potatoes drew sharp
criticism from Egypt over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In response, Egypt hinted that Cairo might freeze its bilateral
trade agreement with Beirut.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Decides on Pillar Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
chosen machine building, household appliances and electronics,
construction and new materials, petrochemicals and fine chemistry,
and automobile manufacturing as pillar industries of its economy.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended at improving competitiveness of the
industries, which have developed rapidly in recent years. In 1996,
the added value of the industries provided some 10 percent of the
province's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial plan, the added value of the
sectors should reach 60 billion yuan, or over 15 percent of the
province's GDP, by the year 2000. They are expected to account for
over 50 percent of the province's total imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to fork trucks, excavators, farm
vehicles, refrigerators, luxury passenger buses, chassis for light
duty vehicles, citric acid, cement, and board production lines.

</P>
<P>
NATO leaders are considering issuing formal invitations to some
ex-Warsaw Pact states, most possibly Poland, the Czech Republic
and Hungary, at the NATO summit scheduled for July in Madrid.

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Thailand Vow to Strengthen Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Thailand vowed to
further strengthen their bilateral ties as the Prime Ministers of
both countries called here today for continued efforts to promote
cooperation between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a welcoming dinner in honor of visiting Thai
Prime Minister General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong urged "Thai and Singapore investors to
combine their resources to explore and tap the economic potential
of the emerging growth areas in Asia."
</P>
<P>
He said that Prime Minister Chavalit and he "discussed ways to
enhance our already warm and substantive bilateral relationship,
and our cooperation in regional fora such as ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations), the ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), APEC
(Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation), and ASEM (Asia Europe
Meeting)".
</P>
<P>
"We share similar views about the value and direction of these
institutions. We also agreed to institutionalize regular exchanges
between the civil services of Thailand and Singapore," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chavalit, who arrived here this afternoon on a
two-day official visit, said, "In this rapid changing world, our
friendship and cooperation needs to be continually nurtured and
strengthened."
</P>
<P>
"As we continue to develop, we naturally find ourselves
competing more vigorously. What we must ensure is that our
competition is healthy and supportive of each other in the
development of our respective countries and of the region,"
Chavalit said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that the Thai Prime Minister is here to
build stronger economic ties and wants closer cooperation between
the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is now Thailand's third largest trading partner and
the largest amongst the ASEAN countries. Singapore's bilateral
trade with Thailand has grown yearly to reach 14.2 billion US
dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's investments in Thailand soared three-fold from 567
million US dollars in 1994 to 1.5 billion US dollars in 1995. In
the first nine months of 1996, Singapore's investment in Thailand
amounted to 1.1 billion US dollars, marking Singapore the fourth
largest foreign investor in Thailand, and the largest among the
ASEAN nations.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival this afternoon, in addition to his talks with
Goh Chok Tong, Chavalit also met with Singapore President Ong Teng
Cheong, and had a lengthy meeting with Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Rocket Northeast Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out this
morning an air raid at a target near the Assi river in
northeast Lebanon but there has been no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in the area said that four Israeli jet fighters
launched the air raid at 9:05 a.m.(0705 GMT) at the Assi valley in
the Hermel area, some 140 kilometers northeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli warplanes carried out a dive attack at a park and a
mosque eight kilometers southeast of Kermel City, but there had
been no reports of casualties, the police sources noted.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman announced in Jerusalem that Israeli
warplanes struck this morning a base of terrorists and they
"precisely fulfilled the mission."
</P>
<P>
The air raid, the 24th since this year, came less than one day
following an attack by guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, on an Israeli patrol deeply inside the
so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Prevention of Conflicts in Africa Is Prime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The acting secretary general
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), ambassador Ahmed
Haggag said the rpevention of conflicts in Africa was a prime
concern to the OAU, not only because of the resources that were
being spent in resolving these conflicts, but also because of the
humanitarian dimension involving millions of refugees and
displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
According to an OAU press release issued today, the remarks
were made by ambassador Haggag Tuesday when he received here a
ten-man delegation from Finland led by Pekka Haavisto, Minister
for Development Cooperation and the Environment.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Haggag stated that the OAU has been monitoring
parliamentary and presidential elections in Africa for some years
adding that the presence of the OAU and the U.N. election
observers could positively influence the process of
democratisation in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Minister Haavisto welcomed the existing contacts between the
OAU and the European Union, and expressed the wish that the two
organizations should work more closely together in sharing
inforamtion in resolving conflicts. He pledged the willingness
and disposition of the government of Finland in assisting the OAU
in executing some of its programs, according to the press
release.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Change of Symbol Reflects Historic Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 20 (Xinhua) --The crown is fading out and
bauhinia is coming in, reminding people that Hong Kong is bidding
farewell to colonial rule and opening a new page in its history.
</P>
<P>
On receiving a letter from a local friend, a Hong Kong
housewife may find that the usual definitive stamp bearing the
British queen's portrait has been replaced by a square piece
featuring the landscape of the Hong Kong Island. This change makes
 her realize that the handover is merely 100 days away -- on July
1, 1997, Hong Kong will become a special administrative region of
China after about 150 years of British rule.
</P>
<P>
As the housewife does, many Hong Kong people begin to realize a
profound change now undergoing smoothly -- designs with
connotations of colonial rule like the crown are fading out along
with the word "royal."
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong issued a new set of 16 definitive stamps at the
beginning of this year to phase out the set in circulation, which
features the queen's portrait. The new set presents a panorama of
the Hong Kong Island and captures both day and night scenes.
</P>
<P>
Postmaster General Robert Footman said the old definitive
stamps or the royal cipher will no longer be valid for postage
beginning July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Apart from stamps, the Post Office will give a facelift to the
about 800 mailboxes across Hong Kong and all mail vans, covering
the crown or royal cipher with the Post Office logo. From now on
till July 1, 1997, date stamps and frank dies with both Chinese
and English indications will, step by step, replace the existing
postmarks and franking impressions, which are in English only.
</P>
<P>
As in the Post Office, similar changes have taken place in
public schools. Queen's College, the oldest public middle school
in Hong Kong established in 1862, stopped last winter the use
of a traditional school badge bearing the crown, according to
Principal Lee Kar-hung. The symbol of crown has disappeared from
the school badges sewn on the chest pockets of boys' uniforms and
from school exercise books and stationery. A new design, which
carries only the school motto "Labor Omnia Vincit" (Hard working
overcomes all) and the abbreviated school name "QC," has come into
use.
</P>
<P>
Principal Lee said the school would open such courses as the
Chinese language and Chinese history this year to help students
gain knowledge about China. Brought up in Hong Kong where
Cantonese is the dialect, schoolboys are now keen to learn
putonghua, the standard spoken Chinese. "There will be more and
more academic exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong after
the handover on July 1, 1997," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
The Educational Department has asked all the 37 public middle
schools and 46 public primary schools in Hong Kong to end the
use of badges, emblems and stamps having connotations of colonial
rule after June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
In early February this year, the Hong Kong government unveiled
new designs of badges and insignia to be worn by uniformed
officers after the handover, with all signs of British rule
abandoned. It is reported that 2 million separate items of badges
and insignia are involved in the change at an estimated cost of 6
million HK dollars (770,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a new era sets in, "royal" becomes obsolescent. With a
history of 114 years, the Hong Kong Observatory dropped the word
"Royal" from its name along with the royal coat of arms on its
emblem in mid-February to become the last government department to
change its title and logo. The Hong Kong Jockey Club, which
oversees horse racing -- the most widely-participated event in the
territory, started to remove "Royal" from its title a year before
the handover. However, the club cannot complete the change of
emblems in its 150-odd lottery stations till the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the jockey club said the change of title and logo
made almost no difference to horse-racing fans since they know
that horse racing will continue in Hong Kong after July 1, 1997 --
the lifestyles will remain unchanged after Hong Kong returns to
China.
</P>
<P>
When the outdated is gone with the wind, new symbols are filing
in. A bauhinia highlighted by five star-tipped stamens has caught
the eye of both local citizens and overseas tourists, who can find
the symbol on flags, emblems, calendars, souvenirs, T-shirts, caps
and cups.
</P>
<P>
The Sino United Publishing (Holdings) Limited, one of the
biggest publishing houses in Hong Kong, is stepping up its
production of regional flags and emblems of the HKSAR as the
reunification is drawing near.
</P>
<P>
In celebration of Hong Kong's return to China, many social
groups have placed orders for various commemorative items, all
featuring the bauhinia highlighted by five star-tipped stamens,
according to sources of the Sino United publishing house.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a white dolphin, a symbol of family reunion, has
been chosen as the mascot for celebration of Hong Kong's
reunification with the motherland. With the approaching of July 1,
1997, the design of the lovely animal has appeared more and more
frequently in Hong Kong, both on small items like a key chain and
on large-scale activities such as a charity walk to raise funds
for celebration activities.

ISLAMABAD, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake of severe
intensity today jolted Quetta, capital of Pakistan's Baluchistan
province, and its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Macao Banking Business Sees Stable Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Macao's banking business saw a
stable growth last year, with both bank deposits and loans rising
mildly under a slowdown overall economy, a top local banker said.
</P>
<P>
Luo Iong Gan, deputy general manager of the Tai Fung Bank Ltd.,
one of the leading banks in Macao, said at a recent seminar that
the banking business grew almost the same as in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 23 banks in operation in Macao absorbed a total of 88.6
billion patacas (about 11.2 billion U.S. dollars) of deposits at
the end of last year, up 8.97 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The loans of the banks added up to 49.9 billion patacas (about
6.32 billion dollars), up 5.72 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of all the bank deposits, current savings deposits rose only
five percent while fixed deposits went up 10 percent. This means
the capital cost of banks was on constant rise, said Luo.
</P>
<P>
Demand for loans was affected mainly by the overall economy and
bank owners were also cautious in giving out loans locally, he
said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, many bankers have cast their eyes on areas
with a high return of profits, such as China's inland areas. They
are trying to get a share from the areas which are in great need
of capital.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect that both deposits and loans will grow better
this year than in 1996 as Macao's economy will benefit from the
recovering world economy and the high economic growth in Hong Kong
and China's inland areas.

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Province Keeping Vegetable Prices Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Vegetable production in east
China's Anhui Province has become a major contributor to the drop
in retail prices, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Vegetable prices played a decisive part in bringing retail
prices under control by accounting for three to four percentage
points of the province's retail price index of 7.1 percent last
year, a 5.6 percentage point drop from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Low vegetable prices contributed to the "vegetable basket
project", a program that makes governors and mayors accountable
for vegetable production and supply to city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
The province developed a funding system for vegetable
production last year, and collected more than 60 million yuan for
the purpose. It also arranged provided four million KWH of
electricity at lower prices to help the 483,000 ha of land planted
to vegetables, a 6.5 percent increase from the year before.
</P>
<P>
New breeds and techniques also played a role in promoting
vegetable growing. The province has set up 6,000 ha of bases in
suburbs and mountainous areas for organic vegetables, which are
mainly used to control price fluctuations in off seasons. enditem

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Calls on PNG to Find Peaceful Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today called on Papua New Guinea (PNG) to find a peaceful
solution to the Bougainville island conflict.
</P>
<P>
Howard told parliament that he welcomed an apparent retreat by
his PNG counterpart, Julius Chan, on the use of mercenaries but
made it clear that Australia's alternative proposals required him
to rule out any other way of escalating the conflict.
</P>
<P>
PNG Prime Minister Julius said Wednesday that his government
would reconsider the 27.5 million US dollars contract, that was
signed with Sandline International for hiring mercenaries to
training PNG troops.
</P>
<P>
Sandline is a British-based consulting firm that recommended to
the PNG government that mercenaries be used to help resolve the
conflict on the Bougainville island.
</P>
<P>
Howard said alternatives he put to Julius on March 9 remained
on the table, Australia's offer precluded any escalation of the
nine-year-old secessionist violence.
</P>
<P>
Before the mercenary row erupted, Australia consistently
pressed for a negotiated settlement and refused to provide
military aid that could be used against the secessionist movement.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Port Moresby, police today fired tear
gas and rubber bullets to disperse gangs of looters, it seems the
political crisis over the mercenaries issue erupted into renewed
civil disorder in the south Pacific island country.
</P>
<P>
Shops, banks and schools around the capital were closed and
police blocked major roads to keep rioters out of the city center,
as National Capital District Governor Bill Skate made a general
call for calm.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of protesters gathered again outside Murry Barracks,
the main army camp in the capital, which was the focus of a huge
demonstration involving 2,000 people Wednesday.

</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- IBM and Cellcom have signed an agreement for the
establishment of an "intelligent network" (IN) for the cellular
phone company, reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
IBM-Israel will serve as the principal contractor in the
development and installation of the network, along with Bellcore
and Nortel, which produce Cellcom's infrastructure equipment.
</P>
<P>
The IN allows the offering of sophisticated cellular phone
services, such as automatic filtering of calls (accepting only
those approved by the recipient); granting a private number by
which the caller can reach individuals wherever they are,
depending on schedule and previous instructions, and dialing
by voice.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Foreign capital ushered into the Israeli economy
by the private sector, a major barometer of excessively high
interest rates, plummeted last year to 4.4 billion U.S. dollars
from 7.9 billion dollars in 1995, reported The Jerusalem Post
today.
</P>
<P>
Of the overall figure for capital inflows last year, 3.6
billion dollars represented foreign-currency denominated loans
taken by Israeli residents, compared with 6.3 billion dollars in
 1995, according to data released Wednesday by the Bank of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's foreign debt stood at 19.9 billion
U.S. dollars at the end of 1996, 1.7 billion dollars more than
1995, a report of The Jerusalem Post said today.

<P>
However, the country's overall foreign debt dropped to 22
percent from 23 percent, when compared with the gross national
product (GNP), according to data released by Central Bank of

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Today was the opening day of a
two-day symposium on the economies of China and France, sponsored
by the China Council for Promoting International Trade.
</P>
<P>

countries are economically complementary.

which China needs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
China and France have cooperated in many successful projects
and in trade and the economy, he said, pointing out however, that

enormous potential to tap in expanding bilateral economic and
trade relations.

people will make the best use of their advanced technology,
competitive prices, effective fund-raising measures, and good
services to explore China's market and become involved in China's
economic construction .

development in the past decade. He said that France is confident
in the prospects of the Chinese economy, and that the symposium is

peoples.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of Internet Service
users in Macao has reached 3,350, and is expected to grow to some
5,000 by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven percent of them are Chinese-language users, 27
percent of them Portuguese users and the remaining are English
users, according to a report in today's Macao Daily News.
</P>
<P>
In addition, most of the users are individuals instead of
companies or institutions, because "Macao business people are
quite conservative in expanding their business via the Internet,"
said Ma Chi Kong, manager of the Macao Telecommunications
Company (CTM), who is in charge of the Internet service.
</P>
<P>
"They are not fully aware of the role that Internet plays in
international business and trade," he added.
</P>
<P>
Macao introduced the Internet service in 1995, and the number
of users rose from 800 in the end of 1995 to 2,600 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Most users choose to enter the Internet on Saturdays and
Sundays. On other weekdays, they usually enter after eleven
o'clock in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The Macao government has established several homepages on the
Internet, in a bid to let users know more about Macao's tourism,
weather, hotels and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Smuggled Dollars Flood S. Leonean Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Gem merchants mostly from
strife-torn Zaire, have "invaded" Sierra Leone's rich diamond
mining areas since war broke out in that country nearly five
months ago, local police said here today.
</P>
<P>
"They are here to desperately buy large quantities of gem
stones to illegally smuggle to Antwerp," said a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A central bank official said the flood of fake dollar notes is
responsible for the unexplained fall of the price of the U.S.
Dollar in recent weeks though there has not been any significant
turn around in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Diamond dealers in Kono in the eastern part of the country
said the new influx of merchants were mainly Lebanese, French and
Belgian.
</P>
<P>
"Their activities have not been reflected in the official
figures of the diamond export for the past two months," an
official from the state-owned gold and diamond office said.
</P>
<P>
Rutile and bauxite, the two major foreign exchange earners in
Sierra Leone constituting about 60 percent of the total earnings,
are still out of operation since rebels attacked and damaged the
two mining sites in the south of the country in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Newly-Elected Local Govt Chairmen to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's newly-elected local
government chairmen will be sworn in next Monday, but
final results of the poll has yet been fully out, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said this was decided at a Wednesday meeting in Abuja
presided over by Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha to assess
last Saturday's elections.
</P>
<P>
The meeting admitted that there were some mistakes and lapses
in the elections and vowed to deal with various malpractices
according to the law, reports said.
</P>
<P>
It also decided that the National Electoral Commission of
Nigeria (NECON) will later announce the date of run-off elections
at areas where stalemate was reported in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the final results of the election have not been
out. Latest figures showed that the United Nigeria Congress Party
is still at its leading position with 283 chairman seats,
followed by the Democratic Party of Nigeria with 165 seats.
</P>
<P>
The three others, the Congress of National consensus, the
Grassroots Democratic Movement and the National Centre Party of
Nigeria, got 51, 45 and 39 seats, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The election has been widely described as free, fair and
peaceful, but there are still signs that troubles might be
waiting ahead.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of the election, leader of the National
Center Party of Nigeria (NCPN), Chief Don Etiebet, was detained
for alleged "security reasons" in Oyo State.
</P>
<P>
The Akwa-Ibom State chapter of the party claimed in a press
release today that the announced results in both Akwa-Ibom and
Oye states are not what its agents at polling stations had signed
and agreed to.
</P>
<P>
The press release announced that the "Akwa-Ibom State NCPN
rejects the concocted results of Saturday, 15th March, 1997 local
government election by NECON."
</P>
<P>
Another party, the Congress of National Consensus was also
reportedly dissatisfied with the election results in several
states and may go to the court seeking to rewrite the results.
</P>
<P>
"There are clear cases of manipulation and intimidation by
some NECON officials in favor of a particular party," a party
spokesman was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Garment Market to rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The domestic garment market will
head for a hopeful revival this year, after surviving stagnation
throughout 1996, according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an industrial seminar here today, Sheng Caiqing,
deputy general manager of the China Garment Corporation (CGC),
said that a national survey, jointly conducted by CGC, Shanghai
Garment Group, and other six local institutes in 20 cities, shows
that the indices for people's demand for garment product increased
by 1.5 and 3.5 percentage points, respectively, in cities and
rural area this year.
</P>
<P>
The result of the survey indicated that this year will be a
beginning for a long-term revival of the garment market, and the
development of domestic markets will be slow but steady.
</P>
<P>
China saw garment sales drop by 17 percent in the home
market last year, which was the first shrinkage since the market
began sustained expansion in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said that the prediction of a revival was based on the
analysts' expectation of a steady increase in people's incomes
this year, and closer cooperation between the clothing and
commercial sectors.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Internal Trade Ministry, China National Textile
Council and other six departments at the ministerial level will
join hands in exploring the domestic markets, and coordinate the
introduction of a unified marketing system and expanding the rural
markets.
</P>
<P>
Yu Zongyao, secretary general of the China Garment Association,
said that another sign of the revival is that a number of new
technologies and new materials are being put into use in the
clothing industry.
</P>
<P>
The Luozi Group, one of China's biggest shirt makers in the
coastal Ningbo City in Zhejiang Province, and other leading
clothing companies will begin to use the low-polluting man-made
fibers as a substitute to the viscose fibers, which are now
heavily weaved into China's garments and cause environmental
damage in the producing places.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, to ensure a lasting development in the clothing
sector, the country will speed up the import of advanced garment
processing equipment, and increase the use of CAD technology in
domestic garment-making enterprises, Yu said.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Water Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China will progressively heighten
the public's awareness of the water shortage and explore means of
efficient use of water, according to a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks at a
meeting to mark the World Water Day, which falls on March
22. The meeting was attended by state councillor Chen Junsheng and
over 40 officials from various ministries.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that localities tend to emphasize increased
production or harvest, to the neglect of disaster prevention.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned, "Floods are still the surest worry for the
Chinese nation, water shortages continues to restrict the economic
development, and water pollution still affects the people's health
and social stability."
</P>
<P>
The vice chairman said that NPC, the country's legislature,
will step up the introduction of a legal system related to water
management, adding that it has placed the revision of the
nine-year-old Water Law at the top of its agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Some clauses in the Water Law are not in tune with the
requirements of a socialist market economy and the law has
some glaring loopholes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the law will make a clear distinction between
ownership and right to use water and allow market forces more
power in the running of the water market.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Dengquan, vice minister of Water Resources, said that
China's per capita water resource is way down at no. 110 in the
world and that water resources are not distributed evenly across
the country or across the year.
</P>
<P>
"The south of the country has abundant water resources but
rainfall is too concentrated in July and August, easily causing
floods, and is prone to droughts in the rest of the year."
</P>
<P>
He said that some localities tend to ignore the preservation of
water resources in pursuit of economic development. He pledged
that the ministry will strictly carry out the Water Law and other
regulations to halt such misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will launch various kinds of publicity
activities on water conservation during the country's Water Week,
which starts on March 22.

</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The British Conservatives received a pre-election boost as

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Holds Talks With Malaysian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad held talks here today with Mozambican President
Joaquim Alberto Chissano on their two countries' ties.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Mahathir asked countries like Mozambique
which enlist the services of Malaysian companies to undertake mega
projects in their countries to ascertain whether the firms have
the required expertise for the job, Foreign Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said when briefing reporters on discussions
between Mahathir and Chissano that this is necessary as there are
cases of Malaysian companies which secured projects abroad, but
could not implement them. There are also companies awarded
projects tried to "sell" them to other companies in Malaysia for a
"certain price."
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, however, did not name the companies or businessmen
involved in such practices.
</P>
<P>
He said Mahathir assured Chissano that he would get Malaysian
firms to venture into the agricultural, logging, infrastructure
and natural resources sectors in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Mahathir had explained the matter
during his discussions with the leader of a foreign country,
according to Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
"This is to curb Malaysian businessmen from taking advantage of
new investment opportunities in Mozambique to make all kinds of
promises and proposals but have no intention to execute the
projects as they are devoid of expertise and capabilities," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Mahathir regarded such ways as unhealthy because "if
Malaysia wants to be a partner in the development of a friendly
nation, it must recommend credible companies which could deliver
the projects on time and in accordance with the stipulated time
and objectives of the project."
</P>
<P>
The move is to protect Malaysia's image and economic ties with
other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Chissano also discussed ways to enhance
cooperation between the ASEAN and the Southern African Development
Community, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chissano, the first Mozambican president to visit Malaysia,
arrived yesterday for a four-day official visit, which is set to
open new opportunities for bilateral ties and Malaysian investors
in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Both members of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Commonwealth and
more recently, the newly-created Indian Ocean Rim-Association for
Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC), Malaysia and Mozambique are
beginning to explore a more active relationship.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries is small, totaling only 1.5
million ringgit (about 600,000 U.S. dollars) last year, according
to official figures.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Thailand plan
to set up a joint police working committee to deal with problems
such as illegal immigrants and criminal activities on their common
border, Malaysian Inspector-General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor
said today.
</P>
<P>
Both sides feel there is a need for joint effort in tackling
the entry of illegal immigrants as well as smuggling and drug
trafficking activities on the border, he told reporters after
meeting Thai Police Director-General Pracha Promnog here.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai police agreed that the illegal immigrant problem is
the main issue to be dealt with by the committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two sides would hold further discussions on
the role of the committee while agreeing that senior police
officers will be included to make it more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian and Thai police, he said, could share intelligence on
matters such as local agents involved in harboring illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps, we can even organize some joint operations together
with our counterpart in Thailand to combat criminal activities
there," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pracha said on the occasion that Thai police are doing their
best to prevent illegal immigrants from using Thailand as the
transit point to enter Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Pracha, heading a 24-member Thai delegation, arrived here
yesterday for a three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Start Work for Supplying Gas to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is soon to begin laying
pipelines for supplying liquefied natural gas to its European
customers from 1999, a project expected to bring in a yearly revenue
of some one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Apart from other preparatory work, adequate security would be
provided to ensure that the pipes, passing through aboutztelecommunications syst
ems is
nothing rare in Nigeria. It hecome a headache of the government
and companies concerned because of the huge economic losses it has
caused.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a liquefied natural gas plant with an annual
production capacity of 7.15 billion cubic meters is under
construction. The facility, to operate for 22 and a half years,
is expected to generate 22.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to company sources, Nigeria's share of the revenue will
come to 11.02 billion dollars, representing its 49 percent equity
holdings in the NLNG company.
</P>
<P>
The European buyers of the gas include Enagas of Spain, which will
take 1.6 billion cubic meters a year, Botas of Turkey with 1.2 billion
and Gas de France with 0.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The fourth and biggest buyer, ENEL of Italy, pulled out of a
contract with the NLNG last year. Under the contract, the ENEL
will take 3.5 billion cubic meters from the plant a year.
</P>
<P>
However, recent diplomatic efforts by Nigeria and Italy are
expected to get the Italian company to the contract signed five years
ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- There are about 500,000 to one
million drug addicts in the countries of the European Union, the
European Drugs Observatory reported today.
</P>
<P>
The observatory said in its annual report that although
marijuana takes the lion's share of the illegal drugs used in
Europe, the number of cocaine users is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
It added that since the late 1980s, the use of amphetamine and
other excitants has also increased drastically.
</P>
<P>
Statistics compiled by the Lisbon-based group said that the
percentage of adults who have used drugs varies greatly in Europe,
ranging from five percent in some countries to 16 percent in
others.
</P>
<P>
In most countries, however, drug abuse accounts for about 30 to
40 percent of the crimes committed in Europe.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Ease Restrictions on Chinese Student Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will relax its
restrictions on Chinese students to study in the country in a move
to normalize relations in all areas with China.
</P>
<P>
A press release jointly issued today by Education Minister
Wyatt Creech and Immigration Minister Max Bradford said the
government has agreed to introduce a one-off quota of 200 tertiary
students, 100 secondary school exchange students and 100 full fee
paying secondary school students.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said it is a timely move to ease current
restrictions in view of increased political stability and economic
growth in China.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy is enjoying high growth rates and New Zealand
will benefit from a relaxation in Chinese student policy. We
stand to gain increased revenue from the sale of educational
services, trade, economic and cultural links," the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the restrictions on the entry of Chinese tertiary
students include that they must be under the age of 29, have a
university degree or equivalent and have English language skills.
</P>
<P>
For the trial quota of tertiary students, the age restriction
is to be raised to 35 years and the requirement for an
undergraduate qualification removed.
</P>
<P>
The release said the New Zealand Immigration Service will
manage and monitor the quota and provide information to the
ministries involved to assess whether Chinese student policy
should be liberalized permanently.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Criticizes US Vilification Over Political Donation (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities are all pervasive in bribing US
politicians. Even the Taiwan local newspapers called the offering
of political donations to the U.S. "resorting to mean tricks
without adhering to any principles."
</P>
<P>
It is just those people "resorting to mean tricks without
adhering to any principles" who are trumping up a counter-charge
and playing the game of "a thief crying 'Stop thief," in an
attempt to splash dirty water on the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
This showed that they are already at their wits' end and have
to cover up their ugly acts by muddying the water and diverting
attention from their own acts.
</P>
<P>
More than that. It also showed that the Taiwan authorities
harbor another ulterior motive, that is, to interfere with and
undermine the gradually improving Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
However, the US media, which claim to be fair, did not utter a
single word about their vicious acts of diverting attention and
shifting the blame onto others. Doesn't this fact set people
thinking deeply?
</P>
<P>
Recalling the history of the development of Sino-US relations,
it is not difficult to find that whenever the Sino-US relations
showed signs of improvement and advancement for which people of
the two countries felt glad, some people in the US have felt
uncomfortable. They would always seek opportunities to make
trouble, cause difficulties in an effort to undermine the
development of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-US relations have made some improvements recently and
promise a good opportunity for further development. It is the
result of the two sides' joint efforts which has not come easily
and deserves to be treasured.
</P>
<P>
We firmly believe that the historical trend of improvement and
development of the Sino-US relations is irreversible. The attempts
to impair the Sino-US relations and damage the fundamental
interests of the two peoples will be doomed to failure.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Ratifies Protocol on Civil Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colombo, March 20 (Xinhua ) -- The Sri Lankan government has
ratified the Montreal Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful
Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation,
according to a press release from the Foreign Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka recently ratified the Montreal protocol and the
instrument of ratification signed by Foreign Minister Lakshman
Kadirgamar was deposited in the archives of the government of the
United Kingdom, which is one of the depositories of the protocol,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The protocol is supplementary to the Montreal Convention on
Unlawful Acts Against Civil Aviation to which Sri Lanka is a
party. The Montreal convention covers only offenses against
aircraft, such as hijacking, the release said.
</P>
<P>
A state becoming a party to the protocol would be required to
either extradite or prosecute an offender committing any of the
offenses set out in the protocol, it said.
</P>
<P>
A declaration on the elimination of terrorism adopted at the
U.N. General Assembly last year called upon states to become
parties to international conventions including the Montreal
protocol for the suppression of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's ratification of the Montreal protocol followed the
adoption by the parliament of an act on the suppression of
unlawful acts of violence at airports serving international civil
aviation.
</P>
<P>
It is a further step taken by the Sri Lankan government to
support international initiatives in combating terrorism, the
release noted.

NEW DELHI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The first suspected case of
dengue fever, a mosquito-transmitted disease which left hundreds
of people dead and nearly 10,000 hospitalized last year in the
capital, has been reported in a local hospital here, The Hindustan
Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sudden increase in the number of mosquitoes in
the capital has alarmed Delhi people, who are worried that these
insects could carry dengue.
</P>
<P>
The hospital, in which the suspected dengue fever patient is
treated, has taken his blood sample and sent it to India's
National Institute of Communicable Diseases. The results will be
known in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi municipal authorities declared dengue fever an
epidemic in the city earlier this year in a bid to control its
spread at an early stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 20 (XINHUA) -- A coalition government of the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP)
will be sworn in at Lucknow, capital of India's Uttar Pradesh, on
Friday, ending five months' political stalemate in the country's
most populated state.
</P>
<P>
This was indicated by Uttar Pradesh Governor Romesh Bhandari to
leaders of the two parties who staked their claim to form the
government late Wednesday night, the Hindustan Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in a dramatic turn of events, the two parties hammered
out an agreement to form a coalition government with a
"rotational" chief minister.
</P>
<P>
While Mayawati from the BSP would lead the coalition during the
first six months, the BJP's nominee (presumably Kalyan Singh)
would take over for the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Uttar Pradesh has been under the president's rule since last
October when the state assembly election resulted in a hung house,
with none of the political forces claiming a simple majority to
form a government in the state.
</P>
<P>
The governor, while accepting the claim of the two parties to
form a coalition government, informed them that it might take
another 24 hours to complete the process of revoking the
president's rule.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Criticizes US Vilification Over Political Donation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is an old Chinese saying: "Do not do to others what you
would not have them do to you." China not only opposes other
countries' interfering in China's internal affairs, but also will
definitely not interfere in other countries' internal affairs in
any way.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 25 years since China and United States resumed
contacts, China has never gotten involved in American politics in
any form. Speaking frankly, moneybag politics in the United States
is widely known around the world, and the "political donation"
case is only the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
Being a developing country, China does not have the money to
spend on that. Even if it did, China would not do so either.
</P>
<P>
It must be pointed out that for a long time, some people in the
United States has been attempting to interfere in China's internal
affairs, and China has been the victim. Now, some anti-China
forces in the US are groundlessly and wantonly attacking China for
interfering in US internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Doesn't this indicate their evil intentions, just like a thief
crying "stop thief"?
</P>
<P>
Some Americans are keen on creating false intelligence, and
some members of the US Congress also have made use of the matter
in an attempt to cook up charges against China. Some US news
organizations, which claim to be responsible, have taken extremely
irresponsible attitudes in repeating false reports, and they are
not bored in doing this.
</P>
<P>
But they have to admit that up to now they have not found a
single piece of evidence of China's interference in US internal
affairs. A false thing is a false thing, and a lie can not become
a fact though repeated for a thousand times.
</P>
<P>
A host of facts have proved that it is exactly the Taiwan
authorities who have attempted to influence the US policies by
offering large sums of money. They have made and are making the
dirty deals, and the bribes to some Americans often proved to be
quite effective.
</P>
<P>
Not to mention events long ago, Lee Teng-hui's visit to the US
in 1995 was an example. In that case, the Taiwan authorities spent
nearly ten million US dollars to buy favors.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Turkey are expected
to conclude their negotiations over the sale of two Turkish-made
submarines soon, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted defense sources as saying that the
negotiations had been going on for more than one year but the
deal had to wait for the settlement of Malaysian side's
financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has agreed to purchase two 1400-tonne 209 AY-class
submarines from Turkey in a bid to upgrade the defense
capabilities of its armed forces, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics published by the World Strategic
Information Institute, Turkey, with a total of 16 submarines, has
the world's ninth-largest submarine fleet.
</P>
<P>
The 209 AY-class submarine project, produced at Turkey's
Golcuk shipyard under license from German Howaldts-Werke Deutsche
Werft, was a continuation of Turkey's submarine modernization
program.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Golcuk shipyard has delivered six of such
submarines to the Turkish Navy.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects New Israeli Negotiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat has rejected outright an accelerated
timetable for the Palestinian-Israeli final status talks,
according to the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in Gaza Wednesday
night that Arafat had received no official proposal, but if he
had, he would not have accepted it.
</P>
<P>
In a new diplomatic move, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu is reportedly initiating a proposal urging the
Palestinians to accept an accelerated timetable for negotiating
the final disposition of territories Israel has occupied,
officials at the Prime Minister's Office were quoted as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks would hopefully be completed within six months, and
no later than nine months.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he would be willing to culminate the talks
with U.S. participation at a Camp David-style summit, thus
welcoming the personal involvement of U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether this is what he referred to when he
said Tuesday that he would announce something that would surprise
the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can guarantee these matters can be implemented. We
don't have enough trust that matters can be completed," Abu
Rudeineh said after speaking with Arafat. "We have a signed
agreement and American and European letters of assurance. We
don't have enough trust... now. Trust must be built up."
</P>
<P>
To regain trust, the Palestinians require as a minimum
condition that the building on Har Homa be "postponed," he
indicated.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian spokesman said that had the proposal come
before the Israeli decisions on troop redeployment from Hebron in
the West Bank and the construction of Har Homa settlement were
taken, the response might have been different.
</P>
<P>
But the PNA fears that if it jumps off the Oslo track onto a
Netanyahu "fast track," it will only find that the new track
stops far short of the Palestinians' desired destination, with no
backup from Washington, Rudeineh added.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who had consulted Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and Foreign Minister David Levy, first raised the idea
of accelerated final-status talks during his meeting with
King Hussein of Jordan in Jerusalem Sunday. He then briefed
U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk to the Jewish state about the idea.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein paid a good-will visit to Israel Sunday to express
condolences to families of the seven Israeli schoolgirls killed by
one Jordanian soldier last Thursday near the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu sought to raise the idea personally with Arafat at
a Monday night summit, but the PNA president refused to attend
it due to his anger over the Har Homa project.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh reportedly informed
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat of the initiative during their
meeting in Jerusalem Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israel is planning to brief Egypt on the proposal soon, said
the report.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Works Out Strategy for Fighting Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African police
will take more effective measures to clamp down on violent
crimes, especially those against women and children, a local
daily, the Citizen, reported today.
</P>
<P>
Andre Pruis, Commissioner of the South African Police Service
(SAPS), revealed on Wednesday a five-point strategy for fighting
crimes in 1997, saying SAPS would target crime organizations such
as syndicates and gangs.
</P>
<P>
Pruis said since South Africa had re-entered the international
community, crime in the country has been internationalized.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 500 organized crime syndicates are
operating in the country, including the Russian Mafia, he said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has become a country with the highest rape figure
in the world, and in Gauteng, one of the nine provinces in the
country, there were some 1,000 rape cases each month, he said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Banks to Start Yuan-Based Business in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Overseas banks are to start
yuan-based business early next month in Shanghai, China's largest
economic and financial city.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, is now
working out a set of regulations governing the line of business by
the overseas banks.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by a leading official of the Shanghai branch
of the central bank Monday.
</P>
<P>
The official said this at a function marking the moving of
Japan's Mitsubishi Bank into a building in the Pudong New Area,
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight overseas banks have got the license from
China's central bank to do the yuan-based business, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The eight banks are Japan's Sanwa Bank, Daiichi Kangyo Bank,
Industrial Bank of Japan and Mitsubishi Bank, Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation, the US Citibank, The British
Chartered Bank, the Shanghai and Paris International Bank, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that up till now, Japanese businesses have invested
a total of 2.8 billion US dollars in 574 projects in the Pudong
New Area over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to the central bank, all the overseas banks which
have been approved to do Renminbi business have to move their
headquarters in China to Pudong.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Mitsubishi Bank and the American CitiBank have
moved their China headquarters to buildings in Pudong, and the
other six banks are on the way.
</P>
<P>
Financial specialists here say that "the move by the Mitsubishi
Bank will be conducive to the Japanese businesses in making
investment in Pudong."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Clinton to Meet Later Today in Helsinki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton will arrive here later today for a
summit, possibly the toughest since the end of the Cold War due to
the thorny issue of NATO's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is expected to reach Helsinki at noon and followed by
Yeltsin, who will arrive three hours later.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the 11th between presidents of the two countries
since the former Soviet Union disintegrated, is going to kick off
with a grand dinner hosted by Finnish President Marti Ahtisari
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Formal talks will be held on Friday, with the planned NATO
expansion to central and eastern European countries, arms control
and the economic relations high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Neither the U.S. nor Russia has hitherto shown any intention to
soften their position over the expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Helsinki late Wednesday, Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, Russia's presidential press secretary, said that if
the alliance's expansion becomes true, it will be the "strategic
mistake" and "worst" decision after the end of the Cold War and
the West will have to pay a high price for it.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO has no reasons whatever to expand since
there is no more ideological confrontation following the end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"There are none of reasons for NATO to move eastward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia's approach to NATO expansion will not change
regardless of any summits, bilateral meetings and negotiations,"
Yastrzhembsky stressed.
</P>
<P>
NATO's move also undermines the arms reduction negotiations
between Russia and the U.S., said Yastrzhembsky, adding that the
implementation of the START II treaty has stopped while process of
starting talks on START III is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate solution to the issue is the denial of taking new
members, or postponing the acceptance of new members," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. takes an equally tough stance on the issue of NATO
expansion. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said
that the alliance's enlargement will go ahead despite the strong
opposition from Russia.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders are considering to issue formal invitations to
some ex-Warsaw Pact states, most possibly Poland, the Czech
Republic and Hungary, at the NATO summit scheduled for July in
Madrid.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Strengthen U.S.-Latin American Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will strengthen ties and promote trade with Latin American and
Caribbean nations during his second term, a senior State
Department official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The next 12 months will see an intense focus on regional
issues by the president," Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey
Davidow said at a hearing of the House Western Hemisphere
Subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Clinton started his second term, he hosted a visit
by Chilean President Eduardo Frei, and he is going to visit Mexico
in April, tour five Latin American and Caribbean countries in May,
and attend the second Summit of the Americas in Chile in March,
1998.
</P>
<P>
"This high level of activity is indicative of the importance
the administration gives to relations with the nations of our
hemisphere," Davidow said.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the major goals of Clinton's policy for the
region were to promote free trade, strengthen democracy and fight
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The United States was committed to establishing a Free Trade
Area of the Americas by the year 2005, a goal that was set by the
1994 Summit of the Americas, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, Davidow said the United States will continue its tough
economic sanctions against Cuba, claiming that it was the best way
to promote democracy there.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Grip over Extra-Budgetary Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Fiance has vowed
to carry on the national campaign to tighten supervision of
extra-budgetary funds.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the ministry Wednesday said the
emphasis of the campaign will be on industries and work units
suspected of severe misuse of such funds, or those unreached by
past check-ups.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of extra-budgetary funds was 384.3 billion
yuan (about 46.3 billion US dollars) last year, according to an
official with the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
A number of cases involving the misuse and embezzlement of such
funds have been discovered, and the state revenue then increased
by 16.2 billion yuan (1.95 billion US dollars) from the
confiscation of misused funds.
</P>
<P>
"Lax management has given rise to illegal and irregular
activities in the use of extra-budgetary funds," said the
official, adding that efficient management of such funds can
prevent the consumption funds and investment in fixed assets from
running out control and rectify the financial order.

<HEADLINE> 1 Israeli Soldier Killed, 3 Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was killed
and three others wounded in a missle attack by the pro-Syrian
Hezbollah on an army convoy in south Lebanon, Israel Radio
reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred near the Beaufort Castle in the Israeli
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon Wednesday afternoon,
but details were not available.
</P>
<P>
Hezi Avner, 20, was killed when a missile scored a direct hit
on the command car in which he and four other soldiers were
traveling.
</P>
<P>
The three wounded soldiers, two in serious condition due to
shrapnel wounds to their limbs, were evacuated by helicopter to
Haifa's Rambam Hospital in northern Israel and underwent surgery
shortly after being admitted, according to Zvi Ben-Ishai, the
hospital's deputy director.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed responsibility for the
attack in a statement issued on the organization's Nur Radio
station broadcasting from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. The statement
said Hezbollah had attacked "an enemy convoy" and inflicted
damage and caused casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army's Northern Command Amiram Levine said that a
Hezbollah squad had fired two anti-tank missiles and mortars at
the convoy.
</P>
<P>
Levine said the two missiles were fired from a distance of
1,500 to 1,600 meters, and one of them hit the command car.
</P>
<P>
He noted that troops in the convoy returned fire with support
from other units, including some artillery. However, it was
unlikely that the attackers were hit.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has not succeeded in hitting convoys or patrols on
the route leading up to the Beaufort in the past year due to the
use of helicopters by the Israeli army to fly in troops and
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Other protective measures, including concrete walls and
embankments at various points on the road, are also believed to
have prevented possible Hezbollah attacks.
</P>
<P>
The use of helicopters was re-evaluated following a
disaster over Moshav She'ar Yashuv in northern Israel last
month, when two troop transporters collided, killing all 73
soldiers and airmen on board.
</P>
<P>
However, Levine said the consideration of whether to move
troops and supplies by air or road was not connected to the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Levine said the situation had been reexamined and regulations
improved after the helicopter disaster, but there is nothing to
prevent the use of helicopters.

<HEADLINE> Commentary Criticizes US Vilification over Political Donation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- A commentary written by a Xinhua
commentator said that anti-China forces in the United States
"harbor ulterior motives and are playing the trick of a thief
crying 'stopping thief'" in their recent wave of vilifications
against China.
</P>
<P>
The commentary reads:
</P>
<P>
Recently, anti-China forces in the United States have set off
yet another round of vicious defamations against China. After
so-called inside information was leaked out to the media by
officials from US judicial and intelligence departments, the
forces made unproven accusations that the Chinese government and
China's embassy in the United States participated in "political
donation" in the United States to "buy influence" in the US
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Acting like someone who chases the wind and clutches at
shadows, some American media took the chance to create sensational
news without any fact in a vilification campaign against
China. Some people on the Taiwan Island also made an uproar,
spreading allegations that "the Chinese Communists were involved
in a political donation case."
</P>
<P>
The viciousness of their intention and despicableness of their
tricks are rarely seen before.
</P>
<P>
Today when Sino-US relations have improved to some extent, a
few anti-China forces in the US and a small number of splitters in
Taiwan, working in collusion with each other, should have made a
big fuss out of the so-called "political donation" issue to sow
discord. People cannot help asking what are they really up to?
</P>
<P>
AS is known to all, China has strictly observed the principle
of mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in others'
internal affairs in relations with other countries, and this is
the basic principle China follows in its relations with the United
States.

<HEADLINE> 36 Percent of Filipino Kids Malnourished: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- About 36 percent of pre-school
children in the Philippines are malnourished and 12 percent of
them are suffering from serious malnutrition, the official
Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Florentino Solon, head of the Nutrition
Center of the Philippines, as saying some Filipino kids get a mere
15-percent of the calories of the Recommended Dietary Allowance
(RDA).
</P>
<P>
Solon said most of the country's undernourished children are
below two years, the time when their growth accelerates.
</P>
<P>
He said nutrition deficiency results in wasting and stunted
growth, adding that in 1993, the prevalence of wasted or acutely
malnourished children in the country was 6.2 percent and those
stunted or chronically malnourished was 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
While seriously malnourished children in the Philippines now
comprise a mere 12 percent of the population of pre-school
children, an additional 24 percent are considered mildly
undernourished, he said.
</P>
<P>
Solon said the government must make sources of needed
macronutrients accessible, adding that an increase in the
production of potent sources of macronutrients like animal meat
should be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
He said the composite proportion of the total daily energy
intake requirement for Filipinos is 60 to 65 percent
carbohydrates, 20 to 25 percent fat and 10 to 15 percent protein.
</P>
<P>
However, the vulnerable and growing pre-school children
population in the country is meeting a mere 64 percent of the
required RDA.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Filipino pregnant women even consume less than 70
percent of the RDA, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The quality and quantity imbalance of the Filipino diet has
yet so much room for improvement in order to attain the suggested
proportion of energy intake," Solon said.
</P>
<P>
The government should also re-orient parents on proper
nutrition, the expert said.

<HEADLINE> One Price for Chinese, Overseas Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Foreign tourists will no longer
be overcharged for tickets at major tourist attractions as new
government policy is being implemented.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the State Planning Commission recently
urges all tourists attractions in the country to end the
long-practised dual-pricing system for domestic and overseas
visitors by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under the dual-pricing system, foreign tourists paid
substantially higher prices for tickets and amenities than their
Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The circular requires that all scenic spots should fix one
price for the same kind of service of the same
quality. Discrimination on the basis of nationality, place of
origin, or race is not to be permitted.
</P>
<P>
Scenic spots and tourist attractions are also required to
explicitly display the price and to stop illicit price hikes.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the dual-pricing practise in 1982 at
major scenic spots. But the practise was widely picked up, causing
many complaints from overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the decision to change the practice is
consistent with government policy to ensure that "overseas
investors are given the same treatment as Chinese nationals" and
to bring the tourist industry in line with accepted international
practices.

<HEADLINE> Ambitious Plan for China's Natural Gas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to double its annual
natural gas production capacity to 30 billion cu m by the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official with the China National
Petroleum Corp (CNPC), China is expected to verify additional
onshore gas reserves of one trillion cu m by the end of the
century, with the accumulative total hitting two trillion cu m.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the country's gas production capacity will rise by
another 10 billion cu m, with the total topping 25 billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source said that through further exploration, major
breakthroughs are expected to be made in the expansion of proven
gas reserves and production capacity in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia
region and Tarim Basin in northwest China, and Sichuan Province
in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC official noted that that enormous potential exists for
the country's gas production. Following years of vigorous
development, three large-scale gas production areas have taken
shape in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the central part of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region, total
gas reserves of 230 billion cu m have been verified. Total gas
reserves of 200 billion cu m have been proven in the eastern part
of Sichuan. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, total gas
reserves of 160 billion cu m have been verified, in addition to
the discovery of a group of new gas-bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in the Sebei area of northwest China's Qinghai
Province, a gas field with proven reserves of 50 billion cu m
has been found.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the domestic gas exploration, efforts are
being made to utilize gas resources in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
China has joined an international gas exploration project which
will involve the laying of a long-distance gas pipeline
running from Central Asia through China and the Korean Peninsula
to Japan, providing China with a gas supply of 25 billion cu m a
year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint venture with Russia for gas exploration in
eastern Siberia will pipe to China 25 billion cu m of gas
annually.

<HEADLINE> EA Digital Transmission Link Project To Cost 70 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The proposed East African
(EA) Digital Transmission Link Project, whose implementation starts
in May this year, will cost about 70 million US dollars, Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Secretary of the East African Co-operation
(EAC), Ambassador Francis Muthaura, said this on Wednesday in a
telephone interview from Arusha of northern Tanzania, noting that
a funding formula had already been determined.
</P>
<P>
"The project has three components. Each member country will give
25 percent of the total cost while the East African Development
Bank (EADB) and the National Development Financial institutions will
give another 25 percent", Muthaura explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the European Investment Bank has basically agreed to
finance the balance of the total cost if there is any, adding that
an implementation secretariat of the poject would be formed next month.
</P>
<P>
The East African Digital Transmission Project is aimed at replacing
the outdated backbone microwave system with a new system linking the
East African states.
</P>
<P>
"We are very serious on this project. We need to have efficient
postal and telecommunication services to ensure the faster formation
of a single market", Muthaura further said.
</P>
<P>
The project would enable east Africans in neighboring border
towns to communicate directly and solve the existing communication
problems whereby a call in a border town has to be channelled first
to the capital of the respective country for switching, then to the
capital of the other side before the call is finally connected to
the other border town.
</P>
<P>
He added that the structural changes would enhance the investment
climate in the region.

<HEADLINE> Performers Urged to Pay Taxes in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian province
recently set up a special department to strengthen its control of
people who work in entertainment places and stop them from tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established department will take effective measures
to collect taxes from singers and fashion models who usually earn
a lot but have little awareness of tax paying.
</P>
<P>
And owners of local entertainment places and the employed
performers have been reportedly organized to learn tax-related
laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Local officials estimated that Pingtan County alone will
collect tax revenue 500,000 yuan more than last year.
</P>
<P>
"The move aims to urge performers who usually travel a lot
job-hunting to pay taxes, and it will also benefit the
government's effective control of the floating population," said
Wang Guozhang, official with the local taxation bureau.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Joins Hands With Kunming in Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has worked out an
ambitious plan with Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province, to
complete 30 key projects jointly before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Each of the projects jointly funded will involve a total
investment of more than 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan released, Shanghai will transfer the
production of 20 hi-tech items to Kunming, and finish one or two
projects for the city, to demonstrate how to reshape the
traditional industries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kunming will set up in Shanghai several shops to
sell its famed industrial products and trade centers to deal its
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The two cities started such cooperation several years ago. But
the "Ninth Five Year Plan"(1996-2000) was a little bit different
from the previous ones, focusing on building a close partnership
based on integration of assets.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will export its funds and technology to Kunming to
help reform local traditional industries, and develop local
manufacturing industries of textile, food, and plastics, etc.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will help its partner develop its tourism industry,
which is famous for its tropical climate and natural environment.
</P>
<P>
The same attention is given to boost the mining industry of
Kunming, and to make the city a production base for Shanghai
industrial enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Hijacker to be Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Liu Shan-chung, the Taiwanese who
hijacked an airplane from Taiwan to Xiamen on March 10, will be
repatriated to Taiwan after necessary investigations are made, an
official with the Association for Relations across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the ARATS held a special discussion
with the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and
reached a consensus that all hijackers should be repatriated.
</P>
<P>
However, the agreement remains unsigned for reasons from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the relevant department will repatriate the
hijacker in accordance with the "Quemoy Agreement" reached by
both sides of the Taiwan Straits in September, 1990, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan side will take prompt measures to
repatriate hijackers, in a bid to join hands in cracking down on
hijacking," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Hijacking is a serious criminal act and should be dealt with
severely, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have consistently held that both sides of the
Taiwan Straits should proceed from the overall interests in
developing relations across the Taiwan Straits and protecting the
safety of the lives and property of people across the Straits and
cooperate in curbing the occurrence of hijacking."
</P>
<P>
A Far Eastern Boeing-757 airliner was hijacked at 14:25 on
March 10 to Xiamen, in east China's Fujian Province. The
eight-member crew and 149 passengers on board the plane returned
to Taiwan safely on the same evening.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's external trade
declined by 8.6 percent in February on a monthly basis, reflecting
the continued sluggish global demand for electronics products,
particularly semiconductors, the Singapore Trade Development Board
(TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Non-oil domestic exports fell by 7.9 percent, while re-exports
declined by 4.3 percent, though oil domestic exports recorded an
increase of 7.3 percent to reach 1.2 billion Singapore dollars
(about 860 million US dollars), the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
However, it said that on a three-month moving average basis,
total trade at current prices in February 1997 dropped by 1.6
percent, with non-oil domestic exports declining by 3.6 percent,
while re-exports rising by 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports fell by 2.5 percent to 12.7 billion Singapore dollars
(about 9.07 billion US dollars) in the month.
</P>
<P>
The fall was largely in imports of integrated circuits, parts
of diodes, photocells and transistors, capacitors, printed
circuits, and other products, it said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The US woman pilot who is
retracing the route Amelia Earhart followed 60 years ago in an
attempt to become the first woman to fly around the globe landed
in Tucson, Arizona on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Linda Finch, taking off Monday from Oakland, California,
touched the ground at no more than 150 mph (240 kph) in the same
type of plane flown by Earhart when she disappeared 60 years
ago -- a refurbished 1935 Lockheed Electra 10E.
</P>
<P>
Others have completed the Earhart flight, but not in an Electra
10E, of which only 15 were built.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old American millionare and her support team,
including more than a half-dozen navigators who will alternate on
legs of the flight, have 10 fuel tanks to manage. The longest leg
will be the last -- from Honolulu to Oakland -- about 16 hours.
</P>
<P>
Her 44,240 kilometers trip was to sent her across Brazil,
Africa, India, Australia and the Pacific's Howlett Island -- in
the area where Earhart disappeared in 1937 -- before returning to
California.
</P>
<P>
Earhart and her navigator, Frederick J. Noonan, disappeared in
the Pacific after completing 35,000 kilometers of the scheduled
47,000-kilometer trip.

<HEADLINE> Singapore "Surprised" at Malaysian Gov't Comment on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Government said
it was "surprised" at the Malaysian government's statement that
restoration of the bilateral ties, which were affected by Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew's remarks about Johor, would take time.
</P>
<P>
In his statement made on Wednesday night, but distributed here
today, Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar said, "The Government of
Singapore is surprised that the Malaysian Government has stated
that 'restoration of the old level of relationship would take
time.'"
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar made the comment in response to a statement by
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi on Wednesday on
Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's apology for his remarks
on Johor, a southern state of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, the Malaysian Foreign Minister said, "The
Malaysian government notes that Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew has
now personally signed a press statement dated 17th March 1997
wherein he repeated his unreserved apology. He has also stated
that his lawyer has been instructed to seek the court's permission
to have the offending paragraphs deleted from the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
"The Malaysian government accepts the unreserved apology
tendered by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and views positively his
intention to retract the offending paragraphs. However, it should
be acknowledged that this episode has deeply hurt Malaysians of
all sections of society and that restoration of the old level of
relationship would take time."
</P>
<P>
Jayakumar said in his statement, "The Government of Singapore
notes the statement by the Malaysian Government which accepted
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's unreserved apology".
</P>
<P>
"The statement on Johor in Mr Lee Kuan Yew's affidavit was made
by him personally in actions by him against Mr Tang Liang Hong for
defamation. He was suing in his private capacity to defend his
personal reputation and to enforce his personal rights. The
affidavit was not made by Mr Lee Kuan Yew as Senior Minister, nor
did he make it on behalf of the Government of Singapore",
Jayakumar explained.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of Singapore has always attached importance to
its relations with Malaysia and will work with the Malaysian
Government to enhance this relationship. We believe that
cooperation between the two countries can only result in a win-win
situation," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for International Cooperation on Drug Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The international community should
strengthen cooperation in cracking down on illegal drug trade, a
Chinese official said today at the 40th annual session of the
U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs.
</P>
<P>
Li Changhe, China's deputy representative of the permanent
mission to the U.N. office in Vienna, spoke highly of the role
played by U.N. agencies, including the Commission on Narcotic
Drugs, the International Drug Control Program (UNIDCP) and the
International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), in coordinating the
anti-drug war around the world.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the world-wide illicit drug traffic and abuse
still remains a serious problem, which has affected the economic
development and threatened social stability of various countries.
</P>
<P>
Li urged more financial support for the UNIDCP so as to help
the organization in its efforts against illegal drug trade.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese representative said complying with U.N. resolutions
on drug control, the Chinese government has adopted special
anti-drug laws and strengthen management and has successfully
prevented several attempts to channel drugs onto its territories.
</P>
<P>
China would like to further cooperation with other countries
and international organizations in the war against drugs, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the planned U.N. special conference on drug
control in 1998 is of great importance and China will play an
active role in preparing for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the 10-day session of the U.N. Commission on Narcotic
Drugs, that began Tuesday, a total of 700 participants from more
than 100 countries and international organizations will review
the UNIDCP and INCB's annual reports and discuss new anti-drug
strategies and measures.

<HEADLINE> Russia Warns West Over NATO's Eastward Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- NATO's eastward expansion will
be the West's biggest mistake since the end of the Cold War and
could damage relations between Russia and the West, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin's press secretary warned tonight on the
eve of the Russia-U.S. summit in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a press conference in the Finnish
capital, "President Yeltsin and the Russian leadership are
convinced that NATO's plans to expand eastwards, if realised,
could be the West's biggest strategic mistake since the end of the
Cold War."
</P>
<P>
Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton are due to meet
here on March 20 for a summit to discuss strategic issues
including NATO's eastward expansion, the Russia-NATO relationship,
and strategic arms control.
</P>
<P>
There are no concrete reasons for extending NATO's border
eastwards, Yastrzhembsky said. The move would threaten Russia's
security and could upset relations between Russia and the West, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
The very discussion of plans by the U.S.-led military alliance
to expand eastwards has already cast a shadow over relations
between the West and Russia and the U.S. and Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
The trust built up between the leaders of Russia and the United
States and major Western countries has been shaken due to NATO's
plan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The alliance's expansion would also have a negative impact on
Russia's ratification of the START-II agreement with the U.S. on
cutting long-range nuclear missiles, and a proposed follow-on
Start-III treaty on further weapons reductions, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to avoid these adverse consequences, Yastrzhembsky
advised NATO not to admit new member states or postpone talks on
eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between Russia and NATO, Yastrzhembsky
said that the two sides should sign an agreement with legally
binding commitments, in which NATO guarantees not to deploy
allied troops and nuclear arms in new member states.
</P>
<P>
The agreement should also clearly define Russia's equal status
with the 16 member states of NATO, he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO has refused to abandon its eastward expansion plans but is
offering Russia a new relationship, which would give Moscow the
right to consultation on security issues but no power of veto over
the alliance's plans.
</P>
<P>
Yastrzhembsky ruled out the possibility of solving all the
problems between Russia and the West at the Helsinki summit and
said another meeting between Yeltsin and Clinton is likely to be
held in Paris.

Over 20 vessels were stranded there due to the standoff.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the port users and the workers were
to resume their work this morning.
</P>
<P>
Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) will also withdraw its two
orders to the Q.C. Shipping Agency issued on Monday. The orders
had directed the Q.C. Shipping to remove its two forklifts from
the port areas or face punitive action.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate began last Saturday when port workers went on
strike protesting the use of private equipment in cargo handling.
The strike called off Tuesday following the order by the CPA to
withdraw the private equipment.
</P>
<P>
But a fresh deadlock ensued on the same day when the port users
started a boycott of the port demanding permission for the use of
private equipment in handling cargo.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of Saber Chowdhury, a member of Parliament
of Chittagong city, the port users finally agreed to stop use of
private equipment till April 5, pending government decisions in
this regard.

<P>
WARSAW, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Croatia is paying special
attention to relations with neighboring countries and Central
Europe, Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic said here today.
</P>
<P>
The effort, Granic said at the end of a two-day visit to
Poland, is part of his country's endeavor to integrate into Europe.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Granic, in his capacity also as Croatia's
foreign minister, met with Polish President Aleksander
Kawasniewski and Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati.
</P>
<P>
They discussed, among other topics, cooperation between the two
countries in the areas of economy, science, technology and
military affairs, and the situation in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the critical social and political unrest in
Albania, Granic said a comprehensive analysis would be needed to
define the problems that led to the recent tragic incidents there.
</P>
<P>
The current situation in Albania could be attributed partly to
the country's difficult economic conditions and the mishandling of
political system and ethnic relations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Main Opposition Calls Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has called a nationwide dawn-to-noon
strike on March 23, the first such work stoppage in nine months of
Awami (people's) League rule, in a major development in the
country's turbulent political arena.
</P>
<P>
BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia announced the program at a rally
here on Wednesday to protest the government's move to provide
transit to and import power from India, and form a sub-regional
grouping including India, Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Awami League (AL) General Secretary Zillur Rahman on
Wednesday night said that the BNP's call for the strike reflected
its lack of political acumen.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to fish in troubled water by whipping up
public sentiment on some baseless issues," said Rahman, adding
that people would not support such program.
</P>
<P>
The eight-hour shutdown is also to protest the government's
failure to tackle the water, gas and power crisis, the
law-and-order situation and price hikes, said Khaleda, the former
prime minister, whose party was defeated by the AL led by Sheikh
Hasina in last June's election.
</P>
<P>
Khaleda also accused the government of resorting to
all-pervasive politicization, terrorism, extortion, women
repression and torture on political workers.
</P>
<P>
"We are compelled to announce the program for the fake of
people and to save the country," said Khaleda, who also declared a
series of programs beginning today.
</P>
<P>
The programs include nationwide mass contact today, nationwide
meetings and processions on Friday and torch processions and
meetings on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> FMLN Emerges as Political Force in El Salvador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary results of last
Sunday's elections in El Salvador show the former rebel movement
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) has become a
major political force in the country to challenge the governing
Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The FMLN, a former guerrilla group, has so far doubled the
number of seats it holds in the 84-seat National Assembly from 14
to between 28 and 31 in Sunday's election and won 54 of the 262
mayoral races throughout the country. Before the election FMLN
held just 11 mayorships.
</P>
<P>
So far, the FMLN has captured 35 percent of the vote, neck and
neck with ARENA. But only 40 percent of those eligible to vote
went to the polls.
</P>
<P>
If the FMLN can build on this election victory over the next
two years, analysts believe it has a chance of winning the
presidential election in 1999.
</P>
<P>
One of the FMLN's major victories in the national elections was
winning the mayorship of the capital San Salvador from ARENA. The
new mayor, 49-year-old U.S.-educated doctor Hector Silva, 49,
beginning May 1.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to show that we can govern," Silva promised.
</P>
<P>
The electoral advances of the FMLN were in direct proportion to
the losses suffered by ARENA, which previously controlled
more than 40 parliamentary seats and 207 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
ARENA has been the dominant political force in the country of
5.5 million people since 1989, both in the central and municipal
governments, as well as in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
But political analyst Nelson Zarate of El Salvador's
Technological University says those days are now over.
</P>
<P>
It's not yet clear just how many seats ARENA has retained,
but no party will have enough seats to command a majority in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Either the FMLN or the ARENA will have to rely on forming a
coalition with at least two other parties to form a majority.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol will
have to negotiate with the opposition to govern the country and
pass any bills, Zarate said.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel movement FMLN became a political party in El
Salvador after signing a peace treaty in December 1992 that ended
a 12-year civil war in which 7,600 people died.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador Urges U.S. to Pay U.N. Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations Bill Richardson today told Congress that the U.S. must pay
its U.N. debts to maintain influence in the world body.
</P>
<P>
"We are losing our influence and our leverage," Richardson said
in his first testimony to a House of Representatives
appropriations subcommittee since taking on his new job.
</P>
<P>
Unless the country pays its U.N. arrears of more than 1 billion
dollars, "we are not going to achieve reforms for others to pay
more so we can pay less," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that other U.N. members deeply resented the
US. delay in paying its debt.
</P>
<P>
U.N. calculations show the U.S. is the world organization's
biggest debtor, owing 1.6 billion U.S. dollars, although
Washington says the debt is just over 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The congressional subcommittee agreed that the U.S. should pay
the debt, but members disagreed on when it should pay in order to
ensure that the U.N. meets U.S. reform goals.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. wants to reduce its peacekeeping assessment from 30.8
to 25 percent of the total, and its annual U.N. dues from 25 to 20
percent of total contributions.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Government Pledges to Fight Crime and Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino today pledged the government's determination to fight
organized crime and terrorism in the country which has been
gripped by violence and unrest over the last month.
</P>
<P>
In a televised appeal to the nation, he called on people to
back the police, the army and local government to safeguard
property and maintain social stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Violence has spread throughout the country, crime has touched
the lives of children and families and terrorist activities have
posed a threat to society and the population, Fino said in his TV
address following a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would respond to the violence and has
decided to set up a special anti-terrorism force.
</P>
<P>
On the same day he spoke to the nation, a museum in the
southern city of Korca and some banks in the southern city of
Gjirokaster were robbed.
</P>
<P>
Fino, a member of the opposition Socialist Party, was brought
in to head a caretaker government of national reconciliation with
President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party last week in a bid to
end a popular uprising that has led to anarchy in Albania.
</P>
<P>
He said the government must stabilize the country's situation,
provide people with food, water and electricity and safeguard
airports, seaports, customs and other key departments.
</P>
<P>
The government on Wednesday rejected an ultimatum from rebels
in the south demanding that President Sali Berisha resign by
Thursday, state-run television said.
</P>
<P>
"Ultimatums are unacceptable. We favor dialogue," Fino said.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 Albanians have been killed in more than a month of
unrest sparked by the collapse of the so-called pyramid investment
schemes, in which thousands of Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
Protests mushroomed into a lawless anti-government revolt, with
widespread looting of arms from army depots.
</P>
<P>
The situation appears to be returning to normal in the tiny
Balkan republic, although a government-imposed state of emergency
and a dusk-to-dawn curfew are still in effect.

HANOI, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists visiting
Laos is expected to rise by a quarter this year to more than

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM Outlines Government Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Lokendra
Bahadur Chand has outlined his newly formed government's policies
which give top priorities to economic development and social
order.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the lower house of parliament Wednesday before
voting was held on a confidence motion for his three-party
government, Chand said the government will make efforts to
maintain reliable economic growth and social justice.
</P>
<P>
Special programs will be launched to raise the quality of life
of the people living below the poverty line, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will give more autonomy to local administrations
in accordance with the principle of decentralization, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the one-year-old insurgency in the country's remote rural
areas launched by an ultra-leftist movement, Chand said his
government will form a high-level human rights commission to find
political solutions to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also stressed his commitment to controlling
price hikes of consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
The 205-seat lower house later passed a confidence motion
proposed by Chand for his government, which took office last week,
with a vote of 113 for to 85 against.
</P>
<P>
The government was formed by Chand's National Democratic Party
(RPP), the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML) and the Nepal Goodwill Party (NSP) to replace the former
coalition government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali
Congress (NC).
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day when presenting the confidence motion, Chand
pledged to continue the liberal economic policy of the former
government and strive to make Nepalese products more competitive
in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed the government's commitment to attracting
foreign investment to develop the country's abundant water
resources.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Chand said Nepal will always honor the
Charter of the United Nations and abide by the policy of
non-alignment and peaceful co-existence. The new government will
attach special importance to strengthening the relations with both
China and India, the country's two neighbors, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Economy Starts Recovery After Sanctions Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's economy started to
recover last year following the suspension and subsequent lifting
of United Nations' sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
Basic chemical production in Serbia, one of Yugoslavia's two
republics, rose 125 percent in 1996, rubber production rose 46.7
percent, nonmetallic minerals rose 15.8 percent and nonmetallic
processing 21.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Serbian economists attribute the increase to the fact that some
big enterprises resumed production after the U.N. sanctions,
imposed in May 1992, were suspended in November 1995 after the
Dayton peace accord was agreed, ending nearly four years of war in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions, which were finally lifted in October 1996,
had a devastating effect on the economy and led to a halving in
the country's output.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The Thailand Tobacco Monopoly
(TTM) is planning to recycle tobacco residues for cigarette
production as a bid to reduce costs and pollution, a local
newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet has approved a plan for the TTM to invest 250
million baht (10 million U.S. dollars) to sharpen its production
techniques, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly nine percent of all tobacco now used in cigarette
production ends up as waste, while through applying a slurry
process, tobacco residues can be pressed into sheets and used as
raw materials, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The TTM stressed that tar and nicotine content of the new raw
materials can be regulated and their quality and flavor will be
close to those of the original tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The new product will be 46.9 baht (1.87 dollars) per kilogram,
much lower than the 120.5 baht (4.8 dollars) it now pays for
American-flavored tobacco, the TTM said.

was recorded last Monday, when a total of five car bombs were
dynamited in different parts of the Central American country.
</P>
<P>
One of the bombs struck a prosecutor's office in Segovia, and
another blasted in front of the Fedeagro building in
Barrancabermeja, where one person was injured.
</P>
<P>
The highest official apparently targeted by the attacks was
National Police Director General Rosso Jose Serrano, who was
supposed to pass a site where two cars were loaded with explosives.
</P>
<P>
The police chief was unharmed, but an eight-year-old child was
killed and six others were injured in the incident in Cucuta.
</P>
<P>
Military intelligence analysts attributed the attacks to
guerrillas who want to show off their ability to attack the
country's urban areas.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton left
here today for Helsinki to attend a summit with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin in an attempt to persuade the Russian leader to drop
his opposition to NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Clinton told reporters at the White House
that his two-day talks with Yeltsin would focus on three important
areas: NATO expansion into central and eastern European countries,
arms control to reduce weapons of mass destruction and on promoting
economic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said there was unlikely to be any breakthrough
at the meeting, the 11th between the two leaders, as the United
States is firmly committed to expanding the NATO alliance while
Russia is strongly opposed to the move.

committee to investigate the plot against Abdala Bucaram, he

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Carry Out Nutrition Program for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese public health authority
plans to reduce malnutrition rate among Chinese children by 50
percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of chronic illness caused by improper diets will
also decrease if a national program for nutrition improvement is
successful, said a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health, in co-operation with ten other
ministries, commissions and non-governmental organizations, will
launch a national campaign this year to upgrade the physical
fitness of Chinese people, the newspaper quoted ministry official
Zhu Peifu as saying.
</P>
<P>
The program, called "nutrition improvement action in China,"
will be implemented after final approval by the State Council,
China's highest governing body, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the draft program, the rate of moderate and
serious malnutrition among children below five will drop 50
percent by the year 2000 from the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the number of cases of anemia among pregnant women
will be reduced and endemic diseases related to iodine
deficiencies will also be eliminated, according to the program.
</P>
<P>
Data from the ministry indicates that most Chinese residents
have enough to eat, but malnutrition still exists.
</P>
<P>
"The latest national survey showed that about 35 percent of
Chinese children below the age of five have failed to reach
national indexes for physical development, the rate was as high as
50 percent in some poor areas," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
A number of children suffered from various related ailments
such as rickets and anemia, which could impair their physical
health and intelligence, it said.

KIEV, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government is to
change its budget and taxation systems and reform the social
security system to help the country's poor, Deputy Minister of the
Economy Alexander Yaremenko said today.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is planning to adopt a "social welfare"
policy based on ensuring a minimum standard of living, the
Ukrainian news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that wages have fallen 14 percent over

</P>
<P>
The current poverty line is set at 70.9 hryvnas (about 38.5

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Foreign Currency Reserves Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's foreign currency
reserves fell more than 250 million U.S. dollars during
the second week of March compared with February.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons for the drop was the central bank's
intervention to keep the exchange rate stable and prevent the
Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, from falling, according to an
analysis in the "daily report of the economy".
</P>
<P>
Another factor was the large fall in the price of Venezuelan
crude oil in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Labor conflicts in the country have also caused foreign
investors to lose confidence in keeping their capital in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Munoz, an economist and professor of the Andres Bello
Catholic University, believes that there is still a significant
demand for foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
"To keep the exchange rate stable, Venezuela's Central Bank has
to lower the level of its international reserves," he said. But he
warned the situation could not continue for much longer.

WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold medal-winning

cancer and will undergo chemotherapy, his doctors announced in Los
Angeles on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Los Angeles, 38-year-old Hamilton,

world champion, underwent a series of tests at a hospital in
Cleveland, Ohio, this week after complaining of recent stomach
pains.

<P>
BEIJING, MARCH 20 (Xinhua) -- Doctors from the Henan Provincial
Institute of Ophthalmology have discovered the cause of juvenile
rapid blink syndrome -- an eye disease of increasing prevalence in
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yinqi, deputy director of the institute, said patients
would blink eyes over 12 times per minute during the clonic
occurrence of the disease, and those children do not have either
facial muscle spasm or other nerve diseases.
</P>
<P>
Attributing the disease to the overtime watching of TV
programs, doctors of the institute named the disease "juvenile
rapid blink syndrome."
</P>
<P>
Wang said, hospitals in his city have received more children
who have contracted the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to a sample survey of 138 cases in the city, the
youngest one is a two-year-old baby and the eldest is an
11-year-old child. Most of them are children between three years
old and seven years old who watched TV programs from one hour to
eight hours a day.
</P>
<P>
He said the swift changes of TV images could give rise to
over-excitement of the visual center after excessive watching.
</P>
<P>
As the child's vision development has not completed, the
over-excitement of the visual nerve could lead to a preventive
feedback -- a video twitch.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the children's parents often treated the blink as a
"bad habit" and would blame their children.
</P>
<P>
Wang said, the symptom would disappear after the patients stop
watching TV programs for two or three months and after the symptom
disappears, the patient should only be allowed to watch the
programs less than one hour day.

<HEADLINE> China Criticises US House of Representative's HK Stance (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Any unbiased person would say that the Chinese government is
determined in its 'one country, two systems' principle. After the
signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, the West
expressed some pessimistic views about the future of Hong Kong,
and some people left Hong Kong out of worries. Now however, many
people have returned.
</P>
<P>
From the election of Hong Kong SAR's chief executive to the
formation of the region's administrative body, Hong Kong
compatriots see that the central government does things in
accordance with the Basic Law and sticks to the principle of "Hong
Kong people governing Hong Kong." Therefore, confidence has grown
among Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Hong Kong government showed that 73
percent of Hong Kong residents have confidence in Hong Kong's
continued prosperity and stability, 13 percent higher than in
November of last year.
</P>
<P>
The stability of financial markets in Hong Kong and the
increase in foreign investment also indicate that foreign
businesses are increasingly confident about Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
However, the US Congress acted unwisely by singing a different
tune and expressing its doubts about Hong Kong's future in its
Bill.
</P>
<P>
The United States has heavy economic interests in Hong Kong,
which is America's 15th biggest trading partner, and more than
1,000 American companies have offices in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The United States should have a cooperative attitude and should
play a positive role in Hong Kong's smooth transition and
long-term prosperity and stability. This would be in the US's
interests.

<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A Panamanian court imposed
sentences ranging between 6-18 years upon a group of Colombians
and native indians found guilty of sending cocaine from the Cali
drug cartel to Spain.
</P>
<P>
Among those sentenced were Colombian Hernan Olier Caicedo, an
important drugpin of the Cali drug cartel (Colombian) in Panama,
who was sentenced to 18 years in prison for trafficking in
drugs and association with criminals, press reports said today
quoting a source from the third court of Colon.
</P>
<P>
Judicial authorities said 30,000 dollars, AK-47 assault rifles
and a double traction vehicle with a false bottom, which is
presumed to be used to transport the drug, were confiscated from
those found guilty.
</P>
<P>
According to the Drug Prosecutor's Office, this criminal
organization trafficked large quantities of cocaine at 60,000
dollars per kilogram to Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Panamanian authorities seized more than 100 kilograms
of cocaine hidden in a container from this drug trafficking ring.
</P>
<P>
The Cali cartel maintains operations in Panama through branches
engaged in money laundering.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Spring had long been a dusty
season for Beijing, but this spring the skies over Beijing have
approached a heavenly blue.
</P>
<P>
Sands blown by the wind in Beijing have decreased by 20 to 40
percent compared with the past, as a result of the Three-North
Shelterbelt System started in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Ten green shelterbelt projects have been started across China,
covering more than 60 percent of the nation's total land area. The
on-going Three-North Shelterbelt System is one of those projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, during the past 19 years 18
million hectares of shelter-forests have been planted in the
three-north areas (north, northeast and northwest areas).
</P>
<P>
This increases the forest coverage in the region from 5.05
percent to 9 percent, bringing large area of dunes and soil-eroded
lands under control.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the nation's shelterbelt afforestation efforts,
nearly 5 million hectares of forests have been planted in the
upper branches of the Yangtze river, bringing the soil erosion
problems in more than 100 counties under control.
</P>
<P>
In the nation's plain areas, 33 million hectares of farmland
have been protected by green shelterbelt systems, which help
increase the grain output by 10 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Ministry of Forestry, the
green shelterbelt projects have also benefited the local farmers.
In Yixing county of central China's Hubei province, the local
people's average income has been tripled due to shelterbelt forest
planting.

<HEADLINE> Quakeproof Ancient Chinese Structures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have found
reasons why ancient structures survived strong earthquakes and
have introduced the aseismatic design into modern architecture.
</P>
<P>
The key to the quakeproof design, they say, is that all parts
of the structure were connected by a mortise and tenon system that
allows the structure to shake as a whole without collapsing during
an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
This kind of movement consumes the energy of the shock wave,
the experts say.
</P>
<P>
Brackets that were always carved supporting the eaves from the
columns were previously thought to be there for decorative
purposes only, but they also serve to distribute the load from
above and help keep the whole structure balanced.
</P>
<P>
Buildings with bracket were more durable during earthquakes
than those without bracket sets, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
Straight beams slightly leaning toward the axis, and pillar
bases set up on a solid foundation were also included in the
quakeproof design.

<HEADLINE> New Director of Czech Intelligence Agency Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Czech government today named
Karel Vulterin as director of the state intelligence agency BIS,
filling the vacancy left by last November's resignation of acting
director Stanislav Devaty over allegations the agency spied on a
cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
Vulterin is a former director of a hospital radio isotope lab
and chairman of a higher education trade union. He is considered
nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
Stanislav Devaty was head of BIS for several years, although he
was never confirmed as the director. He was forced to resign after
BIS was charged with spying on Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux
three years previously and then trying to cover up its actions.
</P>
<P>
Lux is chairman of the Christian Democratic Party and the
country's minister of agriculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 20 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
province had an unemployment rate of 2.3 percent, with 236,000
urban laborers out of work last year.
</P>
<P>
"The declining unemployment rate shows that the campaign
launched by the province to re-settle workers laid-off by
state-owned enterprises has started to work," Gan Zhaojiong,
director of the Labor Department of Guangdong, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong province used to have a lot of job opportunities, but
migrant workers from other parts of the country flushed into
Guangdong seeking jobs and changed the situation.
</P>
<P>
Migrant workers in the province peaked at 6.6 million. There
remained 3.6 million registered migrants last year.
</P>
<P>
In order to slow down the province's rising unemployment rate,
Xie Fei, secretary of the CPC Committee of Guangdong province, and
provincial governor Lu Ruihua, urged all local government
officials to make efforts to resettle the jobless.
</P>
<P>
Free training programs were also given to the unemployed, and
favorable policies worked out to encourage industrial businesses
to hire more people.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Demands Change in Israel's Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Swedish Foreign Minister Lena
Hjelm-Wallen said today that Israel's decision to build a new
Jewish settlement on occupied territory contravenes international
law and called for a change in its provocative settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
Hjelm-Wallen was referring to a recent decision of Israel to go
ahead with the construction of a Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem despite the strong opposition of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
An occupying power does not have the right to move its own
population into occupied territory, the minister said. The Israeli
bulldozers are not just devastating occupied territory, they also
are undermining people's hope for the future and their confidence
in a peaceful solution, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government must reverse its provocative settlement
policy and seriously engage itself in the peace process, urged
the minister.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and
annexed it as a united capital of Israel. Palestinians want East
Jerusalem to be the future capital of an independent Palestinian
state.

<HEADLINE> China Criticises US House On Hong Kong Stance (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bill shows that quite a few members of the US House of
Representatives are ignorant about Hong Kong, and know very little
about China's Hong Kong policy. Their prejudice make them believe
readily the biased reporting of some media and the allegations of
the British side.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Bill groundlessly accuses the establishment of
the Provisional Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR as a
violation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. The establishment
of the council is the immediate outcome of the British disruption
of the `through train' arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The British Hong Kong authorities unilaterally carried out a
"constitutional reform" in violation of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, the principle that it should be done in tandem with
the Basic Law, and the the two countries' agreements and
understandings. This made it impossible for the last Legislative
Council of Hong Kong to become the first Legislative Council of
the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure a smooth transition and successful transfer of
power and to avoid a legislative vacuum, the Preparatory Committee
of the Hong Kong SAR had no alternative but to establish the
Provisional Legislative Council. In a similar way, the Bill of
Rights Ordinance of Hong Kong was revised because the British Hong
Kong authorities had formulatd the ordinance unilaterally and in
bad faith and made it superior over all existing laws in Hong Kong.
Under the prerequisite that those articles that contrtadict the
Basic Law are abolished, the Bill of Rights Ordinance can remain a
lawof the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the Congress, don't be so ready with such
indiscreet criticism. Why can't you study the situation and learn
something about the reality of Hong Kong before you reach a
conclusion?.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's basic principle and policy of "one
country, two systems", and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong",
and of a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong have not only won
the support of Hong Kong compatriots, but have been praised by the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Ricken Goal Gives Dortmund Place in Semi-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A powerful 59th minute shot from
midfielder Lars Ricken gave Borussia Dortmund of Germany a 1-0 win
over Auxerre of France and a place in the semi-finals of the
European Champions' Cup on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Borussia, leading 3-1 from the first leg of their quarter-final
tie, resisted Auxerre pressure in the first half of the second leg
on French soil before finding the opening.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Ricken was set up by a pass from striker Stephane
Chapuisat and seized his chance from 25 meters. His shot took a
deflection off Auxerre midfielder Philippe Violeau's leg and left
French keeper Lionel Charbonnier helpless.
</P>
<P>
Auxerre dominated play in the first half but failed to breach
the visitors' tight defence.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund threatened once in the first 45 minutes, when
Karlheinz Riedle saw a 22nd minute header saved by Charbonnier.
</P>
<P>
Dortmund, who now face Manchester United in the semi-finals,
will be without defender and captain Matthias Sammer in the first
leg after he received his second yellow card of the competition.

<HEADLINE> China Criticises US House of Representative's Hong Kong Stance (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some members of the US Congress think of nothing but "US
superiority", and have a preference for meddling with the affairs
of other countries, but do not understand the realities there, so
that they can only impose their will on other people. This Bill
can only arouse strong resentment among the Chinese, including the
six million Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the United States has continued to interfere
in the transition process in Hong Kong. The United States enacted
a law in 1992 stating that the Hong Kong question cannot be solved
without the US support, and that the US intends to be an "arbiter"
in the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and
the Basic Law of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
This year, the House of Representatives has adopted a bill that
brazenly called on the Chinese government to resolve the Hong Kong
question in line with their will, and even threatened economic
sanctions. Which article of International Law gives the United
States such authority?.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the British Hong Kong government and some
so-called democrats have been lobbying the US Congress, viciously
attacking China's policy on Hong Kong and attempting to
internationalize the Hong Kong question. Some US news media have
also fanned the flames and are eager to see Hong Kong devolve into
chaos.
</P>
<P>
The anti-China forces in the US take the Hong Kong affair to be
a "human rights question", and frequently apply pressure on the
Chinese government while attempting to hold a check on the China
policy of the administration. The House Bill on Hong Kong last
week was dished up against this background.

<HEADLINE> NZ to Adopt New Work-Test Measures Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand will introduce new
work-test measures to penalize beneficiaries who turn down jobs,
the local newspaper "The Dominion" reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a spokeswoman for Employment Minister Peter McCardle
as saying that from April 1, beneficiaries who turn down suitable
jobs, fail to turn up for a job interview or do not take part in
other job-seeking activities will have their benefits cut.
</P>
<P>
The penalties will work on a sliding scale from a minimum of a
20 percent cut to the benefit for at least one week to loss of the
benefit for up to 13 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, beneficiaries might be referred to jobs
which require different skills from the jobs they are seeking, if
they are deemed to have suitable skills for the alternative jobs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, people on domestic purposes benefits, widows
benefits and spouses of unemployment beneficiaries will also be
required to register with the Employment Service, and become
active job-seekers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The changes are designed to ensure that beneficiaries meet
their responsibilities to look for work or work-related training.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the policy toward domestic purposes
beneficiaries and other work-tested groups had been changed
because of concern that their long-term benefit dependency was
increasing, despite improvements in labor market conditions.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the number of solo parents and widows on
benefits and the length of time they were on it, was growing, she
said.

MADRID, March 19 (Xinhua) -- An extra-time 3-2 win sent last
season's runners-up Ajax to the semi-finals of the European
Champions' Cup as they downed the Spanish Champion Atletico Madrid
3-2 on Wednesday for a 4-3 aggregate victory.
</P>
<P>
But the four-times champions had keeper Edwin van der Sar to
thank for dramatic victory as he made several great saves
including one from a penalty.
</P>
<P>
Atletico were led throughout by a spirited Kiko and it was the
striker who rounded off a fine move down the right to open the
scoring just before the half-hour.
</P>
<P>
A defensive error let through Ronald de Boer to head the
equaliser just after the break, and a splendid strike by
substitute forward Dani put the Dutch ahead early in extra-time
after van der Sar had saved a penalty from Juan Eduardo Esnaider
in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
Milinko Pantic made it 2-2 from another penalty, but with
Atletico needing another goal, Ajax's Tijani Babangida broke
through to score a late winner.

<P>
LISBON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United held FC Porto to
a goalless draw in Oporto to move into the semi-finals of the
European Champions Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Needing a big win to erase a 0-4 first round loss, the
Portuguese champion wasted three chances in the opening 13 minutes
before Manchester controlled the game at the Estadio Das Antas.
</P>
<P>
Manchester is the first English team to make the last four
since Liverpool in 1985 and has reached its first semi-final since
it was defending titlist in 1969.
</P>
<P>
The English club will face German champion Borussia Dortmund in
the two-leg semi-final April 9 and 23. Friday's draw in Lausanne,
Switzerland, will decide who has home advantage first.
</P>
<P>
In the third minute, Manchester's goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel
made a dive to save from Jardel who blasted at the edged of the
penalty box.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, Porto squandered an easy chance as the
unmarked Jardel had an empty net to aim at. But the Brazilian

ROME, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Juventus stayed on course to defend
their Champions' Cup title by reaching the semi-finals of the
European Champions' Cup on Wednesday as a 2-0 home win gave them a
3-1 aggregate victory over Norwegian outsiders Rosenborg.
</P>
<P>
Zinedine Zidane got Juventus going after 29 minutes and the
French international midfielder can rarely have had an easier
chance.
</P>
<P>
Rosenborg goalkeeper Joern Jamtfall sent a clearance straight
at Zidane who hit it straight back into the empty net.
</P>
<P>
Nicola Amoruso scored the second, an 88th minute penalty, after
Attilio Lombardo was brought down. Rosenborg's Stale Stensaas was
sent off for protesting about the penalty decision.
</P>
<P>
The scoreline flattered the Norwegians, who dumped AC Milan
out of the cup at the Champions League stage. It took them 75
minutes to force their first corner against a Juventus side that
was always in control.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: NATO Enlargement Top Priority Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
before leaving for the Finnish capital of Helsinki for a
U.S.-Russian summit, said today that the first and foremost
priority issue he will discuss with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin is NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is "adapting" NATO, the product of
the Cold War era, to "take on new missions," the so-called
building up of an "undivided" Europe.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plans to expand the NATO alliance into central and
eastern Europe have been met with strong opposition from Russia,
which is heated up on the eve of the Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky brought to the climax a
fierce anti-NATO tirade today, warning the West could make a
biggest strategic mistake.
</P>
<P>
"President Yeltsin and the Russian leadership are convinced
that NATO's plans to expand to the east, if realized, could be the
West's biggest strategic mistake since the end of the Cold War,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here believe that there could hardly any
breakthrough for the talks between the two presidents as they are
squaring up for the toughest summit.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Russia is included in the envisioned
undivided Europe, Clinton indicated that he never "left Russia
out."
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe Russia should be excluded from NATO
membership," Clinton said. But he said the first step is to have
a "special charter between Russia and NATO."
</P>
<P>
The special charter is what the United States proposed to offer
for Moscow to consult with the West on European security, but
Russia will have no right to veto any military decisions taken by
the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
Russia, acknowledging NATO is a "real force," is not happy with
just a consultation forum provided by the charter, and demanded a
legally-binding treaty between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
But all the demands Russia raised have been rejected by the
United States, which declared the NATO enlargement will "remain on
track."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin has called NATO's plans to take in new members as a
"blockade" and warned any move to threaten Russia's security would
be a "return to the Cold War."
</P>
<P>
"We can't move any further. Now it's the U.S. turn to move in
order to preserve our partnership," he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters that besides the issue of NATO
enlargement, he will also discuss with Yeltsin other issues like
arms control to reduce arsenals of mass destruction and expansion
of economic partnership.

<HEADLINE> EU Farm Ministers Agree on Beef Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- European Union farm ministers,
anxious to restore consumer confidence shaken by the mad cow
disease health scare, finally reached an agreement today to label
the origin of beef sold in shops from January 2000.
</P>
<P>
After a three-day meeting in Brussels, it was agreed that the
member states are obliged from January 2000 to establish a
registration and identification system for cattle born after
January 1, 1998, providing information regarding the origin, sex,
rearing, feeding and slaughter of the cattle.
</P>
<P>
From January 2000, all the beef products sold in shops should
be labeled with details of origin and rearing. But the clause
allows a member state to apply the system on a voluntary basis on
its territory for beef produced in its own country, a concession
to Britain and Italy who strongly opposed the measures to be
compulsory across the EU.
</P>
<P>
The UK, fearing that a "British beef" label might turn off
Community consumers worried about mad cow disease, argued that
compulsory mention of the provenance is contrary to the principle
of a Single European Market.
</P>
<P>
However, supporters led by France and Germany insisted that if
the consumer is to be reassured, he or she must be provided the
above-mentioned information.
</P>
<P>
At the ministerial meeting, UK Farm Minister Douglas Hogg
presented an update on anti-mad cow measures, but met with little
enthusiasm from fellow ministers for an early lifting of the beef
export embargo and the export ban still remains in place.
</P>
<P>
EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler told a press conference
after the meeting that the agreed measures were aimed to restore
consumer confidence in the wake of the bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
The mad cow crisis was triggered by a British government
statement last March that the fatal cattle brain disease BSE might
be transmitted to humans.
</P>
<P>
At the third day of the meeting, the ministers again dropped
the proposal from the European Commission demanding a 1.4 billion
ECU (1.6 billion US dollar) cut in direct aid payments to cereals
and oilseed farmers to help fund emergency aid for beef producers
hit by the mad cow disease crisis.

<HEADLINE> China Criticises US House of Representative's Hong Kong Stance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- An article in today's People's
Daily criticises some members of the US House of Representatives
for their hegemonic mentality in interfering in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The article reads as follows: With the approaching return of
Hong Kong to China, some members of the US Congress are becoming
increasingly interested in it, and it is excusable if they are
paying attention to the interests of American enterprises in Hong
Kong. But, many signs indicate that some members of the US
Congress are attempting to seize the chance to increase US
influence in Hong Kong, and to contain China by making use of the
Hong Kong question.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the House of Representatives adopted the Hong Kong
Reversion Bill, pointlessly raising doubts about whether the
Chinese government will observe the Sino-British Joint Declaration
after July 1, 1997, and unjustifiably criticizing China about
taking necessary measures to ensure the smooth transition of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Bill calls for the US government to interfere in Hong Kong
and authorize the US President to halt all preferential treatment
for Hong Kong and to enforce trade restrictions if the President
decides that China cannot maintain a high degree of autonomy in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
This once again reveals the ugly mentality of some members of
the US Congress who want to lord it over the world.
</P>
<P>
As is well-known, the Hong Kong issue is between the Chinese
and British governments before Hong Kong's return, and China's
internal affair afterwards. No foreign government or organization
has the right to interfere in Hong Kong affairs. In fact, no
sovereign government could tolerate the practice of the
supercilious US Congress in grossly interfering in its internal
affairs.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Mostly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a 10-month
high against the Canadian dollar and strengthened in most other
currency dealings today, helped by more expectations that the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Labor Department reported a higher-than-forecast
consumer prices for February, which was viewed by traders as more
evidence that the Fed is likely to raise rates next week to thwart
inflationary pressure. Higher rates tend to help the dollar.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the dollar cost 1.6816 marks, up from its
three-week low of 1.6727 Tuesday. The dollar cost 122.82 yen, up
from 122.43. The pound cost 1.5982 U.S. dollars, up from 1.5901
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's biggest move was against the Canadian dollar over
the prospect that Canada's interest rates could weaken relatively
to U.S. rates, which spurred selling of the Canadian currency. In
New York, the dollar cost 1.3764 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3735
Tuesday and the highest since late May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late Tuesday:
1.4432 Swiss francs, up from 1.4383; 5.6700 French francs, up from
5.6435; 1,685.00 Italian lire, up from 1,683.50.

<HEADLINE> US Researchers Develop Ceramic Valves for Heat Engines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Researchers have developed
ceramic valves that offer longer life and better durability and
can be used in huge mine-haul trucks and other advanced heat
engines, the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The ceramic valves were developed as part of the Ceramic
Technology Project, an ORNL-led program begun in 1983 for
developing an industrial technology base to provide reliable and
cost-effective, high-temperature ceramic components for industrial
applications, it said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with metallic valves which often fail due to corrosion
caused by sulfur in the fuel, "ceramic valves are best suited for
diesel mining trucks that carry enormous loads in severe
environments," said Arvid Pasto, director of the High Temperature
Materials Laboratory at the ORNL.
</P>
<P>
Static and cyclic tests conducted at the ORNL have proven that
the ceramic valves can tolerate more severe conditions than
metallic ones. "Four ceramic valves are currently running in an
engine in a mine haul truck and have accumulated over 2,000 hours
already," Pasto said.
</P>
<P>
"The tests gave us confidence and validated our predictions for
the lifespan of the valves," researchers said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, ORNL researchers are developing methods for
forecasting how long the ceramic valves will last, which includes
performing two- and three-dimensional life prediction analyses
along with many static and fatigue failure tests.

<HEADLINE> German Couple Win Pairs' Gold at 1997 World Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, Switzerland, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Mandy Wotzel and
Ingo Steuer from Germany won the gold medal in the pairs'
competition held here tonight at the 1997 World Figure Skating
Championships.
</P>
<P>
The only Chinese couple taking part in the competition won the
11th place, their best at the world championships. They won the
15th last year.
</P>
<P>
The second and the third prizes were awarded to two Russian
couples, Marina Eltsova/Andrei Bushkov and Oksana Kazakova/Artur
Dmitriev.
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters after the competition, Marina Eltsova and
Andrei Bushkov said, "We're not pleased with some of the marks,
especially the 5.4 for technical merit and the 5.6 for artistic
impression. Apparently, the audience didn't agree with the marks
either. We will be competing in the Olympics in Nagano."
</P>
<P>
All first 16 skaters in the pairs' competition will qualify for
the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
Placed third in the short program Tuesday, Elena Berezhnaya and
Anton Sikharulidze from Russia made five fatal mistakes tonight.
They were only in the ninth place in the final standings.
</P>
<P>
Their coach said, "It wasn't a good performance. They skated a
good short program yesterday, but today they weren't on. It wasn't
the pressure of skating last. It doesn't matter in what order they
skate, the important thing is to skate well."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Nominates Tenet for CIA Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today nominated acting Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director
George Tenet to head the nation's spy agency, replacing nominee
Anthony Lake who withdrew amid a rough Senate confirmation
process.
</P>
<P>
"I want to announce my intention to nominate George Tenet as
the director of central intelligence. He brings a wealth of
experience and skill to the challenge of leading our intelligence
community into the 21st century," Clinton said in an announcement
before he left for a summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin
in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
Tenet said in a statement at Clinton's invitation that "if
confirmed I will do my level best to provide leadership, stability
and strength of purpose to the men and women who serve our nation
with such devotion" in the intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
Clinton chose Tenet, 44, as the nominee shortly after he
accepted Tony Lake's request to withdraw the nomination of him to
avoid further dispute between the White House and Congress over
the seat of CIA chief.
</P>
<P>
Tenet's name surfaced both on Capitol Hill and at the White
House as a way to avoid a bruising confirmation fight. Therefore,
he was expected to be confirmed easily.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Tenet met privately with members of the Senate
Intelligence and Senate Appropriations Committees to discuss CIA
budget matters and other intelligence issues.
</P>
<P>
Tenet's career started as a staffer for the late Senator John
Heinz and then he worked for the Intelligence Committee, including
four years as staff director from 1988 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
Before the departure of CIA Director John Deutch in the
post-election cabinet shuffle, Tenet was the CIA's No. 2 official.
Since then he has continued to perform the deputy's duties and
served as acting director.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the Senate easily confirmed Tenet to the deputy's
position following a 17-0 endorsement by the Senate Intelligence
Committee.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for Emergency Aid to Great Lakes Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
appealed today for 325 million U.S. dollars to meet the emergency
humanitarian needs of over 1.4 million refugees, internally
displaced persons and returnees affected by the ongoing emergency
throughout the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for the
Great Lakes Emergency, prepared by the United Nations agencies and
non-governmental organizations operating in the region, covers the
period January to December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Programs and activities within the appeal will address
emergency humanitarian needs for 460,000 internally displaced
people and refugees in Zaire, 615,000 internally displaced people
and refugees in Burundi, 326,000 in the United Republic of
Tanzania, 33,000 in Uganda and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Acting on the specific request by the government of Rwanda,
humanitarian requirements for Rwanda are not included in this
regional Great Lakes appeal.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. press release said that the assistance sought from the
international community will be aimed at preventing suffering,
promoting voluntary repatriation of Rwandan refugees and
providing sufficient assistance to enable internally displaced
and conflict-affected persons to return to normal economic and
social standards of living.

<HEADLINE> Tech Shares Pull New York Stocks Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Technology shares led a broad
decline today on the New York Stock Exchange following an
inflation report that failed to calm fears the Federal Reserve is
about to raise interest rates next week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average recovered much of the day's
decline over the last hour, declining 18.88 to 6,877.68.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume reaching 535.55
million shares, more than 467.27 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The broad market finished with much steeper losses. Once again,
the technology-laden Nasdaq market suffered the worst damage as
leading computer-industry names continued their slide.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 3.89 to 785.77, and
the NYSE's composite index fell 1.81 to 413.59.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 20.15 to 1,249.19, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.66 to 591.79,
trimming a 7-point retreat to about 19 points.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported this morning that consumer prices
rose a moderate 0.3 percent in February with little sign of
inflation. The increase was a bit higher than many economists
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
crept above 6.99 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts are expecting Federal Reserve officials to slow
the pace of economy by raising the central bank's key lending
rates at their March 25 meeting.

<HEADLINE> US Lawmakers Criticize EU Over Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Some U.S. lawmakers said today
that the European Union's challenge to the U.S. anti-Cuba
Helms-Burton law before the World Trade Organization (WTO) is an
"irresponsible" attempt to interfere with U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
However, they said the law aroused outside criticism of
interrupting the world trading system.
</P>
<P>
Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen from Florida said, "To involve
the WTO in a dispute over foreign policy is merely a thinly veiled
attempt to interfere and dictate the agenda of the United States."
</P>
<P>
"No U.S. government leader would allow the WTO or any outside
entity to determine what the United States can and cannot do to
protect its interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Republican Lincoln Diaz-Balart, who is also from Florida, said
the European Union's action is "obviously irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton signed the Helms-Burton bill into law in
March 1996. The controversial legislation punishes individuals and
companies from other countries doing business in Cuba with assets
that once belonged to U.S. citizens or corporations, and that have
been nationalized since the 1959 Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
The EU, Canada and some other U.S. allies expressed strong
opposition to the law immediately after it was enacted. Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyed Axworthy said earlier this month that the
Helms-Burton law was "causing a real disruption in the larger
trading system."
</P>
<P>
The EU brought the dispute to the WTO last year and the
Geneva-based WTO appointed a panel of three experts last February
to look into the EU's claim that the Helms-Burton legislation as
an extraterritorial impact that violates international trade law.
</P>
<P>
Washington threatened that it would not cooperate with the WTO
investigative panel in the case, arguing that the Helms-Burton law
pertains to foreign policy and relations between the United States
and Cuba, and it is not a trade issue.
</P>
<P>
While other legislators said that the EU was wrong to bring the
case to the WTO, Ernest Preeg, an expert on international business
with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International
Studies, told the House hearing that the Helms-Burton law is
having a substantial adverse impact on U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
"The law applies, for foreign policy reasons, economic
sanctions on an extraterritorial basis to certain companies in
other countries who trade with or invest in Cuba," Preeg said.
</P>
<P>
"Such actions conflict with the principles underlying the WTO
multilateral trading system," noted Preeg.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Signs Pact With S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Maputo has entered a new
agricultural agreement with Pretoria in a bid to resettle South
African Boers in Mozambican province of Niassa, the Mozambican
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
A joint committee was to be established to coordinate the
resettlement, according to the accord inked by Bonifacio Aires
Aly, governor of Mozambique's Niassa Province, and Mathews Phosa,
Premier of South Africa's Npumalanga Province.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in May 1996 between the two
countries, 13 South African farmers would immigrate to Niassa
Province last November where they would settle down and open up
"experimental farms" to produce seeds the coming farming year.
</P>
<P>
Mozagrius Development Corporation, responsible for the
resettlement, has allocated 220,000 hectares of land for the
first phase of the plan in Niassa Province for cultivation by the
South African Boers.
</P>
<P>
About 300 South African Boers have registered on the Mozagrius
Program which, apart from farming, also covers bio-agriculture,
livestock husbandry and infrastructure building.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sharply Criticizes NATO Expansion on Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Russia sharply criticized the
expansion plan of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on
the eve of the summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Helsinki today, Sergei Yastrzhembsky,
Russia's presidential press secretary, said that if the alliance's
expansion becomes true, it will be the "strategic mistake" and
"worst" decision after the end of the Cold War and the West will
pay high price for it.
</P>
<P>
He said through an interpreter that NATO has no reasons at all
to expand since there is no more ideological confrontation
following the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
"There are none of reasons for NATO to move eastward," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions of the NATO expansion have already undermined
the trust between Russia and the West built after the end of the
Cold War," he said, adding that they "have thrown shadows" over
the relations between Russia and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
When the Cold War ended several years ago, the West promised
there will be no enlargement of NATO, but they now changed their
minds. How can Russia trust them? asked he.
</P>
<P>
NATO's move also undermines arms reduction negotiations between
Russia and the U.S. The implementation of the START II treaty has
stopped while the process of starting talks on START III is
slowing down, said Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate solution to the issue is the denial of taking new
members, or postponing acceptance of new members," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that discussions on NATO will not end in the summit
and will continue, perhaps will be held in Paris next time.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he repeated the demand that NATO and the U.S. sign a
legally-binding document to set "a new institution of full 17
members, not 16 plus one" independent from NATO to deal with
Europe's security.
</P>
<P>
The Russian presidential spokesman also asked "written
obligation" from NATO not to move military infrastructure eastward
or deploy nuclear weapons to "minimize the harm" to international
relations caused by the alliance's possible eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he tries to woo the worries of the Baltic and Nordic
countries, which fear that the U.S. and Russia will make a deal at
the expense of the small countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is a two-party meeting, not against any third parties,"
he said, stressing, "Helsinki is not Yalta."
</P>
<P>
In the summit, the U.S. and Russia will not make any decision
that is against any independent countries behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
NATO expansion will dominate the two-day summit. But neither
side has signaled any concessions over the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, Yastrzhembsky appeared optimistic over possible
progress on bilateral issues. The two presidents are also expected
to discuss arms control and bilateral economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be here on crutches due to a leg injury at noon on
Thursday while Yeltsin will arrive three hours later.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, London Down on Rate Rise Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed today, with Frankfurt and Paris sharply up and London
well down as latest economic figures triggered fresh worries about
higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Inflationary news on boths sides of the Atlantic ensured
British shares in London to continue their recent declines.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index had earlier today been hit by news of higher
retail sales and another fall in the country's jobless total,
which gave strength to Bank of England calls for another interest
rate increase.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stronger-than-expected US consumer price data sent
US treasuries and shares lower, helping the FTSE 100 to end the
session lower for the third consecutive day, down 24.6 points at
4,332.2.
</P>
<P>
But German shares closed higher today, helped by the dollar's
recovery and firm bonds although volumes were thin ahead of the US
February consumer price data, with the DAX-30 index 24.74 points
up at 3,315.93.
</P>
<P>
Share prices on the Paris bourse bounced back after a week of
selling, boosted by robust German markets and a firm dollar, with
the CAC-40 index finishing up 22.82 points at 2,596.77.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares ended down
