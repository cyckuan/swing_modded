<HEADLINE> Profile: Sheikh Hasina - Bangladeshi New PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Sheikh Hasina, president of
Bangladesh Awami (people's) League (AL), today became the new
prime minister of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to journalists after the oath-taking, she called upon
all Bangladeshis to keep patience, show restraint and face
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Terming her government as one of consensus, Hasina said that
the first task of her government was to improve law and order and
ensure peace and security of the people.
</P>
<P>
"Let us work unitedly for democracy. Once we struggled together
on the streets for democracy. Now we should make endeavors for the
economic emancipation of the people by consolidating democracy,"
she stressed.
</P>
<P>
As chief of the AL, Hasina led her party to contest in the
just-completed seventh parliamentary elections and emerge as the
largest party in the parliament by winning 146 out of 300
constituencies, defeating its arch rival, the ex-ruling Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) which won 116 seats in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Born on September 28, 1947, at Tungipara village under Faridpur
district in central Bangladesh, Hasina is the eldest of five
children of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of
independent Bangladesh in 1971.
</P>
<P>
As a scion of a political family, Hasina was actively involved
in student politics in her college and university life when she
gained political experience as a go-between for her father and his
student leaders during Mujibur's repeated imprisonment by the then
Pakistani rulers in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Popular among the students, Hasina was elected chief of the
Students Union of the Eden Girls College, the leading women's
college in the country, where she was studying. She was also a
member of the Students League of the Dhaka University.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the liberation war for independence, she was
imprisoned with family members.
</P>
<P>
On the fateful night of August 15, 1975 when some disgruntled
army officers assassinated her father, the then head of state, her
mother and three brothers to capture power, Hasina and her only
sister Sheikh Rohana survived the carnage because they were on a
tour of the then West Germany.
</P>
<P>
By sheer luck, she escaped from the conspiracy of eliminating
her entire family and subsequently rose to the leadership of the
AL founded by her father. She was elected AL president in 1981 in
her absence.
</P>
<P>
On her return home after six years of exile to take up the
party leadership, she declared: "I have nothing to lose. I pledge
you to fight for restoring the democratic rights of my people."
</P>
<P>
With her firm conviction in constitutional and democratic
movement against the military rule of the then H.M. Ershad regime,
Hasina was arrested and imprisoned many times. But she was
successful in leading her party and a 15-party alliance in the
parliamentary elections held in 1986, in which she won in three
constituencies. Afterwards, she was elected leader of the
opposition in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
After March 1994, the opposition leader led a prolonged
campaign against the then government of the Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP), demanding the holding of a general election under a
neutral caretaker government.
</P>
<P>
While boycotting the sixth parliamentary election held by the
BNP government on February 15 this year, Hasina led the opposition
alliance in launching a month-long "non-cooperation movement"
which forced the BNP government to step down and hand over the
power to a non-party caretaker government to pave the way for the
seventh general elections.
</P>
<P>
A widely traveled personality, Hasina visited and addressed
international seminars in different countries in Asia, Africa,
Europe and the United States. She is an avid reader of books and
journals on international politics, literature and social changes.
</P>
<P>
In 1968, Hasina was married to Dr. M.A. Wazed Miah, an eminent
scientist in the country. They have a son and a daughter.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Urge Israel Not to Deviate from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders here today gave a
clear warning to Israel, saying that if it deviates from the
principles of the peace process and retreats from its promises,
the Arab states will be forced to reconsider the steps they took
toward the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In their final communique after two days' meeting here, the
leaders urged Israel to seriously implement U.N. Security Council
resolutions 242, 338 and 425 which call for Israel's full
withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, including Arab
Jerusalem, Syria's Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They called on Israel to enable the Palestinians to exercise
their right to self-determination and statehood with Arab
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders said the establishment of fresh settlements
and bringing in new settlers constitute a violation of the Geneva
Conventions, and the Madrid conference frame and obstructs the
whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
There should be a halt to the Israeli settlement activities in
the Golan Heights and the occupied Arab territories in Palestine,
especially Jerusalem, they said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders underlined their rejection of any changes to the
features of Jerusalem or its legal status and stressed that the
attainment of peace can only be possible with the solution to the
Jerusalem problem and the Palestinian refugees issue.
</P>
<P>
They emphasized the necessity of ending the Israeli blockade
of the Palestinian self-rule areas and spelt out their support for
Lebanon in the face of constant Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
The realization of peace in the region is the sole guarantee
for providing security to all regional countries, they noted.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders also called upon the co-sponsors of the peace
process, the United States and Russia, the European Union member
states and other countries concerned as well as the United
Nations and international institutions to guarantee that there
will not be any violation of the bases of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
They said that only by doing so can the process succeed on the
Syrian, Lebanese and Palestinian tracks with Israel.

<P>
LUSAKA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian president Kenneth
Kaunda reiterated here today that he will contest the presidency
despite the controversial new constitution to bar him from doing
so.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the constitution amendment bill has been
rejected by the majority of Zambians.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill signed into law by President Frederick Chiluba
at the end of last month, Kaunda cannot stand in the elections
because his parents are not Zambians but Malawians.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba reaffirmed on Saturday that "there is no going
back, elections will be held before the end of this year and the
elections will be held under the constitution I have just signed".

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Pledge to Consolidate Arab Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders today stressed the
need and importance of restoring Arab solidarity, saying that it
is the right way to achieve the goals of common Arab Action.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique issued at the end of the two-day Arab
summit, the Arab leaders said they met here to intensify Arab
consultations and coordinations with a view to closing Arab
ranks.
</P>
<P>
They said the Arab solidarity should be based on respect for
the sovereignty and independence over every country's natural and
economic resources, non-intervention in the internal affairs of
any state.
</P>
<P>
It will also be based on a peaceful settlement of bilateral
disputes in accordance with the principles of international law,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders also expressed their keenness on enhancing
the role of the Arab League, affirming their determination to
strengthen and activate its role, and their commitment to its
charter.
</P>
<P>
They urged the member states to honor their financial
obligations to the league.
</P>
<P>
The Arab league has run serious financial crisis due to some
members' failure to pay their fees.
</P>
<P>
The summit, the largest in six years, drew 21 of the 22 Arab
League members. It is widely seen here as a good example for
seeking Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
According to Palestinian official Nabil Shaath, the atmosphere
of the Arab summit is "very positive."
</P>
<P>
He said that the convening in itself is a big success because
it brought together all Arab parties invited.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting has been very positive, we really have seen very
little, little tension, if at all, during the meetings of the
Arab foreign ministers and leaders," he said.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the meeting between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad prior to the summit,
saying that it "opened a new page in relations between the PLO
and Syria."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said at a press conference
that President Hosni Mubarak's meeting with Sudanese President
Omar Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir is also positive.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been strained after
Egypt accused Sudan of supporting terrorism and plotting to
assassinate Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in June 1995. Sudan
has denied the accusations.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Draft Constitution Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority (PA)
published the draft constitution in Gaza today, which states various
Palestinian national rights.
</P>
<P>
The draft defines that a Palestinian state will be established
with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
It says that Jerusalem is holy to three religions and the PA
will enable freedom of worships to members of all religions in
the city and throughout Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The draft constitution is due to be submitted to the 88-member
legislative Palestinian Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
The publication of the draft constitution came at a time when
the new right-wing Israeli government is tightening screws in its
control over Jerusalem and the territories.
</P>
<P>
According to the new Likud-led government's policy guidelines
published on June 18, Israel insists that "Jerusalem, the capital
of Israel, is one city, whole and undiveded, and will remain
forever under Israel's sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The government declared that it will thwart any attempt to

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Pays Tribute to Papandreou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- President Glafcos Clerides has
said Cyprus is mourning the death of former Greek Premier Andreas
Papandreou because he has displayed his "determination to defend
Cyprus' freedom."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here after Papandreou's death in the
early hours of today at his home in Athens, President Clerides
said, "Cyprus in particular is mourning the death of Andreas
Papandreou, who over and above anything else, through the joint
defense pact, has given tangible proof of his government's and
the nation's determination to defend Cypriot freedom."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that "we were informed about the death of
Andreas Papandreou, a prominent political figure in Greece, with
deep sorrow."
</P>
<P>
Greece, which is going through a trying period, "is being
deprived of the services of a distinguished politician", the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou was the first Greek Premier to have visited
officially Cyprus while in office in February 1982. He and
President Clerides agreed on a joint defense pact in November
1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said
today in Florence, where he was accompanying President Clerides
in his working meeting with European Union leaders, that
President Clerides will attend the funeral of the late Greek
Premier Papandreou Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides will return from Florence Monday after a
two-week absence during which he had high level meetings in four
countries on both sides of the Atlantic, including a meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John
Major.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Use Low Sulfur Diesel to Check Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will sell in its
market a new diesel product with low sulfur early next month in
an effort to check environment pollution, a press statement by
the Kuwait National Petroleum Company said today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the new diesel which was produced by the
state-run company has a sulfur content of 0.50 percent, 50 percent
less than the current 1 percent sulfur content.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister and Board Chairman of the Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation Abdul Mohsen al-Madaj said in the statement that
reducing the sulfur percentage in the diesel fuel was an
"important step in combating pollution resulting from fuel
combustion."
</P>
<P>
He said reducing sulfur in diesel would help cut by 50 percent
the level of compound acid stemming from automobiles.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has around 100,000 families and an identical number of
expatriate families and a large number of the Kuwaiti families
have more than one car each. Official figures showed that there
are about 2 million trips last year made by private vehicles in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Streets in Kuwait cities as well as other places around the
country are teeming with vehicles every day from early morning
till late night.

<HEADLINE> Iranian CD Makers Eye US, European, Asian Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian compact disc (CD) makers
are trying to export their products to not only the United States,
but also European and Asian markets as well as markets in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Reza Darabi, commercial director of Laleh Computer Inc, told
Xinhua today that they have exported 50,000 compact discs injected
with Iranian traditional music to the American market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first shipment of the Iranian-made compact
discs to the United States is part of the ambitious program by the
privately-owned company in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-made compact discs with trade mark "Shahram" are
registered in Los Angeles, California, the United States. Each CD
sells at a price of 65 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian director said that Americans are now offering raw
materials for manufacturing CD to his country through their
branches in European countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iranian manufacturers are eager to take orders
from different countries with competitive price and trying to
export their products to U.S., European and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
"We have a big potential market there because 1.5 million
Iranians live in the United States, 400,000 in Britain
and 100,000 in France," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian company will export 145,000 pieces of compact discs
to European market this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abulfath Nikranjbar, CD replication manager of the company,
said that his company has already concluded a deal to duplicate
600,000 CD injected with Holy Quran, which will be exported to
Moslem countries such as Syria, Lebanon, Pakistan and others.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
inaugurated a CD manufacturing plant in Karaj, about 120
kilometers west of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iranians claimed that the plant is the largest of its kind in
the Middle East, which has the production capacity of 5.5 million
compact discs a year.
</P>
<P>
The production lines were imported from America, England,
Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland at a total cost
of 7.3 billion rials (5 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Direct Flights to Amman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The first Israeli commercial flight
to Jordan landed at Queen Alia International Airport today,
launching direct flights between Tel Aviv and Amman by an Israeli
airline.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister of Transport Yitzhak Levy traveled to the
Kingdom aboard the flight, the first visit to the Kingdom by a
minister of Benjamin Netanyahu's government which took office
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is also the first official contact between the right-wing
Israeli Likud government and an Arab state.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister and his Jordanian counterpart Naser Lawzi
pledged at a joint press conference that the two sides will honor
and continue to implement all the accords signed between Jordan
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also voiced their determination to deepen and
widen their cooperation in all fields relating to peace.
</P>
<P>
The airline will operate, as of today, five weekly flights to
Amman except for Fridays and Saturdays as Royal Wings does to Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Royal Wings, managed by the national carrier Royal
Jordanian, started its Amman-Tel Aviv flights in March, nearly
three months after Jordan and Israel signed a transport agreement,
including an annex on civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
But the reciprocal Israeli flights were delayed after Israel
launched a massive blitz against guerrillas in south Lebanon in
April.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Arkia, managed by the national carrier El Al, delayed
its scheduled April 27 launch of Amman flights because of what
Israeli reports described as security reasons but what Jordanian
officials said were "technical" problems.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli reports said the opening of Arkia flights to Amman
were deferred because of fears of attacks in retaliation for the
Jewish state's military operations in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The transport agreement was part of a series of bilateral
accords called for in the peace treaty signed between the two
countries in October, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under the transport accord, buses of private companies started
plying between Jordanian and Israeli cities last Sunday. Private
cars are also allowed cross-border travel.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 23 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today bestowed the order for meritorious service (gold) on the
Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, for his outstanding
service in the public interest of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The award was made during a service of thanksgiving for Tutu
on his retirement at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said Tutu had been a blessing and inspiration to
countless people, here and abroad, through his ministry, his acts
of compassion, his prophetic witness and his political
engagement.
</P>
<P>
''He is renowned for selfless commitment to the poor, the
oppressed and downtrodden. With his colleagues he remained an
effective voice of the people of South Africa when so many of
their leaders were imprisoned, exiled, banned and restricted,''
said the president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, who
delivered the sermon at the service, also presented Tutu with a
special award for outstanding service to the Anglican communion.
</P>
<P>
Carey said Tutu had given confidence and hope to millions of
south Africans.
</P>
<P>
Among dignitaries attending the service included Botswana
President Ketumile Masire, Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano,
Lesotho King Letsie iii, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and de

<HEADLINE> Arafat Willing to Talk with New Israeli Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has
expressed readiness to negotiate with the new Israeli government
provided negotiations are carried out on the basis of the Madrid
conference, the bilateral agreements and international principles.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a closed session of the Arab summit here late
Saturday night, which was released by the Egyptian Middle East
News Agency today, Arafat said the Palestinian people will not
accept going back on progress achieved so far because this would
mean to return to the pre-peace phase.
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit, the first in six years, ended today after two
days' meeting.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that the Arab nation is committed to the peace
process and expects the Israeli government to fulfill its promises
and agreements.
</P>
<P>
The final phase of negotiations between the Palestinian
Authority and Israel involves Jerusalem, settlements, refugees,
borders, security and relations with neighboring countries as well
as the water issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the latest developments in Israel, the final
stage of negotiations were delayed, although a meeting was held in
Taba, Egypt on May 5.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader called on the Arab summit to adopt a
clear and firm position against the dangers facing Jerusalem on
the basis of relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In their final communique issued after the summit, Arab leaders
gave a clear warning to Israel, saying that if it deviates from
the principles of the peace process and retreats from its
promises, the Arab states will be forced to reconsider the steps
they took toward the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also urged for holding an emergent Islamic summit to
examine the future of Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Poverty in East Asia Reducing Steadily, WB Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries have made
remarkable progress in poverty reduction, but much of work is to
be done, a new World Bank report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the 140-page report entitled "Poverty Reduction
and the World Bank: Progress and Challenges in the 1990s" which is
released here today, many East Asian countries have achieved some
of the world's fastest poverty reduction rates in the past 25
years, but the latest estimates finds 460 million people still
living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia and Indonesia are prime examples of just how crucial
it it to invest in the basics--education, health care, nutrition
--if poverty is to be reduced and economic growth encouraged,"
stressed Russell Cheetham, World Bank Vice-President for East Asia
and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The report finds that people in developing countries are living
longer, healthier lives than they were a generation ago. Average
incomes in developing nations have almost doubled in the past 25
years--a growth that took industrialized countries 40-60 years to
achieve. The poor also have more access to such basic services as
electricity and running water.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still a long way to go for global
poverty-reduction. In developing countries, half a million women
die each year from maternity-related complications, 7 million
people still die every year from easily preventable diseases, and
nearly 8 million children die every year from diseases linked to
contaminated water and air pollution. Moreover, 50 million
children are mentally or physically impaired because of
malnutrition and 130 million children-- 80 percent of them girls
--are denied the chance to go to school.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the World Bank report finds out, although the
proportion of people living in poverty has declined, the number of
people living on less than one dollar a day has increased from
1.23 billion in 1987 to some 1.31 billion in 1993. With rapid
population growth, there is a strong tendency for the number of
poor to rise. The World Bank has, in previous reports, used one
U.S. dollar per person per day as a minimum poverty line to ensure
consistent international comparisons.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the poor in the developing world are in South
Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Indochina, Central America, Brazil and
rural China. While the majority of the world's poor still live in
rural areas, it is expected that by the early part of next
century, most will be living in cities. East Asia accounts for one
third of the world's poor, most of whom live in China and
Indochina. Overall, the region's economic growth was between 6
percent and 10 percent per year over the 1991-1994 period. But a
greater effort is needed to improve the lives of the region's
poor. And about 350 million Chinese are living on less than one
dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1995, the World Bank group channeled over 5.4 billion
dollars to more than 200 direct poverty-targeted projects.
Thirteen of these projects were approved for Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Laos, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. They
focused on such areas as social safety nets, basic education,
maternal and child health, land administration and village
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sad over Papandreou's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish leaders today expressed
their sadness over the passing away of the former Prime Minister
of Greece, Andreas Papandreou, despite his staunch anti-Turkish
policies.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou died early this morning from heart failure at his
home in Athens.
</P>
<P>
Hours after Papandreou's death, Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel sent a letter to his Greek counterpart Constantine
Stephanopoulos, in which he expressed his condolences to the
people of Greece and Papandreou's family.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that he had met Papandreou on numerous occasions,
Demirel referred to the late politician's "contribution as a
statesman to his own country."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, in a similar message to
his Greek counterpart Costas Simitis, said he had learned of
Papandreou's death with "great sorrow."
</P>
<P>
Despite the rush of good will from Turkish leaders,
Papandreou will be remembered in Turkey for his anti-Turkish
policies.
</P>
<P>
Coming to power in Greece in 1981-89 and again in 1993-96, his
general approach was to make Turkey as his country's prime enemy.
</P>
<P>
His anti-Turkish approach appeared to gain in intensity at
times when his domestic appeal seemed to be waning, said the local
press here.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou once claimed that the threat to NATO member Greece
was not from the north, Russia that is, but from the east,
meaning Turkey.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Press Israel for Withdrawal from Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department spokesman
said on Sunday that the "key early test" of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's willingness to honor existing agreements with
the Palestinians is timely withdrawal of all but a few hundred
Israeli troops from Hebron, West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned, Hebron is a key early test for the
Prime Minister," said U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas
Burns on the eve of State Secretary Warren Christopher's departure
for a brief tour to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is not very much convinced by Netanyahu's pledge to
abide by commitments his predecessor Shimon Peres has made to
Palestinian leader Yesser Arafat and to hold unconditional
negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, and he intends to remind the
Israeli hardline leader during their meetings next Tuesday that it
is time for Israel to turn over most control of Hebron to the
Palestinians, said the U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was dispatched for the middle East mission by U.S.
President Bill Clinton who has tried to keep his image of Middle
East peacemaker, they said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President: Syria, Biggest Winner Emerging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
stressed that the "biggest winner" emerging from a two-day Arab
summit, which ended in Cairo today, was Syria since it had got rid
of an isolation in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
"Syria was the biggest winner in the summit after it had once
been regarded as isolated in the Arab world," the Lebanese
president was quoted by the Beirut-based Sawt Ash-Shaab (Voice of
the People) Radio.
</P>
<P>
On the margin of the conference, Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad held a meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the
first since January 1994, and two meetings with King Hussein of
Jordan. Tensions have loomed recently in the Syrian-Jordanian
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president returned to Beirut tonight after taking
part in the Arab summit, the first since the 1990 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters on the special plane carrying him back
home, Hrawi said that Egypt was the "second" winner because it
had received all the Arab leaders to the summit.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanon is the third winner," the president added. "Because
it had occupied the hearts of all the participants in the summit
for the Israeli aggressions against Lebanon in April."
</P>
<P>
In its final communique, the Arab summit called for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon to the
internationally recognized border.
</P>
<P>
All states of the 22-member Arab League except Iraq attended
the summit, stimulated by the victory of hardline Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli elections late last month.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi expressed hope that the summit would be the "beginning of
fortune" in light of the advantages which it had achieved.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Arab "Threats" Incompatible With Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today denounced the Arab summit in Cairo for issuing
"threats" incompatible with the negotiations between Israel and
Arab states.
</P>
<P>
In his reaction to the just-concluded two-day Arab summit,
Netanyahu told a meeting of Jewish Agencies that, although peace
is the strategic choice of Israel, "it could not be held hostage
of preconditions."
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders, trying to form a unified front toward the new
Israeli government, ended their summit, the first in six years,
with a strong call on Israel to continue the peace process on the
basis of land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, in a joint communique issued at the end of the
meeting, also supported the establishment of a Palestinian state
with Jerusalem as its capital, and demanded Israel's withdrawal
from the Golan Heights it seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war and from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They warned that Arab countries will reconsider their stands
toward the peace process if Netanyahu's government deviates from
the principles of the peace process and retreats from its
promises.
</P>
<P>
While pledging Israel would enter talks with the Palestinians
on the future status of the territories, Netanyahu pressed the
Palestinian side to honor what he called its commitments to the
Oslo agreements by fighting terrorism in a more effective way.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister also called on Syria to hold dialogue
with his country, but he implied no compromise on the issue of the
Golan Heights, saying that the Israeli withdrawal "would lead
separation only in the short time, but danger in long term."
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy also
criticized the summit, pointing out that some resolutions passed
"included dictations and conditions that would make the peace
negotiations senseless."
</P>
<P>
However, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the host of the
summit, denied that the summit and the joint communique were
"threatening," saying that the Arab world had to react to
Netanyahu's suggestion that peace should be made in Israeli
terms.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed optimism that the new Israeli government
would move the peace process forward, saying that Netanyahu would
prove more flexible than his public remarks suggested.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein also described the communique as
"positive" and called on the Israelis to honor all the agreements
that have been signed.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat called
the summit "very successful," and warned the Israelis that change
of path would have negative repercussions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is to
arrive here Tuesday to start his visit to the Middle East on a
rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who is also expected to visit Egypt, will prepare
for Netanyahu's planned first visit to Washington in July.
</P>
<P>
However, Christopher is eager to learn about Netanyahu's true
intentions on the peace process and will use the opportunity to
persuade him to continue moving along the peace path.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Alarmed By Latest Evictions Of Bosnian Muslims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The UN Higher Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) on Monday reported that evictions of Bosnian
Muslims have been reoccurring in the Serb-controlled city of Banja
Luka.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said that at least 30 Muslims had
been evicted by Serb refugees in the Vrbanja neighborhood of the
northern Bosnian city over the weekend and the eviction "is still
on-going".
</P>
<P>
"Needless to say this is extremely alarming," said Janowski,
"this is the biggest wave of violence and evictions against
Muslims in Banja Luka area since Dayton" agreement was signed last
December.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that the evictions were triggered by the recent
return of a Muslim refugee man to the city from Ireland and in the
incidents of eviction, Serb refugees beat Muslims with sticks.
</P>
<P>
Serb police did provide shelter for the Muslim man but did not
intervene in the incidents, Janowski said.
</P>
<P>
During the three and half year war, most of the Muslims and
Croats were driven out of Banja Luka and their houses were later
taken up by Serb refugees from western Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Because of deep-rooted ethnic hatred, many observers believe
that the return of refugees is one of the most challenging issues
faced by the international community in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Record Drug Trafficking Case Goes to Court in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Evidence in the trial of nine
people accused of smuggling 600 kg of narcotics, was heard in an
opening session in Shenzhen, in south China's Guangdong Province,
today.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest drug trafficking case in the history of new
China and involved a lengthy investigation by the Public Security
Bureau of Shenzhen, which transferred control of the case to the
Shenzhen Municipal People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
In late 1995, one of the defendants, Wang Shijian, opened a
shop in Cangyuan County, in southwest China's Yunnan Province, and
at the same time rented a mine in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
He Then contacted drug dealers in Thailand and China in February
of this year and raised 28.3 million yuan for the purchase of
heroin to be shipped to Guangzhou and Shenzhen from Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, Wang put the funds to be used for buying drugs into
a motor vehicle and drove it to the shop he owned in Yunnan, and
after five days went to Myanmar under the guise of going to the
mine there, buying a large amount of heroin from local smugglers
in the process.
</P>
<P>
He then shipped the drugs across to China, intending to sell
them in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong, according to evidence
given in court.
</P>
<P>
The 598.85 kg of heroin, which was 76.2 percent pure, was
discovered by police at the defendants' residence.
</P>
<P>
The procuratorate has stated that the nine defendants engaged
in criminal acts that completely disregarded the law of the
state. Evidence in the trial is still being heard.

<HEADLINE> China to Enact Administrative Punishment Law This October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The "Administrative Punishment
Law," which goes into effect in four months, is expected to
improve and clean up the government.
</P>
<P>
The Commission of Legal Affairs (CLA) under the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), and the Bureau
of Legal Affairs (BLA) under the State Council, held a meeting June

</P>
<P>
"The government departments and the government workers must
strictly abide by the laws when administering the state affairs,"
CLA director Gu Angran said at the meeting. "Most of the laws are
carried out by administrative departments. To run governmental
affairs by law is very important for building China into a country
with a socialist legal system."
</P>
<P>
The enactment of the "Administrative Punishment Law" will
enable administrative departments to issue appropriate penalties
and provide for the improvement of the government through lawful
means, as well as build a cleaner government and promote relations
between the government and the people, Gu said.

They also should take advantage of the chance to further improve
their quality of administration, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Calls for Israeli Commitment to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri called here today for a commitment of the new Israeli
government to principles of the 1991 Madrid peace conference and
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a conference of Arab businessmen in Beirut, Hariri
urged new Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to "return to
the Madrid conference and international resolutions," and warned
of a setback if Netanyahu fails to do so.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has repeatedly affirmed that the peace it wants with
Israel should be based on U.N. Security Council Resolutions 242,
338 and 425 and the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said the new Israeli prime minister, who is also the
head of the hardline Israeli Likud Party, should "change his
policy if he really wants the realization of peace in the Middle
East and continuation of the peace negotiations as he said."
</P>
<P>
"If there is a problem from which one would suffer, that is
Netanyahu's election from which the Israelis will suffer because
of his policy," Hariri said in his speech opening the second
conference of the Arab capital markets, which is scheduled to last
three days.
</P>
<P>
He said peace is a strategic decision and a strategic choice of
Lebanon because "our peace-loving people are in an urgent need of
peace."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reiterated that instead of a separated
peace, Lebanon is seeking a full and comprehensive peace which
will recover all the Arab rights.
</P>
<P>
To appeal to international investors, the billionaire prime
minister said, "Lebanon can heal the damages of the recent Israeli
aggressions against south Lebanon and the country has emerged
strong from the combat due to the national unity."
</P>
<P>
Hariri said the Lebanese government was "making compensation
for all the losses" caused by the 16-day Israeli military strikes
in April.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of confidence by Arab and foreign
countries in his country for the continuation of the current
reconstruction process, adding that the "biggest indication" of
the confidence was an influx of capitals and investments to
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hariri underlined that Lebanon is an independent state and its
political situation is clear, saying that Lebanon is able to meet
crisis and problems and "it continues confirming itself on the
international political map."

<HEADLINE> Seminar on IPR Protection in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese officials and legal
experts met here today for a seminar on handling intellectual
property rights violations.
</P>
<P>
The Higher People's Court of Hunan Province and the
Intermediate People's Court of Changsha are sponsors of the annual
event, which attracted over 60 judges and officials from 36 courts
and central and local government departments.
</P>
<P>
The five-day seminar is the third of its kind and will focus on
the protection of unpatented technology, technical knowhow, the
ownership of commercial secrets, and other topics.
</P>
<P>
Participants agree that China has basically established a legal
framework for protection of intellectual property rights over the
past decade. It has also joined several international conventions
and signed bilateral treaties on IPR protection with a number of
countries, and many local authorities have drafted rules and
regulations on IPR protection on their own.
</P>
<P>
Trial work on IPR-related cases has become more standardized
over the years, the participants also pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the judicial system of Hunan Province
handled more than 460 cases involving trademarks, patents, and
copyrights in the first five months of this year, while another
study has shown that a total of 642 cases involving industrial
rights were tried in Hunan from 1991 to 1995.

<HEADLINE> Justice Minister's Call for Improved Proficiency in Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Justice Minister Xiao Yang
called for the country's 90,000 lawyers to revise their roles in
legal services and to improve their proficiency, today.
</P>
<P>
The comments came at the closing session of a national
conference on the lawyers law, which takes effect January 1 next
year.
</P>
<P>
Among the lastest changes in China's legal system is the
revised Criminal Procedural Law, also taking effect at the start
of 1997, which allows lawyers greater involvement in criminal
cases.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers' defense arguments will also play a bigger role in
court trials, as cases will not be decided by judges and
prosecutors before hand.
</P>
<P>
"That is why lawyers must improve their proficiency level for
better protection of clients' rights and the correct enforcement
of the law," Xiao explained.
</P>
<P>
They should no longer work as government subsidized "state
legal service workers," but as independent professionals
responsible for clients and the law, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers' law specifically stipulates lawyers' various
responsibilities, he added.
</P>
<P>
A system whereby lawyers compensate clients for losses they
inflict on the clients has been decided and lawyers should improve
their services, the minister said, emphasizing that the major
changes to the legal system have not only enlarged the business
scope of lawyers, but also placed greater responsibilities on them.
</P>
<P>
They all serve as guarantees for lawyers to make full use of
their abilities in the country's drive toward a country with a
system of rule by law, Xiao said, adding that lawyers should value
such reforms in the legal system and make a contribution to
economic development and social progress.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Panel Calls for Restraint in Arms Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A five-member U.S. advisory
panel has urged the United States and its major allies to exercise
more restraint in selling sophisticated conventional arms to other
countries for the safety of the world.
</P>
<P>
The report prepared by the bipartisan panel appointed by U.S.
President Bill Clinton was presented to the White House on Friday
and is to be formally released this week, The Washington Post
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that the 22 billion U.S. dollars global trade
in increasingly sophisticated conventional weaponry threatens to
undermine the security of the United States and its friends.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the end of the Cold War has reshaped the world
market for armaments and given the United States the predominant
share of all such exports, the panel said that Washington should
show more leadership to slow the proliferation of advanced
weaponry and ensure that civilian technologies are not being
diverted to military use overseas.
</P>
<P>
The panel called for U.S. policy makers to stop approving some
weapons exported to prop up declining U.S. defense firms.
</P>
<P>
National security interests should be ther sole criteria for
making such exports, and domestic economic pressures should "not
be allowed to subvert" decision-making, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
The present U.S. share of the global arms market is 52 percent,
up from around 25 percent nine years ago, and will likely expand to
about 60 percent by the end of the decade, according to the
report.

<HEADLINE> Three Seeds Bow Out of Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Three seeds made their
early exits with Michael Chang becoming the first in the men's
singles first round of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The American, the world number six and sixth-seeded player,
suffered a surprise defeat to Spain's Alberto Costa after battling
for three hours.
</P>
<P>
Costa, a Spanish clay-court expert who had never won a
grass-court match, fought back from one set down to beat Chang
3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-1), 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard avenged his defeat to Chang in straight sets in
the first round in his Wimbledon debut in 1994.
</P>
<P>
This is Chang's second consecutive early Wimbledon exit
following last year's second round loss. His best feat in the
grasscourt was in 1994 when he reached the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Chang was immediately joined by compatriot eighth-seeded Jim
Courier who lost to less known fellow Jonathan Stark 2-6, 4-6,
6-2, 4-6.
</P>
<P>
Fifteenth-seed Arnaud Boetsch of France also crashed out of the
first round after a five-set thrilling clash against German
Alexander Radulescu.
</P>
<P>
The 91st-ranked Radulescu, 27, eliminated the 27-year-old
Boetsch 6-3, 6-4, 6-7 (2-7), 5-7, 9-7.
</P>
<P>
In the other action, second seed Boris Becker of Germany
breezed over Frenchman Jean-Philippe Fleurian 6-0, 6-2, 6-3 to
advance into the second round.

<HEADLINE> Work on Yunnan Section of Nanning-Kunming Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Track-laying work on a 297
kilometer section of railway in Yunnan Province of the
Nanning-Kunming Railway line, a very important transport artery in
southwest China, was completed today.
</P>
<P>
The nearly 900-km-long railway crosses Yunnan and Guizhou
provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, connecting
Kunming, Yunnan's capital, with Nanning, the capital city of
Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan section passes through precipitous mountains and
alongside rushing waters 2,000 meters above sea level. Workers had
to build 140 bridges, with a total length of 24 km, and dig 90
tunnels, with a total length of 66 km.
</P>
<P>
The railway will greatly improve Yunnan's transport and
investment environment, and help its reform and opening-up drive,
said He Zhiqiang, governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan is a relatively poor province with rich natural
resources, including 13 rare minerals, 20 billion tons of
phosphate, and rich hyropower resouces, the governor noted, but
poor transport conditions make it difficult for it to develop the
resources.
</P>
<P>
The railway from Guiyang, Guizhou's capital, to Kunming, with a
total length of 643 km, was the province's first and only line,
until 1971. Another line links Kunming with Chengdu, capital city
of Sichuan Province in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan section of the Nanning-Kunming line will be open for
business on August 1 this year, railway authorities say.
</P>
<P>
The entire line will go operational next year, with
track-laying work to be completed next March, they added.
</P>
<P>
Work started on the rail link in 1990. So far, 54 km of track
has been laid in Guizhou, and 246 in Guangxi.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- India and Thailand are making
efforts to enhance their bilateral trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
At the second meeting of the Indo-Thailand Joint Business
Council (JBC) here today, Secretary of the Indian Ministry of
External Affairs N. Ram said that the two countries should expand
their trade basket and increase their trade items such as drugs
and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, auto parts, electric machinery as
well as gems and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The two countries currently focused only on one or two
commodities for trade and this situation needs to be changed, the
secretary said.
</P>
<P>
India is preparing the ground for finalization of a bilateral
investment protection treaty between the two countries to channel
Thai investment to the country, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries is not big enough
and India wanted to realize the two-billion-US-dollar trade target
between the two countries in the 1996-97 financial year starting
April 1, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Both India and Thailand are members of a triangle economic
cooperation group which also consists of Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Egyptian-Sudanese Ties Show Signs of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian-Sudanese relations have
shown signs of relaxation after the Arab summit, which was held in
Cairo from June 22 to 23.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Sudanese relations have been tense in the past
three years because of political differences and border disputes
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The tension reached its height in June last year when Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak experienced an assassination attempt in
which Sudan was accused of being involved.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded Cairo Arab summit provided a meeting
opportunity for both Mubarak and Sudanese President Omar Hassan
Ahmed al-Bashir, who had not met since the summit of the
Organization of African Unity in 1993. It also created a favorable
climate for the two countries to get over their differences.
</P>
<P>
The signs of relaxation in Egyptian-Sudanese relations consist
in the fact that the presidents of the two countries embraced at
the Cairo International Airport as soon as the Sudanese president
arrived last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also met on the sidelines of the Cairo Arab
summit and agreed to halt the media campaigns between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In press statements following his meeting with the Sudanese
president, President Mubarak affirmed that Egypt was eager for
the territorial integrity of Sudan and that it would stand by
the Sudanese people.
</P>
<P>
"The Sudanese president demanded that we turn over a new leaf
and implied that we had to tell the Egyptian people on what basis
we should turn over that new leaf, and that substantial steps
must be taken toward turning over such a leaf, especially in
connection with the status of terrorists," President Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He said that bilateral meetings between security officials of
both sides will be held to examine security issues and exchange
information.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Sudanese president described his
meeting with his Egyptian counterpart as "most friendly and
outspoken."
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to turn over a new leaf in the Sudanese-Egyptian
relations so as to get over all differences of the past, and to
create a mechanism for tackling all the outstanding issues,"
President Bashir said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that his country supports terrorism, affirming that
any Sudanese does not exercise terrorism nor will he ever do so.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about Egypt's position on the
U.N. Security Council economic sanctions against Sudan, President
Bashir said, "Any resolution that is detrimental to the interests
of the Sudanese people does not interest Egypt, because we are one
people."
</P>
<P>
Asked about mediation between Sudan and Egypt, President Bashir
made it clear that a meeting between him and President Mubarak
demands no mediator, and that his country is seeking a
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Political observers in Cairo think that the Mubarak-Bashir
meeting has broken psychological barriers and paved the way to
securing a reconciliation between the two Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng on China's Objective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China's objective is to build a
modernized socialist country with prosperity, democracy and
advanced culture, Chinese premier Li Peng has stressed.
</P>
<P>
During this process, Li said, China will strengthen its legal
system by using the Chinese Constitution and laws as a foundation,
rather than the laws of the United States and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters from the British Financial Times
on June 7, Li said China's style of democracy suits China's
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that China's political system of the National People's
Congress and the multi-Party cooperation, coupled with the system
of political consultation under the leadership of the Chinese
Communist Party, is well-suited to the Chinese conditions," he
said. By upholding these systems, China is expected to greatly
advance the country's socialist democracy and the development of
its legal system, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said in the world today there are different views on human
rights. The Vienna Declaration and Program of Action adopted in
June 1993 proclaims not only the universality of human rights but
also their peculiarity. It acknowledges that the right to
development is universal and inseparable, and is a component of
basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, human rights cannot be simply interpreted as
political rights: they also should embrace the rights of existence
and development. These rights are especially important to
developing countries, Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
Given this, it is irrational and impossible to require all
countries in the world to accept the West's view of what is
valuable, and to require that four-fifths of the world's
population should accept the view on human rights held by
one-fifth of the world's population, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In today's world of constant, profound changes, individual
countries should decide, according to their conditions, what type
of social system they want to follow and what development path
they plan to take, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"One should learn to acknowledge the diversity of the world and
the differences between nations, and people should respect each
other and try to seek common ground while letting differences
exist," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
China's economic development and the reform of its economic
structure will undoubtedly be coupled by the deepening of the
country's reform of the political structure. The result should
enable the government to become more efficient and the people to
enjoy the ability to exercise their rights, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
China's reform of its political structure would by no means be
a copy of the West's model, but should be done in line with
China's conditions and with Chinese characteristics, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reporters conducted their two-week coverage
of China to prepare stories for special editions on China in the
Times. The reporters also interviewed leaders of Chinese
Ministries and Commissions, and heads of financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Force Two to Skip Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- American Chanda Rubin became the
first victim of injury when she abandoned her battles in the
Wimbledon Tennis Championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
And injury also claimed its second victim when Bernd Karbacher
of Germany decided to skip the tournament after he sprained his
ankle in practice hours before his opener.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin tested her racket in her opener against Lisa
Raymond for a dozen minutes and retired after losing the first set.
</P>
<P>
Sidelined since April, the American skipped the French Open
because of tendinitis in her right wrist and only returned to the
court last week for the Wimbledon warmup tournament in Eastbourne.
</P>
<P>
Her place was occupied by Slovakian Karina Habsudova, while the
latter's spot was filled by lucky loser Aleksandra Olska of Poland.
</P>
<P>
On his case, German Karbacher sustained the injury just hours
before his opening game against fourth-seeded Goran Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Karbacher beat Ivanisevic in the fourth round
of the French Open.
</P>
<P>
His slot was taken over by lucky loser David Nainkin of South
Africa.

WASHINGTON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- An abandoned building being
renovated to house a black church in the state of Louisiana, in
the southern United States, was seriously damaged early Monday by
what an official said was arson.
</P>
<P>
Two pedestrians waved down a patrol car shortly after midnight
and reported the fire at the future home of the New Birth Temple
Church, Fire Capt. Danny Glass was quoted as saying by the
Associated Press.
</P>

Fire department spokesman Billy Jordan said that the
congregation of the church was mostly black.

<P>
"Right now we are certain it was an arson fire," said Fire
Capt. Fred Sanders. "But we are not certain it is related to the
church arson fires across the nation."
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
There have been about 40 suspicious fires at predominantly
black churches mostly in the South since January 1995.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Welcomes Arab Summit Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today welcomed the
"positive" outcome of the Cairo Arab Summit which ended Sunday,
especially with respect to its call on Iraq to back off from its
aggressive and provocative policies against its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Following a cabinet meeting specially held on the summit,
Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Acting Foreign Minister
Abdul Aziz Al-Dekheel told reporters that the council of ministers
welcomed the role of the summit in reviving Arab joint actions on
the basis of respect, sovereignty, regional security and
non-interference in others' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, who represented Kuwait at the summit, briefed the
cabinet on the summit's endorsement of a just and comprehensive
peace as a strategic Arab choice on the basis of U.N. resolutions
and the land-for-peace formula in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The ministers expressed content over the outcome and
recommendations made by the summit, which they said served the
restoration of Arab cooperation and "ascended to the level of
Arabs' aspirations."
</P>
<P>
The session also welcomed the summit's call on Iraq to
implement all the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions,
especially regarding the release of Kuwaiti prisoners of war this
country insisted are still detained in Iraqi jails and the
compensation arrangement to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In the final communique issued Sunday after the two-day Arab
summit held in Cairo, Arab leaders demanded the Iraqi government
not to adopt any aggressive or provocative policy toward Arab
neighbors and asked Iraq to commit itself to implementing the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions.

Twenty-one Arab countries of the 22-member Arab League, except

<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said that
for China to resume its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
schedule is a sign of the times and the desire of the people.
</P>
<P>
It is the joint responsibility of the governments of China and
Britain to realize a smooth transfer of Hong Kong's political
power and a steady transition, Premier Li told the London-based
Financial Times during an interview on June 7.
</P>
<P>
At present, the two sides should concentrate on settling their
unresolved issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said Hong Kong residents in all professions are concerned
with the selection of candidates for the first executive officer
and other governmental officials of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The selection of these candidates is important and requires
careful consideration, and people from all walks of life should be
fully represented during the selection process, the premier
said. The officials in charge of various institutions of SAR
should be chosen based on the principle of patriotism, love for
Hong Kong and adherence to the basic law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group is discussing the
details of the takeover ceremony. "I believe that understanding
can be reached through consultation," he said. "It's not
problematic for the Chinese. Maybe some people in Britain's
political circle want the ceremony to be a grand one, over which
we have no disagreement. I hope the two sides make necessary
arrangements after consultations to make the ceremony both grand
and appropriate."

<P>
PARIS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Primo Nebiolo, president of the
world field and track's ruling body IAAF, wrote on Monday from the
Monte Carlo headquater to Michael Johnson to congratulate on his
200-meter world record.
</P>
<P>
The American shattered the oldest track and field record of
19.72 seconds set in 1979 by Italian Pietro Mennea, by clocking
19.66 at the United States Olympic trials on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He also won the 400m at the American trials in 43.44, just 0.15
second off the world mark that has stood since 1988.
</P>
<P>

<P>
SHANTOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- More than 500 people have been
trapped in Renshan, a town in Huidong County, Guangdong Province
because of several days of non-stop heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rains have brought down 47 houses in the town of
Daling, but no deaths or injuries have been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
County traffic police said that the rains, which started
several days ago and hit especially hard from the early hours of
this morning to 4:00 p.m., have caused a traffic jam more than 10
km long.
</P>
<P>
The line of stalled automobiles along Highway 324, a national
highway, is growing by the hour, said the police.
</P>
<P>
Other sources say that all hotels and guest rooms in the county
are full.
</P>
<P>
The county government reported that the massive storms have
caused flooding on 2,000 ha of farmland.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is eyeing edible oil market
of the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC)
and will export 30 million US Dollars of oil to South Africa
alone every year.
</P>
<P>
The Export Board of Zambia said in the latest Export News that
South Africa will be a net importer of edible oil from Zambia,
which, as a SADC member itself, will earn more from other SADC
member countries.
</P>
<P>
The export board said Zambia will, however, have to increase
the species to its oil's package as a way of making the industry
commercially viable.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier on Sino-US Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said that
China hopes to develop its ties with the United States on the
basis of three joint communiques signed between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China's principle for handling its relations with
the US, proposed by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, includes
increasing mutual trust, reducing problems, developing cooperation
and avoiding confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier made the remarks in Beijing during his
interview with Peter Montagnon, Asia editor of Britain's
"Financial Times," on June 7.
</P>
<P>
Li said China realizes that the US government and its people
are experiencing a heated debate over America's relations with
China. Despite differing opinions, the majority of people believe
that the US should have contact with China no matter who is
president or which political party is in power, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is encouraging that most US people believe
their country should adopt a policy of engagement with China,
rather than containment.
</P>
<P>
But there remain differences as well as common interests
between China and the US, and some Americans insist on
implementing containment to China, exerting pressure upon China on
some issues and interfering with China's internal affairs, the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Li said, China will stick to its principles and
will not give in.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Sino-US relations is the Taiwan issue, the
premier said. Relations between China and the US will improve and
develop if the US will strictly observe the three joint
communiques in practice, instead of in theory.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China hopes its relations with the US will advance
smoothly during this American presidential election year, and that
the two countries can resolve their differences through
consultations on equal footing.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China also hopes Sino-US trade and economic
cooperation will develop on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit, and that more US businesses will be involved in the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are not at fault for the failure of some US
businesses to enter the Chinese market, such as in the auto
industry, nuclear power stations and the Three Gorges project, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Based on their experiences with US partners, Chinese
businessmen have concluded that their cooperation with European
partners is less politically charged than it is with the United
States, which frequently claims it will exert sanctions on China,
thus politicizing the trade and economic ties, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese businessmen working with US partners often fear that
the US government might introduce a political element into trade
relations, resulting in their losses, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes this situation will change.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Papers Attack Cairo Arab Summit Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Leading Iraqi newspapers today
attacked the final communique issued Sunday at the end of the Arab
summit, which calls on Iraq, the only Arab state excluded from the
meeting, to be more peaceful toward its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic language daily al-Jumhuriya said in a front-page
editorial that the statement has adopted "the worst Zionist,
American, Kuwaiti and Saudi stands toward the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
The paper said that when the summit demands Iraq not follow an
aggressive course against its Arab neighbors, it failed to provide
any specific proof on this issue. Israel is the source of
aggression throughout the past 50 years, it noted.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war living in Iraq
after the 1991 Gulf war, the paper said it has become an issue
used to block the lifting of the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq
after its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
It said that some non-Arab foreign countries which took part in
the Gulf war against Iraq are more understanding toward the
suffering of the Iraqis than the Arabs which participated in the
Cairo summit.
</P>
<P>
It cited France, Russia, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, India and
Turkey as the non-Arab countries which have been demanding that
Iraq's cooperation with the U.N. should be rewarded by lifting the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra, organ of Iraq's ruling Baath Party, said that the
statement of the Arab summit failed to reconcile the Arab
countries which are believed to be divided following the 1990 Gulf
crisis and the statement actually gives in to the U.N. conception
hostile to the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> New Agreement Between Zimbabwe, IMF in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A bank said today Zimbabwe and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) could in August or September
start a three-year financing agreement to support the country's
second phase of economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
In a bulletin, Barclays Bank Zimbabwe Ltd. said recent public
statements confirming talks between the IMF and the Zimbabwe
government showed a new financing agreement is in sight.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, alarmed with Zimbabwe's high fiscal deficit, last
September suspended disbursement of balance-of-payments aid worth
about 100 million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Zimbabwe government has been implementing a
plethora of revenue-enhancing measures and a draconian
belt-tightening program so as to win back donor support and
launch the second phase of the economic structural adjustment
program (ESAP) starting this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank said it is now likely the new IMF financing program
will include less stringent conditions than the one which expired
last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank added while Zimbabwe has yet to announce details of
the second phase of the program, it is clear, however, a good
starting point will be to correct mistakes made during the first
phase which ended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Future economic growth will require much greater efficiencies
of public investment than have occurred in the past," it
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Tourism Earning Expected on Top in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is expected to earn 8.9
billion US dollars in 1998 in the tourism sector which will become
the country's number one foreign exchange earner, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile by the end of the seventh five-year development plan
or in the year 2005, foreign exchange earnings from the tourism
sector is expected to reach 15 billion US dollars, obtained from
arrivals of 11 million foreign tourists," said Minister for
Tourism, Post and Telecommunication Joop Ave at a meeting of heads
of district tourism services.
</P>
<P>
The number one position of foreign exchange earner at present
was still occupied by the oil and gas sector, followed by the
textile and timber sectors.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the tourism sector earned 5.2 billion US dollars of
foreign exchange through visits of 4.3 million foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
To attract more foreign tourists, the government should create
a conducive climate for investment in the tourism sector through
introducing a series of deregulation measures, quick services as
well as other facilities, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Urges Direct Contacts Across Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said that
there should be direct mail, trade, air and shipping services
between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the London-based "Financial Times" on
June 7, Li said that for now, to establish direct mail, trade, air
and shipping services is the common goal of people from both
Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwanese, especially figures in the industrial and
commercial circles, are eager to accomplish this, however, the
Taiwan authorities have avoided the issue by creating obstacles
that prevent direct contact between the two sides, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Such actions are harmful to economic and trade cooperation, and
are against the will of the people, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that China's basic policy of "Peaceful
reunification; and one country, two systems" has never changed in
regard to the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
The mainland cannot be held responsible for any single case of
tension between the two sides, Li said.
</P>
<P>
If only the Taiwan authorities really give up their attempt to
create "Two Chinas," "One China, One Taiwan," or the "Independence
of Taiwan," relations between the two sides across the Taiwan
straits will be improved and developed, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazil, reigning world soccer
champion, will have more to seek in the upcoming Atlanta Olympic
Games than its traditional event of soccer.
</P>
<P>
As four-time world soccer champion, the Brazilian men's soccer
team is tipped as a sure shot in the Olympics. But the big
Brazilian Olympic entourage, which was made up of 343 members,
including 225 athletes, will be proved to be strong gold
contenders in beach volleyball, women's basketball, men's and
women's volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's yachting team, who contributed all the medals of two
golds and one silver for the country in Barcelona four years ago,
is also expected to display more brilliant performance in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The rising judo squad, which consists of four under-20 judokas
among the seven athletes, might win four medals.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's 10 Atlanta-bound swimmers will also be medal hopefuls
in four or five events, men's 100m and 200m freestyle and 4X100m
medley.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has won a total of nine golds, 10 silvers and 20 bronzes
since it made its Olympic debut in 1920.

<HEADLINE> China Has Sound Investment Climate: Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
recently that China's investment environment has improved.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the London-based "Financial Times," Li
said that China will, under the guidance of its industrial policy,
continue to increase efforts in agriculture and other basic and
leading industries.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure construction has witnessed considerable
improvement, and both investment and consumption demands are
large, he said. Foreign investors have noticed the stable
investment climate in China, and are willing to direct their
financial backing to China, Li said.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has absorbed a total of 120 billion US dollars
of investment, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes foreign investment for infrastructure
construction, and also foreign cooperation for upgrading medium
and small-sized Chinese enterprises in the light and textile
industries, he said. Cooperation in the service industry has had a
good start and is expected to expand, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Premier advised foreign investors to continue to study the
Chinese market, saying this will help them invest wisely.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, Li said, real estate investors have
built many luxury hotels, office buildings and villas, and now
development in these areas far exceeds market demands.
</P>
<P>
Some markets, such as consumer electric appliances, have been
saturated.
</P>
<P>
However, certain industries have great investment demand; the
installation rate of telephones in China is under 5 percent, far
below that of developed and even some developing countries, Li
said. With an annual increase of 15 million phones, China's
telephone market is the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
China's electric power industry also shows great potential, and
the country has to add annually a generating capacity of 15
million kilowatts to meet the need of the economic growth, the
Premier noted.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China welcomes foreign companies to join it in the
exploration of both land and offshore oil, and that results can be
developed through joint investment. China also welcomes foreign
cooperation in transport and communications, he said.

<HEADLINE> British Computer Gives, Marks Exams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) - British scientists have developed a
computer "teacher" which can mark its own tests and award formal
qualifications, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Successful candidates are told by their personal computers that
they have passed and are awarded certificates from an official
examination board but never communicate with anyone other than
their computer screen, The Daily Telegraph reported today.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed by the Computer Skills College in
Lancashire, incorporates an apparently cheat-proof "marking disk,"
which records the performance of candidates at various tasks.
</P>
<P>
A group of teachers are taking the pilot course on basic
computer skills. At the end of the course, the disk sets a two-hour
exam, which it times and marks.
</P>
<P>
Candidates who pass send their disks and printouts for
validation to the City and Guilds examination board, which then
issues a certificate.
</P>
<P>
Though the technology is in its infancy, many experts and
teachers believe that future generations could take a range of
exams on computer, without the need for external markers.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Develop New Drug To Beat Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have developed a
new drug which can beat all strains of flu, a national newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"For it to be most effective, people will have to take it
within 24 to 48 hours of symptoms developing," the Daily Telegraph
quoted a spokeswoman for Glaxo-Wellcome, the British
pharmaceutical giant which developed the drug, as saying.
</P>
<P>
World-wide clinical trials of the drug have just been
completed, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The drug, codenamed GG167, targets a part of the virus that
does not mutate, an enzyme called neuraminidase, so that it
remains effective even after the virus mutates into a new strain.
</P>
<P>
People suspected of being infected with the flu virus will be
given a nasal spray.

<HEADLINE> India's Former PM Rao's Son Again Interrogated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Prabhakar Rao, son of India's
former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, was again interrogated
here today by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for his
involvement in the 39.70 million US dollars urea import scandal.
</P>
<P>
Prabhakar Rao had been interrogated by the CBI at its
headquarters here on June 15. He was allegedly one of the
recipients of kickbacks in the urea import fraudulent deal.
</P>
<P>
The entire 39.70 million dollars which had been paid in advance
were released by the New York branch of the State Bank of India
(SBI) in December last year and deposited in the Swiss bank, the
CBI sources said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the advance payment, not a gram of the 200,000 tons of
urea reached India. According to the contract for import of the
urea between National Fertilizers Limited and the Turkish firm
signed on October 31 last year, 75,000 tons of urea was to reach
India by April this year.
</P>
<P>
Prabhakar Rao has denied that he was involved in the urea
import scandal.
</P>
<P>
The United Front government headed by Deve Gowda is very
cautious over the issue, for its existence highly depends on the
support of the Congress Party headed by its president P.V.
Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties, however, have felt very strongly about
the urea scandal and condemned the former Rao government for its
corruption.

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chi, who is also defence minister, extended

domestic situation. China has political stability, economic
development, and ethnical unity, and military development that has
kept pace, he said.
</P>

General Karamat said that Pakistan has a tradition of friendly
relations with China and good cooperation between the two armies.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Production Up in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing output
increased 13.1 percent in April this year over the same period of
last year, the Economic Development Board (EDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
The machinery, petroleum and electronics industries recorded
high growth rates while the transport equipment industry
registered a decline, it said, adding that higher output during
the first four months of the year led to a cumulative growth of
14.3 percent over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The EDB said that the output of the machinery industry expanded
37.5 percent in response to the increased fabrication pace of oil
rigs and higher output of refrigerating equipment and specialized
machinery. For the first four months of 1996, the industry
achieved a high cumulative growth of 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry continued to be driven by strong demand
as reflected in its output increase of 24.4 percent over the same
period of last year. Cumulatively, output grew 12.8 percent in the
first four months of 1996 as the industry enjoyed greater demand
and higher prices for its products.
</P>
<P>
Output of the electronics industry continued to expand,
increasing 22.8 percent from the level a year ago. The industry
grew 24.1 percent in the first four months of this year, the EDB
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that growth was less strong in other industries, while
the transport equipment industry declined again in April as growth
in the aviation segment was offset by the slowdown in the marine
segment. Cumulatively, the industry's overall output in the first
four months shrank 1.4 percent due to the weak performance in the
marine industries, the EDB said.

<HEADLINE> China to Contribute More in Olympic Movement Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua/OANA) -- China will spare no efforts
to contribute more in the development of the Olympic movement,
said Wu Shaozu, president of the Chinese Olympic Committee and
head of the Chinese Olympic delegation.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Wu, Minister of the
Chinese State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, said on
Monday that China strictly adheres to the ideals and principles of
the Olympic movement and steadily abides by the Olympic Chapter.
</P>
<P>
And IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch also hailed China as
the most active and best rules-abiding member in the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the anniversary of the Olympic centenary, the 26th Olympic
Games is slated for July 19 in Atlanta with the participation of
nearly 10,000 athletes from all the 197 IOC members.
</P>
<P>
And China will dispatch a 495-member delegation for the success
of the Games through active participation and wide-range exchanges
with other members.
</P>
<P>
Our peaceful foreign policy and the aim of "promoting physical
culture and building up the people's health" is in line with the
Olympic ideals of "Peace, Friendship and Progress", said Wu.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, China carried out its open-door policy and returned to
the Olympic family in the following year.
</P>
<P>
Since then, China has reapt great successes in the sports and
achieved mutual understanding with the world through wide-range
international competitions and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
In the 30 years prior to 1978, China won only 30 world titles,
but accumulated a total of 926 world titles in the previous 17
years by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, the Chinese athletes and officials will continue to
pursue their efforts to achieve more in the competition events and
to strengthen friendship with all peoples in the world, said the
Chinese delegation chief.
</P>
<P>
In the recent years, the Olympic movement was smeared by doping
scandals time and again, but China has been in consistent in
adhering to the IOC anti-doping principle, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu said China carried out its "Three-S Policy" in May 1989,
namely "strict prohibition, strict examination and severe
punishment" to curb the doping issue, and the State Commission
also strictly implemented the policy in its preparation for the
Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, no positive case was reported for any Chinese
athlete in international meets, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In Atlanta, China will actively cooperate with the IOC and the
Organizing Committee to ensure a healthy and clean Olympics to
celebrate the centenary of the Olympic movement," said Wu.

LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- German captain Juergen Klinsmann
will definitely miss Wednesday's European championship semifinal
against England at Wembley after he tore a calf muscle in Sunday's
win over Croatia, reports reaching here said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Team spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said, "Klinsmann is 100
percent out of the England game. He has no chance."
</P>
<P>
Niersbach added that there is also little hope for the veteran
striker to play next weekend's final if the Germans go through.

<P>
Another striker Fredi Bobic, who suffered a serious shoulder
injury in Sunday's clash, would also be unable to play for the
rest of the tournament, Niersbach said.
</P>
<P>
Even before the Klinsmann and Bobic setbacks, the German squad
had been reduced to 20 after experienced defender Juergen Kohler
and midfielder Mario Basler went home with injuries earlier in the
tournament.

<HEADLINE> China to Keep Good Momentum for Development, Li Peng Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said that
China will certainly maintain its good momentum for development.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on June 7 at Zhongnanhai by Peter Montagnon, Asia
editor of Britain's Financial Times, Premier Li talked about
China's economic prospects, the Chinese government's stand on
entering the World Trade Organization (WTO), China's investment
environment, Sino-US relations, and the Taiwan and Hong Kong
issues.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question concerning China's economic prospects,
Li said, "Since China's reform and opening up 18 years ago, the
country's economic development has enjoyed a considerable rapid
growth with roughly an annual increase rate of about 9
percent. The issue has aroused concern from the foreign media, who
wondered whether China could maintain the growth rate. The answer
is certain and the objective could be reached.
</P>
<P>
"Last October," he said, "when I met with Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien and nine governors in Canada, I explained
in detail why China would continue its good economic growth. To
make it short, China has found a correct path for its development,
with a long-term stable political situation, fairly rich material
and technological foundation, enhanced comprehensive national
strength, a broad market and great need for investment and
consumption. What's more, the Ninth Five-Year-Plan and the
long-term objectives for the next 15 years will be a great
spiritual force for mobilizing the Chinese people in the
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"The above-mentioned documents mainly illustrate two shifts and
two strategies," the premier said. "The first shift is from the
traditional planned economy to the socialist market economy, which
has been underway for more than ten years, but is not yet
finished. China has adopted way of gradually changing and
constantly summing up its experiences so as to maintain a steady
political situation.
</P>
<P>
"The second shift is from extensive economic growth to
intensive. In other words, to change from emphasizing quantity to
stressing efficiency. To accomplish this, industrial structures
should be further adjusted, advanced technology should be widely
used, and consumption of energy and raw materials should be
reduced and resources rationally allocated.
</P>
<P>
"As for the two strategies, one represents the sustained
development which is discussed internationally. The other stresses
building up the country through technology and education, placing
more emphasis on education, science and technology, and developing
productivity through progress in science and technology, while
improving labor quality by enhancing education," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Conditions Ripe for China to Join WTO: Chinese Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said that
conditions are now ripe for China to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remark during his June 7 interview with
Peter Montagnon, Asia editor of Britain's Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
China has made repeated efforts in the past to re-join the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and is working diligently
for its acceptance into the WTO, and conditions are now ripe. The
problem now is when the WTO is going to accept China's application.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China never set a deadline for its WTO accession
because that is not up to China to decide. The WTO should make a
clear-cut decision on China's membership, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has reiterated it is willing to shoulder the obligations
necessary for membership, and it should receive its due rights,
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has lowered its import tariffs by 36 percent
this year -- something other countries may not have done.
</P>
<P>
And China has promised to further lower its import tariffs to
the average level of developing countries, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Despite its extensive efforts, China is still barred from the
World Trade Organization, Li said, adding that "we do not believe
it is only an economic issue, nor a trade issue."
</P>
<P>
China's accession has become a political issue, for certain
countries, out of their own political needs, try to hinder China's
entry into the WTO, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China will suffer if it cannot become a WTO member, but the WTO
also will suffer without China's involvement, the premier pointed
out. "As I once said in Paris not long ago, without China's
participation, the WTO is not qualified to be called the World
Trade Organization, and it's better for it to be renamed as the
regional trade organization."
</P>
<P>
Preventing China from joining the WTO can by no means hamper
the development of China's trade with foreign countries, because
China's sustained economic growth and huge market is a reality,
the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
China's purchase of a number of aircraft from the European
Airbus Industrial Corporation was made without the WTO's
permission, the premier cited.
</P>
<P>
Now the world's major aircraft producers have come to China to
compete for a share in the China market, Li said. These businesses
have never rejected China's orders because China is not a WTO
member, he said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)
market has sounded a warning to the Finance Ministry of India for
the market is being dominated by foreign institutional investors
(FII).
</P>
<P>
BSE President M. G. Damani told Finance Minister P. Chidambaram
in a pre-budget meeting here today that the trend on the BSE
market was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The recent spurt in the Bombay bourse has been caused by FII
buying in only a few stocks, official sources said here this
evening.
</P>
<P>
Damani has made it clear that the spurt in the BSE sensitive
index should not create the illusion of a buoyant market as it was
caused by concentrated and aggressive buying by FII in a few
scrips with a heavy weightage in the sensitive index.
</P>
<P>
"Our markets have virtually become FII-driven, which is
dangerous," he said.
</P>
<P>
To make the market more broad-based, all Indian investors,
whether resident or non-resident, should be treated on a par with
FII when taxing long-term capital gains, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Indian investors pay tax on such income at 20
percent against 10 percent paid by FII.
</P>
<P>
"If these FII come through the Mauritius route, they do not pay
any tax and hence many of them have adopted this route," Damani
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of the
Provisional Legislative Council is necessary and it has legal
basis, said Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong
Branch.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Time magazine last Saturday, Zhou said
that the establishment of the Provisional Legislative Council is
to fill the legislative vacuum in 1997 when the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is formed.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was the British authorities who derailed the
through train in Hong Kong as it acted against the Sino-British
Joint Declaration, the principle of Convergence with the Basic Law
and the agreements and understandings reached between the Chinese
and British sides.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Provisional Legislative Council will settle
many issues at the early period of the SAR, including the
issuance of the SAR passport and regulations governing the use of
the passport, the composition of the Court of Final Appeal and the
nomination of judges of the CFA and other courts.
</P>
<P>
He said that according to the Basic Law, there will be a Hong
Kong Basic Law Committee under China's National People's Congress,
and three members on the committee will have to be nominated by
Hong Kong's legislative organ.
</P>
<P>
"The Provisional Legislative Council is indispensable to the
Hong Kong SAR," Zhou Nan said.
</P>
<P>
As for the members of the Provisional Legislative Council, he
said that they will be elected by a selection committee.
</P>
<P>
He said personally he hoped that more than one-half of the
present sitting legislators can join the future Provisional
Legislative Council. But it is up to the selection committee to
decide, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat today warmly praised the success of the Arab
summit held in Cairo on June 22-23.
</P>
<P>
The elated Palestinian leader told reporters in Gaza this
morning that the Cairo summit, first in six years since 1990,
was very important and a very strong platform to recover Arab
unity and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The PA was given the reassertion of previous summit formulae
on the Palestinian cause. In the final communique, Arab leaders
endorsed creation of an independent Palestinian state with
East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The PLO executive committee and the PA are due to hold
a joint session in Gaza later today to discuss the outcome
of the Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will travel to Cairo Tuesday to hold talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and meet with visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher there.
</P>
<P>
A PA official said that Arafat will fly shortly after to
Damascus for talks with Syrian President Hafez Assad. During the
Cairo summit, Arafat met with Assad easing tensions between the
two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Syria had strongly criticized the PLO for signing Oslo peace
agreement with Israel in 1993 without prior consultations with
Arab allies.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in
Cairo. Gaddafi told reporters that during the meeting he and
Arafat "chatted and laughed".
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said, however, he would continue to expel thousands of
Palestinians from Libya "to contribute to their return to their
homeland... This is evidence of Libyan support."

<HEADLINE> Water Probe Halves Pollution Control Costs: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A new water quality inspecting
device could make it cheaper and easier to clean up contaminated
underground water, an Australian national water conference was
told today.
</P>
<P>
The sub-surface probe was developed by the Co-operative
Research Center for Waste Management and Pollution Control.
</P>
<P>
Chris Barber, a water scientist of the Commonwealth Science and
Research Organization (CSIRO), told The Australian newspaper that
the probe gave a continuous and accurate on-site picture of how
much pollutant was in ground water.
</P>
<P>
The probe could also help scientists to plan ways to use
naturally occurring microbes to break down organic chemicals, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The probe can be buried under pollution sources such as petrol
stations, refineries, chemical plants, dry cleaners and
electronics plants. It provides continuous readings on pollution
levels from beneath the water table.
</P>
<P>
There is no need to drill a well for water samples and to
analyze them in laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The measurements from the probe are accurate enough for people
to decide the mix and amount of microbes to be applied to
contaminated ground water. So there is no need to dig up the
polluted site before decontamination.
</P>
<P>
It can also monitor the oxygen levels in ground water, which is
vital to the level of activity of the microbes.
</P>
<P>
These advantages in combination would cut the costs of clean up
underground water by half, scientists said at the national
conference on water in Perth in Western Australia today.
</P>
<P>
Barber said that overseas buyers had already placed orders for
the probe.

ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
will pay a four-day official visit to Turkey this month at the
invitation of his Turkish counterpart Suleyman Demirel, Foreign
Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Akbel said that during his visit in Turkey between June 27 and
30, Gligorov and Demirel will hold talks on exchange of views on
bilateral ties and regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will discuss the possibility of further
developing trade and economic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
A Macedonian diplomat, who asked not to be named, told Xinhua
that no agreement will be inked during Gligorov's visit in Turkey
as Turkey and Macedonia signed some trade and economic agreements
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said that this will be a normal visit to Turkey by
the Macedonian president, and it is the second visit by Gligorov
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the second country to recognize Macedonia which
gained independence in 1991.

<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met with
Frank Shrontz, chairman of the Boeing Company of the United
States, and his party here today.
</P>
<P>
Li said China hopes that Sino-US relations will be improved and
developed and the two countries should reduce frictions and avoid
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
However, "certain policies" of the US government and "some
moves" of the US Congress are not conducive to the development of
Sino-US economic and trade relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this situation should change," Li said, adding
that he hopes the US business circles can exert their efforts to
this end.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the rapid growth of the Chinese economy in the
past decade has provided broad prospects for the development of
this country's civil aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there have been progress in the cooperation
between Boeing and China, expressing the hope that such mutually
beneficial cooperation on an equal basis will continue.
</P>
<P>
Shrontz, who chaired Boeing's board meeting in Beijing, said
that it is of "vital importance" to maintain normal relations
between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
He told Li that his company will continue to make efforts for
the development of US-China relations, particularly bilateral
economic and trade ties.

<P>
ATHENS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Greek prime minister Andreas
Papandreou, who died at 77 of heart attack Sunday morning, will be
buried in honor on Wednesday, according to the country's Interior
Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou, whose funeral is to be safeguarded by Greek
military servicemen, will be buried in Athens next to his father.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Greek people paid their last respect to the
country's veteran leader today, who founded the first Greek
socialist party -- Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou became prime minister in 1981, when he led his PASOK
to win the same year's parliamentary election. He continued his
post until 1989 thanks to his foreign policy of keeping distance
from the United States, which gained him great support from the
Greek people.
</P>
<P>
After four years out of the government, Papandreou returned to
power in 1993. He resigned because of his failing health, but
still held the presidency of the socialist party.
</P>
<P>
The PASOK party will hold a congress on Thursday to discuss the
post-Papandreou era issues such as electing a new party leader.

"On average, overseas-funded companies each require an
investment of 31 million dollars. Seven of them each involve an
investment of more than 100 million dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a park official, the Suzhou's park differs from
special economic zones and development zones in other parts of
China, due to its development style.
</P>
<P>
The park draws on Singapore's experience in managing a
world-famous industrial park, not the managerial expertise of a
single enterprise, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-Singaporean Suzhou Industrial Park Development
Company, which is responsible for developing the Suzhou Industrial
Park, was formed by the consortia of the two countries. The
Chinese consortium holds 35 percent of the company's shares and
the its Singaporean colleague the rest.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean consortium consists of 19 major companies with
shares controlled by the Singaporean government, as well as a
number of multi-national companies, such as the Samsung Company of
the Republic of Korea and Japan's Mitsubishi Company.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese consortium is composed of nine major state-owned
companies, including the China National Cereals, the Oils and
Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation, the China National
Chemical Import and Export Corporation, the Huaneng Group, the
China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company and the China Great Wall
Industry Corporation, as well as the Jiangsu Provincial Investment
Company and ten state-owned companies in Suzhou.

has spent 72 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Singaporean partners have recently invested an
additional 300 million dollars in the park.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an international consortium composed of financial
institutions in France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea,

to the park.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Singaporean Deputy Prime

Coordination Council of the Suzhou Industrial Park. Singapore's
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, President Ong Teng Cheong and Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong have supported joint development projects
in the park.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government views the park as a major component of
the strategy for creating the Pudong New Area in Shanghai and
developing the Yangtze River Valley. It has been providing special
support to the construction of the park.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Zhang Xinsheng, the park will be completed

</P>
<P>
Suzhou's park, the only park in China to be operated according

HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- After 1997, political

He pointed out that according to the Sino-British Joint

legislative-led. Even if one party wins a majority of seats in the
Legislative Council, it has no right to form the government."

"Hong Kong will be a special administrative region, not an
independent state. This particular system is quite different from
that of the Western countries," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> India to Raise Petroleum Price Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
expected to raise prices of petroleum products in a bid to make up
its losses.
</P>
<P>
The enhancement has become imperative in the light of the
growing deficit on the oil pool account. The deficit, which
aggregated 40 billion rupees (1.2 billion US dollars) in early
February, has now risen to 65 billion rupees (1.9 billion US
dollars), largely because of the ballooning subsidy on kerosene
and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The price increases are likely to be carried out after the
scheduled meeting of Prime Minister Deve Gowda and chief ministers
on July 3-4.
</P>
<P>
Gowda has held discussions over the past few days with Finance
Minister P. Chidambaram on the proposed rise in administered
prices. The discussion dwelt on the timing of the price increase
to soften the political fallout, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The government is reported to have preferred the traditional
route of raising administered prices before the budget
presentation to minimize the impact of a harsh budget on public
opinion.

ADDIS ABABA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Telecommunications
Authority announced here today that Ethiopia and Djibouti have
agreed to have direct telephone exchange via Dire Dawa.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued today, the authority said the
project which links Addis Ababa and other major Ethiopian towns
with Djibouti will cost 980,000 U.S. Dollars. The fund for the
execution of the project was secured from the European Investment
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The release said, the project is meant to foster better
relations and commercial links with neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
To date, Ethiopia has been exchanging telephones via Dessie-
Assab Port which is inefficient due to old-age service and
exorbitant spare costs.
</P>
<P>
The release said the project planned to be finalized in a
year's time is also helpful to have a direct call to countries
like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Singapore.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- An international youth exchange
program will enable two groups of Hong Kong young people to
broaden their horizon by going to Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
One delegation comprising six members aged between 18 and 24
will start a three-week visit to Britain at the end of this month,
as part of the Exchange Program between Hong Kong and Britain,
which has been carried out since 1979.
</P>
<P>
The other group of 10 young people will go to Germany in the
middle of next month, a new journey added to the Program this
year.
</P>
<P>
Those who are going to Britain will visit youth organizations,
schools and universities, touch on social issues and take part in
recreational activities. In Germany, Hong Kong youth will live
with local families to gain insight into German culture and life
style.
</P>
<P>
Eric Li, chairman of the Hong Kong Commission on Youth said
today that the program is aimed to broaden the outlook of young
people of Hong Kong and help them to exchange ideas and
experiences with youth of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The 16 young delegates were chosen from 100 nominees of various
youth organizations and government departments, said Li.
</P>
<P>
On a reciprocal basis, young people from Britain and Germany
will visit Hong Kong in July 1997. "It is a good chance to
introduce the Special Administrative Region to our friends abroad
when Hong Kong returns to China in 1997," said the chairman.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that his country will, as always, work for friendly
relations and cooperation with all its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Pakistan's chief of army staff, General
Jehangir Karamat, Li said the relations between China and Pakistan
have been growing smoothly over the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
No matter how the international situation changes, he said,
Sino-Pakistani friendly relations remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted, the armed forces of the two countries
"have maintained good cooperative relations" and their military
leaders have had a frequent exchange of visits. This has laid a
solid basis for the continued growth of friendly relations between
the two armed forces, he added.
</P>
<P>
China, pursuing a good-neighborly foreign policy, hopes to have
a favorable surrounding environment, Li said. China will continue
to strive for friendly relations with all its neighboring
countries including Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Karamat told Li that the Pakistan government and people and
their armed forces attach great importance to the friendly
relations with China and always count on China as a trustworthy
friend.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Pakistan-China friendship will be
further consolidated and developed through the joint efforts of
both sides.
</P>
<P>
The current China visit by Karamat is his first trip abroad
since he became Pakistan's chief of army staff.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Copper Output Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's copper output dropped in
April with a low record of 25,000 tons compared with March's
32,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The figure was revealed by the latest fortnightly statistics
report of the Bank of Zambia (BOZ) available here today.
</P>
<P>
The April figure represents the lowest for the year so far
with the exception of January which had about 24,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The production of cobalt in April was also the worst recorded
for the year. It stood at 398 tons compared to March with 458
tons produced.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) has in
recent years suffered a rapid decline in copper production, but
has also lost out on the worldwide increase in copper prices
because of the low copper levels it produces.
</P>
<P>
The ZCCM has in recent years faced liquidity problems because
of the low copper production levels resulted from the obsolete
equipment the company uses in its mining production.

<HEADLINE> Australian Building Workers Go on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 100,000 building
workers in Australia went on strike today to protest against the
federal government's decision to remove a tax exemption from their
travel allowances, according to a press release received here.
</P>
<P>
Building workers in all states of the country except Queensland
and Victoria took part in the 24-hour strike aimed at forcing the
government to overturn its decision.
</P>
<P>
The strike followed the national action on May 29 when
thousands of unionists took to the streets in all states to
protest against the government, and workers have vowed to continue
their protests.
</P>
<P>
Building unions said that the removal of the tax exemption will
cost each worker up to 30 Australian dollars (about 23 US dollars)
a week, and making the allowance taxable from the start of the
1995-96 financial year would mean that workers would have to repay
1,000 to 1,500 Australian dollars (770 to 1,155 US dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union hailed
today's 24-hour stoppage as "an overwhelming success" while the
New South Wales branch of Master Builders Australia said today's
strike would cost the national economy millions of dollars in lost
production.
</P>
<P>
The press release said, Queensland building workers will stop
work for 24-hour tomorrow, as today was a rostered day off.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Criticizes Amnesty International's Annual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Amnesty International's 1996 annual
report on human rights is flawed and one-sided, a statement issued
by Turkey's Foreign Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Turkey is surprised and disappointed
to find itself again the target for unfair accusations by
Amnesty International, adding that the Amnesty International's
annual report gives a distorted and defective picture of the human
rights situation in Turkey in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report fails to take adequate account of changes in Turkey
during 1995 and simply repeats allegations it made in previous
years. It makes no mention of the constitutional and all legal reforms
that Turkey carried out last year in a bid to enhance human
rights, the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
It added that Amnesty has again brushed aside the fact that
Turkey has a functioning parliamentary democracy and terrorists
are trying to undermine it by force.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty plays down terrorist violence but exaggerates alleged
abuses by the forces of law and order, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Amnesty fails to make it sufficiently clear that
violence can never be a legitimate instrument in the pursuit of
human rights. Indeed, some people reading this report could get
the impression that Amnesty believes violence can be a legitimate
instrument, the statement said.

<P>
KHARTOUM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omer el Bashir
has described his meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak during the recent Cairo Arab summit as turning over a new
page in the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This came in press statements made by the Sudanese president
on his return home from Cairo Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"We explained to him (Mubarak) the implications of the
assassination attempt he experienced (in Addis Ababa), told him
that none of those who are suspected of being involved in that
attempt is in Sudan and assured him that Sudan had no hand in that
attempt," President Bashir said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Cairo Arab summit was pervaded by a spirit of
cordiality, that there was a determination to bring the summit to
a success and that the summit was a prelude to form joint Arab
action intended to maintain the rights of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been strained after
Egypt accused Sudan of supporting terrorism and plotting to
assassinate Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in June 1995. Sudan
has denied the accusations.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese boat people
transit camp in Malaysia will be closed tomorrow when the
scheduled last batch of 22 Vietnamese boat people leave Sungai
Besi camp for home.

<P>
Assistant Secretary General of the Malaysian Red Crescent

Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysia's national news agency Bernama, Malaysian
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi will attend a brief
ceremony at the camp where the UNHCR flags will be lowered to
officially mark its closure.
</P>
<P>

people from Malaysia, 9,592 boat people have been repatriated to
their home country under the Orderly Repatriation Program (ORP).
</P>
<P>
The repatriation process has been speeded up with the use of
ships to send 721 Vietnamese boat people earlier this year.

HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Experts from the two sides on
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) today reached consensus
on the principles for drafting Hong Kong's budget for fiscal year
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing on the ninth JLG experts meeting on Hong
Kong budget for the transition period, Chen Zuo'er, Chinese JLG
representative, said that both sides also reached consensus on the
work mode of the drafting and the approval procedures.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that he hoped the two sides would continue to
cooperate so as to ensure a smooth transition for this particular
budget.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, after discussions at previous three experts
meetings, the 36th JLG plenary meeting in London early this month
and the experts discussions over the past two days, the two sides
reached some consensus and entered a phase of joint drafting.
</P>
<P>
He said that the future government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) enjoys a high degree of autonomy and
the Hong Kong SAR government will draft the budget by itself. The
central government will not participate in it, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes as long as the two sides continue to make
concerted efforts in the spirit of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, there will be a smooth
transition for the particular budget.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Official Optimistic on HK's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said he is very optimistic about
Hong Kong's future after 1997.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Time magazine last weekend, Zhou said that
he believes that the principle of "one country, two systems" will
be fully implemented, and Hong Kong will become increasingly
prosperous and stable.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said a recent opinion poll showed that the great majority
of people in Hong Kong are optimistic about its continued
stability and prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
A large number of foreign firms including those from the United
States have increased their investments and more than 800 regional
headquarters or foreign offices have been opened in Hong Kong in
the past five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hong Kong needs the Chinese mainland and vice
versa.
Hong Kong had been a free port for over 100 years, but in quite a
long time, it was not prosperous. Hong Kong's prosperity in the
past two or three decades benefited from China's reforms and
opening.
</P>
<P>
He said that China needs Hong Kong as a window and a bridge to
the outside world and its determination to implement the principle
of "one country, two systems" confirms to its fundamental
interests.
</P>
<P>
He said, "How can you imagine the Chinese people doing anything
unfavorable to China's interests?"
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's transition, Zhou said, "I do not foresee much
trouble because all conditions are favorable. If there is any
trouble, it won't be the making of China."
</P>
<P>
He noted that he is confident of Hong Kong's transition,
adding, "Let us witness together the concept of 'one country, two
systems' becoming a reality."

<P>
This was disclosed by defendant Choo Young-bock, former defense
minister, when responding to cross-examination by his defense
attorney at the 16th trial session on mutiny and treason.
</P>
<P>
Charges of mutiny and treason were made against Chun Doo-hwan
and his successor Roh Tae-woo as well as some former high-ranking
officers at the Seoul District Court here today.
</P>
<P>
"Then Martial Law Commander Lee Hui-sung reported to me that he
had consulted with Chun Doo-hwan prior to replacing CATC Commander
Yun Hung-jyong with So Joon-yeol," Choo testified.
</P>
<P>
At today's trial session, defense attorneys finished cross
examining four defendants involved in the 1980 crackdown, which
happened in Kwangju, capital of the country's South Cholla
Province.
</P>
<P>
During the session, prosecutors presented more than 1,000
pieces of evidence related to the incident.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers, who did not present any evidence of their
own, objected to most of the evidence submitted by the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen former South Korean army officers including Chun and
Roh have been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges respectively stemmed from their
roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the
brutal suppression of the Kwangju uprising on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980 and ruled the nation until
February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in February
1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted for graft since they received illegal funds
from businessmen while in office.

<HEADLINE> Zhou Nan Expects More Cooperation from British Side </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua
News Agency Hong Kong Branch, said that he expects more
cooperation from the British side in the remaining days before
Hong Kong's handover.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Time magazine last week, Zhou said that
the Sino-British relations have been improving in the past year
and this momentum should be continued.
</P>
<P>
He said if the two sides stand higher and look farther into the
next century, they will find that they have many common interests.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I am still nostalgic about my many happy moments as
leader of the Chinese delegation from 1982 to 1984 when China and
Britain negotiated over the Hong Kong issue."
</P>
<P>
"We had quarrels and differences, but all those have been
settled in the spirit of mutual understanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Honestly, when I was first sent to Hong Kong from Beijing, I
was expecting very cordial and friendly cooperation with my
counterpart. I did not expect their change of mind and policy."
</P>
<P>
But, he said, that is in the past. "Let's look forward to the
future. It my sincere hope that in the 300 or so days before Hong
Kong's handover we will have less trouble with the British and
more cooperation. I hope a happy beginning will lead to a happy
ending, although in between there may be twists and turns."

NEW DELHI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The Indian parliament's budget
session is scheduled to start on July 10 and the general budget
for 1996-97 is likely to be presented to the House on July 19,
said an official announcement here today.
</P>
<P>
Subject to exigencies of the government business, the session
of Lok Sabha (lower house) and Rajya Sabha (upper house) will last
over two months.

<P>
As usual, the union budget should be presented to the
parliament for debate and approval before the financial year (from
April 1 to March 31) starts. The beginning date of the 1996-97
financial year has been delayed due to the just concluded 11th Lok
Sabha general elections and the formation of the United Front
government.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister P. Chidambararam has been busy preparing the
new union budget in the past few days through meeting
representatives from various economic and business circles.
</P>
<P>
The new budget is expected to fully reflect the new
government's minimum common program (MCP), which adopts a dual
track strategy to continue economic reforms and enhance social
justice and welfare.

<HEADLINE> Zhou Nan on Foreign-owned Business in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign businesses in Hong Kong
will never be forced to cooperate with or sell stakes to
China-funded enterprises, said Zhou Nan, director of Xinhua News
Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Time magazine last week, Zhou said, "There
have not been such practices in the past, nor will there be in the
future."
</P>
<P>
He said that some foreign-owned enterprises are willing to
cooperate with China-funded enterprises. The deals are just of
their own accord and no one is forcing them to do so.
</P>
<P>
He said that now the China-funded enterprises only make a small
proportion in various sectors in Hong Kong and it is impossible
for them to take a dominant role in Hong Kong's economy in future.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is China's consistent policy to enhance
Hong Kong's role as an international financial center, trading
center, shipping center and information center.
</P>
<P>
He said he wishes both foreign-owned and local Chinese-owned
business would achieve greater development after 1997.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that the Chinese government will continue to restrict
the establishment of companies from Chinese inland provinces and
cities in future.
</P>
<P>
"As for the China-funded enterprises in Hong Kong, they must
abide by Hong Kong's laws and the capitalist 'rule of game'," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that after 1997, there will be no privileges for
foreign-owned enterprises, nor will there be discrimination
against them.
</P>
<P>
He said he is sure that Hong Kong will provide a better
environment for foreign investment in future.

<HEADLINE> 4 Killed in Anti-Government Demonstration in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 24 (Xinhua) -- About four people were killed in
Rawalpindi, twin city of Islamabad, this morning when members of
Jamaat-i-Islami marched towards the capital to protest against the
Pakistani government's budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources told Xinhua that paramilitary troops have been
called in and they tear-gased the demonstrators, who threw stones
to the troops in return.
</P>
<P>
The route between the twin cities has been totally cut off
since this morning by paramilitary troops to prevent the
protesters from marching into the capital and planning a sit-in
demonstration in front of the prime minister' secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the situation in Rawalpindi was very tense.
</P>
<P>
The government presented the budget for the fiscal year of July
1996 to June 1997 this month, suggesting the heaviest tax
collection in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz Group), the main opposition,
called for a country-wide strike Sunday against the budget, which
received good response from the business community.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaat-i-Islami, a religious political party and
opposition, called for a sit-in demonstration in the capital today

<HEADLINE> Okinawa Base Referendum Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Okinawa prefectural
government today announced a referendum to ask local residents
whether or not they support a reduction in U.S. bases in Japan's
southernmost island prefecture.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government also set up a special task force for
the referendum, which was voted for last week by the prefectural
assembly, Kyodo news service said.
</P>
<P>
The 13-member task force comprises three groups, one each to
take charge of public relations, coordination with local
governments, and general affairs, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The bill for a special ordinance for the referendum was
proposed by the Okinawa branch of the Japanese Trade Union
Confederation (Rengo), Japan's largest labor organization,
following a petition backed by 34,500 signatures for the
residential vote, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is the first of the kind in a prefecture.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of all land used by the U.S. military in Japan
is concentrated in Okinawa Prefecture, although the island
prefecture makes up only 0.6 percent of Japan's total land area.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached in April between Japan and the
United States, the U.S. military will vacate some 20 percent of
the land it now occupies in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Defense Facilities Administration Agency asked
Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota to carry out the legal procedure for
forced rental of land in Okinawa for U.S. forces in place of the
heads of local governments who have refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
The request came after the heads of nine of the 10 cities,
towns and villages concerned refused to conduct the procedure
required to secure forced land rental contracts after the current
ones expire in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Ota, who himself has refused to cooperate with the central
government on forced land leasing in Okinawa for U.S. bases, is
expected to give the agency the cold shoulder, according to the
Kyodo report.
</P>
<P>
A public campaign was kicked off to press for a reduction in
the U.S. military base in Okinawa after a Japanese school girl was
raped in September last year by three American GIs based in the
island prefecture.

</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index rose 3.1 points to 2,258.7 points.

lackluster trade today. The all resources index dropped by 8.2

firmer against major currencies today.

The Australian dollar ended at 78.95 US cents from 78.93 US

<P>
It was also firmer against the Japanese yen, ending at 86.11

But the Australian dollar weakened to 1.2010 mark against the

</P>
<P>
However, local traders said that the Australian currency was
still greatly affected by copper prices and the US dollar's
exchange rate against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Aussie dollar would meet strong resistance
if it went up to 79 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Demand for the currency by Australian exporters supported the

<HEADLINE> HK Residents to Enjoy More Democracy, Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residents will enjoy
more democracy and freedom, not less, than in the past, said Zhou
Nan, director of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Time Saturday, Zhou said that the Basic
Law has given adequate guarantees to such questions as freedom of
the press, human rights and democracy, so there is no need to
worry about this.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past more than 100 years Hong Kong has been
ruled by the British Governor, and there was absolutely no
democracy to speak of. It was after the signing of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration that the question of introducing
democracy in Hong Kong began to be considered.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there is an Article 23 in the Basic Law,
which bans any act of treason, secession, sedition and subversion
against the central government. There is nothing strange about it,
he stressed, because articles of this kind can be found in the
laws of any sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the freedom of assembly in Hong Kong after 1997,
Zhou said that the Basic Law has also given clear guarantees that
Hong Kong people will not have restrictions on freedom of
assembly. On this point the future Special Administrative Region
(SAR) will enact laws on its own to implement the requirements and
spirit of Article 23 of the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"We should have full confidence in the wisdom of the Hong Kong
people," he said, adding that Hong Kong people have demonstrated
such wisdom in the management of the economy, and they can do as
well in the management of the politics.

<HEADLINE> China Developed Vehicle-Carried GPS Guiding System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ordinary-looking station wagon was driven in China's
capital one summer day, unnoticed by motorists on the crowded
highways. It sped along the road, and skillfully zigzagged in and
out of crowded lanes.
</P>
<P>
Wherever it went, the vehicle's route was followed: on a
computer notebook in the front of the car, a black cross
indicating the wagon's location moved along a map on the screen,
pinpointing the vehicle's position, speed, direction, mileage,
driving time, date and time.
</P>
<P>
The test-drive was the first on-the-spot check of a vehicle
using global positioning system (GPS), a satellite guiding system
developed by the China Research Institute of Surveying and Mapping.
</P>
<P>
"The system can be put into wide use in such fields as public
security, bank note transportation, and navigation to carry out
motion monitoring," said Ma Yu, deputy director of the Research
Development Department of the institute.
</P>
<P>
GPS has been tested over hundreds of kilometers, and has been
proved to have precise positioning and a strong anti-interference
ability.
</P>
<P>
"Our next step is to get rid of the computer notebook to make
it still more practical," said Ma Yu.
</P>
<P>
He added that the institute began to develop the system in
1992, and its technological level has reached the advanced world
standards.
</P>
<P>
"We will focus on developing more practical software in the
next stage. Finally we will apply wireless communication
facilities to the system to make it a comprehensive monitoring
management system for moving targets," Ma said.

LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major will tell parliament
members Monday that the European Union ban on British beef exports
across the world should be lifted completely "within months."
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government may abolish the Post Office's
monopoly in letter delivery if little sign emerges in the coming
days of an end to strike action by postal workers.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister John Major is under growing pressure
from senior conservatives to replace Douglas Hogg as agriculture
minister in government reshuffle next month.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The German government is now working actively to undermine
British Prime Minister John Major, and believes that Europe must
wait for Tony Blair to take over Major's position before progress
can be made on European cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain and its Europe Union (EU) partners are resigned to
the prospect of further friction, despite the weekend agreement on
lifting the beef ban, as both sides do battle over the future of
the 15-nation body.

<HEADLINE> Cause of Chinese Explorer's Death Disclosed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Dehydration and extreme
temperatures killed a Chinese explorer who was walking through
northwest China's Lop Nur desert.
</P>
<P>
Yu Chunshun, 48, was found dead in his tent by a rescue team on
June 18, five days after his fellow explorers lost contact with
him.
</P>
<P>
The medical examiner who autopsied Yu's body believed that the
explorer died of sudden dehydration and exhaustion during his trek
through the excessive heat. He did not have a water supply.
</P>
<P>
The examiner said Yu died around June 13, when the desert
temperature exceeded 40 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Experts have excluded starvation or sandstorm as causes of
death, because a bag half-full of dried beef was found beside him,
and his tent would have protected him from sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
Yu entered the Lop Nur desert, located in the southeastern part
of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, alone at 8:30 A.M. on
June 11, carrying with him a two-day supply of water and food.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his death, he had completed a journey to the ruin of
ancient Loulan City, accompanied by five cameramen and two local
guides.
</P>
<P>
Yu's remains were buried on June 18 at the place where he
died. A memorial was held Saturday in Korla, a city west of Lop
Nur. It was attended by local residents and members of Yu's
family, who came from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Yu Jinshan, the explorer's father, announced that a memorial
donation of 100,000 yuan (about 12,000 US dollars), collected from
his son's life insurance benefits, will be used to establish a
foundation that will provide support to travelers and explorers in
need of financial assistance.

<HEADLINE> UAE Media Hail Outcome of Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Some United Arab Emirates (UAE)
newspapers today carried editorials hailing the success of the
outgoing pan-Arab summit in bringing the Arabs together and
boosting their solidarity.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab summit succeeded in enhancing Arab solidarity, getting
over sensitivities and putting the strategic peace option in its
proper place so there may be no surrendering of Arab rights or
bargaining over Arab security," Al-Fajr newspaper said in its
editorial today.
</P>
<P>
"The summit was distinguished by its objective analysis of the
present conditions in the Middle East, avoided emotion in
decision-making and brought the international community, especially
the co-sponsors of the peace process, face to face with its
responsiblities," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Bayan" newspaper also said that the meeting of Arab leaders
for the first time in six years is in itself an achievement
for the Arab nation at the summit, which ended in Cairo Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that the Arab leaders made public statements
underlining the necessity of pushing forward joint action, thus
providing maximum guarantees for maintaining Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
"Al-Khalij" newspaper said that the Cairo summit scored a
brilliant success, and that its call for bringing the Arabs
together met with immediate response.

<HEADLINE> School Bullying Discussed at Tokyo Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 24 (Xinhua) -- School bullying is being discussed
at an international symposium held here in Tokyo, according to a
Kyodo News Service report Monday.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Norway, Britain, the Netherlands and Australia
with some 300 teachers and board-of-education members from across
Japan are attending the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry, sponsor of the symposium, hopes to
learn from the experiences and measures taken in other countries
on the problems that have plagued the Japanese school system for
years, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Dan Olweus from the University of Bergen in Norway started the
symposium by delivering a report on his 20 years of research on
the problems, including his survey 13 years ago triggered by the
suicides of three children.
</P>
<P>
Olweus' survey that covered 130,000 children showed many
parents and teachers were not aware of bullying at school, and his
proposals to prevent further tragedies have helped reduce bullying
cases to 50-70 percent of the former figures.
</P>
<P>
Bullying has become a serious issue in schools in Japan, with
several bullying victims committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
Peter Smith from the University of London, Josine Jungertas
from the Netherlands' Leiden University and Phillip Slee from
Flinders University of South Australia also delivered papers at
the symposium. They were joined by Yoji Morita, a professor at
Osaka City University.

<HEADLINE> Heaviest Fighting Breaks Out in Somalia in Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were killed and
37 others wounded when heavy fighting erupted in Somalia between
the militiamen of General Mohamed Aidid and those of his clan
rival Osman Hassan Ali Atto at K-7 junction last night.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was the heaviest in the last two months. Tens of
stray mortars landed in the district of Hamar Jadid of South
Mogadishu, killing and wounding a number of civilians at their
houses, local radios reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
The intensity of the fighting has eased a little since late
last night, but heavy shellings continued into this morning, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was ignited when the militiamen supporting Osman
Atto attacked the strategic point of K-7 which was controlled by
the militiamen of General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The junction has fallen into the hands of Osman Atto's men
after an hour of fierce fighting. As K-7 junction links Mogadishu
with the southern regions of Somalia, Mogadishu has been isolated
from the rest of the southern regions after last night's
fighting.
</P>
<P>
South Mogadishu Radio supporting Osman Atto claimed that the
self-proclaimed group, a term they usually refer to the
government of General Aidid, attacked their militia bases on four
fronts.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoting a militia operation spokesman as saying
their forces have repulsed the attack, inflicting upon them heavy
losses, adding that the strategic road linking Mogadishu to the
southern regions is now safe and open to all civilian traffic
without any sort of levy.
</P>
<P>
There's no word from the government of General Aidid over the
fighting. However, his radio said General Aidid has held a
meeting with the militia commanders of his government on the
security situation of the war-torn capital of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The residents here have experienced the fourth day of heavy
shellings in South Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Oppose Election Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 23 (Xinhua) -- "Serbian Republic of
Bosnia-Herzegovina" Prime Minister Gojko Klickovic said today that
Bosnian Serbs oppose any delay of the election scheduled for
September this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for the election, which, we assure, will be held
in the air of democracy in the Serb area," said Klickovic at Radio
Kragujevac in the Bosnian Serb republic.
</P>
<P>
Serbs would make the election a fair play and provide enough
chances for foreign journalists to cover and observers to
supervise the event, said Klickovic.
</P>
<P>
The September election was set by the Dayton peace agreement
last year, which ended more than three years of the bloodshed in
the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also urged the Bosnian Muslims to
participate in the election without raising any new conditions so
as to show their good faith in implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The coming election is of great significance, during which
people living in Bosnia will elect such organizations as the
federal departments for the new government, parliament, presidium
and constitutional court, said Klickovic.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Test New Anti-Rocket System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli Defense
Ministry researcher has said that the Nautilus laser anti-rocket
system will be arriving in Israel from the U.S. for tests before
it is set up in the North to eventually serve as protection
against Katyushas.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post quoted Uzi Elan, head of the ministry's
Weapons Research and Development Division, as saying that "the
Nautilus system seems to us to be the most promising defense
system against Katyushas."
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, pro-Iranian Hezbollah militants had
fired quite a few number of Katyushas rockets from Lebanon into
northern Israeli towns and villages, as well as the Israeli
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army had carried out several major military
operations, including the Operation Grape of Wrath in last April,
against Hezbollah targets, but so far it has failed to stop the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Elan said that the Nautilus system, developed as a joint
American-Israeli project, will be "an expensive system," and the
prototype will cost tens of millions of U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gilad Ramot, head of the Anti-Aircraft Corps, said
that at present, the shooting down of Katyushas is the main aim
of the Nautilus system.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that possibly in the future other uses will
be found for the system, including shooting down planes and
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Jerusalem Post quoted an Israeli
army officer as saying that progress has been made in the
project of the Arrow anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
"Following intelligence information we have received, we have
made changes in the Arrow missile," said the officer.
</P>
<P>
"The total cost of the Arrow program is similar to that of a
fighter plane," the officer said, adding that several countries
have expressed interest in the Arrow, and that Britain is
examining it now.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Issue New Foreign Investment Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 24 (Xinhua)-- Vietnam will issue a new foreign
investment law next year, Minister of Justice Nguyen Dinh Loc said
today.
</P>
<P>
The English "Vietnam News" quoted the minister as saying that
his ministry is working on the law together with other relevant
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The new law, which will be regionally more competitive, will
replace the existing law introduced in 1987 that has been
subjected to over 100 adjustments in the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
The drawing up of a new foreign investment law was necessary
for Vietnam to overcome the shortfalls of the current law which
requires so much alteration to suit the nation's development
needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The new law was also necessary to facilitate the attraction of
more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's poor infrastructure and current level of expertise
needed an investment law that could more easily attract foreign
investment for the production of raw materials like cement and
steel.
</P>
<P>
Next year's new law would also be a transit step to bring both
the law on foreign investment and that on domestic investment
closer, the minister added.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Three million domestic and overseas
visitors have visited Shaanxi History Museum since it opened five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi, the birthplace of the Chinese nation, now has 37
cultural relics under state protection, more than any other
provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
A celebration recently was held to mark the museum's fifth
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
To better protect these historical relics, the Chinese
government invested 144 million yuan to construct the museum on
the Xiaozhai East Road, one kilometer northwest of the
famous Dayan Pagoda in Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese leaders Jiang Zemin, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu
Rongji and Hu Jintao have visited the museum since it was opened
to the public on June 20, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The museum covers 65,000 square meters and has a floor space of
56,000 sq m. The building consists of a reception hall, lecture
hall, waiting rooms, a parking lot and handicapped-accessible
elevators. Multi-language services are available for visitors.
</P>
<P>
The museum has an 11,000 sq m exhibition hall, where more than
3,000 cultural relics selected from more than 370,000 pieces are
displayed.
</P>
<P>
Exhibits include bronze, gold, silver and jadeware, pottery
figurines, coins and porcelain products, and mural paintings
unearthed from the tombs of the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Cultural
relics from various dynasties also are on display.

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Arab Summit Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran today welcomed the results of
the two-day Arab summit which concluded Sunday in Cairo, Egypt,
thereby having changed its previous skeptical attitude into a
positive one.
</P>
<P>
Hossein Sheikholeslan, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for
Afro-Arab Affairs, said that the Arab summit has opened a new
chapter in the history of struggle against occupation and
aggression in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, the deputy foreign minister criticized the Arab
summit for incorporation into the final communique of allegations
against Iran by accusing it of being involved in the Bahraini
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed the summit for supporting the United Arab Emirates'
(UAE) claims that its three islands have been occupied by Iran in
the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran at first doubted very much about the success of the Cairo
summit, claiming that each Arab country wwas pursuing its own
interest in the two-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The deputy foreign minister said that "the active participation
of 21 Arab leaders in a summit with an agenda aimed at finding a
united Arab stand vis-a-vis the Zionist regime indicates that a
new political will is emerging."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Morteza Sarmadi also said "from
Iran's point of view the summit was positive because it seems the
Arab countries have realized the sinister goals of the Zionist
entity and abandoned their unwarranted optimism."
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the holding of the Arab summit, the Iranian
foreign ministry asked the Arab countries to make all efforts to
confront the expansionist policies of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sarmadi said that the Arab summit held after a long interval
was a "positive step", especially in view of the Israeli
atrocities in Palestine and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed the importance of solidarity between the
Arabic and Islamic worlds vis-a-vis the aggression of Israel and
its continued occupation of Arab lands, saying that Iran was ready
to help realize stability in the region and to coordinate the
confrontation against the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Netanyahu's policy statements, Sheikholeslam said
"Today, it is clear to all governments in the region that Israel
does not honor its international commitments. Hence, all regional
governments are under pressure from their people to take a firm
stand in the face of the Israeli aggressions."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman regretted that efforts were underway in some
quarters to weaken the anti-Israeli front, and dismissed the
accusations that Iran was interfering with the internal affairs of
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the Bahrain government would adopt proper policies to
promote peace and tranquility in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
As to UAE's claims of ownership of the three islands in the
Persian Gulf, the spokesman said the islands belong to Iran for
ever. He once again announced the readiness of Iran to sit at the
negotiating table with the UAE in order to remove the
misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
"It was better for the Arab countries to encourage the
emirates authorities to hold direct negotiations with Iran instead
of indulging in vain propaganda which will bear no result except
increasing tension and paving the way for outsiders to interfere
in (with) the regional affairs," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Both the deputy foreign minister and the spokesman called on
the Islamic and Arab countries to make their efforts for further
solidarity and brotherly relations for the total liberation of the
occupied lands.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Drafts Regulations to Curb Taihu Lake Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The legislative department of east
China's Jiangsu Province has drafted regulations to curb water
pollution in Taihu Lake.
</P>
<P>
The regulations are expected to help prevent and treat water
pollution in the lake, and also protect its scenery, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Taihu, one of the three largest freshwater lakes in China,
covers an area of 2,338 sq km and is a major of drinking water
source for Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The lake's water quality has deteriorated over the past several
years, because of industrial and agricultural development, the
booming urban population and the failure to strictly adhere to
regulations for the protection of water resources, experts said,
</P>
<P>
Pollution in the lake has become a concern both in and outside
China, they said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will tighten the control over the discharge of
pollutants. Goals set by the regulations include improving the
lake's water quality and eliminating pollution by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will formally go into effect in October.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Proposes Withdrawal from Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Israeli senior army officers
have advised the new government to proceed with troops
redeployment from the volatile West Bank town of Hebron,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The senior officers have submitted a proposal to call on the
government to honor the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo accords by
redeploying troops from Hebron, otherwise it will risk damaging
its credibility and destabilizing the area, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the army officers said that the troops in Hebron,
a flash point town of regular Israeli-Palestinian violence where
about 450 Jewish settlers living among 200,000 Palestinians,
would adapt themselves to whatever dire conditions pending the
government's decision on the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel was to have completed its
troops redeployment from most of Hebron by late March, but the
former Labor government decided to delay the pullout due to a
spate of terrorist attacks by Islamic militants inside Israel and
the earlier Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has repeatedly called on the Israeli
government to honor its commitments by pulling its troops out of
Hebron, and warned against serious consequences for failing to do
so.
</P>
<P>
Israeli new Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly
to agree to the redeployment from most of Hebron, on
conditions that the Israel will maintain security control over
the whole town.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held a meeting with Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai and other senior security officials last week to
discuss the redeployment, but failed to make a decision.

<HEADLINE> Iran: US Mediation Aims at Setting Foothold in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran today attacked the United
States for its attempt to establish a foothold in Afghanistan
against the Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Alauddin Boroujerdi, Deputy Foreign Minister for Asia-Oceania
Affairs, said that "Washington's attempts to mediate among Afghan
warring factions is not out of benevolence, but a reaction
to Iran's successful mediation between the Afghan government and
Hezb-i-Islami, (the party) of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar."
</P>
<P>
"The train of peace has begun to move with the mediation
of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the White House is trying
to jump on the peace bandwagon on the one hand and undermine
the peace process on the other," he said in a report carried
in today's English daily Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
Organized by U.S. Republican Senator Hank Brown, representatives
of Afghanistan's major factions, including the Taliban militia,
are to attend three days of hearing in the U.S. Congress
beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said: "We call on all Afghan groups
participating in the talks to be very cautious while
discussing with the U.S. officials."
</P>
<P>
He said that history proves the U.S. has never looked
with favor upon Islamic countries of the region. On the
contrary, it has always tried to undermine the interests of the
Moslem countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran will continue its efforts to forge new agreements
similar to that concluded between President Rabbani
and Hekmatyar.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our talks with the Taliban and encourage
them to join peace talks. There is no military solution to
the Afghan crisis," he added.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Guatemalan Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexico City, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Guatemalan rebels and
government negotiators have moved a step closer to end Central
America's longest-running insurgency as they on Sunday ended the
first round of talks on the military's future role in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the three-day peace talks in the Mexican capital,
Gustavo Porras, coordinator of the presidential peace commission,
said the issue was a "difficult" one, "but we've made progress."
</P>
<P>
Although no formal agreement was reached, all sides concerned
said important groundwork had been laid for further talks on
military reform in Guatemala. Another round is to be held sometime
next month.
</P>
<P>
The talks are considered key to a final agreement by the
Guatemala National Revolutionary Unit to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators said the two sides exchanged proposals and
discussed a document on reducing the role of the military, which
has maintained great influence a decade after formally turning
over power to a democratically elected government.
</P>
<P>
Military rule in Guatemala ended in 1986, but the army has
continued to wield enormous power.
</P>
<P>
The two sides instructed U.N. mediator Jean Arnault to meet
with them separately over the next two weeks in an effort to
bridge the gap between government and rebel proposals before the
next round of talks, according to a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has overseen the peace process over the last
two years, during which the two sides have reached agreement on
Guatemala National Revolutionary Unit to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
Government and rebel negotiators signed their last important
agreement in early May on how to tackle socioeconomic and agrarian
issues.
</P>
<P>
More than 140,000 people have been reportedly killed during the
decades-long war in the country.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has died down in recent years, but the peace process
has been a slow one since it began in 1991, complicated by
internal political strife.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Starts Campaign to Curtail Strange Skin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's health authorities
have started a campaign to curtail the spread of a strange skin
disease and cure those already infected with it in the country,
according to official sources today.
</P>
<P>
Director of Public Health Rashid Al-Owaish said the disease,
which is called "lishmania" in Arabic, has infected many persons
recently.
</P>
<P>
He said it the disease normally carried by a kind of rodent
locally called "Abu Afan" and may be passed onto human beings by
desert flies. The disease causes deep and painful lesions on the
patients' skin and limbs, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the first case of this disease was reported in
Abdally, which is near the Iraq border in the north.
</P>
<P>
The official said the entry of the disease into the country
might be traced to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. He said
the rodent might have entered the country during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
When the ground offensive operations were stopped in Abdally,
an increase in rodents and insects was found there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Department of Public Health and the Department of
Rodent Control have taken measures to eradicate the disease and its
causes before it spreads and the rodents start heading for
the city.
</P>
<P>
Al-Owaish said the anti-Abu Afan campaign would take three
month to complete.

<HEADLINE> Rented Flowers Popular Among Shenyang's Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Even if they do not grow the
flowers themselves, the residents of Shenyang, in northeast China,
can enjoy the fragrance of fresh flowers at home or at work, every
day now.
</P>
<P>
The innovation is the result of a heretofore unheard of service
- flowers for rent.
</P>
<P>
The business has by now become very popular among the locals,
for the simple reason that flowers obtained this way are quite a
bit cheaper.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, those who rent only have to pay
one-third of the cost of flowers that are purchased outright.
</P>
<P>
To decorate their surroundings, enterprises in Shenyang often
spend thousands of yuan annually on flowers, but not many of those
flowers are left a year later, mostly because of improper care or
lack of care.
</P>
<P>
Now there is a solution to the problem and the worries are
over. Flowers are now available for rent from local greenhouses
and parks, thanks also to a large number of horticulturists.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the new flower-renting industry has a
bright future in other pars of China.

visit. They also suggested that Hainan develop more low-pollution
projects and at the same time develop tourism in ecologically
protected zones.
</P>
<P>
At one seminar, the experts suggested that enterprises attach
importance to the interests of farmers and employ more farmers in

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Shenyang on Strong Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province has hit an all-time
high.
</P>
<P>
A total of 205 foreign-invested enterprises have been set up in
the city from January to March, twice the number of the same
period last year, latest statistics showed.
</P>
<P>
Their investments totalled more than 570 million US dollars,
and their registered capital amounted to 430 million US dollars,
soaring 52 percent and 74 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Among the enterprises, 170 are in the manufacturing industry,
accounting for 80 percent of the total. More encouraging is that
18 large and medium-sized enterprises began to co-operate with
foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Officials observed that the flow of foreign investments into
industrial enterprises will be conducive to renovating the old
industrial base of Shenyang and improving its industrial structure
products structure.
</P>
<P>
Another new features of the foreign investments in this period
is that more big investors came to the city. Of the 205, 19 put an
investment more than 10 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 17 private firms have been turned into joint
ventures, nearly twice the number of the corresponding period last
year. The firms attracted a combined investment of 40 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure construction in the city used to attract few
foreign investments. This year, the deadlock was broken. Two joint
ventures were set up for developing water resources, and several
joint ventures were established for highway construction.
</P>
<P>
Officials attributed the the strong and healthy momentum in
using foreign investment to the readjustment of tax policies and
the measures the local government adopted to improve investment
environment.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Faces Hunger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Half of the population in
southern Africa are unsure where their next meal will come from
and many more might face starvation unless governments take
action, a Washington-based food policy research body official
said.
</P>
<P>
''Food security appears to have deteriorated in southern
Africa,'' International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
Director-General Pinstrup Andersen told a seminar here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
''The Citizen'' paper today quoted Anderson as saying that the
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a combined population of
about 140 million, remain a ''hot spot'' of food insecurity,
along with developing countries in southern Asia.
</P>
<P>
But the region has more potential than ever to build a better
future because of major reforms in southern African politics,
economics and society over the past decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
however, he noted, the poverty, hunger and environmental decay
that threaten the people in southern Africa can only be reversed
if governments take action.
</P>
<P>
''Failure to act could condemn the region to more human
misery in the years to come,'' said Anderson.
</P>
<P>
The number of hungry people in Africa has increased by 46
percent to 175 million over the past 25 years and southern Africa
is among the areas hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
The worsening situation has partially been a result of severe
drought throughout the region since the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
''The number of food-insecure people almost doubled between
the beginning of the 1980's and 1990's. In the region, every
second person is food insecure and every fourth child is
malnourished,'' said Anderson.
</P>
<P>
According to IFPRI, the number of malnourished children in
Sub-Saharan Africa could increased by 50 percent, reaching 43
million by year 2020, unless southern African governments
intervene.
</P>
<P>
Southern African countries, excluding South Africa, are home
to more than 4.3 million malnourished children younger than
school-going age, Anderson said, adding that Tanzania and
Mozambique account for more than a million.
</P>
<P>
An IFPRI report said among the main challenges to southern
African governments are ensuring poverty relief and increasing
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> China to Examine Water Leakage in Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- China will take its first look at
water leaking from water pipes, using state-of-the-art technology,
in several major cities, the China Construction News has reported.
</P>
<P>
The Jindi Water Leakage Investigation Co. Ltd., the first
company of its kind on the Chinese mainland, will soon study water
leakage in Xiamen, Zhengzhou, Nanjing and other cities, using the
Japanese technology, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that, in a large Chinese city with daily use of two
million tons of water, about 400,000 tons are lost because of
pipeline problems. Economic losses resulting from water leakage
are estimated at three billion yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
However, studying water leakage, something that is commonly
done worldwide, was neglected in China until Jindi, a firm that
helps locate underground pipelines, began to co-operate with Japan
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
In a regulation developed in 1993, the Chinese government ruled
that water loss rate in cities cannot exceed eight percent. The
present rate is 20 to 25 percent, some 70 percent of it caused by
water leakage.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that if China's water leakage rate can drop one
percent, every year the country will be able to save over 400
million cubic meters of water, enough to supply 6.5 million
people's needs annually.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said China believes that it can hopefully cut the
water leakage rate by 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen to Build First Special Wharf for Taiwan Straits Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The mainland's first special wharf
for people-to-people trade across the Taiwan Straits will be built
with funds partially collected by Wutong Village, of Heshan Town,
Xiamen City, in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The idea of building the wharf came from a group of farmers in
Wutong Village.
</P>
<P>
The wharf construction feasibility study has gotten approval
from the local government and the project is expected to start
soon.
</P>
<P>
The wharf is expected to have an annual cargo handling capacity
of 280,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Of about 70 million yuan (some 8.7 million US dollars) of
estimated investment, 30 million yuan will come from farmers in
Wutong Village, and the other 40 million yuan will come from the
Xiamen Harbor Administration and two large corporations.
</P>
<P>
Wutong is only six kilometers from Quemoy Island off the Taiwan
coast and sometimes several Taiwan vessels berth there and take
fresh vegetables, fruits, and aquatic products back to Quemoy, but
the present stone-pile wharf cannot meet the needs of the trade
across the straits.

BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A 140-km-per-hour passenger
express train is expected to run between the Chinese capital and
Qinhuangdao, a port and coastal resort in north China, beginning
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The double-decker "Beidaihe" train will reduce the travel time
between the two cities from the present three hours and 38 minutes
to two and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
It will become the second express passenger train in China, in
addition to the 140 kmh "Pioneer" passenger train between Shanghai
and Nanjing, which went into operation in April.
</P>
<P>
Experts and workers with the Beijing Railway Administrative
Bureau have conducted speed-increasing trial operations three
times since November.
</P>
<P>
"The operation of domestically-made express trains and fast
tracks mark the development of China's railway management," Wang
Chunshan, director of the Beijing Railway Bureau, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The bureau plans to increase the train's speed to 160 kmh in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Other express passenger trains bound for Tianjin, Shijiazhuang,
Shenyang and Jinan cities from Beijing also will be operational.
</P>
<P>
China's railway authority has announced that it will launch a
massive upgrading of its railway lines and equipment in the next
few years, and will introduce several new trains to the 60,000-km
railway system.

WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The first 26 horses from
European nations competing in the Centennial Olympic Games arrived
Sunday at the Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The horses were aboard a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt,
Germany, inside three-meter containers. After the arrivement, they
were immediately quarantined for 36 hours at the airport's equine
center.
</P>
<P>
The horses included nine from Germany, six from Italy, four
from Sweden, four from Hungary, two from Belgium and one from
Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Those horses have been at the center of an international
equestrian controversy and after months of debate, the
International Equestrian Federation agreed earlier this year to
the quarantine plan.
</P>
<P>
Horse owners and agriculture officials have expressed concern
that allowing infected horses into the country for the Olympics
could spread the virus.
</P>
<P>
A total of 230 horses will be transported to Atlanta in nine
shipments.
</P>
<P>
After 36 hours, the horses will be transferred to the new
Georgia International Horse Park, southeast of Atlanta, where they

<P>
DHAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi President Abdur Rahman
Biswas said last night that there was no lapse on his part in
discharging his responsibilities neutrally as the president in
holding the country's seventh parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Biswas chaired the inauguration on Sunday afternoon of a
20-member cabinet headed by Sheikh Hasina after her Awami League
(AL) emerged as the largest party winning 146 out of the 300
elected parliamentary seats in the June 12 elections.
</P>
<P>
In a radio and televised speech last night, Biswas noted that
setting up a caretaker government through the amendment of the
constitution had proved a successful means to hold the elections.
</P>
<P>
"Many people have made harsh remarks, saying the actions (to
sack ex-chief of army staff A.S.M. Nasim during an alleged foiled
mutiny on May 20 by the Defense Ministry under the president) were
taken to influence the elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proved today that their apprehension was baseless
as the polling process ended without any disruption, the formation
of the majority party government has been completed in the natural
process and the state power has been handed over peacefully and
constitutionally," Biswas said.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much hopeful that a new horizon of development
process will be opened up and democracy and democratic values will
flourish more during the tenure of the new government," the
president stressed.

<HEADLINE> War-torn Sierra Leone in Deadly Epidemic Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 15 to 20 people a week are
going down with the deadly lassa fever virus which is spreading
through war-torn Sierra Leone in western Africa, a British charity
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Doctors are trying to control the deadly virus, which can kill
within 10 days, but efforts have been hampered by the civil war
which has destroyed medical services, said Dr Rob Bennett, medical
co-ordinator for Medical Emergency Relief International (MERLIN).
</P>
<P>
"This looks like the most severe epidemic of lassa fever in
this region to date," he said. "The number of cases jumped from
three or four a week to 15 or 20."
</P>
<P>
So far, the disease has killed nearly 40 percent of its victims.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the epidemic, centering on Kenema some 165
kilometers south of the capital Freetown, has contaminated human
food and water supplies via rats' urine and excreta.
</P>
<P>
The district, flooded with thousands of refugees who have fled
from fighting in the country's five-year civil war, has conditions
ideal for the spread of lassa fever - unclean water, unhygienic
food storage, overcrowding and is plagued by rats.
</P>
<P>
Lassa fever is one of a group of haemorraghic diseases
including ebola, dengue and yellow fever.

HANGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Sixty percent of industrial
output value in the Yangtze River delta area comes from the
region's rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts said that the total industrial output value of
the delta area is expected to exceed 1,600 billion yuan (about 200
billion U.S. dollars) this year, and that of the rural enterprises
run by farmers may reach nearly 1,000 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
It means that the industrial output value of the rural
enterprises will continue to take at least 60 percent of the
region's total industrial output value this year.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River delta area includes northern parts of
Zhejiang Province, Southern parts of Jiangsu Province and China's
top industrial city, Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The delta has an area of about 100,000 kilometers with a
population of over 70 million.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials half of the rural laborers in the
delta area have sought jobs in rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Many small factories have developed into big production groups
through share-holding, annexing, leasing and auctions. Statistics
show that the area has more than 500 enterprise groups at
the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 enterprises have annual business incomes of 100
million yuan (about 13 million dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz President Askar Akayevich
Akayev expressed satisfaction with Sino-Kyrgyz relationship on the
eve of Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to this central Asian
country on July 3-4.
</P>
<P>
Kyrgyz has developed very friendly relations with China on the
basis of equality and mutual benefit, Akayev said in an interview
with Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
The president highly commented on the more than 30 important
accords and agreements signed between the two countries over the
past years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on confidence-building in the military field in
border areas signed in Shanghai in April this year by China,
Kyrgyz, Russia, Kazakhstan and Tadzhikstan is particularly
significant, he said.
</P>
<P>
It has pushed the Sino-Kyrgyz relations to a higher level, he
said, adding it not only has a positive effect on the stability
and security in Asia but also promote peace in the world.
</P>
<P>
These accords have created a prerequisite for the development
of bilateral cooperation in various fields, said Akayev.
</P>
<P>
The president told the reporters that China, whose trade with
Kyrgyz accounts for 28 percent of Kyrgyz's total foreign trade
volume, has become the second biggest trade partner of Kyrgyz,
just behind Russia.
</P>
<P>
He is certain that the Sino-Kyrgyz trade, which accounted for
only 1 to 2 percent of Kyrgyz's foreign trade in 1990, will
increase in the future.
</P>
<P>
Akayev noted that his country has a political situation more
stable than any time before, which will definitely promote economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kyrgyz people are looking forward to Jiang's visit
and wished his visit a success.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Formation of Cabinet Paves Way for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A 20-member cabinet led by Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina was sworn in in Bangladesh Sunday
afternoon. Suffering a lot from years of political upheaval,
Bangladeshis have finally seen the dawn of peace.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much hopeful that a new horizon of development
process will be opened up and democracy and democratic values will
flourish more during the tenure of the new government," President
Abdur Rahman Biswas said on television, who administered the
oath-taking for the new cabinet formed by the Awami (people's)
League (AL), the largest party in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, not long ago the president was under attack mainly
from the AL for keeping the portfolios of the Defense Ministry and
armed forces in hands.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, the Defense Ministry under the president sacked the
former chief of army staff A.S.M. Nasim and some other senior army
officers and put them under military custody for an alleged
mutiny.
</P>
<P>
"People have made harsh remarks, saying the action was taken to
influence the elections," President Biswas noted, adding that "it
has proved today that their apprehension was baseless" as the
polling process ended without any disruption and the state power
has been handed over peacefully and constitutionally with the
formation of the new government.
</P>
<P>
In fact, barring stray incidents which led to repolling in 27
constituencies, the elections in all other constituencies were
described by observers from both home and abroad as "free, fair
and peaceful" with the turnout of more than 73 percent of the
voters.
</P>
<P>
Although the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) demanded for
repolling in 112 constituencies for alleged "massive riggings and
irregularities," the party has decided to join the new parliament
as the largest opposition party and its MPs-elect were finally
asked to take oath today.
</P>
<P>
BNP chairperson and former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia
last night issued a statement to congratulate Hasina on her
assumption of the prime minister's office.
</P>
<P>
"Accepting in good grace the election and its outcome -- and on
a positive and forward looking note -- was what people hoped for,"
a local daily commented, adding that "as a first step in that
direction we are happy that the BNP took the poll results
graciously."
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the move by both the president and the BNP has
dispelled misgivings among the people to some extent, providing a
basis for future stability in the country's politics.
</P>
<P>
Now, the AL government has gained support from various
political parties and all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The Jatiya (national) Party, the third largest party in the new
parliament with 32 seats, has from the very beginning extended its
"absolute and unconditional" support to the AL to form the new
government "in the great interest of the establishment of
democracy and continuation of the constitutional process."
</P>
<P>
Due to prolonged government-opposition conflicts, strikes or
strike-like agitation programs have become a common scene on the
streets across the country during the past two years. Suffering a
lot from these disturbances, Bangladeshis are longing for peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
"That's why the AL has won the election and got support from
almost all and even most BNP MPs are opposing violent or
strike-like agitation activities against the new ruler," a
journalist said.
</P>
<P>
But, as a new ruler may be with less experience, there
certainly are many challenges and difficulties ahead. Perhaps, the
BNP hard-liners will pose a potential threat to the law and order
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The first task of my government will be to improve law and
order and ensure peace and security of the people," said Hasina
after the swearing-in ceremony, adding that "let us work unitedly
for democracy. Once we have struggled together on the streets for
democracy. Now we should make endeavors for the economic
emancipation of the people by consolidating democracy."

<HEADLINE> Vigorous City Group Emerges in Yangtze River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A Shanghai-centered city group in
the Yangtze River Delta had utilized 15 billion U.S. dollars of
foreign capital by the end of 1995, becoming the most economically
dynamic region in China.
</P>
<P>
The giant city group is comprised of seven cities in Jiangsu
Province and six cities in Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that with one percent of the country's
territory and six percent of its population, the Yangtze River
Delta has produced 16 percent of China's gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
The development of the energetic city group has caught the
attention of businessmen both in China and abroad, resulting in
the signing of 15,000 investment-oriented contracts by the end of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou, a city renowned for its oriental gardens, has been
cooperating with Singapore in the building of an industrial park,
with an expected total investment of nearly 20 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing, the capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, is
scheduled to invest 20 billion yuan in the next five years, in a
move to transform the city to meet international standards.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the city has devoted itself to building high-tech
skyscraper groups, high-rise commodity buildings, and information
centers. It aims to turn Nanjing into an international center in
the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

<HEADLINE> Blood Donation Quotas Set for Guangzhou Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 24 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangzhou City
will enact a regulation on blood donation, requiring work units to
meet donation quotas since the need for blood has surged.
</P>
<P>
The Regulation on Blood Management and Voluntary Blood
Donation, effective July 10, advocates free blood donation, rather
than the current system heavily reliant on cash incentives,
reported today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
In concert with the State Council principle that donation of
blood is the best policy, the regulation states that local
citizens are encouraged to give their blood free.
</P>
<P>
Units and individuals who meet donation quotas will then have
first access to blood supplies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Those units who fail to fill their yearly blood donation quota
will be fined three times the value of the blood their employees
should have donated," it said.
</P>
<P>
The need for blood has surged in Guangzhou in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the city used 28.1 million milliliters of blood, 24
times that of 1984 and a yearly increase of 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"However, only 8.8 percent of the blood used that year came
from donation. The rest came from paid collecting stations the
city set up in or outside the province," the report said.

Statistics show that to date, the province has closed a total

The project has enabled the province to see an increase in the
total reserve of its forest resources, and an improvement of its
fragile ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the province will implement another
large-scale afforestation project, which will cover 27 counties
and cities there.
</P>
<P>
The province also will systematically establish a group of cash
tree production bases in order to fully utilize resources such as

<P>
BEIJING, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Mainland senior high school
students are more confident about than lives at present than their
counterparts in Taiwan, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A recent cross-straits survey showed that 79 percent of
mainland students said they are confident about their lives, while
in Taiwan, only 64 percent of students surveyed gave this response.
</P>
<P>
The survey was designed by Taiwan Normal University and
conducted in 10 high schools in six Taiwanese cities in October
1993. Two years later, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
surveyed students in 15 schools in Beijing, Shanghai, Zhengzhou,
Xi'an and Shenyang, using the same questionaire.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time Taiwan and the Chinese mainland have
conducted the same survey.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of mainland students said they believe in
the importance of hard work, while 47.8 percent of those surveyed
in Taiwan hold this belief.
</P>
<P>
More than 89 percent of students from the mainland think their
future is "bright". Their Taiwan counterparts are even more
optimistic, with 92 percent of them saying their future is "great".
</P>
<P>
Taiwan youngsters are less worried about fashion than mainland
students. Only 3.7 percent of them are crazy about fashionable
things. On the mainland, 9.8 percent of the students are.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Construction work at Huanghua
Port in north China's Hebei Province, which is connected with the
Shenfu-Dongsheng Coal Field by a 820-km railway line, is being
speeded up.
</P>
<P>
The port project will be separated into three phases. In the
first phase, which is to be completed by 2003, four 35,000-tonnage
berths will be built to handle 30 million tons of coal annually,
at a total cost of 5.2 billion yuan (626 million US
dollars). Hebei has put 50 million yuan into the effort since May
of last year.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, the port will become an important hub for coal
transport from western to eastern China.
</P>
<P>
So far, workers have removed more than 300,000 cubic meters of
earth, 25,000 cubic meters of sand, and more than 70,000 cubic
meters of stones.
</P>
<P>
The port now has two 1,000-tonnage berths and two 3,000-tonnage
berths, with a combined annual capacity of 1.25 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Environmental Science to Be Optional Course in Chinese Colleges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- A new option will be added to the
list of courses that Chinese college students can take to enhance
their awareness of the environment.
</P>
<P>
Students not majoring in environmental science will also have
the opportunity to learn something about the environment,
environmental planning and management, and environmental ecology.
</P>
<P>
Participants at a recent national meeting for the reform of
curricula agreed to offer environmental science as an independent
course at colleges and universities and suggested that different
textbooks be compiled for students majoring in the humanities and
those in the sciences.
</P>
<P>
A national teaching guidance committee on environmental science
will compile and recommend textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that this will be an important step toward
developing a sense of the environment among China's 2.8 million
college students.
</P>
<P>
Some scholars have even made the appeal for environmental
science as a requirement and an essential part of the state
college education.
</P>
<P>
Environmental education was new to China in the 1970s, when
China was not greatly aware of environmental problems. Now, nearly
140 colleges and universities offer 206 subjects related to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Over 5,000 freshmen annually are enrolled in environmental
science, and there are now more than 20,000 college students and
1,200 master's degree candidates studying environmental
science.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Czech Republic Enter Euro Soccer Semi-Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 23 (Xinhua/OANA) -- European soccer superpower
Germany and unfancied Czech Republic defeated their opponents
"dark horse" Croatia and favourite Portugal by 2-1 and 1-0
separately in two  quarter-final clashes and entered the
semi-finals of the on-going European Soccer Championship in
England.
</P>
<P>
During the German-Croatian match played this afternoon in
Manchester City, German soccer team, the hottest candidate to win
the European Soccer honour, failed to leave people with an
inspiring impression as some of its key players haved missed the
match for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the talented Croatian players launched fierce
attacks upon their strong opponents from the start of the first
half and successively forced the Germans to play defensive
football.
</P>
<P>
The turning point came at the 20th minute when the Germans were
given a penalty kick and Jurgen Klingsmann fired the ball into the
left-hand corner to give Germany an early lead.
</P>
<P>
At the 51 minute of the second half, Croatian most talented
striker Davor Suker hit an equalizer by waltzing around the
goalkeeper and slotting home.
</P>
<P>
Full-back defender Matthias Sammer became the hero of the match
by scoring a crucial goal at the 56th minute to send the Germans
into the semi-finals of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
However, the German side grabbed the victory with a very high
price as its most influential striker Kinglinsmann, who was
injured in the first half of the match, would not be able to play
the semi-final clash with England at Wembley Stadium on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Disapponted Germand coach Beritie Vogts said after the match,
"England can be happy. Klingsmann will not play".
</P>
<P>
Klingsmann, also captain of the German squad, is quoted as
saying: "I have been told it could take 10 days to heal. Maybe the
doctors can do something in the next two days and I may be
okey. But you need to ask the medical team."
</P>
<P>
In another quarter-final thriller held in Birminhham this
evening, the Czech Republic, which defeated favourite Italy in an
early group match, has made another big surprise by defeating
their skillful Portugese opponent.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese team, led by its master-stly midfeider Rui
Costa, has dominated most parts of the match with excellent
football techniques, but failed to score a goal.
</P>
<P>
The Czech side, which had been commonly regarded an outsider of
the Championship, fought an all-out battle and Karel Poborksky
scored a remarkable goal to help the Czech Republic move into the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The Czech team celebrated their victory with mixed feelings as
quite a few key Czech players, who face suspensions, would not be
able to play the semi-final match with France on Wednesday.

WASHINGTON, June 23 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Michael Johnson, who was
denied a world record in the men's 200 meters Saturday, reset it
on Sunday by streaking to a time of 19.66 seconds at the
U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's time broke the world record of 19.72 seconds set by
Italy's Pietro Mennea in 1979 in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Johnson run 19.70 seconds to cover the distence,
but the mark was ineligible for consideration as a world record
because of a prevailing tailwind. The wind gauge at Olympic
Stadium registered 2.7 meters per second, seven-tenths above the
maximum allowable of 2.0.
</P>
<P>
When Johnson broke the record Sunday, the wind measurement
registered 1.7 meters per second.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Royal Mail Monopoly In Jeopardy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, June 23 (Xinhua) -- The British Government has worked
out a secret plan to break the Royal Mail's monopoly this summer.
</P>
<P>
The move would allow rival companies to deliver letters with a
postal value of under one pound (l.5 U.S.dollars) -- now carried
only by the Royal Mail, according to Britain's media today.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 postal staff members worked overtime
yesterday to clear the backlog of 70 million letters after
Friday's 24-hour national strike, the first in the business for a
decade.
</P>
<P>
Michael Heseltine, Deputy Prime Minister, has ordered Ian Lang,
President of the Board of Trade, to prepare for the suspension of
Royal Mail's monopoly of letter delivery, saying that "I hope you
are preparing to suspend the monopoly in the event of this action
going on."
</P>
<P>
Under the secret plan which could come into effect within 24
hours, bulk carriers could take an estimated 20 percent of the
company's business, including the lucrative delivery of household
bills and large-scale mailshots.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Mail regards the protection of its monopoly as the
best guarantee of preserving the current uniform postal rates.
Without this, it claimed, the price of stamps would rise for
long-range deliveries.
</P>
<P>
The company hopes further strike could be averted by
negotiations which resume tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Arab Leaders Send Strong Message to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders ended their two-day
summit here today with a strong message to Israel: Arab countries
will reconsider their policies toward Israel if the Jewish state
does not stick to the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded final communique issued at the end of the
two-day summit, the Arab leaders called on Israel to fully
withdraw from all the occupied Arab land including Syria's Golan
Heights, south Lebanon and Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
They also asked Israel to allow the Palestinian people to
exercise their right to self-determination and establish their
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Although Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and a number of Arab
officials have repeatedly denied that the summit was called to
deal with the new Israeli government led by hardline Likud leader
Benjamin Netanyahu, the message from the summit was apparently in
reaction to Netanyahu's tough policy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
His policy guidelines reject the return of the Golan Heights to
Syria and the establishment of a Palestinian state and even refuse
to negotiate the future status of Jerusalem with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders also urged Israel to implement all its
agreements with the Arabs and seriously commit itself to the peace
process based on the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
If Netanyahu's government really goes back on these agreements
and the principle, the Arab leaders said in their communique, "it
will lead to a setback in the process with all the dangers" that
will take the region back to "the whirlpool of tension."
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the conference said Syria and some other
parties wanted a stronger statement, demanding an end to all steps
to normalize relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Jordan, which has made peace with Israel, was apparently
not in favor of reacting sharply to the Israeli new government,
saying that the election of Netanyahu as prime minister should not
drive the Arabs to panic.
</P>
<P>
Restoring Arab solidarity was another focus of the summit,
which brought together heads of state and senior government
officials from 21 of the Arab League's 22 members. They held
intensified consultations during the two days and the atmosphere
pervading the meetings were "very positive" as Palestinian
Authority Minister Nabil Shaath put it.
</P>
<P>
"The summit's convening itself is a success as it brought
together all Arab parties invited," Shaath said.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the tripartite meeting grouping Mubarak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad prior to the summit, saying that it "opened a new page in
relations between the PLO and Syria."
</P>
<P>
Syria was at odds with Jordan and the Palestinians after the
two parties separately signed peace agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak also hosted a meeting between King Hussein and al-Assad
on Saturday in an attempt to overcome their differences.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters that the
two tripartite meetings were "absolutely fruitful," describing
them as "a good beginning which opened the door for understanding."
</P>
<P>
As what Moussa described as another positive development taking
place at the summit, Mubarak met today with his Sudanese
counterpart Omar al-Bashir despite the strained relations between
their two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt accused Sudan of masterminding the assassination attempt
on Mubarak's life in Addis Ababa last year. Sudan has denied the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
Besides the main issues of Arab solidarity and the peace
process, the Arab leaders also discussed a number of other issues
concerning different parties.
</P>
<P>
In the final communique, they voiced concern over the human and
material damages sustained by the Libyan people as a result of
U.N. embargoes.
</P>
<P>
They expressed concern over a Turkish-Israeli military pact
concluded earlier this year, hoping that Ankara would adopt a
policy "compatible with its own and Arabs' interests."
</P>
<P>
The Arab leaders called for coordinated efforts to combat
terrorism, while underscoring peoples' right to resist occupation.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the Arab leaders also agreed in principle to
establish an Arab Court of Justice for resolving disputes among
Arab states and a common market to enhance regional economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Greek Ruling Party to Hold Congress as Scheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, June 23 (Xinhua) -- Greek ruling party Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (pasok) will hold its party congress as
scheduled for next Thursday despite the death of its leader
Andreas Papandreou earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made unanimously at the pasok Executive
Bureau's extraordinary meeting this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The congress will now have to elect a new president, rather
than the previously proposed position of vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, who took over the
premiership from then hospitalized Papandreou in January, met
pasok party's Central Committee Secretary Costas Skandalidis
tonight to be briefed on the Executive Bureau's decision. Simitis
is not a member of the Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Simitis was expected to compete with interior minister Akis
Tsochadzopoulos to succeed Papandreou as the pasok's leader at the
forthcoming party congress.
