UN special envoy meets with Afghans to try to bridge gap
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Dogged by security worries and uneasy
relations with Afghanistan's Taliban rulers, the United Nations
special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has been trying to improve conditions
for aid workers.
	   Four months after the United Nations pulled its international
staff out of war-weary Afghanistan, Brahimi will be seeking
security guarantees from the Taliban in a meeting scheduled for
Saturday.
	   He also will be meeting with Pakistani officials during his
two-day visit to try to explore ways of bringing Afghanistan's
warring factions to the negotiating table.
	   ``There are still security problems for the United Nations,''
Brahimi told reporters upon his arrival in the Pakistani capital on
Friday.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban rulers have promised to protect U.N.
personnel, but Brahimi said ``we are not fully satisfied.''
	   The United Nations pulled its international staff out of
Afghanistan Aug. 21 after an Italian employee was shot and killed
and another was wounded in the Afghan capital of Kabul.

Philippines' most wanted man killed in gunfight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISABELA, Philippines (AP) _ The leader of a Muslim extremist
group who was the Philippines' most wanted man has been killed in a
raid by police and soldiers on his mountain hideout in the southern
part of the country, officials said Saturday.
	   Three police officers, including the leader of the raiding team,
and another member of the Abu Sayyaf extremist group also died in
the ensuing gunfight late Friday in a remote village on Basilan
island.
	   The body of Abu Sayyaf leader Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani was
identified by his relatives and Basilan Gov. Wahab Akbar.
	   ``We are glad it is over,'' Akbar said. ``I advised him to
surrender before, but he never listened. Now my people can live in
peace. It is the end of the road for Janjalani. It is over, thank
Allah.''
	   Regional police chief Dominador Domingo said government forces
had been on the trail of Janjalani in recent weeks.
	   Police were informed of the whereabouts of Janjalani and about
20 armed followers by local agents Friday and immediately organized
special commando units for the raid on the village of Tumakit in
Lamitan, about 880 kilometers (550 miles) south of Manila.
	   Domingo said the police, expecting Janjalani's followers to
avenge his death, have adopted ``contingency measures,'' which he
did not specify.
	   The Abu Sayyaf, which officials said has ties to Libya, has been
blamed for numerous violent attacks on Christian communities in the
southern Philippines, including the April 1995 raid on the town of
Ipil that left 52 people dead.
	   The military believes the group has links with international
terrorists, such as Saudi exile Osama bin Laden and Ramzi Yousef,
the convicted mastermind of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade
Center in New York.
	   Yousef was arrested February 1995 in Pakistan where he had fled
from Manila after Philippine police discovered an alleged plot to
kill Pope John Paul II during the pope's visit to Manila in January
of that year.
	   Janjalani, a former teacher from a Muslim-Christian family on
Basilan, studied theology and Arabic in Libya, Syria and Saudi
Arabia during the 1980s.
	   He returned to the Philippines around 1990 and began preaching
in Basilan and other southern islands, attracting disillusioned
young Muslims.
	   Military intelligence sources believe the group's first
operation was a 1991 grenade attack on Christian missionaries in
Zamboanga City near Basilan that killed two 19-year-old women from
New Zealand and Sweden. No arrests were made.
	   The military also blames Abu Sayyaf in numerous ransom
kidnappings, including the abduction of American and Spanish
priests, and the 1993 bombing of a cathedral in Davao City that
killed seven people and injured 130.
	   In July 1994, Abu Sayyaf members stopped a bus on Basilan,
killed 15 Christian passengers and took three dozen hostage. All
were released after local authorities paid ransom.

From corps to corp., Chinese paramilitary seeks money to grow

<TEXT>
	   SHIHEZI, China (AP) _ For nearly a half century, a pioneering
paramilitary corps tamed desert land in China's far northwest for
Chinese settlers and suppressed unrest among the Muslim natives.
Now it wants to conquer international commerce.
	   With plows and guns, the Xinjiang Production and Construction
Corps has turned China's once sparsely settled Central Asian
frontier into an empire of cotton plantations, distilleries and gas
stations. Its success has drawn Hong Kong investment bankers and
won the group the Communist Party's consent to set up a
conglomerate.
	   The transformation from corps to corp. underscores a fundamental
change wrought by China's shift from a command economy to free
markets. In a twist on revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung's wisdom,
power no longer comes solely from the barrels of guns, but also
from buckets of cash.
	   But the Production and Construction Corps _ known simply as
``the Corps'' in Xinjiang _ carries heavy historic baggage into its
shiny corporate future. Among its vast holdings lie the
forced-labor camps that earned the region infamy as China's gulag.
Well-trained Corps members helped quell an anti-Chinese riot last
year.
	   Militant members of the once dominant Turkic-speaking Muslim
ethnic groups consider the force an agent of colonization by ethnic
Chinese, known as Hans.
	   The Corps ``is the institution that systematically places the
Han in a dominant role in the Xinjiang economy and has gotten
control of a lot of the land,'' said James Seymour, a China scholar
at Columbia University.
	   The Corps' influence reaches into the country's most powerful
institutions. Its economic projects are approved by China's
Cabinet, its commander sits on Xinjiang's Communist Party committee
and its militia is trained by the People's Liberation Army.
	   While the armed forces severed ties with their commercial
holdings in mid-December and other government agencies are to do so
by year's end under government orders, the Corps is being told to
upgrade its businesses and maintain its militia.
	   From its start with 100,000 soldiers demobilized after the
communist victory in 1949, the Corps' dual mission _ ``to open up
wasteland and defend the border'' _ was designed to blunt
Xinjiang's hostile environment.
	   A swath of forbidding deserts, bleak plains of scrub and high
pastures three times the size of France, Xinjiang (pronounced
SHIN-JAHNG) was largely cut off from China's food supplies.
Separatist sentiment thrived. Muslim natives ran a brief-lived East
Turkestan Republic in the mid-1940s.
	   Corps members lived in shelters dug into the hard earth to ward
off the long, 30-below-(-35 Celsius)-plus winters and performed
military drills early in the morning and after work.
	   ``It wasn't just hard; it was unbearably hard,'' said Li
Shuxian, assistant commander of the Corps' 8th Division, who came
to Xinjiang fresh out of college 36 years ago.
	   ``We didn't have enough to eat. We worked long hours every day.
We went to the fields before there was light in the sky and came
back very late. We ate coarse corn dumplings and shared a big bowl
of soup.''
	   The Corps is now a state-within-a-state. It runs its own schools
and prison system. Gleaming office towers in grimy Urumqi,
Xinjiang's capital, sport the Corps name. Corps workers helped
build the oil city of Korla and are laying track for a
cross-Xinjiang railroad.
	   Its 2.38 million people, more than 80 percent Han Chinese, make
up 14 percent of Xinjiang's population. Last year, the Corps grew
43 percent of Xinjiang's cotton, the most important cash crop,
produced dlrs 1.8 billion worth of goods and services and did dlrs
200 million in foreign trade.
	   ``Our Corps' contributions to Xinjiang are extraordinarily
great, most importantly to Xinjiang's prosperity and social
progress,'' said Li. ``Without the Corps, Xinjiang would be even
more backward, perhaps by a lot.''
	   Shihezi, the 8th Division's headquarters 90 miles (145
kilometers) west of Urumqi, is the birthplace of the Corps and its
desert-to-farmland mythology.
	   A sprawling city of wide boulevards covers what was once a
barren plain of sand and reeds dotted with a few settlements.
Division plantations stretch over 500,000 acres (202,000 hectares).
Rows of wispy poplars hold back the shifting Gobi Desert.
	   Military terminology dominates road signs and official name
cards. Farms are known as regiments and are farmed by brigades and
squads. Leaders are called commanders.
	   The military nomenclature, however, is increasingly an
embarrassment to officials and an impediment to getting the foreign
investment and technology crucial to keeping the Corps competitive.
	   ``Our name has created a lot of misunderstanding,'' Wang
Guizhen, the Corps' political commissar, said in an interview at a
Corps-owned hotel in Urumqi.
	   ``When China was closed and developing on its own, there was
little contact with the outside world and with the West even less.
It didn't matter what name we were called. But no one ever thought
that decades later, under a market economy, our name would be a
problem.''
	   Responding to those concerns, China's Cabinet approved a name
change in December. The Corps will soon become the China New
Construction Enterprise Group, Wang said.
	   One Hong Kong firm linked to the Chinese government plans to
list a collection of prime Corps assets, mostly farms, on Hong
Kong's ``H'' share exchange for mainland companies. The listed
company will be known as Xinjiang Oasis Agriculture Co.
	   Names aside, the Corps will carry on its paramilitary mission
and has given no sign it plans to shut down the network of labor
camps filled with hardened criminals other Chinese provinces pay
the force to take.
	   Wang refused to discuss the camps; 8th Division officers denied
they exist. But locals in Shihezi say the camps are numerous and
point to a low brick wall 18 miles (29 kilometers) outside town
that marks the entrance to one forced-labor prison.
	   ``If the Corps says they have no labor camps, I am here to say
it is a lie,'' said Fan Sidong, a dissident from Shanghai who spent
8 1/2 years as a prisoner farming and building dikes outside
Shihezi, but who now lives in the United States.
	   Paramilitary training will definitely go on, especially in farms
along the border, Wang said. Although Wang was vague about numbers,
Seymour, the Columbia scholar, estimates 100,000 Corps members
undergo the training _ a potent reserve force in the restive
region.
	   Wang boasts the Corps' militia is Xinjiang's best, called out to
aid police and the military in hunting down separatists whenever
anti-Chinese unrest breaks out. Corps members patrolled Yining in
1997 after the city erupted in the largest protest against Chinese
rule in years.
	   Since April, separatists have clashed three times with Chinese
security forces around Yining, near the Kazakstan border. Bombs
reportedly went off in two other cities this summer.
	   Much of the violence is inspired by nationalism in neighboring
Central Asian countries now free from Soviet domination and is
linked to underground movements among Xinjiang's largest Muslim
minority, the Uighurs.
	   Many Uighurs despise the Corps for displacing them from fertile
oases and grazing lands, using up scarce water and diluting their
numbers in what they regard as their homeland.
	   The Corps hasn't ``contributed anything good to the Uighurs or
other minority groups,'' said one exiled Uighur who, fearful of
reprisals, spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It contributed a lot
to suppressing the Uighurs. ... That is the only reason it is still
there.''
	   The Corps is still recruiting Han Chinese to settle in Xinjiang,
although its leaders say not in the numbers it once did.
	   ``According to history, Xinjiang is a part of China,'' said Li,
the 8th Division assistant commander. ``Who is dominating who? Who
is colonizing who? The Corps is made up of different ethnic groups
and just engages in production and construction.''
	   Still in places like Shihezi, barely a Uighur, Kazak or other
minority face can be seen. One successful farmer in the 8th
Division's 121st Regiment said he has had little contact with
Xinjiang natives since arriving from Sichuan province 37 years ago.
	   ``Our relations with the ethnics are very good,'' said farmer
Deng Lifu. ``We meet each other on market day and we say `hello'
and treat each other nicely.''

Paramilitary grit, government policy transform China's border

<TEXT>
	   NO. 121 REGIMENT, China (AP) _ As a 20-year-old farmer trying to
make do in China's overcrowded heartland, Deng Lifu heard about the
wide open, tractor-tilled farms on the northwest frontier.
	   Like tens of thousands of others, Deng headed west and joined
the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps _ a paramilitary
group whose mission was to turn desolate lands into farms and
secure the remote region of politically suspect Muslim minorities.
	   Deng endured blistering cold, scarce food, barren earth and
cramped barracks for two decades, helping the Corps' proud 8th
Division make Xinjiang's desert bloom.
	   ``Chairman Mao said to us as a corps we should work, fight and
produce. I was quite proud of this, so I stayed,'' said Deng, now a
prosperous 57-year-old self-employed farmer.
	   The pioneering grit of farmers like Deng helped the Corps become
a potent economic force in Xinjiang, producing 14 percent of its
goods and 43 percent of the cotton crop. Its 2 million members
account for a third of the Chinese migrants who are fast
marginalizing Xinjiang's Muslim natives.
	   When Deng left his hometown in 1961, Sichuan was beset by Mao
Tse-tung's ruinous ``Great Leap'' to communism. Xinjiang was bleak,
with few of the tractors he had heard about, but ``the conditions
were better than where I came from,'' Deng said. Grain was
plentiful; everything else was rationed.
	   He lived with five to 10 others in one room, quickly falling
into the Corps' routine of farming and drilling.
	   ``After we finished military training in the morning, we went to
work in the fields, and after we finished working in the fields, we
went for military training,'' Deng said.
	   Deng's wife from Sichuan joined him in 1963 and together they
raised three sons and a daughter on the frontier. But his life of
marching and tilling changed in 1991, when agricultural reforms
allowed Deng to buy and reclaim as much desert land as he could.
	   He estimates his 250 acres (101 hectares) of cotton, wheat and
corn are worth dlrs 120,000. Thirty-eight full-time and 30 seasonal
employees are helping him put more of the Gobi Desert under plow.
And his relatives from Sichuan are thinking about joining him.
	   Deng turns aside suggestions the Corps and its settlers have
thrived at the expense of Xinjiang's natives. Then again, he admits
he has made no minority friends in his 37 years in the region.
	   ``All the ethnic groups are part of one family,'' said Deng.
``The land is here for whoever is capable of working it and
benefiting from it.''

Tale of a survivor of China's paramilitary gulag
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-China-Paramilitary Inc &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHIHEZI, China (AP) _ Fan Sidong remembers being worked so hard
one searing desert summer he wore through six pairs of shoes
pulling carts of rock and sand for a dam.
	   Fan's labor wasn't voluntary, but forced. He was one of the tens
of thousands of convicted criminals and dissidents whom Chinese
provinces sent to the vast wastelands of the northwestern frontier
to toil for the paramilitary Xinjiang Production and Construction
Corps.
	   The labor camps form the dark side of the Corps' success in
carving a giant agribusiness from Xinjiang's deserts. Corps leaders
pretend the camps don't exist. But their numbers and miserable
conditions have made Xinjiang notorious as China's criminal dumping
ground.
	   For 8 1/2 years, Fan said, he survived beatings, hunger and the
countless indignities of prison life in camps outside Shihezi, a
city the Corps' vanguard 8th Division chiseled from the fringes of
the Gobi Desert.
	   After his release in 1994, Fan returned to Shanghai, then fled
to Hong Kong and finally settled in the United States last year,
all the while studying the penal colony that confined him.
	   A political prisoner convicted of writing for an underground
democracy magazine and spying for a foreign government, Fan was
surrounded by hardened criminals. Of the 800 people sent with him
from Shanghai in 1985, Fan estimates only eight were outright
dissidents. All got the same treatment.
	   ``Soon after we arrived, out of a group of 200 of us, half were
beaten,'' Fan said in a telephone interview from his home in
Seattle. ``The Xinjiang guards wanted to pull the Shanghai convicts
off their high horse. They thought, `You Shanghai people might be
from the big city and might look down on us,' so they beat us.''
	   Food, or the lack of it, determines much of the logic of the
Corps labor camps. Prisoners steal for it, sometimes for and at the
bidding of the poorly paid guards. One prisoner desperate with
hunger committed suicide, Fan said.
	   For his first few years, Fan had to coax wheat, rice and corn
from the arid wastes. But the land given to labor camps was poor,
remote and desolate. ``When we planted, nothing grew,'' Fan said.
	   His hardest work came building dikes for a reservoir. Guards
forced convicts to work under the hot Gobi sun as long as there was
daylight.
	   Although Corps labor camps at one time held perhaps 100,000
prisoners, Fan estimates their numbers have dropped by half. He
cites reforms in China's prison system, local resistance and the
shortcomings of using an ill-fed, unmotivated labor force.
	   People in Shihezi marched in 1987 to protest the dumping of
prisoners in their midst.
	   ``They shouted: `Xinjiang is not a labor-reform brigade. We
don't want these prisoners from all over China coming to
Xinjiang,''' Fan said.

Corruption charged in building of controversial Thai power plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Government investigators said 17
bureaucrats from Thailand's state electric authority pocketed more
than 600 million baht (dlrs 17 million) from a land scam involving
a power plant that has been the cause of violent protests by
villagers and environmentalists, a media report said Saturday.
	   The Counter Corruption Commission has recommended that criminal
charges be filed against all 17 bureaucrats from the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand, although seven of them have
already retired, The Nation newspaper said.
	   The commission said the 17 conspired to charge the consortia
building the power plant 641 million baht (dlrs 17.8 million) more
than they paid the owners of the land for the plots and kept the
difference.
	   Violence erupted two weeks ago between 3,000 policemen and 5,000
demonstrators who oppose the building of the plant and two others
in Prachuab Khiri Khan, 230 kilometers (145 miles) southwest of
Bangkok.
	   More than 65 people were injured during the two days of clashes.
	   The protesters say the coal-fired power plants will poison their
environment and affect their health.
	   The Cabinet said this week that public hearings will be held on
whether or not continue with the building of the plants, but
companies from the United States, Japan and Finland, who are
members of the consortia that own the plants, say they expect the
government to honor its contracts.
	   Thailand is privatizing its power industry, and the contracts to
build, own and operate the plants were doled out after hundreds of
companies submitted bids to the government.

Chinese complete sweep of rowing medals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's rowers, guided by the nation's
most famous track coach, completed a sweep of their 11 Asian Games
gold medal races Saturday, winning six more. They said it was easy.
	   The feat re-established their perfection in the sport in Asia
after they missed one of the 12 decided at the last games in 1994.
China had swept all four in 1982 and all 12 in 1990.
	   Japan took three of the silver medals in Saturday's 2,000-meter
races, but never came closer than 2.6 seconds.
	   In the men's pairs, China's Cui Yonghui and Li Yang ran up a
lead of nearly five seconds after 1,500 meters and held off Japan's
Kazuaki Mimoto and Daisaku Takeda, winning in 6 minutes, 39.05
seconds. The Japanese were second in 6:41.64.
	   Olympic silver medalist Zhang Xiuyun raced away from Hong Kong's
Ng Ga-loc in the women's single sculls, winning by more than 12
seconds _ 7:48.58 to 8:01.14.
	   ``I was quite relaxed and felt no pressure. The competition was
not tough for me,'' she said.
	   Zhang Qing, director of China's Aquatic Sports Center, added:
``Now it's clear China holds an obvious advantage in Asian
rowing.''
	   China's Hua Lingjun won the men's lightweight singles sculls in
7:08.22, with North Korea's Kim Il Yong more than five seconds
behind in 7:13.84.
	   Fan Ruihua and Ou Shaoyan won the women's lightweight pairs in
7:26.08, with Japan's Akiko Iwamoto and Yoshie Sugiyama second in
7:34.99.
	   China beat Japan in the men's fours and Kazakstan in the
women's. In the men's race, the Chinese finished in 6:15.97 to
6:21.15 for Japan. The women's margin was 7:07.75 to 7:18.67.
	   Chinese coach Gao Hongyin had said Friday that the rowers
received advice in training from track coach Ma Junren, famous for
``Ma's army'' of women distance runners who set world records in
the early 1990s. Because of a dispute with national officials, none
of Ma's runners are in the Asian Games.
	   Gao said Ma went to a special training camp set up by the rowers
to toughen the team after its setbacks in the World Championships
in Germany in September.

Argentina: seeking loopholes to prosecute ``Dirty War'' leaders

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A motorcade rolls past an angry
crowd of shouting demonstrators. Officers in riot gear press back
the throng as the cars pull up before a federal courthouse.
	   An aging man is ushered past the horde, who curse the former
military officer they consider responsible for thousands of deaths
during the 1970s and early 80s.
	   The heavyset man with slicked-back gray hair is Emilio Massera,
a former Argentine admiral who helped lead the 1976-83 dictatorship
here. He's again been hauled before a judge to answer charges
stemming from the so-called era of the ``dirty war.''
	   Massera isn't alone. Four former commanders from the military
junta have landed in court in recent months as part of
investigations into allegations that officers stole children born
to women detained as suspected subversives.
	   More detentions are expected this month.
	   With Spain's effort to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
Britain, the question of how Latin American countries should
address misdeeds of the past has been reopened.
	   Argentina, unlike other South American countries, put its former
leaders on trial and sentenced them to life in prison in 1985.
	   Moving to calm a restless military, President Carlos Menem
pardoned the leaders five years later _ a move he said was
necessary for the sake of ``national reconciliation.''
	   Now groups eager to bring the officers to justice are moving
again, seeking to exploit a loophole in Menem's amnesty that
doesn't cover abuses against minors.
	   More than 200 ``baby disappearances'' have been identified by
the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the Argentine group that has
worked for decades to locate children of those killed or missing
from the ``dirty war.'' Many of the disappeared babies would now be
in their early 20s.
	   ``It's incredible what these grandmothers have been able to
accomplish through Argentina's judiciary system, fighting for the
childrens' custody and opening the country's eyes to what went
on,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco of Human Rights Watch.
	   Massera, who still defends his actions during the ``dirty war''
as a legitimate wartime necessity, has declared he's innocent of
the new charges. He claims he's already paid for his past crimes.
	   In rare comments recently to a local radio station, Massera
said, ``When I see Carlotta (the Grandmothers' president) I
understand her pain, but I was already jailed. I have passed my
time being Argentina's most despised person.''
	   Many of the junta leaders are also wanted by the same Spanish
investigators seeking to extradite Pinochet on charges of murder
and torture arising from his 1973-1990 Chilean dictatorship.
	   But Argentina has refused to go along with those efforts. Menem
has described the investigation of Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon as
``interfering with our people'' and encouraging an ``unbearable
situation.''
	   But rights groups say Garzon's efforts to seek the 83-year-old
Pinochet for trial has aided their long struggle. Arrested n London
on Oct. 16, Pinochet is battling in the British courts to avoid
extradition.
	   ``There is no doubt what happened with Pinochet has set a
precedent,'' said Hebe Bonafini, president of the Mothers of the
Plaza de Mayo, who still march in protest for missing sons and
daughters.
	   Vivanco agrees.
	   Pinochet's detention ``contributes to the encouragement of
judges in other parts of the world ... to provide some redress
against human rights violations,'' said Vivanco.
	   Massera and former junta head, Gen. Jorge Videla, are under
house arrest on accusations of kidnapping children born to jailed
political prisoners. If convicted, they face sentences of up to 20
years in jail.
	   Lawyers for Videla and Massera contend the former officers have
been judged for their past crimes in trials held after the
military's 1982 fall. But that pardon does not include those
against minors.
	   Both were menacing figures during the military's reign. Videla,
considered the ideological head, was reputed to have had final
authority over death squads that tortured and killed perceived
opponents.
	   Massera presided over the Navy Mechanics School, a training
facility prosecutors say was converted into a clandestine killing
center.
	   The government says nearly 9,000 Argentines disappeared under
the junta, but human rights groups put the figure closer to 30,000.
	   For Argentina, coming to grips with its past has come easier
than in countries like Chile.
	   A weakened military after the loss of the 1982 Falkland Islands
War with Britain helped break the military's grip on Argentina. And
in 1995, the head of the armed forces apologized for the military's
past actions.
	   Also, former officers have come forward and confessed to killing
dissidents. ``Justice is coming slowing,'' said Eduardo Demarchi, a
teacher in Buenos Aires. ``But finally it seems to be coming.''

Anwar's wife appeals for his release during Muslim holy month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede to UPDATE with Azizah asking for Anwar's release.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim's
wife on Saturday appealed for his release on bail during the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan.
	   Azizah Ismail, the sacked deputy prime minister's wife, made the
request as she submitted an application to officially register a
pro-reform group that will seek greater political freedom in the
Southeast Asian nation.
	   ``For the month of Ramadan, we appeal to the government to
release Anwar on bail,'' she told reporters. Ramadan, which Muslims
traditionally observe by fasting during the daytime, begins in
predominantly Muslim Malaysia from Sunday.
	   Azizah announced the creation of the pro-reform group on Dec. 10
but said it was not going to contest elections.
	   Police have threatened Azizah with jail if she took up the
leadership of the nascent movement that her husband began. But she
has openly defied the authorities by giving interviews and making
statements.
	   On Saturday, she was accompanied by her eldest daughter, Nurul
Izzah, when she went to the office of the Registrar of Societies in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Along with forms for registration, she submitted the logo of the
group, named Adil, the Malay word for justice.
	   Without registration, meetings or gatherings under the banner of
Adil could be deemed illegal.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 2 after organizing huge rallies to
demand the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir recently dared Anwar's supporters to form a party to
challenge him in the general election in 2000.
	   Anwar is currently on trial for abuse of office and sodomy. He
has denied all charges, saying they are politically motivated.

Malaysian opposition groups protest Iraq bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian groups opposed to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Saturday organized a protest in front
of the U.S. embassy with the twin aim of denouncing the bombing of
Baghdad and proving that the groups were not pro-U.S.
	   More than 50 activists from various opposition parties and
student groups held up posters saying ``Stop Killing Innocent
People'' and photocopied news pictures of Iraqi people injured in
the three days of bombing.
	   The same activists have gathered in recent months to express
solidarity with jailed former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim
and demand political reform in Malaysia.
	   Mahathir called the movement a ``puppet'' of the United States
after Vice President Al Gore made a speech in Kuala Lumpur last
month praising Anwar's supporters as ``brave.''
	   Gore, who was standing in for President Bill Clinton at a summit
of Pacific Rim nations, spoke in front of Mahathir and several
other prominent Asian leaders, then walked out of a banquet held in
his own honor.
	   ``We want to dispute that the reformist movement is supported by
Western powers,'' said Tian Chua, chairman of the opposition
Coalition of People's Democracy, an umbrella organization of
opposition groups formed in the weeks following the Sept. 20 arrest
of Anwar.
	   ``We are here to show that we are opposed to any form of
injustice, whether at home or at the international level,'' Chua
said into a megaphone as supporters behind him shouted ``Allah O
Akbar,'' or ``God is Great.''
	   Anwar, who is charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal
sex, has often been accused of being too pro-Western and, as
finance minister, following policies prescribed by the
International Monetary Fund. He was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2
after being dubbed immoral.
	   On Saturday, several pro-government activists led by a federal
minister held a protest outside the U.S. embassy to protest the
bombings.

Israeli helicopters raid suspected guerrilla bases in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopters repeatedly struck at
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon overnight to
retaliate for attacks on Israeli troops, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   The officials said they had no immediate reports of casualties.
	   The helicopters targeted positions of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Majdel Selim, the officials said.
	   The village faces Israel's self-styled ``security zone,'' which
the Jewish state set up in southern Lebanon in 1985 to try to
prevent cross-border attacks on Israel's northern settlements.
	   On Friday night, a helicopter also targeted an area between the
villages of Majdel Selim and Kabrikha, which are about 25
kilometers (15 miles) east of Lebanon's port city of Tyre.
	   Bases manned by Israel's South Lebanon Army militia also fired
mortars and 155mm howitzers at villages facing the security zone,
the officials said. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The repeated helicopter raids apparently were in response to
repeated Hezbollah attacks on Israeli outposts nearby.
	   Israeli troops often use helicopters or jets against guerrillas
in southern Lebanon. The guerrillas, led by Hezbollah, have been
trying to drive some 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,500 militia
allies out of Lebanon.

Hong Kong's Wong wins cycling road race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Wong Kam Po rode to a narrow victory
Saturday in the men's 200-kilometer cycling road race, giving Hong
Kong its fifth gold medal of the Asian Games.
	   Hong Kong is having by far its best games, with golds so far in
bowling, billiards, wushu, yachting and cycling. In all previous
games, it had won only one gold medal _ in bowling in 1986.
	   Wong, the 1997 Tour of the Philippines champion, finished just
ahead of Japan's Makoto Iijima and the Philippines' Victor
Espiritu. All three medalists were timed in 4 hours, 39 minutes,
27.23 seconds, an average of 42.94 kph.
	   Filipino Warren Davadilla, this year's winner of the Tour of the
Philippines, finished sixth in 4:41:20.12. Espiritu was the 1996
winner.

Blood product possibly tainted with mad cow disease recalled after
</HEADLINE>
being used on 49 patients &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A blood product possibly tainted with the human
form of mad cow disease has been recalled from Hong Kong hospitals
_ but not before it had been given to 49 patients, hospital
authorities said Saturday.
	   The plasma product was recalled on Thursday from five hospitals
and one clinic, the Hospital Authority said in a statement.
	   The move followed the worldwide recall by Germany's Bayer AG of
its blood product Koate HP after a donor had been diagnosed with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD, the statement said.
	   The company called the move a ``precautionary measure,''
according to the statement.
	   The Hospital Authority added that there was ``no practical
risk'' of transmission of CJD to humans through the blood product
but said they would contact those injected with the product
immediately.
	   In April, the government confirmed that 12 people in public
hospitals had been diagnosed with CJD since early 1996.
	   They were reported a month after the government ordered
hospitals and doctors to return a batch of blood products collected
from a donor who later died of the disease, a version of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy that affects humans.
	   The disease, which makes cattle drool and stagger before dying,
was dubbed mad cow disease in Britain. In humans, it usually
affects older people.
	   CJD has killed at least 20 people in Britain.

From guerrillas to people's army: KLA grows, retools, rearms
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAPASTICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The buzz of rebel military activity
across Kosovo during this uneasy Balkan winter is unmistakable. And
ominous.
	   From the frozen farm plains in the north across the forested
hills of the war-blackened Drenica region to icy mountain passes
along the western border with Albania, the Kosovo Liberation Army
is increasingly visible _ expanding, reorganizing, rearming.
	   For the ethnic Albanian fighters, bent on winning the province's
independence from Serbia, a resumption of full-scale war is not a
question of if but when.
	   This is a new, improved KLA by all appearances and experts'
assessments _ stronger and more disciplined than the ragtag force
that was routed over the summer. It is preparing to battle Serbian
forces for years if necessary in the predominantly Albanian
province.
	   ``We have learned from our mistakes,'' declares a young rebel
commander named Remi, who is based at a heavily guarded compound in
Lapastica, a village in northern Kosovo. ``We are trying to form a
professional army.''
	   A two-way radio on his desk crackles with reports from the
field, and a line of young recruits marches past the window,
wearing jeans and camouflage backpacks.
	   ``We know what to do when fighting breaks out again,'' the
27-year-old commander says. ``We are ready to go fight in every
part of Kosovo.''
	   New camouflage or all-black uniforms are only a symbol of the
changes the KLA has undertaken during the 10 weeks since a
U.S.-brokered truce brought a tenuous halt to months of combat.
	   Using the lull to its advantage, the KLA has reshuffled its
ranks to put professionally trained officers in key posts,
instituted a draft, acquired satellite communications and put
military police in many villages. Following Serb withdrawals
required by the Oct. 12 truce agreement, it has moved boldly back
into all the territory it controlled at the high point last July _
some 40 percent of Kosovo.
	   Perhaps most important, foreign analysts and the rebels
themselves say they've smuggled in significant amounts of anti-tank
rockets, anti-aircraft guns, shoulder-fired Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles and long-barreled sniper rifles that can pierce armored
vehicles or take a man's head off from three-quarters of a mile
away.
	   ``We're getting more and more arms every day,'' says the deputy
commander in Lapastica, Daja _ a 38-year-old soldier respected in
the KLA for his four years heading a commando force that fought for
Croatia in its war of independence from Yugoslavia. ``By spring
we'll have five times what we have now.''
	   The KLA remains no battlefield match for the 11,000 Yugoslav
army soldiers and 10,000 Serbian police officers stationed in
Kosovo. Western intelligence sources conservatively estimate KLA
strength at 1,000 trained, professional soldiers and a few thousand
armed supporters.
	   But Western observers agree the rebels now enjoy widespread
support in villages and are better-armed, better-equipped and
better-organized than in the seven months of fighting earlier this
year.
	   ``They're a little bit more sophisticated, and they have bigger
weapons,'' says Frank Larsson of Sweden, a European Union observer
in Kosovo. ``They have learned from before.''
	   Rebel fighters are everywhere, it seems, in central and western
Kosovo these days.
	   Venture down a dirt road and grim-faced guerrillas carrying
automatic rifles emerge from behind bushes or houses, fingers on
triggers.
	   KLA officers wearing berets and carrying field radios cruise the
back roads of Drenica, where their central command is believed to
be located, in Mercedes or sport-utility vehicles.
	   A small army of black-clad, special-force rebels lay by
invisibly when Serb civilians staged a protest march to a command
post this month, springing into view only after the event ended.
	   While the rebels are still struggling to get all fighting units
coordinated, enlisting new support is hardly a problem.
	   A secret ceremony takes place every few days in a different
village, where KLA commanders swear in new recruits who recite
oaths of loyalty, sing the Albanian anthem and salute the Albanian
flag.
	   Most of the fighters are men, but women are helping, too, making
uniforms and donating jewelry and valuables. Remi takes a handful
of gold coins out of his desk drawer as proof.
	   ``Except for a small group, more or less everybody backs the
KLA,'' says Belul Beqaj, an ethnic Albanian political analyst and
freelance journalist who reports on the rebel movement.
	   Military experts aren't convinced the outmanned rebels have
learned all their lessons from the Serbs pushing them out of
stronghold after stronghold in July and August. Some think the
rebels may be too devoted to trying to hold territory, rather than
relying on guerrilla raids.
	   But the rebels say that even as they try to transform into a
regular army _ a people's army _ they haven't abandoned the
hit-and-run tactics that give them their best chance.
	   ``We are a new army, and that means we had no experience before
this,'' says Agim Cervadiku, 38, cradling a Russian-made anti-tank
rocket at a rebel stronghold in Drenica. ``But now we know what we
need to fight against the Serbs, and we have it.
	   ``We are ready to start guerrilla actions again soon.''

Thailand wins fourth gold in sepak takraw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand won its fourth gold medal in
Asian Games sepak takraw competition Saturday, scoring highest in
the women's circle competition.
	   The Thais finished with 3,708 points. Myanmar, the women's regu
gold medalist, took the circle silver medal with 3,374. Vietnam won
the bronze with 2,543 in the Southeast Asian sport.
	   In the circle event, each team competes individually for points,
with the players standing in a circle and kicking a small rattan
ball to teammates on commands shouted between each kick by
tournament officials. The team event resembles volleyball, except
that the hands may not be used and players send the ball across the
net with acrobatic kicks.
	   ``I'm very excited and very happy because this is my first time
in a tournament,'' said Thai player Wanwipa Silahoi.
	   Thailand earlier had won the men's and women's team events and
the men's regu.

Valuable manuscripts and books are missing from university library
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURHAM, England (AP) _ Centuries-old manuscripts and books,
including works by William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer, are
missing from a university library in northern England.
	   The two manuscripts and five books, worth more than 250,000
pounds (dlrs 400,000), were taken out of a glass-topped display
case at Durham University's library, police said.
	   The theft was discovered Thursday. Police said the items may
have been stolen during opening hours because the library did not
appear to have been broken into.
	   ``We are shocked and distressed by the theft,'' said university
spokesman Keith Seacroft. ``The manuscripts and books are a unique
and irreplaceable part of the region's heritage. It would be
virtually impossible to sell them to legitimate buyers.''
	   The items missing included a first folio edition of a collection
of works by William Shakespeare, published in 1623, and a 15th
century manuscript, with a fragment of a poem written by Geoffrey
Chaucer, author of ``The Canterbury Tales.'' A first edition of
Beowulf printed in 1812 and a book of maps and poetry dating from
1612 were also missing.
	   The works were on exhibit as part of a library show charting the
progress of English literature from the Middle Ages to the 20th
century.

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ As pro-independence activists rallied in
the streets Saturday, a U.N. envoy arrived in East Timor and said
that a peaceful solution to the long-running conflict in the
Indonesian-controlled territory was within grasp.
	   The U.N. diplomat, Jamsheed Marker, flew aboard an Indonesian
military helicopter to Dili, the seaside capital of the former
Portuguese colony. Upon landing, he warned that any fresh unrest
could delay peace talks that have gained momentum in recent months.
	   ``We are getting very close to an agreement and it is very
important for all persons concerned to maintain peace and not to
resort to any form of violence,'' said Marker, who planned to meet
a range of community leaders and military and government officials.
	   The envoy's trip has heightened fears that rallies timed for his
arrival could trigger riots and derail negotiations between
Indonesia and Portugal, which along with the United Nations does
not recognize Indonesian authority in East Timor.
	   Ignoring an appeal from their spiritual leader to abandon street
demonstrations, some 2,000 separatist protesters meandered through
Dili in a convoy of buses, trucks and motorcycles.
	   Anti-riot police officers with clubs, reinforced plastic shields
and rifles guarded the local Parliament building, a frequent target
of pro-independence rallies. There were no reported incidents of
violence.
	   East Timor's Nobel laureate, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo,
reiterated an appeal that protesters, many of them students, get
off the streets to avoid the possibility of clashes with Indonesian
troops.
	   ``Please stop the demonstrations. It will disturb efforts to
find a peaceful solution in East Timor,'' Belo told reporters after
visiting a high school in Dili on Saturday.
	   ``It will be better if the demonstrators go back home and go to
school because we're coming into Christmas time, so we need a calm
situation,'' said Belo, a co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize
for his efforts to solve the conflict in his troubled homeland.
	   East Timor is predominately Roman Catholic, while some 90
percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim.
	   Belo's message was lost on the protesters who shouted
``independence'' and waved flags of the separatist rebel movement
that has been fighting Indonesian troops since they invaded in
1975. Activists staged similar, peaceful rallies earlier this week.
	   Peace talks chaired by Marker were revitalized earlier this year
after Jakarta offered to grant autonomy to East Timor in exchange
for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   The process picked up speed after the ouster in May of former
authoritarian President Suharto, who took a hard line on the
half-island territory of 800,000 people. His successor and onetime
protege, President B.J. Habibie, has promised nationwide political
reforms and has adopted a more conciliatory approach to East Timor.
	   However, sporadic fighting between guerrillas and the Indonesian
military persists. Many independence activists want a total
withdrawal of Indonesian troops, who have been accused of
widespread human rights abuses over the years.
	   Marker last visited East Timor in July and held talks at that
time under heavy guard by Indonesian troops at a remote airport.
	   During a visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers shot and
killed two pro-independence protesters at a rally outside a Dili
hotel where the envoy was staying.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Thunderous blasts rocked Baghdad before
dawn on Saturday, with U.S. and British forces pressing a punishing
air offensive on Iraq for a third night.
	   Reporters saw fiery streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk
cruise missiles arcing across the sky and landing in giant
fireballs. Warheads exploded a few seconds later, lighting the
pre-dawn horizon in a red glow that silhouetted palm trees against
the dark sky.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling the
sky with booms and bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets
streaked high above.
	   When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens
blaring were heard speeding away. Officials, who must escort
journalists wishing to tour the city, refused to take them to the
targeted areas.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the Friday and Saturday
attacks was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center of
the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Saturday's attack appeared to be the toughest yet against
Baghdad since the U.S. and British militaries began air strikes
early Thursday to punish Iraq for its obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks.
	   In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman said British aircraft
took part in operations Friday night. He refused to say if they
participated in the operations early Saturday.
	   Saturday's explosions were not preceded by air raid sirens,
implying that for the first time the strikes eluded Iraqi air
defenses.
	   When the reverberations from the explosions subsided at about
4:45 a.m. (0145 gmt), the winter air filled with the sounds of
muezzins calling from mosque loudspeakers, informing Muslims to eat
their last meal before beginning the first day of fasting for the
holy month of Ramadan.
	   Clerics declared the start of Ramadan after sighting the moon on
Friday, the 29th day of the preceding month, Shaaban.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice.
	   ``We will not let evil triumph over virtue,'' he said.
	   State-run newspapers on Saturday echoed Saddam's theme. A banner
headline in the Al-Jumhuriya daily read: ``We shall resist and
fight in the name of God.'' Al-Qadissiya wrote that ``History will
be proud'' of Iraq's defiance of the United States.

	   The European Union's single currency becomes a reality on New
Year's Day, a 19th century idea that 20th century politicians hope
will lead them to even greater prosperity in the 21st.
	   The euro is the most concrete _ and monumental _ step yet taken
to forge real union among the peoples of Europe. Monetary union
will provide a huge unified market better able to trade efficiently
with the United States, Asia and elsewhere and give Europe more
economic and political clout.
	   All the excitement over the currency's launch is a bit
artificial, because real euros won't be jingling in the pockets of
ordinary Europeans for three more years. For a while, the euro will
exist as a sort of virtual money alongside existing currencies: It
will be traded on world markets against the dollar and other
currencies. Stock and bond prices will be set in euros. Workers at
multinational companies will be able to receive paychecks
denominated in euros. Banks will offer euro accounts.
	   Associated Press reporters have put together a package of
stories that look at the changes being brought by the euro, both
for Europeans and people elsewhere. The initial stories will move
Saturday, Dec. 20. Other stories in the package will be transmitted
Sunday, Dec. 21, Monday, Dec. 22, and Tuesday, Dec. 23. The stories
will be slugged FEA-The Euro- . The package is accompanied by

the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Saturday's attack appeared to be the toughest yet against
Baghdad since the U.S. and British militaries began air strikes
early Thursday to punish Iraq for its obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf from B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks.
	   In London, a Defense Ministry spokesman said British aircraft
took part in operations Friday night. He refused to say if they
participated in the operations early Saturday.
	   Saturday's explosions were not preceded by air raid sirens,
implying that for the first time the strikes eluded Iraqi air
defenses.
	   When the reverberations from the explosions subsided at about
4:45 a.m. (0145 GMT), the winter air filled with the sounds of
muezzins calling from mosque loudspeakers, informing Muslims to eat
their last meal before beginning the first day of fasting for the
holy month of Ramadan.
	   Clerics declared the start of Ramadan after sighting the moon on
Friday, the 29th day of the preceding month, Shaaban.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice.
	   ``We will not let evil triumph over virtue,'' he said.
	   State-run newspapers on Saturday echoed Saddam's theme. A banner
headline in the Al-Jumhuriya daily read: ``We shall resist and
fight in the name of God.'' Al-Qadissiya wrote that ``History will
be proud'' of Iraq's defiance of the United States.

Malaysian leader says Asian economic crisis hasn't dimmed ambitions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The severe economic crisis in Asia
will not derail Malaysia's plans of joining the ranks of rich and
industrialized nations by the year 2020, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said Saturday.
	   The long-term plan, known as ``Vision 2020,'' was outlined well
before the onset of the Asian financial crisis last year, but
Mahathir said his country was on track to reach the goal despite
suffering from its worst recession in decades.
	   ``Although efforts to attain Vision 2020 may be slowed down due
to the uncontrollable nature of recent events, our vision to attain
a developed country status by 2020 remains intact,'' national news
agency Bernama quoted Mahathir as saying in a speech.
	   While the Malaysian premier remains optimistic, economic
indicators have shown a steady deterioration in the outlook for the
Southeast Asian country's economy.
	   Industrial production sank 10.4 percent in October compared to
the same month a year ago, the inflation rate has risen and the
overall economy shrank 8.6 percent in the third quarter, a dramatic
slowdown from a 7.8 percent growth rate in 1997.
	   The government has even said it may have to lower its full year
forecast for the current year, which now projects a 4.8 percent
contraction.
	   Mahathir cited a pet project, the so-called Multimedia Super
Corridor, as one reason for his optimistic appraisal of Malaysia's
long-term fortunes. He said Saturday that the program would be an
engine of growth by helping the country leap-frog into the
information age.
	   The 4 billion ringgit (dlrs 1 billion) MSC was one of several
megaprojects designed with the Vision 2020 goal in mind. It is
intended to serve as a center for computer chip manufacturing,
software development, and other information technology businesses.
	   ``Indeed, if Asia is prosperous, the MSC and with it the
national economy, will also take off in tandem.''
	   In his speech, Mahathir singled out Japan for praise, thanking
Tokyo for a promise to underwrite Malaysian development projects
with dlrs 2 billion in financial aid.
	   ``We look forward to Japan's economic stimulus initiatives in
both the public and private sectors, which can provide the
necessary impetus for a new cycle of mutual growth,'' he said.

Old idea transformed into Europe's new road to prosperity

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The single European currency, which
becomes a reality on New Year's Day, is a 19th century idea that
20th century politicians hope will lead them to even greater
prosperity in the 21st.
	   The euro, as the European Union has decided to call the new
money, is the most concrete _ and monumental _ step yet taken to
forge real union among the peoples of Europe.
	   ``On Jan. 1, Europe enters a new dimension,'' German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fisher said recently. ``For the first time, a key
part of national sovereignty is being transferred to the Union.''
	   The initial euro club will include 11 of the EU's 15 members _
Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. The nations' 290
million residents will, over time, give up their currencies for the
common money.
	   Britain, Denmark and Sweden opted out of the euro, and Greece
failed to meet the required economic criteria.
	   Monetary union will, among other things, provide a huge unified
market better able to trade efficiently with the United States,
Asia and elsewhere and give Europe more economic and political
clout.
	   It will make the lives of American and other tourists infinitely
easier, sparing them the constant exchange of German marks, French
francs, Spanish pesetas and Italian lire. It will make
continent-wide comparison shopping less difficult. It will simplify
international business and banking, and it will protect enterprises
and consumers against fluctuating exchange rates.
	   All the excitement about the New Year's launch of the euro is a
bit artificial, however, because real euros won't be jingling in
the pockets of ordinary Europeans for three more years. During that
period, the euro will exist only as a sort of virtual money
alongside existing currencies.
	   Some retailers, in an effort to educate the public, have begun
showing prices in both local currencies and euros, but that's
something of a gimmick since no one will be able to pay cash for
retail purchases in euros.
	   And the exact value of the currency won't be known until New
Year's Eve when finance ministers from euro-bloc nations fix the
rates.
	   However, barring some last-minute market rumbling, the euro will
be worth about 6.6 French francs, 14 Austrian schillings and 2
German marks. An American dollar will be worth about 80 euro cents.
	   As a virtual money, the euro will trade on international markets
against the dollar and other currencies. Stock and bond prices will
be set in euros. Workers at multinational companies will be able to
receive paychecks denominated in euros. Banks will let clients open
euro accounts. And governments will allow residents to pay taxes in
euros.
	   Consumers will be able to pay in euros by credit or debit card,
or by check, but only at those retailers that choose to switch
early.
	   Sharing a single currency also means sharing monetary
sovereignty, under the new European Central Bank, something that
worries many Europeans, even many of those who are attracted by the
benefits. In effect, the 11 euro governments have surrendered their
capacity to use monetary policy for domestic political, economic
and social ends in exchange for a number of clear positives.
	   This is not the first time Europeans have tried to put all their
eggs into the same basket.
	   Victor Hugo thought it was a terrific concept way back in 1855.
	   ``A continental currency underpinned by the entire capital of
Europe and driven by the free labor of 200 million people!'' the
French poet and novelist wrote in a letter to exiles from a failed
coup d'etat.
	   ``This single currency would replace and absorb the absurd
monetary variety we have today ... that amounts to so many causes
of impoverishment.''
	   In 1865, France created the Latin Monetary Union with Belgium,
Italy and Greece. They agreed to regulate their currencies
uniformly and make them interchangeable. It was finally abandoned
in 1927, lamed and eventually killed by fluctuating gold and silver
prices, and finally World War I.
	   The idea, however, lived on.
	   The 1957 Treaty of Rome creating the predecessor of the European
Union did not specifically mention monetary union, but it stressed
the need to coordinate policy and abolish restrictions on the
movement of capital.
	   In the 1960s it became clear the Bretton Woods system of global
fixed exchange rates was coming to an end. As the efforts to
control fluctuating currencies within the European trade bloc
turned to jelly, Pierre Werner of Luxembourg laid out a multistage
process for economic and monetary union.
	   It took 20 years, until July 1990, to begin implementing the
first stage. In 1994, the European Monetary Institute was
established, this year becoming the European Central Bank.

The Euro: What countries will use? What will it be worth?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-The Euro &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ In a monumental undertaking, 11
European nations on Jan. 1 will begin trading in their marks,
francs and other national currencies for a new one, the euro.
	   Some questions and answers on what the nations are doing with
the euro, and its significance:
	   Q. Which countries of the European Union are joining the euro?
	   A. Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
	   Q. Which are staying out?
	   A. Britain, Denmark, Greece and Sweden.
	   Q. Why?
	   A. Britain, Denmark and Sweden say they don't want to join, at
least for now. Greece didn't meet the economic standards to
qualify.
	   Q. How much will a euro be worth?
	   A. The exact value of the euro will be set Jan. 1. It is
expected to be slightly stronger than the dollar, around dlrs 1.10
to dlrs 1.20 to a euro. Another way of saying that is the dollar
will be worth between 83 and 91 cents.
	   Q. What will happen when the euro is launched?
	   A. The euro becomes the official currency in the 11 nations.
That means stock exchanges will trade in euros, and large
businesses will keep track of finances in the euro. However, euro
notes and coins won't enter circulation until 2002. To ease the
transition, bank customers can keep accounts in euros _ alongside
national currencies _ starting Jan. 1.
	   Q. Will Americans and other travelers from outside the 11-nation
euro bloc need euros notes, coins or travelers' checks after Jan.
1?
	   A. No. Euro notes and coins won't be available until 2002. For
now, the local currency is still good. Travelers checks will be
available in euros, but aren't a must.
	   Q. Will there be any effect on the dollar?
	   A. That's not yet known, but there could be eventually. The euro
could challenge the dollar as the international currency of choice.
The leaders of the European Central Bank say they won't try for
this, but will leave it up to market forces. However, no sudden
challenge is expected, at least while the euro is gaining
confidence at home and internationally.
	   Q. Who in the United States will be affected?
	   A. Managers at firms that buy or sell in Europe or have
subsidiaries there. The American Chamber of Commerce in Germany
says its 2,600 members in Germany are well-informed about the euro.
The trick will be translating the information across the Atlantic
to the United States, where awareness is low, said Patrick Wilson,
the chamber's manager of trade and investment policy.
	   Q. What are the advantages for business of the euro?
	   A. There are many. The size of the new currency bloc _ with 290
million inhabitants _ will provide a stable economic and business
environment. Businesses will save money; the costs of changing
currencies from country to country will be sharply reduced. With 11
countries operating a single money system, comparing prices will be
quicker, and interest rates will stabilize. All this will make
long-term planning easier.
	   Q. What are the advantages for ordinary consumers?
	   A. Residents of the euro countries also will benefit from it
being easier to compare prices across borders, and they won't have
to change money within the bloc. The same goes for tourists, who
can avoid costly commissions as they move across Europe.
	   Q. Will the euro affect prices in Europe?
	   A. A lot of people are asking this. A leading German consumer
magazine, Stiftung Warentest, says that when shops switch to the
euro ``the temptation to secretly raise prices could be big.'' When
converting a price into euros, stores might be tempted to add a few
cents. For example: A pair of socks should cost 3.90 euros, but a
store might price them at the more traditional 3.99.
	   To avoid this, shops will display the original price alongside
the euro so customers can compare. But customers will have to be
aware. Some stores that do business in a number of countries have
said they may unify their prices, so a blouse at an international
department story will cost the same in Germany as in Austria. Until
now, prices have varied, reflecting national economies.
	   Q. Why did the countries choose to give up their national
currencies?
	   A. The original idea was developed shortly after the end of
World War II. The goal was to link Europe so closely that another
war would be impossible. Political union proved too difficult, with
countries refusing to give up national sovereignty. Economic union,
as symbolized by the common currency, remains a feasible goal.

<TEXT>
	   Eleven European nations launch the euro as their shared currency
Jan. 1. Although euro banknotes and coins won't be in circulation
until 2002, the euro's impact will be clear from Day One.
	   ___
	   EXCHANGE RATES: On Dec. 31, finance ministers permanently fix
rates at which the 11 national currencies will be absorbed into the
euro. Foreign exchange trading in German marks, French francs and
the rest will disappear. When markets reopen Jan. 4, only euros
will be traded against the dollar, Japanese yen and other world
currencies. One euro is expected to be worth around dlrs 1.17.
	   ___
	   FINANCIAL MARKETS: Using the new rates, financial centers around
Europe will work through the holiday to convert accounts and
quotations into euros. Starting Jan. 4, stocks, bonds and mutual
funds will be quoted in euros. Inter-bank dealings will be in
euros. Public debts will be converted into euros.
	   ___
	   BUSINESS: Banks will offer clients the choice of accounts in
euros or national currencies. Some large, multinational companies
plan to switch immediately, but most firms will stick to national
currencies for now. Companies will have to choose whether to use
euros for tax returns, account statements or bookkeeping. The euro
should make it easier and cheaper to transfer funds from
country-to-country and streamline international operations. Banks
will offer financing and cash-management options in euros.
	   ___
	   PRIVATE CITIZENS: Stores are phasing in dual-pricing in euros
and national currencies, allowing consumers to better compare
cross-border prices. However, cash payments will remain in the old
currencies until 2002, so Americans and other visitors will still
have to change money. Banks will offer euro-denominated accounts,
euro check-books and credit-card bills in euros. Consumers will be
able to pay in euros by credit or debit card, or by check, but only
at those retailers that choose to switch early.
	   ___
	   CURRENCIES SWITCHING: Austrian schilling, Belgian franc, Dutch
guilder, Finnish markka, French franc, German mark, Irish punt,
Italian lira, Luxembourg franc, Portuguese escudo and Spanish
peseta.

BJP shows its political determination
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A battering at the polls may have
weakened India's main governing party, but Bharatiya Janata showed
it won't be pushed around during a parliament session that saw
progress on two key pieces of economic legislation.
	   Leftist opponents literally tried to push the Bharatiya Janata
Party-led coalition government last week, scuffling on the floor of
parliament to try to derail a proposal to privatize insurance
companies and allow foreigners a share of the potentially lucrative
market. Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha persevered, and his bill
was introduced.
	   Another bill providing exclusive marketing rights to foreign
agrochemical and pharmaceutical companies selling their products
here met similarly emotional opposition, but again the BJP was able
to introduce it. Passage of the insurance and patent legislation
could still be slowed, but appeared assured because they are
supported by both the conservative BJP and its main opposition, the
centrist Congress party.
	   Unions and the leftist parties joined hands earlier this month
to stage a nationwide strike against the BJP's economic reforms.
The party also faced opposition from the right, with Rashtriya
Swayamsevak Sangh, the conservative Hindu group that created the
BJP, threatening to throw its support elsewhere if swadeshi, or
economic nationalism, was abandoned.
	   Leftists argue working people will be hurt because foreigners
will destroy indigenous business, while rightists look with
suspicion on any outside meddling in the Indian economy. Reformists
say India will be strengthened by new ideas, investment and
entrepreneurs.
	   Moderates within the BJP may in fact have been strengthened by
losses to Congress in assembly elections in two states once
considered its strongholds _ New Delhi, site of the federal
capital; and Rajasthan in the west. Voters were believed angry at
the faltering economy, making reforms crucial.
	   Ironically, it was the opposition Congress that first moved to
abandon socialist policies, when it was in power in the 1990s.
Local newspapers reported some Congress leaders were chafing at now
having to work with the BJP to push through reforms, putting
policy-making over old-style combative politics.
	   The nine-month-old BJP-led government is under pressure to live
up to its promises of providing effective governance after years of
fractious, unstable coalitions.
	   During a speech Friday, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi went on the
offensive, holding the BJP coalition responsible for inflation,
unemployment and industrial recession. But she also made clear she
was in no hurry to plunge India back into uncertainty by trying to
bring down the BJP government.

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The Rev. Marcelo Rossi readies a bucket
of water and flashes a grin that might be devilish if it weren't on
the face of a priest.
	   ``Here! Here!'' screams the crowd, mostly women. The 6-foot-4
(1.94 meter) former gym teacher rears back and sends a jet of holy
water over the feverish congregation. Then another, and another.
Soon everyone within 50 feet (15 meters) of the stage is soaked _
and ecstatic.
	   It's not your average Catholic mass. But Rossi is anything but
an average priest.
	   With his matinee-idol looks and a chart-topping record, ``Music
to Praise the Lord,'' Rossi regularly draws crowds of 70,000 to the
masses he celebrates four times a week in a former bottle factory
on Sao Paulo's south side.
	   The turnout is surprising. Although some 80 percent of
Brazilians ostensibly are Catholics, far fewer regularly attend
church.
	   Rossi is part of a new generation of clerics who belong to the
Catholic Church's charismatic movement. The local press has dubbed
them ``pop star priests.''
	   Others include Padre Zeca, the ``surfing priest,'' who recently
drew 35,000 people to a mass on Ipanema Beach in Rio de Janeiro.
Basketball-playing priest Giovanni Carlos has a big following in
Brasilia, the nation's capital.
	   Brought to Brazil in the late 1960s by U.S. priest Harold J.
Hans, the charismatic church is Catholicism's response to the
rising popularity of Protestant evangelism, especially among the
poor.
	   Protestant evangelists offer a direct communion with the holy
spirit, as well as strict codes of dress and behavior that many
poor Brazilians found appealing. The charismatics stick to the
Catholic liturgy, but with audience-friendly language and
activities.
	   ``The charismatics attract their following by preaching simple,
even saccharine sermons, and the young people are attracted by the
plain language, the singing and dancing,'' explains Rev. Estevao
Bittencourt, theology professor at Rio's Sao Bento Monastery.
	   A typical mass is followed by a ``festinha,'' or little party,
where Rossi leads the crowd in his ``Aerobics of the Lord.'' Taking
a page from the evangelists, he leads the congregation in jumping,
singing and air-boxing.
	   ``With the traditional mass, I used to think one hour was too
long, but with Padre Rossi, two or three hours doesn't even seem
like enough,'' said Idione Cassia Silva, a 34-year-old housewife.
	   A Rossi mass deploys close to 1,000 people to handle the crowds
and 80 other priests to distribute the 15,000 communion wafers
consumed at every service.
	   Today, Rossi's face smiles from the cover of half a dozen
magazines on newsstands. His posters hang alongside those of movie
idols Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt.
	   Millions tune in to watch him sing, dance and lead audiences in
prayer on popular TV programs, usually flanked by the shows'
dancers barely dressed in spandex and skin-tight vinyl.
	   With 2.7 million copies sold, ``Music to Praise the Lord'' is
the No. 1 record in Brazil, and his record company predicts sales
will grow as Christmas approaches.
	   Rossi is self-effacing. He says all the royalties go to charity
and denies he has gone Hollywood.
	   ``Be a fan of God. I'm not a phenomenon, I only want to bring
young people to the Church,'' Rossi recently told popular kiddie TV
show hostess Xuxa.
	   But when The Associated Press asked for an interview, he said
his record label wouldn't allow it. ``I have promised Polygram I
would not talk to the press and I am a man of my word,'' he said.
	   A spokeswoman for Polygram said the order to avoid the media
came from Bishop Fernando Figueiredo, who did not return phone
calls.
	   The charismatic movement has been approved by the Vatican, and
Pope John Paul II has met with members of the movements during
visits to pareish churches in Rome.
	   But among some clergy, concern is growing that Rossi-mania may
be getting out of hand.
	   ``I worry that the idea of faith as bringing yourself
unconditionally into the hands of God takes second place to the
idea of faith as a supermarket, where you pray to God in return for
something material,'' said the most Rev. Antonio Celso Queiroz,
auxiliary bishop of Sao Paulo for the Ipiranga region.
	   Queiroz also worries that the Rossi phenomenon is more about
marketing than religion.
	   ``Marketing creates the success,'' he said. ``When the person
stops singing and tries to talk about church doctrine, I wonder if
the television shows will still be interested.''

Allegations of bribery now in hands of ethics panel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MATTHEW BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ A burgeoning bribery scandal suggesting
the 2002 Winter Games were bought and sold is now in the hands of
an independent ethics panel to determine if there was any
misconduct by local officials.
	   ``I'm glad this has now happened,'' Frank Joklik, president and
CEO of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, said after board members
emerged from Friday's 5 1/2-hour emergency meeting called to deal
with the scandal.
	   The committee turned the investigation over to a five-member
ethics panel that would, according to a written resolution, be
``free from any direction or control'' by organizers.
	   The panel's report, to be made public, will be due no later than
Feb. 11.
	   ``We acknowledge the seriousness of this matter,'' said board
chairman Robert Garff. ``We regret any and all embarrassment this
has caused the citizens of the state of Utah.''
	   A poll conducted this week for KSL-TV found that news of scandal
has not swayed opinion for or against the 2002 Winter Games.
Sixty-two percent said the controversy has made no difference in
their support for the Olympics, which were favored by 55 percent of
those surveyed.
	   The poll by Dan Jones -and- Associates had a 5 percent margin of
error.
	   Salt Lake's efforts to cozy up to key International Olympic
Committee members _ including providing college scholarships to
some of their children _ have set off a firestorm over the 2002 bid
and the way the IOC selects host cities.
	   As a result, the IOC has launched its own inquiry into charges
that some members and unscrupulous agents may have sold their
votes. And the U.S. Olympic Committee said it could open its own
investigation depending on what action Salt Lake takes.
	   The FBI in Salt Lake confirmed that it, too, at the behest of
Attorney General Janet Reno, was reviewing the allegations to
determine whether to open a formal investigation.
	   ``We're trying to determine whether the facts and allegations
fall under one of the statutes we're responsible for enforcing,''
special agent George Dougherty said.
	   Suhel Attarabulsi, 26, whose father is Libyan IOC member Bashir
Attarabulsi, told the Deseret News on Friday that the money Salt
Lake's bid committee gave to send him to school in Utah was not
meant to buy his father's vote. He said he does not know how his
father voted in the secret ballot to determine what city would host
the 2002 Games.
	   Attarabulsi said checks for his tuition and books stopped coming
two months ago and he does not expect to receive any further
assistance.
	   After Friday's meeting, SLOC chairman Robert Garff said nobody
had asked for Joklik or the committee's senior vice president, Dave
Johnson, to resign. The two were heavily involved for a decade in
securing the bid.
	   ``At this point in time we have no reasons to believe that there
are any improprieties until the ethics board reports,'' Garff said.
	   The ethics committee's probe is not restricted to just the
city's 1998 and 2002 bids, but to anything bearing on the conduct
of local Olympic officials. SLOC will foot the bill for the panel,
which can employ attorneys, accountants or any other necessary
help.
	   Among those likely to be questioned is Tom Welch, who ran Salt
Lake's bid and left the SLOC two years ago after a no-contest plea
to a domestic violence charge. Welch defended a scholarship program
that the SLOC is alleged to have used as a possible front to secure
IOC votes.
	   ``What I hope happens from this is that there is a better
recognition and understanding that goes into the process'' of
winning an Olympic bid, Welch said. ``You have to know what it is
and what it isn't. And it isn't the Olympic competition. It's the
business side of it.''
	   And that, said Welch, involves wooing members of the IOC, giving
them gifts and ``letting them know who their friends are.''
	   Welch's comments were lent stark credence by a prominent Salt
Lake plastic surgeon, who said Welch pleaded with him to perform
free cosmetic surgery on an IOC member in the months before Salt
Lake won the bid in 1995.
	   ``Tom told me it was the way in the past and the way in the
future that places got these kinds of things,'' Dr. Rick Anderson
told The Associated Press.
	   Anderson, who would not identify the IOC member because of
privacy considerations, said the IOC member could have afforded the
dlrs 7,000 procedure to remove bags from his eyes.
	   Welch was not immediately available to comment on Anderson's
assertion.

Brother of jailed former No. 2 Malaysian leader loses court appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The adopted brother of Malaysia's
jailed former No. 2 leader failed to win reprieve on Saturday from
a six-month prison sentence when an appeals court dismissed his
case.
	   Sukma Darmawan was imprisoned for allegedly engaging in sodomy
with his brother by adoption, Anwar Ibrahim, the Southeast Asian
country's ex-deputy prime minister. He is said to have confessed to
a homosexual relationship with Anwar.
	   Sukma petitioned judicial authorities by arguing he should have
been tried by an Islamic Shariat Court, not under civil law. But an
appellate court on Saturday upheld an earlier decision by
Malaysia's High Court to reject his plea.
	   Sukma's confession was widely believed likely to be used to
prosecute Anwar, a prominent dissident who faces a number of sexual
misconduct charges and is currently on trial for alleged abuse of
power while in office.
	   Anwar denies the allegations against him, saying they are part
of a political plot to derail a challenge he posed to Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   Anwar was sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir on Sept. 2 and
arrested 18 days later.
	   Sukma heard the court ruling without showing any reaction,
sitting quietly with his hands folded on his lap. His lawyer,
Karpal Singh, said he would seek a reversal of the latest judgment
in the Federal Court on Monday.
	   Sukma has also filed a separate appeal seeking the overturning
of his conviction because he claims police coerced him into making
a guilty plea.

Russian parliament to debate budget on Christmas Eve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament will hold an extraordinary
meeting next Thursday to begin debate on the country's 1999 budget,
the chairman of the State Duma's Budget Committee said Saturday.
	   Alexander Zhukov said the draft plan would be submitted for
discussion by the Duma's economic committees on Monday, and would
be given a first reading in parliament on Dec. 24, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government wants the budget
passed before January so it can chart a course for taking the
country out of its economic depression.
	   The parliament originally planned to start debate on the
2,550-page document on Wednesday, Interfax said.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, the one-day delay is a
result of a planned trip by Primakov to Kazakstan Dec. 23-24.
Primakov is expected to formally submit the budget to parliament,
the news agency said.
	   The Duma must vote on the budget three times, and it also plans
to debate 19 tax bills accompanying the document.
	   Russia's economy suffered a major setback in August after the
government devalued the ruble and froze some debt payments.
Primakov has moved cautiously to develop a plan that would end the
crisis and reverse years of economic decline.
	   The Russian ruble continued its steady slide on Friday, trading
at 20.75 a dollar compared to 20.7 the previous day. Before the
crisis, the ruble was trading at about 6 to the dollar.
	   The draft budget envisages 30 percent inflation in 1999 and an
average ruble rate of 21.5 to the U.S. dollar _ a target most
experts consider unrealistic. The ruble has already plummeted below
22 to the dollar in street trading, and is not expected to stop its
drop any time soon.
	   In recent years, the government and parliament have battled for
months before passing the annual budget. However, Primakov's team
has widespread support in the Communist-dominated Duma, raising
hopes that the budget can be approved without lengthy debate.

England turns on the runs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ England's cricketers enjoyed a
morale-boosting run feast Saturday under some questionable bowling
by the Australian XI on the first day of a four-day match.
	   Michael Atherton, who celebrated his temporary return to
captaincy by winning the toss and batting all day for a chanceless
154, led England to 298-3 at stumps. He will resume Sunday with
Graeme Hick, who is on 14.
	   But Australia's second-best team, brimming with players
desperate to catch the selectors' eyes, looked more like a hospital
XI.
	   Offspinner Gavin Robertson suffered a back spasm at training
Friday and hopes that he'd recover in time were not fulfilled. He
never took the field.
	   Medium pacer Paul Reiffel did that, but little more. After
bowling nine balls he retired with a groin strain, never to
reappear.
	   This brought Allan Border, who's coaching the Australians, to
the field as 13th man. Soon the former Australian captain was
scurrying towards the boundary in pursuit of an off drive.
	   However, before too many demands were made on Border's
athleticism, Sam Fingas, a 17-year-old local grade cricketer, was
given an unexpected chance to mingle with the elite. (djp)

Upcoming Singapore budget unlikely to include more stimulus
</HEADLINE>
measures

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's next government budget is unlikely
to include further funding for special stimulus measures designed
to bolster the island republic's ailing economy, said Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
	   Lee, who made the remark in a recent television interview, the
transcript of which was released on Saturday, said the government
was reluctant to debut new measures until it has assessed the
impact of recently approved steps to slash business costs.
	   A wide-ranging dlrs 6 billion stimulus package was approved last
month to help businesses cope with Singapore's first recession in
13 years.
	   ``If the situation changes, we must of course adjust our
policies, but we need some time to evaluate the impact of the
measures,'' Lee said in the interview. ``So I do not expect any
significant additional initiatives in the budget'' to be unveiled
in February.
	   Many of the initiatives _ including a painful 15 percent
reduction in overall wage costs that will slash salaries, pension
payments and other worker income _ will not take effect until the
start of 1999.
	   The government hopes to regain competitiveness lost to neighbors
in the region, which have lower labor costs than Singapore.
	   ``The measures will definitely improve our competitiveness
significantly, and save many jobs,'' Lee said. ``But whether the
measures will be enough is more difficult to say.''
	   Responding to criticisms that the government was not using
enough of its substantial 120 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 73
billion) in reserves to combat the economic slowdown, Lee said
dipping deeply into national savings was not the answer to the
city-state's woes.
	   ``If in this situation we refuse to tighten our belts, our
reserves would soon be gone,'' he said. ``Worse, we would be seen
to be a people unable to take hardship, we have gone soft after too
many years of affluence.''
	   But if a protracted global recession ensues, Lee said the
government would draw further on its reserves.
	   ``But we must always do so reluctantly, as a last resort,'' he
said. ``Let us do our best to solve the problem by our own
efforts.''

Rain again disrupts play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COOLUM, Australia (AP) _ An electrical storm halted sentimental
favorite Stuart Appleby's attempt to overcome leader Craig Spence
in the Coolum Classic pro-am Saturday.
	   The alarm clocks will be set early Sunday with all but six of
the 56 professionals having to return at 6 a.m. local time to
finish their third rounds.
	   Craig Mears (71), Adam Crawford (72), Adam Le Vesconte (73),
Stuart Thompson (73), Paul Harford (76) and Lucas Parsons (78) will
be able to sleep in after beating the storm.
	   Organizers will utilise a two-tee format to get through the
final round, weather permitting.
	   When played was officially stopped, Spence (65-67) was 14 under
after 46 holes, Appleby (69-70) 12 under through 47 holes and Paul
Moloney (68-68) and Peter Senior (73-70) next on eight under after
completing 46 and 51 holes respectively.
	   Appleby _ who dragged himself out of bed at 4 a.m. to complete
his storm-stalled second round with a 70 _ scorched around the
Hyatt Coolum's front-nine layout in a blistering 30 shots.
	   He launched his third-day assault with three successive birdies
before officials sounded the warning siren due to lightning in the
area.
	   ``I'm going to be playing hard (tomorrow),'' said Appleby, still
on a high from last week's Presidents Cup victory by the
International side over the United States.
	   ``I'm not going to be worried about laying up anywhere ... I'll
be going for all the flags.'' (djp)

Taiwanese investment in China falls amid concerns about regional
</HEADLINE>
crisis

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Concerned about a regional economic
crisis, Taiwanese companies made only U.S. dlrs 47 million worth of
investment in mainland China last month, a 49 percent drop from the
same month a year ago, the government said Saturday.
	   Overall, investment in China fell 3.65 percent in the first 11
months of the year, Taiwan's Investment Commission said.
	   Officials said investment slowed mainly because of China's grim
export prospects as a result of the Asian economic crisis.
	   Measures taken by China recently to prevent tax evasion have
also driven some potential investors away, they said.
	   A Taiwanese government ban on big or infrastructure-related
investment in China has also led to the decline, they said.

Indonesians condemn U.S. military strikes against Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 50 Indonesian students staged a
protest outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday against U.S. President
Bill Clinton's decision to order military strikes on Iraq.
	   Shouting ``hang Clinton,'' the demonstration by members of an
Islamic student group ended peacefully after the unfurling of a big
banner with a slogan that read: ``Bill Clinton  &QC;  Hitler.''
	   The U.S. air strikes on the eve of the Muslim holiday of Ramadan
also drew criticism from Indonesian legislative leaders and members
of a newly founded Islamic political party.
	   Meanwhile, the chairwoman of Parliament's foreign affairs
commission, Aisyah Aminy, said the deadly attacks violated human
rights, the official Antara news agency reported.
	   ``The attacks should not merely be settled and stopped but
should also be criticized strongly by all peace-loving communities
because the deeds are contemptible and against human rights,''
Aminy said.
	   She also criticized the United Nations Security Council, saying
it is dominated by powerful nations that protect their own
interests and not those of the broader international community.
	   Predominately Muslim Indonesia is a leading member of the
Non-Aligned Movement, a group of developing nations that is often
critical of the West.
	   Legislator Lukman Harun, a prominent figure in one of
Indonesia's largest Muslim groups, Muhammadiyah, also said the
attacks by the United States and Britain were an affront to those
who revere human rights.
	   Several thousand supporters of the Justice Party, a Muslim party
founded after the ouster of authoritarian President Suharto in May,
marched through the streets of Jakarta. They chanted political
slogans and also condemned the U.S. air attacks.
	   ``Stop international terrorism,'' read one of their banners.

Pakistan says dispute with US over F-16 fighter planes resolved
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said
Saturday Pakistan's long-standing dispute with the United States
over the purchase of 28 F-16 fighter planes has been resolved.
	   Pakistan will get dlrs 467 million from Washington, the
outstanding amount of the money it paid for the fighter planes it
never received. Earlier Pakistan had received dlrs 157 million as
partial repayment.
	   ``The F-16s issue has been a long-standing and a persistent
irritant in our bilateral relations with the United States,''
Sharif told a news conference. ``For almost a whole decade now this
issue has been hanging fire between the two countries because, in
all these years, the U.S. refused to give us the planes as well as
our money.''
	   But that's over now and the money will be returned, he said.
	   ``I am delighted that this issue has been satisfactorily
settled,'' he said.
	   Delivery of the fighter aircraft was stopped after 1990 when the
United States stopped all military and humanitarian aid to Pakistan
to protest its nuclear program.
	   The repayment of the money to Pakistan will be divided into a
dlrs 327 million cash payment before the end of December and a dlrs
140 million payment in wheat and other commodities over the next
two years, he said.
	   ``As Pakistan must make annual purchases of wheat against cash,
we deem this arrangement to be entirely satisfactory and as good as
receiving cash payment,'' Sharif said.
	   Sharif, who met U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington
earlier this month, said ``in a statesman like manner, he (Clinton)
has honored his commitment.''

Arab League postpones meeting, militants issue threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League has postponed an emergency
meeting on the U.S. air strikes on Iraq that had been scheduled for
Sunday, the Al-Ahram daily reported Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, a Muslim militant group has threatened to avenge the
American and British missile attacks, the London-based Al-Hayat
newspaper reported.
	   The paper quoted a statement by the Islamic Jihad-Vanguards of
Conquest saying ``We will avenge what has happened to the children
of our people in Iraq.''
	   It added: ``The crimes committed by the United States against
our Islamic people will not pass without punishment.''
	   Both groups were active in a campaign by Muslim extremists,
launched in 1992, to try to overthrow Egypt's secular government
and replace it with strict Islamic rule.
	   They have sometimes threatened attacks against Western interests
to avenge perceived injustice against Muslims.
	   Al-Ahram said the meeting of the 21-member league was put off at
the request of Iraq.
	   No reason was given for the decision, and officials at the Arab
League could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   The paper quoted the league's deputy secretary-general, Ahmed
Ben Hili, as saying that Iraq's representative had called him
Friday and requested the postponement.
	   The league has been sharply divided on the question of Iraq
since the Baghdad regime invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the 1991 Gulf War. Kuwait and its Gulf allies have not
forgiven Iraq for the seven-month occupation, and many Arab
countries still do not have full diplomatic ties with Baghdad.
	   The United States and Britain have carried out three nights of
missile attacks to punish Iraq for failing to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors, who are charged with seeking out and
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The attacks have been the heaviest since the Gulf War.
	   Iraq says at least 25 people have died in the attacks and 75
were wounded.

Large new pro-Iraq protest erupts in West Bank despite ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Defying a police ban on pro-Iraq
demonstrations, about 3,000 Palestinians carrying Iraqi flags and
screaming ``Death to Israel _ death to America!'' marched Saturday
in the West Bank town of Hebron.
	   The marchers, some wearing black hoods or masked with keffiyehs,
carried posters of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein as they marched
near Hebron University. Palestinian police did not attempt to
restrain them.
	   ``No war for Monica!'' the marchers yelled. ``Our blood and our
soul will redeem Iraq!''
	   The rally drew Palestinian political groups from across the
political spectrum, ranging from the radical Islamic group Hamas to
Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction.
	   The Fatah participation came despite a declaration by Arafat's
police chief in Gaza that such demonstrations were banned. At the
same time, Palestinian authorities shut down media broadcasting
pro-Iraqi sentiments and detained journalists _ including some
working for foreign media outlets _ who covered pro-Iraqi unrest.
	   The Palestinian leadership is in a dilemma. On the one hand, it
is anxious to curb the unmitigated backing Palestinians gave Saddam
Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that set back the
Palestinian cause in the West.
	   At the same time, however, it apparently wants to allow some
outlet for Palestinian street sentiment in favor of Iraq.
	   On Friday, protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip
gathered after morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting _ marchers on
Friday chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and ``Death to
America, death to Clinton, death to Britain!''
	   Anticipating the demonstration, authorities made sure to strip
the city of the U.S. flags that had hung from electricity poles
during the Clinton visit. Protesters found a few leftover plastic
U.S. flags, and wrapped them around their shoes in a sign of
contempt.
	   After the demonstration, marchers threw stones at Israeli troops
guarding the entrance to the city. The troops responded with rubber
bullets and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were injured.

Israeli helicopters raid suspected guerrilla bases in Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli helicopters repeatedly struck at
suspected guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon overnight to
retaliate for attacks on Israeli troops, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   On Saturday, Israeli troops and the Lebanese guerrillas
exchanged artillery and mortar fire around Sojod, about 22
kilometers (14 miles) southeast of the port city of Sidon, the
officials said.
	   They had no immediate reports of casualties.
	   The helicopters targeted positions of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in Majdel Selim, the officials said. At
least three air-to-surface rockets were fired, they said.
	   The village faces Israel's self-styled ``security zone,'' which
the Jewish state set up in southern Lebanon in 1985 to try to
prevent cross-border attacks on Israel's northern settlements.
	   On Friday night, a helicopter also targeted an area between the
villages of Majdel Selim and Kabrikha, which are about 25
kilometers (15 miles) east of Lebanon's port city of Tyre.
	   Bases manned by Israel's South Lebanon Army militia also fired
mortars and 155mm howitzers at villages facing the security zone,
the officials said. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The helicopter raids apparently were in response to repeated
Hezbollah attacks on Israeli outposts nearby.
	   Israeli troops often use helicopters or jets against guerrillas
in southern Lebanon. The guerrillas, led by Hezbollah, have been
trying to drive some 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,500 militia
allies out of Lebanon.

China defeats Thailand 3-0 for Asian Games soccer bronze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led with Iran-Kuwait gold medal game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China easily dominated Thailand for a
3-0 victory Saturday to seize the bronze medal in Asian Games
soccer, dashing the host nation's hopes of capturing its first
soccer medal ever in the regional competition.
	   The top two scorers of the tournament _ Ali Daei of Iran with
eight and Farj Laheeb of Kuwait with nine _ were to square off
later Saturday in the game to decide the gold.
	   Crystal Palace star Fan Zhiyi opened the scoring in the 25th
minute before a capacity crowd of 20,000 screaming, flag-waving
Thais in the southern city of Songkhla, slotting a free kick
through a break in the Thai defensive wall for the only score in
the first half.
	   Substitute Wang Peng added the insurance about 20 minutes into
the second half, taking a 12-meter shot that caromed off the keeper
into the back of the net. Ma Mingyu later came down the right side
and fired 20 meters at a tight angle into the far corner for the
final 3-0 score.
	   The goals were the third each in the games for Ma and Wang and
the second for Fan.
	   The Thais were a laggard shadow of the side that upset heavily
favored South Korea in Monday's quarterfinal. Under English coach
Peter Withe, they were hoping to better their best Asian Games
finish _ fourth place in 1990 _ but China's superior depth kept
them at bay.
	   For China also, the result was a disappointing decline from its
silver at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, four years ago.
The young Chinese squad lost twice to Gulf power Iran in the
tournament, once in a preliminary group and again in Wednesday's
semifinal.

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Pilots aboard this U.S.
aircraft carrier Saturday reported their most successful night yet
of bombing and armed their warplanes for more strikes despite the
arrival of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month.
	   ``We're preparing for another night. We're expecting to
continue,'' said Adm. James Cutler Dawson, commander of the
Enterprise Battle Group in the Gulf.
	   ``If nights one and two were good, night three was the best,''
he said.
	   The activity aboard the aircraft carrier countered speculation
that the U.S. and British air assault would be called off for
Ramadan, which began Saturday in Iraq. Some nations begin the month
of dawn-to-dusk fasts on Sunday because of later sightings of the
moon.
	   The third night of attacks was officially over about 6 a.m.
(0300 gmt) with the return of the last warplanes to the vessel.
Dawson said pilots reported ``very good'' success at striking
targets, but he would not specify what was hit.
	   The jets took off in waves from the carrier deck throughout the
night. Tomahawk cruise missiles, carrying 1,000-pound
(454-kilogram) conventional warheads, were fired from other ships
in the Gulf flotilla.
	   Already, more cruise missiles have been launched than the 289
fired at Iraq during the entire, five-week Gulf War in 1991.
	   Iraqis continued to respond with anti-aircraft fire, but there
have been no reports of any warplanes hit.
	   ``We saw Triple-A (anti-aircraft artillery), but it's nothing we
haven't expected or haven't been able to combat,'' said Dawson.
	   Airmen indicated the attacks weren't winding down at all.
	   ``We're here to do a mission,'' said Lt. Pete Courtney, a radar
intercept officer flying an F-14 Tomcat. ``If that takes three days
or if that takes three weeks ... whatever they want us to do, we're
all ready to do it.''
	   Many aboard the Enterprise, including some Gulf War veterans,
supported pressing ahead with the attacks to finally end the years
of confrontation between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the
West.
	   ``I think I speak for most people when I say Saddam's games are
getting old. Time to put a stop to it,'' said Lt. John Taylor, an
F-18 pilot from St. Petersburg, Florida.
	   Lt. Cmdr. Timothy Gedney, a pilot on the E2C Hawkeye
surveillance and radar aircraft, noted that U.S. planes have been
in the skies over Iraq almost constantly since the 1991 Gulf War
and afterward monitoring no-fly zones.
	   ``So it's definitely familiar, the people who've been over here
again and again in the past eight years,'' said Gedney of Norfolk,
Virginia.
	   He bristled at suggestions that U.S. President Bill Clinton
ordered the air strikes in an attempt to bolster support as
impeachment proceedings move through Congress.
	   ``That's ridiculous ... This has been building up to this for a
long, long time,'' he said. ``And the fact that impeachment
proceedings happen to coincide with what's going on is, again, just
coincidence.''

Shishigina returns from drug ban to Asian Games record
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kazakstan's Olga Shishigina, who
returned this season from a two-year drug ban, set an Asian Games
record of 12.63 seconds in the women's 100-meter hurdles Saturday.
	   Shishigina had tested positive in a meet in early 1996 for
stanozolol, the same steroid that turned up in Canadian sprinter
Ben Johnson's drug test at the 1988 Olympics.
	   She was banned for four years, but the IAAF, the sport's
governing body, cut that to two in May 1996. She had been
considered one of the favorites for the 1996 Olympic gold medal
after a time of 12.44 seconds _ still the Asian record _ in 1995
and a second place behind American Gail Devers at the 1995 worlds.
	   On Saturday, Shishigina, who returned to competition at the
Asian track championships in July, ran 12.63 into the wind, one of
the top times of 1998. That beat the games record of 12.73 set by
China's Liu Huajin of China in 1990.
	   China's Liu Jing was second in 12.82.
	   In the men's 110 hurdles, China's Chen Yanhao won easily in
13.65 seconds, far off the 13.30 games mark set by another Chinese,
Li Tong, in 1994.
	   Chen took control of the race by the fourth hurdle and gradually
moved out to a two-meter victory over Kazakstan's Andrei
Sklyarenko, 13.86. Third was Qatar's Hamad al-Dosari, 13.99, the
only other runner under 14.00.
	   Qatar's Mohammed Taib built his Asian Games gold collection over
eight years to five by winning a slow men's 5,000.
	   He last won the 5,000 in the 1990 games, and has won the 1,500
at three games, including these.
	   With seven laps to go, there were seven runners bunched in
front, headed by Japan's Seiji Kushibe and Jun Hiratsuka.
	   With two laps to go, the pace quickened. South Korea's Baek
Seung-do took the lead, and Taib and Qatar's Ahmed Hashim followed.
	   In the final lap, Taib moved easily in front with 200 meters to
go and established a large lead before slowing at the finish to win
in 13 minutes, 55.79 seconds. Hashim took the silver in 13:56.65,
with Baek third in 13:57.11
	   After Saturday's eight finals, only the marathon is left in the
track and field portion of the games, with China battling Japan for
the overall lead in medals.
	   At the 1994 games, China had 22 golds in the sport, paced by its
women, who took 14 of 19 events.
	   But this time China's women have faltered, losing all the middle
distance races that they dominated between 1993 and 1994, when
members of coach Ma Junren's training group set world records in
the 1,500, 3,000 and 10,000.
	   At these games, aside from Shishigina's hurdles time, the only
other world-class mark for the women was in the marathon, where
Japan's Naoko Takashashi set the fifth best time ever in the event,
just one minute off the world's best.

India's P.T. Usha bids farewell to Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For P.T. Usha, a medal at her last
Asian Games would have been a dream finish to a remarkably long
career that has made her an Indian track legend. But it wasn't to
be.
	   Usha, 33, bowed out from her fifth Asian Games without running
Saturday in what had been expected to be her last race. Plagued by
a hamstring injury and feeling low after performing poorly earlier
in the week, Usha was not included in the 4 x 400 Indian squad in
Saturday's final.
	   ``I feel sorry. I wanted that her last race would be graceful,''
said her coach, Jasvinder Bhutia. ``It is a sad dismissal.''
	   Usha burst into Indian athletics 20 years ago as a shy
13-year-old in pigtails. Since then, she has picked up a slew of
Asian track medals and came closest to being the first Indian to
win an Olympic track and field medal, missing bronze by 0.01
seconds in the 400-meter hurdles at the 1984 games.
	   She emerged from retirement to run in the Asian Track
Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, this July. She was third, in 23.46
seconds, in the 200 and anchored India's victorious 4 x 100 relay.
Usha also anchored India's silver medal team in 4 x 400, which
finished .16 seconds behind China.
	   But her training for the Bangkok games was disrupted by a heel
injury and a hamstring strained at a November meet in the eastern
city of Calcutta, when she collapsed in the 200.
	   The injuries effectively ruined Usha's swan song. She did not
qualify for the 200 final and was sixth in the 400, her favorite
event. The poor results led to her missing Saturday's final.
India's team doctor, Rakesh Kaushal, said her confidence was also
``a little bit on the low side'' to run following her disappointing
earlier races.
	   ``We have a better girl,'' said Lalit Bhanot, secretary of the
Amateur Athletic Federation of India. ``We knew that she wasn't
going to do well.''
	   India's women got silver in Saturday's 4 x 400. But Usha wasn't
on hand to see it. Her coach said she was staying away from the
track Saturday because it was too painful for her watch and not
take part.
	   ``She was feeling very bad that she wasn't running,'' he said.
``It is bad luck. Without injury, she has such will power that she
definitely would have won a medal.''

Pro-Iraq protests erupt despite ban; seven Palestinians hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with clash with Israeli troops in Hebron, smaller
protest in Gaza, Palestinian journalists' syndicate calling strike &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Defying a ban on pro-Iraq
demonstrations, about 3,000 Palestinians screaming ``Death to
Israel _ death to America!'' marched Saturday in the West Bank town
of Hebron. Clashes with Israeli troops afterward injured seven
protesters.
	   Another demonstration took place in the southern Gaza Strip town
of Rafah, where about 400 Palestinian protesters burned U.S. and
British flags. Police dispersed them, but without using force.
	   In the West Bank, Palestinian police did not attempt to restrain
the marchers as they set out from Hebron University, some wearing
black hoods or masked with keffiyehs, carrying posters of Iraqi
president Saddam Hussein.
	   When the marchers reached the center of town, where several
Jewish settler enclaves are located, about 400 protesters broke
away from the main rally and hurled stones at Israeli troops. The
soldiers responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
	   All of the injuries to protesters were from rubber-coated
bullets.
	   The Hebron rally drew Palestinian political groups from across
the political spectrum, ranging from the radical Islamic group
Hamas to Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction.
	   The Fatah participation came despite a declaration by Arafat's
police chief in Gaza that such demonstrations were banned.
Palestinian authorities also shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi
sentiments and detained journalists _ including some working for
foreign media outlets _ who covered pro-Iraqi unrest.
	   On Saturday, the Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a
strike to protest the curbs.
	   The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership.
On the one hand, it is anxious to curb the unmitigated backing
Palestinians gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that
set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   At the same time, however, Arafat's government apparently wants
to allow some outlet for Palestinian street sentiment in favor of
Iraq.
	   On Friday, protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip
gathered after morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting _ marchers on
Friday chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and ``Death to
America, death to Clinton, death to Britain!''
	   Anticipating the demonstration, authorities made sure to strip
the city of the U.S. flags that had hung from electricity poles
during the Clinton visit. Protesters found a few leftover plastic
U.S. flags, and wrapped them around their shoes in a sign of
contempt.
	   After the demonstration, marchers threw stones at Israeli troops
guarding the entrance to the city. The troops responded with rubber
bullets and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were injured.

Arab League postpones meeting, militants issue threat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League has postponed Sunday's
emergency meeting to discuss the U.S. airstrikes on Iraq, the
Al-Ahram daily reported Saturday.
	   Meanwhile, a Muslim militant group has threatened to avenge the
American and British missile attacks, the London-based Al-Hayat
newspaper reported.
	   The paper quoted a statement by the Islamic Jihad-Vanguards of
Conquest saying ``We will avenge what has happened to the children
of our people in Iraq.''
	   It added: ``The crimes committed by the United States against
our Islamic people will not pass without punishment.''
	   Both groups were active in a campaign by Muslim extremists,
launched in 1992, to try to overthrow Egypt's secular government
and replace it with strict Islamic rule.
	   They have sometimes threatened attacks against Western interests
to avenge perceived injustice against Muslims.
	   Al-Ahram said the meeting of the 21-member league was put off at
the request of Iraq.
	   No reason was given for the decision, and officials at the Arab
League could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   The paper quoted the league's deputy secretary-general, Ahmed
Ben Hili, as saying that Iraq's representative had called him
Friday and requested the postponement.
	   The league has been sharply divided on the question of Iraq
since the Baghdad regime invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the 1991 Gulf War. Kuwait and its Gulf allies have not
forgiven Iraq for the seven-month occupation, and many Arab
countries still do not have full diplomatic ties with Baghdad.
	   The United States and Britain have carried out three nights of
missile attacks to punish Iraq for failing to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors, who are charged with seeking out and
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The attacks have been the heaviest since the Gulf War.
	   Iraq says at least 25 people have died in the attacks and 75
were wounded.

Bad light and fog deny play on third day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Zimbabwe brightened its chances of
recording its first series victory away from home after fog
prevented play for the third successive day in the third and final
cricket test against Pakistan in Faisalabad on Saturday.
	   Although the fog was not dense, poor light forced umpires Dough
Cowie and Salim Badar to rule out play shortly after noon. Dense
fog had denied play on the first two days.
	   Zimbabwe leads the three-match series 1-0 after winning the
first test by seven wickets. The second Test was also marred by
dense fog at Lahore as 13 hours were lost in the drawn game due to
poor visibility.

	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Sailors rearmed their warplanes
for more strikes against Iraq Saturday, despite the arrival of
Ramadan, the Muslim holy month.
	   ``We're preparing for another night. We're expecting to
continue,'' said Adm. James Cutler Dawson, commander of the
Enterprise Battle Group in the Gulf.
	   The activity aboard this U.S. aircraft carrier countered
speculation that the U.S. and British air assault would be called
off for Ramadan, which began Saturday in Iraq. Some nations will
begin the month of dawn-to-dusk fasts on Sunday because of later
sightings of the moon.
	   Pilots returning from Iraq Saturday reported their most
successful night yet of bombing.
	   ``If nights one and two were good, night three was the best,''
Cutler said.
	   The third night of attacks was officially over about 6 a.m.
(0300 GMT) with the return of the last warplanes to the vessel.
Dawson said pilots reported ``very good'' success at striking
targets, but he would not specify what was hit.
	   The jets took off in waves from the carrier deck throughout the
night. Tomahawk cruise missiles, carrying 1,000-pound
(454-kilogram) conventional warheads, were fired from other ships
in the Gulf flotilla. More cruise missiles have been launched in
the last three days than the 289 fired at Iraq during the entire,
five-week Gulf War in 1991.
	   Iraqis continued to respond with anti-aircraft fire, but there
have been no reports of any warplanes hit.
	   ``We saw Triple-A (anti-aircraft artillery), but it's nothing we
haven't expected or haven't been able to combat,'' said Dawson.
	   Many aboard the Enterprise, including some Gulf War veterans,
supported pressing ahead with the attacks to finally end the years
of confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``I think I speak for most people when I say Saddam's games are
getting old. Time to put a stop to it,'' said Lt. John Taylor, an
F-18 pilot from St. Petersburg, Florida.
	   Lt. Cmdr. Timothy Gedney, a pilot on an E2C Hawkeye surveillance
and radar aircraft, noted that U.S. planes have been in the skies
over Iraq almost constantly since the 1991 Gulf War and afterward
monitoring no-fly zones.
	   ``So it's definitely familiar, the people who've been over here
again and again in the past eight years,'' said Gedney of Norfolk,
Virginia.
	   He bristled at suggestions that U.S. President Bill Clinton
ordered the air strikes in an attempt to bolster support as
impeachment proceedings move through Congress.
	   ``That's ridiculous ... This has been building up to this for a
long, long time,'' he said. ``And the fact that impeachment
proceedings happen to coincide with what's going on is, again, just
coincidence.''

Philippines beats Kazakstan for bronze medal

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Isabelo Lastimosa scored the last 10
points as the Philippines came from one point down with 1:15 to
play and beat Kazakstan 73-68 for the men's basketball bronze medal
of the Asian Games Saturday.
	   Kazakstan led 68-67 before Lastimosa put the game away with two
free shots, a field goal, and two more free throws. He ended with
19 points.
	   Trying to get back on top Asian basketball, the Philippines sent
a team of its top pros, but they lost to defending champion China
in the semifinals.
	   Still, the bronze medal finish improved on the last games in
1994, when the Filipinos lost the bronze medal game to Japan.
	   Kazakstan scored early on 3-point shots against the flashier
Filipinos, and the two were tied 36-36 at halftime.
	   Early in the second half, Kazakstan was able to break inside for
layups, but the Philippines tightened its defense.
	   Mikhail Dedov led Kazakstan's scoring with 15.
	   ``It's been a wonderful job,'' said Tim Cone, the Philippines'
coach.
	   ``It's different for us than it is for anyone else. ... We only
have one shot at it, while these other teams go back and play for
the ABC (Asian Basketball Confederation). We don't get that,'' he
said.
	   The Philippine team of players from its professional league was
put together in February to prepare for these games.
	   ``It's hard to face those guys (players) now,'' Cone said.
``It's hard to tell those guys it's all over. It's time to part and
go back and play for our own teams.
	   ``Today's game wasn't for the players. ... It was for the people
back home.''
	   Lastimosa said, ``Definitely it's a hard game. It's a team you
can't take lightly. Emotionally we were down. We weren't ready in
the games before against Korea and China.''
	   The Philippines was Asia's basketball power before it launched
its own professional league in 1975. Since then it had been sending
top amateurs to foreign competitions, an approach that didn't win
medals.

Japanese Cabinet set to approve new economic growth target Sunday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan will endorse an economic growth target on
Sunday for the fiscal year which begins next April at an
extraordinary meeting of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet, a
government official said Saturday.
	   Top officials from the Economic Planning Agency, Finance
Ministry and other related agencies met Saturday to finalize the
official growth forecast for fiscal 1999, an Economic Planning
Agency spokesman said.
	   The Cabinet was scheduled to formally adopt the estimate on
Sunday, said the spokesman, who declined to be named.
	   The move comes at a time when Prime Minister Obuchi faces
increasing pressure both at home and abroad to jump start the
world's second-largest economy, which has slid into its worst
recession since World War II.
	   Japan's leading business daily reported the government has
decided to set the growth target at 0.5 percent. The Nihon Keizai
newspaper also said the projection will be appended by a note that
Japan should aim for 1 percent growth.
	   The EPA spokesman could not confirm the report, which said it
would be the first time in decades that the government has forecast
a growth rate less than 1 percent.
	   Still, many private economists say that even half a percentage
point of growth is too much to hope for as Japan struggles to deal
with record unemployment, soaring bankruptcies and bad
loan-burdened banks.
	   The reported decision apparently came after a bout of
bureaucratic wrangling between two of Japan's chief economic
agencies.
	   The EPA, which insisted on the 0.5 growth target, prevailed over
the objections of the trade ministry, which had sought to set the
forecast at 1 percent in line with Prime Minister Obuchi's pledge
to engineer a full recovery within two years, the Nihon Keizai
said.
	   For the current fiscal year, which ends in March, the government
initially projected 1.9 percent growth, but later revised that
estimate down to a 1.8 percent contraction.
	   The economy shrank 0.4 percent last year. A second year of
negative growth would be a postwar first for Japan.
	   Continued sluggishness in industrial output and consumer
spending may force a second revision to as low as minus 2.2
percent, Kyodo News agency reported.

Singapore's deputy leader warns of plight of Malay minority
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Warning that an economic crisis is threatening
Singapore's social cohesion, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
said the high rate of layoffs and low education level in the
country's minority Malay community is a ``national problem.''
	   ``It is a national problem which affects all of us,'' Lee said
in a recent television interview, the transcript of which was
released Saturday.
	   About 1 in 3 workers laid off in Singapore so far this year have
been ethnic Malays, who constitute 14 percent of the island
republic's 3.1 million population, though only about 11 percent of
the work force.
	   Recent government statistics have shown that only about 30
percent of Malay workers have more than a secondary school
education.
	   Racial and religious cohesion in predominantly ethnic-Chinese
Singapore, which is sandwiched between two much larger Muslim
neighbors, has been one of the government's chief concerns for
decades.
	   Riots between Chinese and Malays in Singapore during the 1960s
left scores dead, and threatened the small city-state's future.
	   Lee urged improved education for Malays, and increased training
for Malay workers in skilled and semi-skilled activities.
	   He also said racial tension and violence in neighboring
Indonesia had heightened anxiety between Chinese and Malay
Singaporeans.
	   ``It is probably unavoidable that such sentiments will continue
to exist in a multi-racial society,'' he said.
	   ``We must try our best not to let external events affect our own
ethnic relations. These are events happening in a different
country, with different problems. They are not our quarrels.''
	   He said the Chinese majority should make minorities ``feel at
ease'' about their part in Singapore's society.

Shiishigina returns from drug ban to Asian Games record; Taib wins

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kazakstan's Olga Shishigina, who
returned this season from a two-year drug ban, set an Asian Games
record of 12.63 seconds in the women's 100-meter hurdles Saturday.
	   Qatar's Mohammed Taib took his fifth Asian Games gold medal by
capturing the 5,000 meters _ his first 5,000 since 1990 _ after
taking his third straight 1,500 earlier in the week.
	   China, which had been battling Japan for supremacy in the
athletic events, took over the overall lead in golds by winning
three of eight events Saturday. It had 15 golds to 12 for Japan,
which won the men's 4 x 400 relay.
	   Shishigina had tested positive in a meet in early 1996 for
stanozolol, the same steroid that turned up in Canadian sprinter
Ben Johnson's drug test at the 1988 Olympics.
	   She was banned for four years, but the IAAF, the sport's
governing body, cut that to two in May 1996. She had been
considered one of the favorites for the 1996 Olympic gold medal
after a time of 12.44 seconds _ still the Asian record _ in 1995
and a second place behind American Gail Devers at the 1995 worlds.
	   On Saturday, Shishigina, who returned to competition at the
Asian track championships in July, ran 12.63 into the wind, one of
the top times of 1998. That beat the games record of 12.73 set by
China's Liu Huajin of China in 1990.
	   China's Liu Jing was second in 12.82.
	   In the men's 110 hurdles, China's Chen Yanhao won easily in
13.65 seconds, far off the 13.30 games mark set by another Chinese,
Li Tong, in 1994.
	   Chen took control of the race by the fourth hurdle and gradually
moved out to a two-meter victory over Kazakstan's Andrei
Sklyarenko, 13.86. Third was Qatar's Hamad al-Dosari, 13.99, the
only other runner under 14.00.
	   In Taib's race, the pace quickened with two laps to go. South
Korea's Baek Seung-do took the lead, and Taib and Qatar's Ahmed
Hashim followed.
	   In the final lap, Taib moved easily in front with 200 meters to
go and established a large lead before slowing at the finish to win
in 13 minutes, 55.79 seconds. Hashim took the silver in 13:56.65,
with Baek third in 13:57.11
	   As he did in the 1,500, Taib slowed dramatically after his
victory was assured, allowing the other medalists to close the gap
somewhat.
	   Taib said it was his first 5,000 since 1990, when he won the
Asian Games event.
	   ``It's preparation for Sydney. I want to run the 5,000 there. I
am getting older,'' said Taib, who will be 31 in 2000.
	   China added gold medals in two women's events. Cai Weiyan and
Sun Caiyun, both former record holders in the pole vault, were
first and third, with Japan's Masumi Ono second, all clearing 4.00
meters.
	   China also held off India in the women's 4 x 400 relay. China's
Chen Yuxiang saw a large lead in the final 100 meters almost
disintegrate when India's 800 and 1,500 winner, Jyortirmoy Sikdhar,
made a late charge that fell short by about a meter, 3:32.03 to
3:32.20.
	   The men's relay went to Japan in an Asian Games record, 3:01.70,
breaking a 12-year-old mark of 3:02.33.
	   Uzbekistan's Sergi Voinov won the men's javelin with a toss of
79.70, putting Asian Games record holder Zhang Lianbiao of China
into second with 78.58. Zhang did more than 83 meters in 1994.
	   Sergei Arzamassov of Kazakstan beat another Chinese for the gold
in the triple jump by two centimeters, 17.00 to 16.98.
	   After Saturday's eight finals, and with only the men's marathon
left, China, with 15 golds, will not get close to its total from
the previous games.
	   In 1994, China had 22 medals in the sport, paced by its women,
who took 14 of 19 events.
	   But this time China's women have faltered, losing all the middle
distance races that they dominated between 1993 and 1994, when
members of coach Ma Junren's training group set world records in
the 1,500, 3,000 and 10,000.
	   At these games, aside from Shishigina's hurdles time, the only
other world-class mark for the women was in the marathon, where
Japan's Naoko Takashashi set the fifth best time ever in the event,
just one minute off the world's best.
	   The men had Koji Ito of Japan, the 100-meter gold medalist,
running an Asian record of 10.00 seconds in the semifinals, just
missing the sub-10 barrier.

Chinese vessels sighted near Philippine-controlled islands in
</HEADLINE>
Spratlys

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ About a dozen Chinese fishing vessels
have been spotted this week near three of eight islands controlled
by the Philippines in the disputed Spratlys chain, the military
said Saturday.
	   The Western Command based in Palawan, the Philippine province
closest to the islands, said in a report to Chief of Staff Gen.
Joselin Nazareno that the fishing vessels dropped anchor Friday
several kilometers (miles) off Kota, Parola and Panata islands.
	   At least nine of the vessels were still in the area, about 800
kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Manila, as of Saturday, the
report said.
	   There was no immediate word on whether the Philippine government
will lodge another protest against China as it did in October after
the military discovered new Chinese structures being built on
Mischief Reef, which is claimed by both Manila and Beijing.
	   China said the structures are shelters for Chinese fishermen.
Later, Beijing offered joint use of the platforms, and this was
accepted ``in principle'' by the Philippine government.
	   Chinese and Philippine officials last month agreed to hold talks
in Manila in January to work on ``confidence building measures'' to
ease the tension over the Spratlys.
	   On Friday, Nazareno said the military plans to improve the
runway on Pag-asa, the largest of the eight islands occupied by
Philippine troops, to accommodate more aircraft.
	   China, Taiwan and Vietnam claim all of the Spratlys. The
Philippines and Malaysia claim only some of the islands and reefs
and Brunei claims one reef.
	   The Spratlys straddle vital sea lanes in the South China Sea and
are believed to be rich in minerals.
	   Meanwhile, the military reported that two of 25 fishermen on a
fishing boat that sank during a recent storm in the Spratlys have
been rescued. The 23 other fishermen aboard the fishing boat Nastra
were believed to have drowned.
	   Ramos Boklat and Joel Atsas Ecol told rescuers that they
abandoned their boat after the others refused to leave it despite
being battered by big waves during tropical storm Faith last week.
	   The two men were seen at the Jackson Atoll by air force
reconnaissance planes last Saturday.

India's P.T. Usha bids farewell to Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Usha watched race, adds quotes, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ For P.T. Usha, a medal at her last
Asian Games would have been a dream finish to a remarkably long
career that has made her an Indian track legend. But it wasn't to
be.
	   Usha, 33, bowed out from her fifth Asian Games without running
Saturday in what had been expected to be her last race. Plagued by
a hamstring injury and feeling low after performing poorly earlier
in the week, Usha was left out of the 4 x 400 Indian squad in
Saturday's final.
	   ``I feel sorry. I wanted that her last race would be graceful,''
said her coach, Jasvinder Bhutia. ``It is a sad dismissal.''
	   Usha burst into Indian athletics 20 years ago as a shy
13-year-old in pigtails. Since then, she has picked up four gold
and seven silver Asian Games medals and come closest to being the
first Indian to win an Olympic track and field medal, missing
bronze by 0.01 seconds in the 400-meter hurdles at the 1984 games.
	   She emerged from retirement to run in the Asian Track
Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, this July. She was third, in 23.46
seconds, in the 200 and anchored India's victorious 4 x 100 relay.
Usha also anchored India's silver medal team in 4 x 400, which
finished .16 seconds behind China.
	   But her training for the Bangkok games was disrupted by a heel
injury and a hamstring strained at a November meet in the eastern
city of Calcutta, when she collapsed in the 200.
	   The injuries effectively ruined Usha's swan song. She did not
qualify for the 200 final and was sixth in the 400, her favorite
event. The poor results led to her missing Saturday's final.
India's team doctor, Rakesh Kaushal, said her confidence was also
``a little bit on the low side'' to run following her disappointing
earlier races.
	   ``We have a better girl,'' said Lalit Bhanot, secretary of the
Amateur Athletic Federation of India. ``We knew that she wasn't
going to do well.''
	   Usha said Indian officials told her Friday that she would not be
running. But she made clear she thought she could have competed.
	   ``If I can run in the 200 semifinals and the 400 semifinals and
final I can run in the 400 meters relay also,'' she said.
	   ``It is bad luck. Without injury, she has such will power that
she definitely would have won a medal,'' her coach said.
	   Usha watched from the stands Saturday as India's women got
silver in the race. She said she would go to the next Asian Games
in the year 2002 but only as a spectator.
	   ``I can't run, I have to see that,'' she said.

Grieving relatives mark first anniversary of SilkAir crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PALEMBANG, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of weeping relatives of
victims of a SilkAir plane crash in Indonesia cast flowers Saturday
onto a mass grave to commemorate the first anniversary of the
tragedy.
	   The anguish was heightened because investigators have yet to
determine the cause of the Dec. 19, 1997 crash into a murky,
fast-flowing river. Divers recovered only body parts amid the plane
wreckage and most victims were never identified.
	   ``There has been no clear explanation as to why it fell and
totally disintegrated,'' said Atang Hidayat, father of victim Elly
Sundari, an Indonesian journalist who perished.
	   About 750 mourners as well as Singaporean and Indonesian
government officials attended the ceremony in the Sumatra island
city of Palembang, near the crash site.
	   A largely symbolic burial with dozens of empty coffins was held
at the same place on Jan. 19, one month after the Boeing 737 fell
out of the sky on a routine flight from Jakarta to Singapore. All
104 passengers and crew members aboard died.
	   As at that ceremony, prayers were recited this time by religious
leaders from a number of different faiths, including Islam,
Christianity, Buddhism and Taoism.
	   Grieving relatives then hugged each other. Some lit candles,
sang hymns, mouthed prayers in silence or shrieked in sadness.
	   ``We feel sad but we have to accept that she was predestined
with such a fate,'' Hidayat said of his daughter, who was then 40
and on her way to Japan to study fashion for three months.
	   Hidayat and other relatives thanked SilkAir, a subsidiary of
national carrier Singapore Airlines, and the local government for
organizing the ceremony. But they expressed frustration at the
failure to discover the cause of the crash as well as offers of
compensation from the airline that they consider too little.
	   So far, the airline has offered no more than the dlrs 75,000
called for in the Warsaw Convention for victims of air crashes, and
as little as dlrs 20,000 for some, depending on their age and
income level, according to Singaporean news reports.
	   At the ceremony, SilkAir unveiled a nine-meter-high monument
consisting of four wing-shaped posts. The cost was four billion
rupiahs (dlrs 510,000).
	   In the weeks following the crash, helicopters, minesweeper boats
with sonar and hundreds of Indonesian and Singaporean searchers
found little more than half the plane wreckage.
	   The remains of six victims who were identified were returned to
their families. Two were from the United States. The others were
from Germany, France, Malaysia and Singapore.
	   Most on board were from Singapore and Indonesia.
	   The plane's flight data and voice recorders were recovered, and
the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has studied their
contents at its laboratory in Washington.
	   A release from Indonesia's Transportation Ministry said Friday
that the investigation has not yet discovered the cause of the
crash.
	   International media reports have raised the possibility that the
cause was pilot suicide.

India's politicians fight New Year greetings card war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Local leaders of India's ruling party plan
to send holiday greeting cards with pictures of a mushroom cloud to
celebrate this year's nuclear tests.
	   Lawmakers and members of the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party
in Uttar Pradesh state said the tests were the biggest achievement
so far this year. The party is in control of the government in
Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state.
	   In the past, political parties and lawmakers have mailed
greeting cards with innocuous messages or illustrations. The cards,
sent to celebrate the new year, contain a decidedly more political
message this year.
	   The Congress Party, the main opposition group in India, designed
cards showing onions _ whose sixfold price hike in recent weeks was
among the reasons the BJP lost three crucial state elections
recently.
	   The socialist Samajwadi Party is designing a card showing the
BJP's alleged anti-Muslim attitude and the reported connection of
BJP lawmakers with criminals in Uttar Pradesh.
	   The Bahujan Samaj Party, which represents low-caste Hindus, is
also planning to print cards highlighting what it calls rampant
corruption in the state administration.

Evacuated U.N. aid workers fear Iraqi suffering will increase

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ U.N. aid workers who reluctantly left Iraq
said Saturday the airstrikes will only deepen the suffering of
Iraqis and reverse economic progress made in recent years.
	   ``This is a very, very unfortunate situation for the Iraqis,''
said Darleen Biseau, who worked on the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program in Baghdad.
	   The program is an exception from the punishing trade sanctions
imposed by the U.N. Security Council after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. It allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy
needed food and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   One of 110 U.N. humanitarian workers who left Iraq Friday
morning, Biseau was exhausted and tearful as she described the
15-hour trip through the desert to the Jordanian capital Amman.
	   ``It's a trip we made with tears for all those people we left
there,'' she said in a wavering voice. ``There is nothing really
happy for us about being here at all.
	   ``I think the cumulative effect of many years of suffering is
simply not going to be helped by this, and I don't have the words
to describe how bad the effect of this airstrike is on Iraq.''
	   Victor Algus, of the U.N. Habitat program, said he hoped the
U.S. and British strikes would not have a long-term impact on their
work.
	   ``We are in the humanitarian business, and it is needed in
Iraq,'' Algus said. ``The Iraqis are suffering and we have to help
them.''
	   Most of the other U.N. aid workers refused to talk to reporters.
	   The workers were evacuated after spending the first night of
U.S. and British military strikes huddled in their headquarters on
the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Prakash Shah, the special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, and the U.N. humanitarian coordinator, Hans von Sponeck,
remain in Baghdad along with 26 U.N. workers, U.N. officials said.
	   The United Nations has said it remains fully committed to
implementation of the oil-for-food program and hopes the relocated
workers will soon resume their duties in Iraq.

of Hebron. Clashes with Israeli troops afterward injured 32
protesters.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Defying a ban on pro-Iraq
demonstrations, about 3,000 Palestinians screaming ``Death to

of Hebron. Clashes with Israeli troops afterward injured seven
protesters.

away from the main rally and hurled stones at Israeli troops. The
soldiers responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
	   All of the injuries to protesters were from rubber-coated
bullets.
	   The Hebron rally drew Palestinian political groups from across
the political spectrum, ranging from the radical Islamic group
Hamas to Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction.
	   The Fatah participation came despite a declaration by Arafat's
police chief in Gaza that such demonstrations were banned.
Palestinian authorities also shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi
sentiments and detained journalists _ including some working for
foreign media outlets _ who covered pro-Iraqi unrest.
	   On Saturday, the Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a
strike to protest the curbs.
	   The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership.
On the one hand, it is anxious to curb the unmitigated backing
Palestinians gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that
set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   At the same time, however, Arafat's government apparently wants
to allow some outlet for Palestinian street sentiment in favor of
Iraq.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting _ marchers on
Friday chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and ``Death to
America, death to Clinton, death to Britain!''
	   Anticipating the demonstration, authorities made sure to strip
the city of the U.S. flags that had hung from electricity poles
during the Clinton visit. Protesters found a few leftover plastic
U.S. flags, and wrapped them around their shoes in a sign of
contempt.
	   After the demonstration, marchers threw stones at Israeli troops
guarding the entrance to the city. The troops responded with rubber
bullets and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were injured.

Russian foreign minister calls for bombing halt in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the use of force
against Iraq could seriously affect relations between Russia and
the United States, a statement from the Foreign Ministry said
Saturday.
	   ``If this action is not stopped, Russian-American relations can
seriously suffer,'' Ivanov told U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright in a telephone conversation Friday night.
	   Ivanov said joint efforts of Russia and the United States in
recent years had advanced their partnership in key areas of
bilateral relations and international matters, the ministry
statement said.
	   ``This is important both for the two peoples and for stability
and security in the whole world,'' Ivanov was quoted as saying.
``It is necessary to do everything to prevent a slideback in our
relations.''
	   Ivanov called for a halt to the bombing campaign against Saddam
Hussein and he urged the United States to resume the search for a
political solution to the situation in Iraq at the U.N. Security
Council.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Albright will travel to Moscow in
January, apparently in an attempt to isolate the dispute over Iraq
from the rest of the U.S.-Russian relationship.
	   ``We do want to keep our channels of communication open despite
the unfortunate decision of Russia to recall its ambassador,''
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington,
referring to Russia's decision to recall Ambassador Yuli M.
Vorontsov to protest the attack on Iraq.
	   On Friday, Moscow denounced the United States and demanded an
end to attacks on Iraq.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a letter to President Boris
Yeltsin on Friday defending the decision to attack. Yeltsin
responded with a message to Clinton through Ivanov, but the
contents of Yeltsin's message were not disclosed.

	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup overall leader Alexandra
Meissnitzer of Austria widened the scope of her supremacy on
Saturday, winning her first career World Cup downhill.
	   Meissnitzer, who has won five of 12 races this season, stormed
down the icy, bumpy 2,500-meter (8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours in 1
minute, 42.68 seconds, to add the downhill victory to her wins in
the super-G and giant slalom.
	   The Austrian was the only skier to break the 42 second barrier,
with runnerup Regine Cavagnoud of France crossing in 1:43.00 flat.
	   Cavagnoud, who is having her best season since 1993, finished
ahead of World Cup downhill leader Renate Goetschl of Austria,
third in 1:43.17.
	   Goetschl, winner of both downhills this season, was the favorite
coming into this weekend's double header, but a near fall in
Friday's race left the Austrian back in 14th.
	   Goetschl clings to her lead in the World Cup downhill standings,
but Meissnitzer has been rapidly gaining ground.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
Embassy in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands of Syrians
took to the streets to denounce the American and British air
strikes on Iraq.
	   Chanting ``Down with America,'' a crowd estimated at a thousand
surrounded the embassy in the upscale Rowda neighborhood. Many
pelted the building with stones, shattering windows.
	   Witnesses said embassy guards fired tear gas to disperse the
crowd.
	   ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a
switchboard operator at the embassy who would not give his name.
	   The building was believed to be largely empty and closed for the
day. Efforts to reach officials at the embassy proved unsuccessful
since the operator said no one was available to comment.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Thunderous blasts rocked Baghdad before
dawn on Saturday, with U.S. and British forces pressing a punishing
air offensive on Iraq for a third night.
	   Reporters saw fiery streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk
cruise missiles arcing across the sky and landing in giant
fireballs. Warheads exploded a few seconds later, lighting the
pre-dawn horizon in a red glow that silhouetted palm trees against
the dark sky.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling the
sky with booms and bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets
streaked high above.
	   When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens
blaring were heard speeding away. Officials, who must escort
journalists wishing to tour the city, refused to take them to the
targeted areas.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the Friday and Saturday
attacks was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center of
the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Western reporters staying at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad
saw explosions in nearby areas known to have palaces, a
headquarters of the Special Security service and the command center
for the Popular Army, which is a paramilitary force.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Saturday's attack appeared to be the toughest yet against
Baghdad since the U.S. and British militaries began air strikes
early Thursday to punish Iraq for its obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks.
	   Saturday's explosions were not preceded by air raid sirens,
implying that for the first time the strikes eluded Iraqi air
defenses.
	   When the reverberations from the explosions subsided at about
4:45 a.m. (0145 gmt), the winter air filled with the sounds of
muezzins calling from mosque loudspeakers, informing Muslims to eat
their last meal before beginning the first day of fasting for the
holy month of Ramadan.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice.
	   ``We will not let evil triumph over virtue,'' he said.
	   State-run newspapers on Saturday echoed Saddam's theme. A banner
headline in the Al-Jumhuriya daily read: ``We shall resist and
fight in the name of God.''
	   On Saturday, officials at the Oil Ministry said that crude
exports under the U.N. approved oil-for-food program were
continuing despite the military attacks.
	   The officials said an average of 1.8 million barrels per day
were going out through Mina al-Bakr port and terminals at the
Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   During a Pentagon briefing on Friday, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman Gen. Henry Shelton said that U.S. forces have hit more
than 75 targets in the last two nights.
	   But initial bomb-damage assessments indicate that only a small
number of the targets were destroyed or severely damaged even
though Iraq offered virtually no resistance.
	   ``We ... have had some very good success with our strikes, but
not all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' Shelton said.
	   For example, of 27 Iraqi surface-to-air missile facilities
attacked, only one was destroyed and eight suffered no damage.
	   The Iraqi military claimed its anti-aircraft batteries had shot
down 77 incoming missiles so far.
	   The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to
lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten
its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz questioned that.
	   ``The real objective of this aggression is to show that the
United States is the sole superpower,'' he told reporters Friday.
	   He said the strikes targeted the old defense ministry building,
which houses only administrative department, a refinery in the
southern city of Basra, a trade ministry warehouse and a
radio-television transmission facility.
	   The Pharmacy College of Baghdad and the Museum of Natural
History were also hit.
	   Aziz did not say which military sites had been hit.
	   But in Washington, U.S. officials showed aircraft videotape of
laser-guided bombs slamming into what they said were military
targets, including radar stations, a missile storage facility, and
a missile production plant.
	   Aziz said almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons
inspectors had been monitoring have been hit.
	   The inspectors, who had been working in the country since 1991,
withdrew from the country on Wednesday, complaining of lack of
cooperation from Iraq. The withdrawal became the trigger for the
U.S.-British attack.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the U.N. Security Council
cannot lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The United Nation's efforts to relieve the hardships caused by
the sanctions received a severe blow with the evacuation Friday of
106 international staffers of a program to monitor food aid to the
Iraqis.

Vatican says pope better and going back to work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ John Paul II was feeling better Saturday
after a day of rest to combat a light flu and was ready to resume
his audiences later in the day, said Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls.
	   The flu forced the pope to cancel his appointments on Friday.
	   On Friday Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said John
Paul, who is 78, had a fever of 38 degrees Celsius (100 F) as part
of a mild flu. By Friday evening, the fever had reportedly gone
down by almost a degree (99 F).
	   The pope was scheduled to appear at noon Sunday at his studio
window overlooking St. Peter's Square to give his weekly blessing.
	   The flu hit at the start of the busy holiday period for the
frail pope, who no longer celebrates Mass Christmas morning in St.
Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time to rest after midnight
Mass Christmas eve.
	   The pope is scheduled to journey to Mexico and St. Louis,
Missouri, in January.

Indonesia's ex-President Suharto meets prominent Muslim leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A prominent Muslim leader met
Indonesia's ex-President Suharto on Saturday in a sign the former
authoritarian head of state is still viewed as a powerful figure by
many of his countrymen.
	   After the meeting, Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid said he had
suggested a four-person meeting on the future of the troubled
Southeast Asian nation that would include himself and Suharto.
	   The other two participants would be President B.J. Habibie,
Suharto's successor and onetime protege, and Gen. Wiranto, chief of
the politically powerful military.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May after riots and protests against his
32-year rule and has been living as a virtual recluse in his
affluent Jakarta home.
	   However, many Indonesians believe he continues to exert
influence over Habibie and the government, which includes many
appointees who owe their careers to Suharto.
	   Student protesters have been pressing for a trial of Suharto on
charges of corruption and human rights abuses, and have labeled as
cosmetic a government investigation of the former president.
	   Wahid, who heads the country's largest Muslim organization,
Nahdlatul Ulama, and has founded his own political party, met
Suharto at his house for one and a half hours.
	   He said Suharto accepted his suggestion for a dialogue and said
the country's leaders should join together to solve problems in
Indonesia, which is plagued by political uncertainty and the worst
economic crisis in decades.
	   Wiranto has also accepted the proposal, Wahid said.
	   ``Gen. Wiranto will represent the military bureaucracy, Suharto
(will participate) as a leader with a huge loyalist following and
myself as a leader with a great number of followers,'' Wahid said.
	   ``We still need the consent of President Habibie, who will
represent the civilian bureaucracy,'' said Wahid, who is popularly
known as Gus Dur.
	   Habibie has allowed political parties to form and has scheduled
Parliamentary elections next year. But student protesters say he
has not gone far enough with political reforms.

China beats South Korea for gold; Philippines wins bronze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with China winning gold &QL; 
 &UR; By KENNETH CRAWFORD &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Li Xiaoyong scored 24 points Saturday,
leading a well-diciplined Chinese team to a 112-92 victory over
South Korea for the men's basketball gold medal at the Asian Games.
	   China's fourth consecutive Asian Games basketball triumph was a
tame affair after the Philippines' dramatic bronze medal victory
earlier in the day.
	   Isabelo Lastimosa scored the last 10 points as the Philippines
came from one point down with 1:15 to play and beat Kazakstan
73-68.
	   Li scored four 3-pointers and went 8-for-8 from the foul line
for his 24, and Zhang Jinsong added 22 for the Chinese, who led
59-43 at halftime. The team sank 7 of 10 3-point attempts in the
first half, while Korea went 2-for-6.
	   The taller Chinese controlled the pace and the area under the
basket, forcing the Koreans to shoot more from outside. China hit
21 of 33 from the field, or 63 percent, to Korea's 56 percent on 17
for 30. It also outrebounded the Koreans 26-15.
	   Seo Jan-hoon led Korea's scoring with 20, including 8 for 16
from the field.
	   ``China was a bit messy in the second half, but that is quite
normal,'' said Chinese coach Wang Fei. ``We could be because of the
lead.''
	   Against the Philippines, Kazakstan led 68-67 before Lastimosa
put the game away with two free shots, a field goal, and two more
free throws. He ended with 19 points.
	   Trying to get back on top Asian basketball, the Philippines sent
a team of its top pros, but they lost to China in the semifinals.
	   Still, the bronze medal finish improved on the last games in
1994, when the Filipinos lost the bronze medal game to Japan.
	   Kazakstan scored early on 3-point shots against the flashier
Filipinos, and the two were tied 36-36 at halftime.
	   Early in the second half, Kazakstan was able to break inside for
layups, but the Philippines tightened its defense.
	   Mikhail Dedov led Kazakstan's scoring with 15.
	   ``It's been a wonderful job,'' said Tim Cone, the Philippines'
coach.
	   ``It's different for us than it is for anyone else. ... We only
have one shot at it, while these other teams go back and play for
the ABC (Asian Basketball Confederation). We don't get that,'' he
said.
	   The Philippine team of players from its professional league was
put together in February to prepare for these games.
	   ``It's hard to face those guys (players) now,'' Cone said.
``It's hard to tell those guys it's all over. It's time to part and
go back and play for our own teams.
	   ``Today's game wasn't for the players. ... It was for the people
back home.''
	   Lastimosa said, ``Definitely it's a hard game. It's a team you
can't take lightly. Emotionally we were down. We weren't ready in
the games before against Korea and China.''
	   The Philippines was Asia's basketball power before it launched
its own professional league in 1975. Since then it had been sending
top amateurs to foreign competitions, an approach that didn't win
medals.

Moscow mayor's movement holds opening congress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov Saturday called on all
Russians to unite under a new political movement to restore the
country to its position as a leading world power.
	   Luzhkov, speaking at the founding congress of the Fatherland
movement, urged ``workers, farmers, intelligentsia and military
servicemen'' to unite in the name of Russia, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``Join us,'' he said. ``We are facing very difficult and
immensely important tasks.''
	   Luzhkov launched the political movement in November, apparently
to support his likely presidential bid in 2000.
	   He said Fatherland's goal was to ensure Russia's development as
a market economy with a strong state sector drawing support from
both the left and right of the political spectrum.
	   Luzhkov called for a revival of the defense industry and the
country's nuclear forces to restore Russia to a position of one of
the world's eight leading powers.
	   ``We need a modern army, a reliable nuclear deterrence system,''
Luzhkov told the 1,123 delegates to the congress. ``The
international community needs a strong Russia as a great power that
respects itself and other powers,'' he said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Domestically, he said he wanted to create a state system ``based
on social democracy and a combination of market-economy methods and
social policies.''
	   Luzhkov lashed out at government reformists, and said they had
not accomplished anything significant.
	   ``Due to the radical reforms implemented in Russia in the past
few years, the country has begun turning into a dump site,'' the
mayor said. ``If the situation in the country remains as it was, we
will all be up against some serious trouble.''
	   So far, Luzhkov has not said outright that he would run for
president. The mayor is popular in Moscow, and has strong ratings
in opinion polls. However, it is unclear how strong a popular
following he has in Russia's outlying regions, where many resent
the capital's relative prosperity.
	   Others expected to run in 2000 are Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, liberal politician Grigory Yavlinsky, former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alexander Lebed, a former general
who is now governor of a vast region in Siberia.

Pro-Iraq protests erupt despite ban; 44 Palestinians hurt
</HEADLINE>

protesters dispersing &QL;

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians clashed violently with
Israeli troops after a pro-Iraq demonstration Saturday, hurling
stones and firebombs at soldiers, who fired back rubber bullets.
Forty-four marchers were hurt.
	   The rally in the West Bank town of Hebron and a smaller one in
the Gaza Strip town of Rafah came in defiance of a Palestinian
police ban on pro-Iraq demonstrations.
	   In Rafah, about 400 Palestinian protesters burned U.S. and
British flags. Police dispersed them, but without using force.
	   In Hebron, Palestinian police did not attempt to restrain about
3,000 marchers as they set out from Hebron University, some wearing
black hoods or masked with keffiyehs, carrying posters of Iraqi
president Saddam Hussein. They waved Iraqi flags and screamed
``Death to Israel _ death to America!''
	   When the marchers reached the center of Hebron _ the site of
several Jewish settlements and a frequent flashpoint _ about 400
protesters broke away from the main rally and threw stones and
firebombs at Israeli troops. The soldiers responded with volleys of
rubber bullets.
	   Amid pitched battles in the winding, cramped downtown streets,
soldiers and protesters alike ducked into shops and doorways for
cover. At one point, with stones raining down on them, about 20
Israeli soldiers grouped and charged stone-throwers, firing rubber
bullets as they ran forward.
	   Of the 44 Palestinians hurt by rubber-coated bullets, at least
one was hurt critically, hospital officials said.
	   Finally, after about two hours, Palestinian police moved in and
began dispersing the demonstrators.
	   The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership.
On the one hand, it is anxious to rein in the unmitigated backing
Palestinians gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that
set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   At the same time, however, Arafat's government apparently wants
to allow some outlet for Palestinian street sentiment in favor of
Iraq. Official Palestinian radio on Saturday played patriotic
songs.
	   The Hebron rally drew Palestinian political groups from across
the political spectrum, ranging from the radical Islamic group
Hamas to Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. Fatah's participation came
despite a declaration by Arafat's own police chief in Gaza that
such demonstrations were banned.
	   On Friday, Palestinian authorities also shut down media
broadcasting pro-Iraqi sentiments and detained journalists _
including some working for foreign media outlets _ who covered
pro-Iraqi unrest. The Gaza City bureau of The Associated Press was
closed down by the authorities, and remained shut on Saturday.
	   The Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a strike starting
Saturday to protest the curbs on their coverage, and said they
would stage a sit-in at the Palestinian legislative council on
Monday.

Iranian official warns against U.S. strike on Iran
</HEADLINE>

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian official said Saturday that U.S.
forces had unintentionally fired a missile into Iran last week but
added the United States would pay a heavy price if it actually
targets the Islamic Republic.
	   ``If the U.S. fires a missile at Iran, none of its fleet will
leave the Gulf safe,'' Maj. Gen. Mohsen Rezaei, secretary of the
Expediency Council, was quoted as saying by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency. The council is a powerful government advisory
body.
	   A missile from the U.S.-British attack on Iraq fell Thursday on
the city of Khorramshahr in southern Iran, damaging several houses
but causing no casualties.
	   Khorramshahr, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Basra in
Iraq, is a large port city with major oil facilities.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Friday complained to
Britain over the stray missile and the continuing raids on Iraq.
	   In a telephone call with his British counterpart, Robin Cook,
Kharrazi protested ``the violation of Iranian airspace'' and called
for an immediate end to the British and American attacks on Iraq,
state-run Tehran Radio reported.
	   He said the strikes were of special concern to Muslims during
the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which started Saturday in many
Muslim countries.
	   A Russian envoy arrived in Tehran on Friday to discuss the Iraqi
crisis with Iranian officials.
	   Sergei Prikhodko, a presidential adviser for international
relations, was carrying a message from Russian President Boris
Yeltsin to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, the radio said.
	   Russia also has condemned the air strikes.
	   Missiles have been falling on Iraqi cities for three consecutive
nights as punishment for Iraq's failure to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   Meanwhile, all 2,050 Iranian pilgrims who were in Iraq when the
military campaign began have returned home safely, IRNA reported.
	   Some 30,000 Iranian pilgrims have traveled to Iraq since August
to visit holy shrines in the southern Iraqi cities of Karbala and
Najaf.
	   Iran-Iraq relations are still tense after their devastating
1980-88 war, which killed or injured an estimated 1 million people.
But Iran repeated has protested the presence of American troops in
the Gulf and opposed military strikes against Iraq.

Balloon team sails into Libyan airspace

	   PARIS (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson, Chicago millionaire
Steve Fossett and teammate Per Lindstrand sailed into Libyan
airspace Saturday on day two of their landmark quest to travel
around the world in a ballon.
	   ``The flight is going very well, according to Jackie McQuillan,
spokeswoman for ICO Global, a mobile telephone company supporting
the voyage.
	   Branson was suffering from what McQuillan called a ``sore
throat,'' but all three adventurers were in good spirits after a
breakfast of vitamin-packed food packages of the kind that
astronauts eat in space.
	   The 200-foot-high (61-meter) balloon crossed into Libyan
airspace on Saturday and by evening was expected to fly over Turkey
after passing over the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Cyprus,
Mcquillan said.
	   The balloon was cruising at about 28,400 feet on Saturday and
traveling about 115 miles (186 kilometers) per hour, Mcquillan said
in a telephone interview.
	   Good weather, a good wind and a cloudless sky augured well for
the travelers in their quest to become the first to circle the
globe in a balloon.
	   The ballon took off from a Moroccan airforce base outside
Marrakech on Saturday at 0922 GMT after a two-hour delay.
	   After crossing the Atlas mountains, the balloon crossed into
Algerian airspace where the balloon continued its course overnight
before crossing the border with Libya.
	   ``The tricky part is getting through the first 24 hours,''
Branson said Friday shortly before liftoff. ``After that we can
start to relax and enjoy the flight.''
	   Branson and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits,
expressed confidence in the trip, estimating it could last from
eight days to nearly three weeks.
	   The U.S. missile strike on Iraq has complicated the task,
Branson said.
	   ``This flight around the world would have taken 9 and a half
days, but for the Iraqi problem,'' Branson told reporters.
	   ``Now, we will be happy to complete the voyage in 10-20 days.''
	   The missile strike means the team will have to find the winds to
take them north of Iraq through Turkey instead of cutting over
Saudi Arabia.
	   Branson and his crew hope to touch down somewhere in Europe at
the end of a 24,000-mile flight which will take them over Saudi
Arabia, India, the South China sea, the Pacific ocean and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and had only four refusals - Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe, the last one
ending when his Solo Spirit was ripped apart in a violent storm off
Australia.
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first
person to trek the globe in a balloon. The only time he managed to
take off, in January 1997, his balloon crashed a day after takeoff,
landing in the Algerian desert.
	   The crew is more confident this time because of the better
technology used to build the balloon, including a Kevlar canopy
over the crew's pressurized capsule. Kevlar is used for bulletproof
vests.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon - from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

Shishigina returns from drug ban to Asian Games record; Taib wins

 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ While China's athletes were under close
scrutiny for drugs at the Asian Games, a runner who served a
two-year drug ban for the same substance that Ben Johnson used set
a meet record in the 100-meter hurdles Saturday.
	   Kazakstan's Olga Shishigina, who missed the Olympics because of
testing positive for stanozolol, set a games record of 12.63
seconds. Johnson was found to have the steroid in his system at the
1988 Olympics.
	   Qatar's Mohammed Taib took his fifth Asian Games gold medal by
capturing the 5,000 meters _ his first 5,000 since 1990 _ after
taking his third straight 1,500 earlier in the week.
	   China, which had been battling Japan for supremacy in the
athletic events, took over the overall lead in golds by winning
three of eight events Saturday. It had 15 golds to 12 for Japan,
which won the men's 4 x 400 relay. Only the men's marathon
remained, on the games' closing day Sunday.
	   China's total, however, was well below its 1994 total of 22, set
with the help of runners from coach Ma Junren's group, who did not
run here.
	   Shishigina had tested positive in a meet in early 1996 and was
banned in May of that year, although the IAAF, the sport's
governing body, cut the original four-year ban to two.
	   She had been considered one of the favorites for the 1996
Olympic gold medal after a time of 12.44 seconds _ still the Asian
record _ in 1995 and a second place behind American Gail Devers at
the 1995 worlds.
	   The best in the 100 hurdles this year was 12.44 by Nigeria's
Glory Alozie.
	   So far in these games, China's athletes have passed all their
drug tests after failing 11 in 1994. This time, Chinese officials
said, extensive tests were carried out before the games to make
sure the athletes were clean.
	   Tests at the games so far have turned up two positive results,
leading to disqualification for one weightlifter from Jordan and
one from Kuwait.
	   Shishigina, who returned to competition at the Asian track
championships in July, ran Saturday's 12.63 into a wind, breaking
the games record of 12.73 set by China's Liu Huajin of China in
1990.
	   China's Liu Jing was second in 12.82.
	   Shishigina avoided talk about drugs in the past.
	   ``I hope to go to Sydney and run 12.45 there,'' Shishigina said
of the 2000 Olympics.
	   In the men's 110 hurdles, China's Chen Yanhao won easily in
13.65 seconds, far off the 13.30 games mark set by another Chinese,
Li Tong, in 1994. He won by two meters over Kazakstan's Andrei
Sklyarenko, 13.86.
	   In Taib's race, the pace quickened with two laps to go. South
Korea's Baek Seung-do took the lead, and Taib and Qatar's Ahmed
Hashim followed.
	   In the final lap, Taib moved easily in front with 200 meters to
go and established a large lead before slowing at the finish to win
in 13 minutes, 55.79 seconds. Hashim took the silver in 13:56.65,
with Baek third in 13:57.11
	   As he did in the 1,500, Taib slowed dramatically after his
victory was assured, allowing the other medalists to close the gap
somewhat.
	   Taib said it was his first 5,000 since 1990, when he won the
Asian Games event.
	   ``It's preparation for Sydney. I want to run the 5,000 there. I
am getting older,'' said Taib, who will be 31 in 2000.
	   China added gold medals in two women's events. Cai Weiyan and
Sun Caiyun, both former record holders in the pole vault, were
first and third, with Japan's Masumi Ono second, all clearing 4.00
meters.
	   China also held off India in the women's 4 x 400 relay. China's
Chen Yuxiang saw a large lead in the final 100 meters almost
disintegrate when India's 800 and 1,500 winner, Jyortirmoy Sikdhar,
made a late charge that fell short by about a meter, 3:32.03 to
3:32.20.
	   The men's relay went to Japan in an Asian Games record, 3:01.70,
breaking a 12-year-old mark of 3:02.33.
	   Uzbekistan's Sergi Voinov won the men's javelin with a toss of
79.70 putting Asian Games record holder Zhang Lianbiao into second
with 78.58. Zhang did more than 83 meters in 1994.
	   Sergei Arzamassov of Kazakstan beat another Chinese for the gold
in the triple jump by two centimeters, 17.00 to 16.98.
	   Although China led 15-12 in golds, its women have faltered,
losing all the middle distance races that they dominated between
1993 and 1994, when members of Ma's training group set world
records in the 1,500, 3,000 and 10,000.
	   At these games, aside from Shishigina's hurdles time, the only
other world-class mark for the women was in the marathon, where
Japan's Naoko Takashashi set the fifth best time ever in the event,
just one minute off the world's best.
	   The men had Koji Ito of Japan, the 100-meter gold medalist,
running an Asian record of 10.00 seconds in the semifinals, just
missing the sub-10 barrier.

	   Sirens could be heard wailing in the background as the operator
spoke. Most of the protesters outside the building apparently were
university students.
	   The attack on the embassy, which was broken up after about 10
minutes, came amid a massive protest against the continued
bombardment of neighboring Iraq by American and British missiles.
	   The marchers carried banners with anti-American slogans and
chanted demands for an end to the attacks on Iraq, which have gone
on for three nights.
	   ``No to killing and destruction,'' went one chant. ``The Iraqi
people will never kneel down,'' was another.
	   ``The Syrian people are with you, our Iraqi brothers,'' read one
banner carried by the protesters.
	   Large demonstrations are rare in the Syrian capital, which is
under tight security control, and Saturday's marches throughout the
downtown could not have occurred without government approval.
	   During the protest marches, patriotic Syrian songs blared from
loudspeakers on some government buildings.
	   The protests in Damascus were part of a massive show of support
for the Iraqis across the Arab world. Demonstrations also erupted
Saturday in the West Bank and Egypt, and protests against the U.S.
and British attacks were staged Friday in Jordan, Lebanon and
Yemen.
	   Many in the crowds in Damascus expressed sympathy for the Iraqi
people, and some of the chants and banners pictured the air strikes
on Iraq as part of an assault on all the Arabs.
	   ``I feel sorry for the innocent Iraqi people,'' said Safaa
Hamama, a 21-year-old student. ``Does America have the right to
live on the blood of the Iraqi people?''
	   Aziza Fadhel, another student, said: ``The aggression on Iraq is
an aggression on the whole Arab nation.''
	   Among the chants shouted by the crowd was: ``You aggressors,
leave our children in Iraq, Libya and Sudan to live in peace.''

Pro-Iraq protests erupt despite ban; 44 Palestinians hurt

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Defying a ban on pro-Iraq
demonstrations, about 3,000 Palestinians screaming ``Death to
Israel _ death to America!'' marched Saturday in the West Bank town
of Hebron. Clashes with Israeli troops afterward injured 44
protesters.
	   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, about 400 Palestinian
protesters burned U.S. and British flags. Police dispersed them,
but without using force.
	   In Hebron, Palestinian police did not attempt to restrain the
marchers as they set out from Hebron University, some wearing black
hoods or masked with keffiyehs, carrying posters of Iraqi president
Saddam Hussein.
	   When the marchers reached the center of Hebron _ the site of
several Jewish settlements and a frequent flashpoint _ about 400
protesters broke away from the main rally and threw stones and
firebombs at Israeli troops. The soldiers responded with volleys of
rubber bullets.
	   Amid pitched battles in the winding, cramped downtown streets,
soldiers and protesters alike ducked into shops and doorways for
cover. At one point, with stones raining down on them, about 20
Israeli soldiers grouped and charged stone-throwers, firing rubber
bullets as they ran forward.
	   Of the 44 Palestinians hurt by rubber-coated bullets, at least
one was hurt critically, hospital officials said.
	   Finally, after about two hours, Palestinian police moved in and
began dispersing the demonstrators.
	   The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership.
On the one hand, it is anxious to rein in the unmitigated backing
Palestinians gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that
set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   At the same time, however, Arafat's government apparently wants
to allow some outlet for Palestinian street sentiment in favor of
Iraq. Official Palestinian radio on Saturday played patriotic
songs.
	   The Hebron rally drew Palestinian political groups from across
the political spectrum, ranging from the radical Islamic group
Hamas to Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. Fatah's participation came
despite a declaration by Arafat's own police chief in Gaza that
such demonstrations were banned.
	   On Friday, Palestinian authorities also shut down media
broadcasting pro-Iraqi sentiments and detained journalists _
including some working for foreign media outlets _ who covered
pro-Iraqi unrest. The Gaza City bureau of The Associated Press was
closed down by the authorities, and remained shut on Saturday.
	   The Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a strike starting
Saturday to protest the curbs on their coverage, and said they
would stage a sit-in at the Palestinian legislative council on
Monday.

Iranian official warns against U.S. strike on Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian official said Saturday that U.S.
forces had unintentionally fired a missile into Iran last week but
added the United States would pay a heavy price if it actually
targets the Islamic Republic.
	   ``If the U.S. fires a missile at Iran, none of its fleet will
leave the Gulf safe,'' Maj. Gen. Mohsen Rezaei, secretary of the
Expediency Council, was quoted as saying by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency. The council is a powerful government advisory
body.
	   A missile from the U.S.-British attack on Iraq fell Thursday on
the city of Khorramshahr in southern Iran, damaging several houses
but causing no casualties.
	   Khorramshahr, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Basra in
Iraq, is a large port city with major oil facilities.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Friday complained to
Britain over the stray missile and the continuing raids on Iraq.
	   In a telephone call with his British counterpart, Robin Cook,
Kharrazi protested ``the violation of Iranian airspace'' and called
for an immediate end to the British and American attacks on Iraq,
state-run Tehran Radio reported.
	   He said the strikes were of special concern to Muslims during
the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which started Saturday in many
Muslim countries.
	   Missiles have been falling on Iraqi cities for three consecutive
nights as punishment for Iraq's failure to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors.

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup overall leader Alexandra
Meissnitzer of Austria widened the scope of her supremacy on
Saturday, winning her first career World Cup downhill.
	   Meissnitzer, who has won five-of-12 races this season, stormed
down the icy, bumpy 2,500-meter (8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours in 1
minute, 42.68 seconds, to add the downhill victory to her wins in
the super-G and giant slalom.
	   The Austrian was the only skier to break the 42 second barrier,
with runnerup Regine Cavagnoud of France crossing in 1:43.00 flat.
	   Cavagnoud, who is having her best season since 1993, finished
ahead of World Cup downhill leader Renate Goetschl of Austria,
third in 1:43.17.
	   Goetschl, winner of the season-opening back-to-back downhills in
Lake Louise, Canada, was the favorite coming into this weekend's
double header, but a near fall in Friday's race left the Austrian
back in 14th.
	   Goetschl clings to her lead in the World Cup downhill standings,
though Meissnitzer has been rapidly gaining ground.
	   Meissnitzer, who has won two super-Gs and a pair of giant
slaloms this season, has rocketed to the top of the overall
standings, rapidly pulling away from her closest challengers.
	   The Austrian leads with 775 points, a whopping 353 ahead of
second place Goetschl. Germany's Martina Ertl, who finished 15th,
dropped to third from second with 414.
	   Swiss skier Corinne Rey-Bellet's fourth place finish in the
downhill proved both sweet and sour for the fans watching.
	   While just missing the podium with her time of 1:43.46, Rey
Bellet's performance was nevertheless an admirable one, the
26-year-old's ugly fall in Friday's race leaving her still
suffering on Saturday.
	   France's Florence Masnada, sixth in Friday's race, moved up a
spot on Saturday, finishing fifth in 1:43.47.
	   Olympic slalom champion Hilde Gerg of Germany, who won her first
career World Cup downhill on Friday, was sixth, .87 adrift.
	   Melanie Turgeon, the Canadian prodigy who finished fifth in
Tignes in her opening race in her first season on the World Cup
circuit, clocked the seventh best time of 1:43.66, tying Italy's
Bibiana Perez, who was third in Friday's race.

Iraq says crude exports continuing despite air strikes

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's crude oil exports under the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program are continuing despite the
military strikes on the country, Oil Ministry officials said
Saturday.
	   The officials told The Associated Press that exports were
averaging 1.8 million barrels per day from Al-Bakr port on the Gulf
and terminals at the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean
Sea.
	   They said a tanker with a 2 million barrel capacity would finish
loading at Al-Bakr on Saturday and that a second tanker with that
capacity was waiting to load. The officials spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The official also disclosed for the first time damage to oil
facilities caused by three nights of missile attacks by U.S. and
British forces.
	   The attacks were launched starting Thursday to punish Iraq for
failing to cooperate with U.N. inspectors who are charged with
overseeing the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The officials said a main pumping station on Iraq's so-called
strategic pipeline close to Basra was hit. Iraqi workers are
repairing the damage, they added.
	   They also said missiles hit a refinery in the southern city of
Basra but that the damage was repairable.
	   As a precautionary measure, Iraq has halted work at its
refineries across the country. Gasoline and other oil products
appeared to remain plentiful, at least in the capital.
	   The officials said they are expecting a tanker with a million
barrel capacity at Al-Bakr on Sunday, and that a 1.2 million barrel
tanker was due Tuesday.
	   They said that communication with various oil centers had become
extremely difficult. This suggested that telephone operations have
been disrupted by the missile strikes.
	   They said senior oil officials were traveling by road to oil
facilities in northern and southern Iraq to monitor operations.

Chinese win five golds; Thais say Chinese referee biased
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai wushu officials walked out
Saturday in protest against what they called bias by a Chinese
referee as Chinese athletes swept the day's five Asian Games gold
medals in their ancient combat art.
	   ``All final decisions came from the head judge, with great favor
to his own country's fighters. It was unfair,'' Thai assistant
chief referee Voranat Disayabuth said at a news conference,
	   He urged other Asian countries to boycott China by not joining
in future wushu events.
	   Thai technical officials withdrew when the stage referee failed
to stop China's Zheng Kunyou from attacking Taiwan's Hsu Chin-kun
as Hsu was falling from the stage in their 56-kilogram division
bout.
	   Hsu was taken to the first aid room and ordered to rest for 30
minutes. He then refused to return to the stage, and the head judge
announced Zheng as the gold medal winner. The Thais said the judge
ignored a rule against attacking off the stage.
	   Voranat said that if wushu still lacks international judging
standards, it should not become part of the 2008 Olympics, for
which China wishes to be the host.
	   ``Let wushu develop itself to be more standard and fair before
promoting it as an international sport,'' he said.
	   As China originated wushu, the position of head judge always
belongs to a Chinese, while other referees come from other Asian
countries, Voranat said.
	   Dissatisfaction began when judge Wan Yulong awarded China's Xing
Zhujie victory over the Philippines' Chulhang Rolly at 52 kilograms
without extending the match to a third round, even though the two
had received neutral points.
	   Other Chinese winners were Zheng Kunyou, who defeated Thailand's
Pichit Jaisak at 56 kilograms; Sun Xunchang, who beat Thailand's
Komsan Thongtup at 60 kilograms, and You Bangmeng, who beat Iran's
Ojaghi Hossein at 70 kilograms.
	   For wushu sparring events, five judges around the stage hold up
red or black paddles to indicate their votes. The head judge sits
at another table.

Germany's firm wins auction to buy Gazprom shares
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Germany's Ruhrgas has won an auction to buy 2.5
percent of shares in Russia's Gazprom monopoly, the Interfax news
agency said Saturday.
	   Ruhrgas offered to pay dlrs 660 million, almost dlrs 9 million
above the government's minimum bidding price of dlrs 651.021
million, Interfax said, citing figures provided by the vendor, the
Federal Property Fund.
	   The second highest bidder for shares in the world's largest gas
company, Interoil France Ltd., offered to pay dlrs 651.5 million, a
fund official told Interfax.
	   The winner will sign a formal deal with the fund on Dec. 21,
Interfax said.
	   The government has been trying to boost its revenues through
privatization, but was recently forced to cancel planned auctions
of the oil company Rosneft and the telecommunications concern
Svyazinvest because of lack of interest.
	   Anticipated proceeds from the Gazprom sale have already been
included in the government's revenues in the final quarter of 1998.
	   The government holds 40 percent of Gazprom shares, with private
investors in Russia and abroad holding the remaining shares. The
government had put off the sale of a Gazprom stake after the
company's share prices plunged in the wake of the August
devaluation of the ruble.
	   The government plans to sell up to 5 percent of Gazprom shares,
but has not yet announced when it will offer the additional 2.5
percent.

Iran defeats Kuwait 2-0 for Asian Games soccer gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iran winning gold &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite being down to 10 men, Iran
dominated Gulf rival Kuwait 2-0 to capture the Asian Games gold
medal for soccer Saturday, while China easily outplayed host
Thailand in a consolation match for bronze.
	   A pair of first-half goals by Ahmed Karimi and world cup veteran
Karim Bagheri put the match out of reach for the struggling
Kuwaitis, who missed star striker Jasem Al-Huwaidi, out since the
semifinal against Thailand with a badly strained thigh.
	   The Iranians, always the favorite for gold, outplayed the
Kuwaitis on every level. Midfielder Karimi shined for Iran, scoring
on a high, close header in the 4th minute from a corner kick and
demonstrating flair in carving up the Kuwaiti offense.
	   Kuwaiti striker Farj Laheeb, who went into the final with an
Asian Games high of nine goals, one more than Al-Huwaidi, seldom
threatened in the first half as the Iranians never allowed the
Kuwaiti attack to gel.
	   In the bronze medal match, China easily dominated Thailand 3-0,
dashing the host nation's hopes of capturing its first soccer medal
ever in the regional competition.
	   Crystal Palace star Fan Zhiyi opened the scoring in the 25th
minute before a capacity crowd of 20,000 screaming, flag-waving
Thais in the southern city of Songkhla, slotting a free kick
through a break in the Thai defensive wall for the only score in
the first half.
	   Substitute Wang Peng added the insurance about 20 minutes into
the second half, taking a 12-meter shot that caromed off the keeper
into the back of the net. Ma Mingyu later came down the right side
and fired 20 meters at a tight angle into the far corner for the
final 3-0 score.
	   The goals were the third each in the games for Ma and Wang and
the second for Fan.
	   The Thais were a laggard shadow of the side that upset heavily
favored South Korea in Monday's quarterfinal. Under English coach
Peter Withe, they were hoping to better their best Asian Games
finish _ fourth place in 1990 _ but China's superior depth kept
them at bay.
	   For China also, the result was a disappointing decline from its
silver at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, four years ago.
The young Chinese squad lost twice to Gulf power Iran in the
tournament, once in a preliminary group and again in Wednesday's
semifinal.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's main downtown streets to denounce the
American and British air strikes on Iraq.
	   Witnesses said the U.S. Embassy's Marine guards fired tear gas
to disperse the crowd, but three protesters managed to enter the
grounds and climb the walls of the building to haul down and burn
the American flag.
	   Chanting ``Down with America,'' a crowd estimated at a thousand
surrounded the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. Many
pelted the building with stones, shattering windows.
	   ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a
switchboard operator at the embassy who would not give his name.
	   The protesters also attacked the nearby residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ryan Crocker, throwing stones and breaking windows. The
ambassador's wife, Christine, was in the building but was not hurt,
said a Syrian guard outside who would not give his name.
	   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
protesters later tried to turn on the U.S. Cultural Center around a
corner about a block away, but Syrian police were trying to block
their path.
	   Other demonstrators surrounded and threw stones at the nearby
British Embassy and the British Council, a government institution
that sponsors English language classes and cultural programs.
	   The protesters also overturned a British diplomatic vehicle,
said witnesses.
	   After initially trying to manage the crowds outside the U.S. and
British institutions, Syrian police later tried to break up the
protests but were still having trouble controlling the situation
after about an hour.
	   ``The Americans are trying to make us kneel down and surrender.
... I will not leave before I burn the flag and make my voice
heard,'' said Hafizah Abu Tarbous, a protester outside the U.S.
Embassy.
	   The embassy building was believed to be largely empty and closed
for the day. Efforts to reach officials at the embassy proved
unsuccessful since the operator said no one was available to
comment.
	   Sirens could be heard wailing in the background as the operator
spoke. Most of the protesters outside the building apparently were
university students or members of the youth organization of the
ruling Baath Party.
	   The attack on the embassy buildings came amid a massive protest
against the continued bombardment of neighboring Iraq by American
and British missiles.
	   Tens of thousands of marchers carried banners with anti-American
slogans and chanted demands for an end to the attacks on Iraq,
which have gone on for three nights.
	   ``No to killing and destruction,'' went one chant. ``The Iraqi
people will never kneel down,'' was another.
	   ``The Syrian people are with you, our Iraqi brothers,'' read one
banner carried by protesters.
	   Large demonstrations are rare in the Syrian capital, which is
under tight security control, and Saturday's marches throughout the
downtown could not have occurred without government approval.
	   During the protest marches, patriotic Syrian songs blared from
loudspeakers on some government buildings.
	   The protests in Damascus were part of a massive show of support
for the Iraqis across the Arab world. Demonstrations also erupted
Saturday in the West Bank and Egypt, and protests against the U.S.
and British attacks were staged Friday in Jordan, Lebanon and
Yemen.
	   Many in the crowds in Damascus expressed sympathy for the Iraqi
people, and some of the chants and banners pictured the air strikes
on Iraq as part of an assault on all the Arabs.
	   ``I feel sorry for the innocent Iraqi people,'' said Safaa
Hamama, a 21-year-old student. ``Does America have the right to
live on the blood of the Iraqi people?''
	   Aziza Fadhel, another student, said: ``The aggression on Iraq is
an aggression on the whole Arab nation.''
	   Among the chants shouted by the crowd was: ``You aggressors,
leave our children in Iraq, Libya and Sudan to live in peace.''

British attack Republican Guard installations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British jets attacked a regional headquarters of
the Republican Guard in overnight raids which also targeted air
defense and a battle tank storage area, a senior military officer
said Saturday.
	   Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defense staff, estimated
that the attacks achieved 75 percent of their objectives, without
losing any of Britain's 12 Kuwait-based Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   ``We want the Republican Guard to know that the cozy life they
have led under Saddam is under attack,'' said Defense Secretary
George Robertson.
	   He said the Republican Guard, considered the elite force of the
Iraqi military, played a key role in guarding the chemical and
biological weapons programs which are the prime targets of the
U.S-British operation.
	   Britain released video images of laser-guided bombs hitting
Republican Guard facilities at Al Kut, 100 miles (160 kms)
southeast of Baghdad, and the nearby Muhammad Al Amin garrison.
	   Robertson said U.S. and British analysts were continuing to
assess damage and he would not say whether the attacks would
continue.
	   ``We are absolutely determined to reduce the threat that Saddam
poses to the countries of the Middle East, the Gulf states,''
Robert said, adding: ``When we believe that threat has been lifted,
we will stop the operation.''
	   Guthrie said the U.S. and British operations were more intense
than on the previous night, but that British jets encountered less
antiaircraft fire.
	   Guthrie said leaflets dropped by U.S. and British planes in Iraq
had warned the regular army to stay out of the conflict. He said
the message was ``Keep ouf of this, you are not our targets, remain
in your barracks.''
	   ``And I think it is a message which has got across,'' Guthrie
said. He added that there had been no reports of Iraqi aircraft
challenging the attacking forces.

Mediator: progress achieved to end hostilities in Burundi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUKHDEV CHHATBAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Talks on ending ethnic and political
conflict in Burundi are progressing and will resume next month,
mediator Julius Nyerere said at the conclusion of a week of
committee meetings to identify issues for the next round.
	   The thumbs up Friday by the former Tanzanian president at the
end of five days of meetings in this northern Tanzania town, gave
Burundian officials hope that economic sanctions imposed on their
country by regional states may soon be lifted.
	   ``(The) remark gives me hope he will do something to help in
lifting the economic embargo against my country,'' Peace Process
minister, Ambroise Niyonsaba, said after Nyerere made remarks at
the close of talks by three of the five committees Friday.
	   On Saturday, Nyerere met with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
in Nairobi to discuss the peace talks, the private KTN television
network said.
	   Burundi's neighbors slapped an embargo on the tiny Great Lakes
nation after Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi and retired general, took the
presidency in a bloodless coup in July 1996.
	   Buyoya said only he could halt the ethnic bloodshed between the
Tutsi military and Hutu rebels that has claimed over 200,000 lives
since Tutsi paratroopers in 1993 killed the country's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu.
	   The violence has continued, with attacks by rebels of the 85
percent Hutu population trying to oust Buyoya and retaliations by
the military run by the country's 14 percent Tutsi minority.
	   Buyoya claims he has met the demands for lifting the embargo,
including a return to democratic institutions and opening of
dialogue towards peace.
	   A recent U.N. report said the sanctions had outlasted their
usefullness and were having devastating effects on Burundi's
poverty-stricken population.
	   On Friday, Nyerere said the talks between 18 parties involved in
the conflict were making progress, adding that ``knowing each other
has helped a great deal.''
	   The subcommittees identifying the nature of the Burundi
conflict, democracy and good governance, and peace and security for
all, began meeting in Arusha Monday as a lead-up to the fourth
round of peace talks Nyerere confirmed would take place Jan. 18.
	   The upcoming talks are to focus on reconstruction and
development, and will name the members to the committee dealing
with the subject.
	   During the third round of talks in October, representatives of
18 parties, movements and armed factions discussed issues of
democracy and good governance as well as peace and security.
	   Nyerere said hosting the peace talks have cost nearly dlrs. 1.2
million in donor funds to date, and he expected next year's talks
could run as high as dlrs 6 million if they begin to produce
tangible results.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials tried
Saturday to jump start political negotiations between Serb leaders
and Kosovo's secessionist Albanians by working to solidify the
divided Albanian camp.
	   French and Austrian diplomats led a group of international
officials to the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and followers of Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``We're here to convey a unified contact group message to Kosovo
Albanians ... to explore possibilities of unifying Kosovo Albanian
factions in order to enter a new phase of negotiations,'' said Jan
Kickert, spokesman for Austria's Ambassador to Belgrade, Wolfgang
Petritsch.
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to Macedonia Jacques
Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian negotiating team to discuss prospects for solving the
province's conflict through negotiations.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia _ also attended the talks.
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight
for full independence.
	   The talks come on the heels of what has been the bloodiest week
in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people have been
killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting
escalated early last year.
	   Also Saturday, funeral preparations were underway for 36 ethnic
Albanian guerrilla fighters killed in a border clash on Monday, as
well as for a Serb municipal leader found shot dead at the end of
the week.
	   The body of Zvonko Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo Polje, 5
kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital Pristina, was
found dumped along a roadside early Friday, badly beaten, with
multiple fracture wounds, and was shot between the eyes.
	   Kosovo Liberation Army representative Adem Demaci denied the
rebels were involved in the killing, suggesting Serbian secret
police may have been behind it.
	   ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of the Serbian
regime,'' said Demaci.
	   Serbian police said, however, the five assailants who broke into
Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs
at a rally hours after the killing called the death ``one more
attack on Serbia.''
	   Sainovic accused the KLA and pledging new action against Serbs
said ``every perpetrator will be prosecuted.''

China piles up more golds

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Hong Kong cyclist Wong Kam Po scored a
victory for the little teams at the Asian Games Saturday, while
sports giant China swept six gold medals in rowing and five in
wushu and defended its men's basketball title.
	   Thailand, which won two of the silver medals in the ancient
Chinese combat art of wushu, protested that the judging was biased,
and its officials urged a boycott of China in that sport.
	   The Chinese also won three of the day's eight gold medals in
track and field, lifting their overall gold total to 129 with just
three more golds left to be decided in these games. They won 135 in
the last games in 1994.
	   South Korea, a 112-92 loser to China in the men's basketball
final, stood second with 64 golds, and Japan had 52 after winning
the men's 4 x 400-meter relay on the track and the individual show
jumping event of equestrian competition.
	   Iran beat Kuwait 2-0 for the men's soccer gold. China shut out
host Thailand 3-0 for the bronze medal.
	   Meanwhile, Qatari runner Mohammed Taib won his fifth Asian Games
over eight years. He added the 5,000-meter title to the 1,500-meter
gold he had won earlier here, and to the one 5,000 and two 1,500
golds he had from past games.
	   As in the 1,500 here, he slowed dramatically at the finish to
let others almost catch up.
	   Kazakstan's Olga Shishigina, who missed the Olympics because of
testing positive for a steroid, set a games record of 12.63 seconds
in winning the women's 100-meter hurdles. China's Liu Jing was
second in 12.82.
	   For China, Chen Yanhao won the men's 110-meter hurdles, former
record holders Cai Weiyan and Sun Caiyun finished first and third
in the women's pole vault, and the women's 4 x 400-meter relay
quartet held off India for gold.
	   Uzbekistan's Sergi Voinov won the men's javelin with a toss of
79.70, and Kazakstan's Sergei Arzamassov beat another Chinese for
the gold in the triple jump by two centimeters, 17.00 to 16.98.
	   In the battle for supremacy in track and field, China had 15
golds to 12 for Japan, which just the men's marathon remaining, on
the games' closing day Sunday.
	   In the men's 200-kilometer cycling road race, Wong Kam Po gave
Hong Kong its fifth gold these Asian Games. The territory, which
still competes independently although it was returned to Chinese
rule last year, is having by far its best games, with golds so far
in bowling, billiards, wushu, yachting and cycling. In all previous
games, it had won only one gold medal _ in bowling in 1986.
	   Wong, silver medalist Makoto IIjima of Japan and bronze medalist
Victor Espiritu of the Philippines all were timed in 4 hours, 39
minutes, 27.23 seconds.
	   Thailand's Banna Kumfu won the women's 100-kilometer race ahead
of Japan's Kaori Sakashita and China's Wang Shuqing. All three were
timed in 3:01:25.93.
	   The Thais also won two gold medals in the Southeast Asian sport
of sepak takraw, beating Myanmar in both the men's and women's
circle competition.
	   With gold in the women's beach volleyball, for a 12-8, 12-5
victory over Japan, the Thais boosted their gold total to 24 _
double their original target of 12.
	   China won the men's beach volleyball gold with a 1-12, 12-10,
12-7 victory over Indonesia.
	   At the wushu matches, Thai officials walked out in protest
against what they called bias by a Chinese referee.
	   ``All final decisions came from the head judge, with great favor
to his own country's fighters. It was unfair,'' Thai assistant
chief referee Voranat Disayabuth said at a news conference,
	   He urged other Asian countries to boycott China by not joining
in future wushu events.
	   Thais took silver medals in two of the weight classes decided
Saturday, while Chinese won all five golds.
	   Against the Chinese rowers, Japan took three silver medals in
Saturday's six 2,000-meter races, but never came closer than 2.6
seconds.
	   With Saturday's victories, the Chinese completed a sweep of all
11 Asian Games rowing golds.
	   The feat re-established their perfection in the sport in Asia
after they missed one of the 12 decided at the last games in 1994.
China had swept all four in 1982 and all 12 in 1990.
	   Kazakstan won the water polo gold medal ahead of Uzbekistan and
China. In Saturday's final games, Kazakstan beat Japan 12-4,
Uzbekistan beat Iran 11-7, and China trounced Singapore 20-1.

Turkish Cypriot leader appoints premier-designate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on
Saturday asked Dervis Eroglu, the breakaway republic's incumbent
premier, to form a new government following elections earlier this
month, the Turkish Cypriot news agency reported.
	   Eroglu's center-right National Unity Party won over 40 percent
of the votes in what was seen as a show of approval for the
government's stance on the future of the divided island.
	   Turkish Cypriots, who declared their own state in 1983, insist
that any solution to the division of Cyprus depends on
international recognition of their state, which only Turkey
recognizes.
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkish forces invaded
the northern third of the island following an short-lived coup by
supporters of union with Greece.
	   Eroglu, 60, has been heading a coalition since 1996. He is
expected to begin consultations with other party leaders later
Saturday.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ A second U.S. aircraft carrier battle
group took up positions in the Gulf on Saturday, boosting the
number of warplanes and missiles able to strike Iraq.
	   A spokesman for the 5th Fleet, Cmdr. Gordon Hume, confirmed the
eight-ship group, led by the carrier USS Carl Vinson, was in the
region. But it was not clear whether it would immediately take part
in attacks if they continue.
	   The Vinson flotilla joins the carrier USS Enterprise and nine
other vessels in its group, which began the air strikes after
attacks were ordered late Wednesday.
	   Five other U.S. ships are in the Gulf, including mine sweepers
and amphibious vessels.

Son of Yemeni lawmaker released by kidnappers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Kidnappers have released the 11-year-old son
of a Yemeni Parliament member who was taken earlier in the week,
Al-Haq newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The paper said Omar Khaled, son of legislator Hamoud Khaled, was
freed on Thursday. Hamoud Khaled is a member of the ruling General
People's Congress party.
	   The youth was kidnapped last Monday outside his school in
downtown San`a by men dressed in military uniforms.
	   He was released after his father promised the kidnappers from
the Al-Faqeer tribe that he would look into their grievances, the
paper said.
	   Tribesmen in Yemen often resort to kidnapping to pressure the
government for more public services. The hostages generally have
been freed unharmed.
	   Meanwhile, a senior security official said that a Syrian
journalist was being questioned about meeting with tribal
kidnappers and would be put on trial. The official spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Sadek Hamaiel, a Syrian national who works for the Berliner
Zeitung daily, was taken into custody Thursday as he returned from
a meeting with four German hostages.
	   The Germans _ three women and a man _ were abducted Dec. 7 by
three gunmen from the Bani Dhabyan tribe and taken to Marib
province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital,
San`a.
	   Hamaiel was escorted to the area by tribesmen close to the
kidnappers. He was arrested with two tribesmen and charged with
traveling in tribal areas without government permission.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians clashed violently with
Israeli troops after a pro-Iraq demonstration Saturday, hurling
stones and firebombs at soldiers who fired back rubber bullets.
More than 80 marchers were hurt, four of them critically.
	   The rally in the West Bank town of Hebron and a smaller one in
the Gaza Strip town of Rafah came in defiance of a Palestinian
police ban on pro-Iraq demonstrations.
	   In Rafah, about 400 Palestinian protesters burned U.S. and
British flags. Police dispersed them, but without using force.
	   In Hebron, Palestinian police did not attempt to restrain about
3,000 marchers as they set out from Hebron University, some wearing
black hoods or masked with keffiyehs, carrying posters of Iraqi
president Saddam Hussein. They waved Iraqi flags and screamed
``Death to Israel _ death to America!''
	   When the marchers reached the center of Hebron _ the site of
several Jewish settlements and a frequent flashpoint _ about 400
protesters broke away from the main rally and threw stones and
firebombs at Israeli troops. The soldiers responded with volleys of
rubber bullets.
	   Amid pitched battles in the winding, cramped downtown streets,
soldiers and protesters ducked into shops and doorways for cover.
At one point, with stones raining down on them, about 20 Israeli
soldiers grouped and charged stone-throwers, firing rubber bullets
as they ran forward.
	   After two hours of fighting, Palestinian police moved in and
kept the demonstrators away from Israeli positions, and the
stone-throwers eventually dispersed.
	   Of the more than 80 Palestinians hurt by rubber-coated bullets,
four were critically injured, hospital officials in Hebron said.
Thirty were hospitalized and the rest treated at the scene.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials tried
Saturday to jump start political negotiations between Serb leaders
and Kosovo's secessionist Albanians by working to solidify the
divided Albanian camp.
	   French and Austrian diplomats led a group of international
officials to the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and followers of Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``We're here to convey a unified contact group message to Kosovo
Albanians ... to explore possibilities of unifying Kosovo Albanian
factions in order to enter a new phase of negotiations,'' said Jan
Kickert, spokesman for Austria's Ambassador to Belgrade, Wolfgang
Petritsch.
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to Macedonia Jacques
Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian negotiating team to discuss prospects for solving the
province's conflict through negotiations.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia _ also attended the talks.
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight
for full independence.
	   The talks come on the heels of what has been the bloodiest week
in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people have been
killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting
escalated early last year.
	   Also Saturday, funeral preparations were underway for 36 ethnic
Albanian guerrilla fighters killed in a border clash on Monday, as
well as for a Serb municipal leader found shot dead at the end of
the week.
	   The body of Zvonko Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo Polje, 5
kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital Pristina, was
found dumped along a roadside early Friday, badly beaten, with
multiple fracture wounds, and was shot between the eyes.
	   Kosovo Liberation Army representative Adem Demaci denied the
rebels were involved in the killing, suggesting Serbian secret
police may have been behind it.
	   ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of the Serbian
regime,'' said Demaci.
	   Serbian police said, however, the five assailants who broke into
Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs
at a rally hours after the killing called the death ``one more
attack on Serbia.''
	   Sainovic accused the KLA and pledging new action against Serbs
said ``every perpetrator will be prosecuted.''

	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP)_ Jean-Luc Cretier, the Olympic downhill
champion, was injured in a high-speed fall during Saturday's World
Cup downhill race in Val Gardena and was taken by helicopter to the
nearby hospital of Bressanone (Brixen) for medical examinations and
treatment.
	   According to initial reports the French skier possibly suffered
a knee injury.
	   Cretier, who won the Olympic title at Nagano this year, fell at
an icy section of the Saslong track shortly after start.
	   He skidded through an unfenced area and fell over a ridge of
grass and snow.
	   He was quickly reached by race stewards and doctors. After
initial treatment at the scene of the accident, the 33-year-old
skier of Bourg St. Maurice was taken on a stretcher toward a
waiting helicopter which flew him to hospital.
	   The icy, Saslong course proved extremely dangerous this weekend,
with bad spills marring the back-to-back speed races in this north
Italian valley.
	   American Ehlias Louis and Frenchman David Pretor tore knee
ligaments in spills during Friday's downhill.

Cambodians stage raucous protest against dumping of industrial
</HEADLINE>
waste &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hundreds of Cambodians staged a
raucous protest Saturday against the dumping of industrial waste on
the outskirts of a coastal city, police said Saturday.
	   Em Bun Sath, police commissioner of Sihanoukville, said about
500 people took part in the demonstration to demand the removal of
the refuse from the area, which many fear has been contaminated by
the dump.
	   Some protesters smashed the window of a local government office,
he said.
	   ``They threw rocks and broke the window of goods-inspection
office. They were very angry because they fear that their health is
being harmed by the waste,'' the police official said.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Hun Sen on Saturday ordered the
suspension of officials who manage the port at Sihanoukville for
their apparent collusion in allowing industrial waste to be
improperly discarded.
	   ``No one will be let free from being accountable for this
problem,'' said a visibly outraged Hun Sen upon his arrival from
Beijing, China, where he visited Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   The prime minister also appealed for help from international
organizations such as the World Health Organization to assist his
government in getting rid of the mess.
	   The waste, resembling blocks of concrete and dirt, was dumped
less than 100 meters (333 feet) from a village of 30 families about
10 kilometers outside the port city of Sihanoukville, 185
kilometers (115 miles) southwest of Phnom Penh.
	   It was believed to have been trucked in two weeks ago. Empty
hundred kilogram (220 pound) bags with markings indicating they
were from Taiwan were found lying next to the waste. Some bags were
labeled barium chloride.
	   Many residents living near the dumping site have complained that
they have suffered from exhaustion and diarrhea. Some fear it might
have poisoned a port worker, but health officials say there were
unable to officially determine the cause of the man's death.
	   While the government has demanded that the waste be shipped to
Taiwan, Taipei has refused to accept it. The two nations have no
formal diplomatic relations.
	   The head of a Cambodian company which allegedly imported the
waste has been detained for questioning by the police.

 &UR; Son of Yemeni lawmaker released by kidnappers

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Kidnappers have released the 11-year-old son
of a Yemeni Parliament member who was taken earlier in the week,
Al-Haq newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The paper said Omar Khaled, son of legislator Hamoud Khaled, was
freed on Thursday. Hamoud Khaled is a member of the ruling General
People's Congress party.
	   The youth was kidnapped last Monday outside his school in
downtown San`a by men dressed in military uniforms.
	   He was released after his father promised the kidnappers from
the Al-Faqeer tribe that he would look into their grievances, the
paper said.
	   Tribesmen in Yemen often resort to kidnapping to pressure the
government for more public services. The hostages generally have
been freed unharmed.
	   Meanwhile, a senior security official said that a Syrian
journalist was being questioned about meeting with tribal
kidnappers and would be put on trial. The official spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Sadek Hamaiel, a Syrian national who works for the Berliner
Zeitung daily, was taken into custody Thursday as he returned from
a meeting with four German hostages.
	   The Germans _ three women and a man _ were abducted Dec. 7 by
three gunmen from the Bani Dhabyan tribe and taken to Marib
province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital,
San`a.
	   Hamaiel was escorted to the area by tribesmen close to the
kidnappers. He was arrested with two tribesmen and charged with
traveling in tribal areas without government permission.
	   The Bani Dhabyan are asking the government for more schools,
hospitals, telephone lines and roads in their poor province.

Protesters stone U.S., British embassies in Syrian capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's downtown streets to denounce the
American and British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Witnesses said the U.S. Embassy's Marine guards fired tear gas
to disperse the crowd, but three protesters managed to enter the
grounds and climb the walls of the building to haul down and burn
the American flag.
	   Chanting ``Down with America,'' a crowd estimated at a thousand
surrounded the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. Many
pelted the building with stones, shattering windows.
	   ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a
switchboard operator at the embassy who would not give his name.
	   The protesters also attacked the nearby residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ryan Crocker, throwing stones and breaking windows. The
ambassador's wife, Christine, was in the building but was not hurt,
said a Syrian guard outside who would not give his name.
	   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
protesters later tried to turn on the U.S. Cultural Center about a
block away, but Syrian police were trying to block their path.
	   Other demonstrators surrounded and threw stones at the nearby
British Embassy and the British Council, a government institution
that sponsors English language classes and cultural programs.
	   The protesters also overturned a British diplomatic vehicle,
said witnesses.
	   Large demonstrations are rare in the Syrian capital, which is
under tight security control, and Saturday's marches throughout the
downtown could not have occurred without government approval.
	   After initially trying to manage the crowds outside the U.S. and
British institutions, Syrian police later tried to break up the
protests but were still having trouble controlling the situation
after about an hour.
	   ``The Americans are trying to make us kneel down and surrender.
... I will not leave before I burn the flag and make my voice
heard,'' said Hafizah Abu Tarbous, a protester outside the U.S.
Embassy.
	   The embassy building was believed to be largely empty and closed
for the day. Efforts to reach officials at the embassy proved
unsuccessful since the operator said no one was available to
comment.
	   Sirens could be heard wailing in the background as the operator
spoke. Most of the protesters outside the building apparently were
university students or members of the youth organization of the
ruling Baath Party.
	   The attack on the embassy buildings came amid a massive protest
against the continued bombardment of neighboring Iraq by American
and British missiles.
	   Tens of thousands of marchers carried banners with anti-American
slogans and chanted demands for an end to the attacks on Iraq,
which have gone on for three nights.
	   ``No to killing and destruction,'' went one chant. ``The Iraqi
people will never kneel down,'' was another.
	   ``The Syrian people are with you, our Iraqi brothers,'' read one
banner carried by protesters. \	   During the protest marches, patriotic Syrian songs blared from
loudspeakers on some government buildings.
	   The protests in Damascus were part of a massive show of support
for the Iraqis across the Arab world. Demonstrations also erupted
Saturday in the West Bank and Egypt, and protests against the U.S.
and British attacks were staged Friday in Jordan, Lebanon and
Yemen.
	   Many in the crowds in Damascus expressed sympathy for the Iraqi
people.
	   Aziza Fadhel, another student, said: ``The aggression on Iraq is
an aggression on the whole Arab nation.''
	   Among the chants shouted by the crowd was: ``You aggressors,
leave our children in Iraq, Libya and Sudan to live in peace.''

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ As pro-independence activists rallied in
the streets Saturday, a U.N. envoy arrived in East Timor and said
that a peaceful solution to the long-running conflict in the
Indonesian-controlled territory was within grasp.
	   The U.N. diplomat, Jamsheed Marker, flew aboard an Indonesian
military helicopter to Dili, the seaside capital of the former
Portuguese colony. Upon landing, he warned that any fresh unrest
could delay peace talks that have gained momentum in recent months.
	   ``We are getting very close to an agreement and it is very
important for all persons concerned to maintain peace and not to
resort to any form of violence,'' Marker said.
	   The envoy's trip had heightened fears that rallies timed for his
arrival could trigger riots and derail negotiations between
Indonesia and Portugal, which along with the United Nations does
not recognize Indonesian authority in East Timor.
	   However, there were no reports of violence while Marker met for
five and a half hours with military officials as well as pro- and
anti-independence leaders.
	   He said the meetings provided helpful input ahead of another
round of U.N.-sponsored talks in New York next month between
Indonesia and Portugal.
	   Ignoring an appeal from their spiritual leader to abandon street
demonstrations, some 2,000 separatist protesters meandered through
Dili in a convoy of buses, trucks and motorcycles.
	   Anti-riot officers with clubs, reinforced plastic shields and
rifles guarded the local Parliament building, a frequent target of
pro-independence rallies.
	   East Timor's Nobel laureate, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo,
reiterated an appeal that protesters, many of them students, get
off the streets to avoid the possibility of clashes with Indonesian
troops.
	   ``Please stop the demonstrations. It will disturb efforts to
find a peaceful solution in East Timor,'' Belo told reporters after
visiting a high school in Dili on Saturday.
	   ``It will be better if the demonstrators go back home and go to
school because we're coming into Christmas time, so we need a calm
situation,'' said Belo, a co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize
for his efforts to solve the conflict in his troubled homeland.
	   East Timor is predominately Roman Catholic, while some 90
percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim.
	   But Belo's message was lost on the protesters who shouted
``independence'' and waved flags of the separatist rebel movement
that has been fighting Indonesian troops since they invaded in
1975. Activists staged similar, peaceful rallies earlier this week.
	   Marker was scheduled to meet Belo on Sunday before leaving East
Timor later in the day.
	   Peace talks chaired by Marker were revitalized earlier this year
after Jakarta offered to grant autonomy to East Timor in exchange
for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   The process picked up speed after the ouster in May of
authoritarian President Suharto, who took a hard line on the
half-island territory of 800,000 people. His successor and onetime
protege, President B.J. Habibie, has promised nationwide political
reforms and has adopted a more conciliatory approach to East Timor.
	   However, sporadic fighting between guerrillas and the Indonesian
military persists. Many independence activists want a total
withdrawal of Indonesian troops, who have been accused of
widespread human rights abuses over the years.
	   Marker last visited East Timor in July and held talks at that
time under heavy guard by Indonesian troops at a remote airport.
	   During a visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers shot and
killed two pro-independence protesters at a rally outside a Dili
hotel where the envoy was staying.

	   IN THE GULF OF ALASKA _ Mountainous waves pounded the fishing
vessel La Conte mercilessly, breaking her up and forcing her
five-man crew to leap into the 38-degree Fahrenheit (3 C) sea. One
by one, three U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crews flew into the maw
of an arctic storm with hurricane-force winds to attempt a rescue.
It was a mission that will be talked about for years in the
remotest Coast Guard air bases and academy classrooms. And when it
was over, five men would receive the Distinguished Flying Cross,
America's highest peacetime honor. Theirs is a tale of struggle and
courage in the face of nature's remorseless power, but it is also a
saga of wild, untamed Alaska, beginning with a mysterious discovery
in a bear's den on a remote island.
	   Storm Gods And Heroes, by AP National Writer Todd Lewan, is
moving Sunday, Dec. 20, as a narrative serial in five parts
intended for use from Sunday, Dec. 20, through Thursday, Dec. 24,
or thereafter. Each part is accompanied by a box, slugged
Heroes-Story So Far, explaining the format and summarizing parts of
the story.
	   Each segment of the story has a cliffhanger ending. The five
parts are moving together on World Service circuits to help
subscribers in planning. The first story, is 2,500 words; the
succeeding stories range from 1,100 to 1,200 words in length. An
editor's note included at the end of each part explains that the
story is based on extensive interviews with the rescue crews,
surviving fishermen and other participants, as well as on a
523-page record of the Coast Guard's inquest into the affair.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Accused of ``high crimes and misdemeanors''
for his actions in concealing a sexual affair, President Bill
Clinton stood on the brink of impeachment Saturday in a House torn
by partisanship. Somber Republican leaders were bringing four
articles of impeachment to a vote on the House floor, marking the
first time in 130 years that an American chief executive has faced
such a threat. An Associated Press telephone survey showed a
majority of lawmakers supported at least one article. Prior to the
voting, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton planned to visit Capitol
Hill to give a pep talk to dispirited Democrats. Mrs. Clinton's
efforts represented yet another unusual turn of events in a week
that saw the bitter fight over Clinton's future converging with the
U.S. military attack on Iraq. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)

dawn on Saturday, with U.S. and British forces pressing a punishing
air offensive on Iraq for a third night. Reporters saw fiery
streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk cruise missiles arcing
across the sky and landing in giant fireballs. Warheads exploded a
few seconds later, lighting the pre-dawn horizon in a red glow that
silhouetted palm trees against the dark sky. Iraqi anti-aircraft
gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling the sky with booms and
bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets streaked high above. When
the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens blaring
were heard speeding away. Saturday's attack appeared to be the
toughest yet against Baghdad since the U.S. and British militaries
began air strikes early Thursday to punish Iraq for its obstruction
of U.N. inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass
destruction. Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the
first two nights of attacks. (IRAQ)
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's downtown streets to denounce the
American and British airstrikes on Iraq. Witnesses said the U.S.
Embassy's Marine guards fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, but
three protesters managed to enter the grounds and climb the walls
of the building to haul down and burn the American flag. Chanting
``Down with America,'' a crowd estimated at a thousand surrounded
the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. Many pelted the
building with stones, shattering windows. (SYRIA-US)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Military investigators found traces of
poison in a body recovered from a suspected North Korean boat sunk
by South Korea's navy, officials said Saturday. The finding
indicated that some of the boat's crewmen may have killed
themselves before their vessel was sunk Friday in a gunbattle off
South Korea's southern coast, Defense Ministry officials said.
South Korean warships pounded the low-slung speedboat with naval
guns and depth charges. South Korean officials believe the boat was
on a mission to land or pick up North Korean spies in the South.
But North Korea's government accused Seoul of fabricating the
incident to raise tension and carry out a U.S. plan to trigger a
second war on the divided Korean peninsula. (KOREAS-INFILTRATION)
	   PARIS (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson, Chicago millionaire
Steve Fossett and teammate Per Lindstrand sailed into Libyan
airspace Saturday on day two of their landmark quest to travel
around the world in a ballon. Spokeswoman Jackie McQuillan of ICO
Global, a mobile telephone company supporting the voyage, said
Branson was suffering from a sore throat, but that all three
adventurers were in good spirits after a breakfast of
vitamin-packed food packages. The 200-foot-high (61-meter) balloon
crossed into Libyan airspace on Saturday and by evening was
expected to fly over Turkey after passing over the Mediterranean
Sea and eastern Cyprus, Mcquillan said. Good weather, a good wind
and a cloudless sky augured well for the travelers in their quest
to become the first to circle the globe in a balloon. (BALLOON

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite being down to 10 men, Iran
dominated Gulf rival Kuwait 2-0 to capture the Asian Games gold
medal for soccer Saturday, while China easily outpaced host
Thailand in a consolation match for the bronze.
	   A pair of first-half goals by Ahmed Karimi and World Cup veteran
Karim Bagheri put the match out of reach for the struggling
Kuwaitis, who missed star striker Jasem al-Huwaidi, out since the
semifinal against Thailand with a badly strained thigh.
	   The Iranians, always the favorites for a gold, outplayed the
Kuwaitis on every level in the first half. Midfielder Karimi shined
for Iran, scoring on a high, close header in the 4th minute from a
corner kick and showing flair in carving up the Kuwaiti offense.
	   Kuwaiti striker Farj Laheeb, who went into the final with a
games-high nine goals, one more than al-Huwaidi, seldom threatened
in the first half as the Iranians never allowed the Kuwaiti attack
to gel. But the Kuwaitis also managed to shut down Bayern Munich
star Ali Daei, Iran's top games scorer with eight.
	   Bagheri, another key prop in the Iranian side missing the
injured Mohammad Khakpour, struck his third goal of the games in
the 29th minute, skirting the last layer of Kuwaiti defense and
firing a tight shot from the edge of the goal area to just inside
the far post.
	   In the second half, the Iranians largely sat on their lead and
allowed Kuwait to regroup and set up a series of free kicks and
corners. Laheeb and Bader al-Halabeej threatened but couldn't find
the goal.
	   In the 33rd minute, Iran was reduced to 10 men when defender
Mehdi Mahdavikia was sent off after a high-boot interception that
brought down Kuwait's Muhammad Ben Haji. But Iran held off a
relentless series of Kuwaiti attacks to maintain the shutout.
	   ``I'm very happy for the Iranian team,'' said a jubilant Daei
before mounting the podium for the gold medal. ``The Iranian team
is the best in Asia and this feels normal to us.''
	   A dejected al-Huwaidi said that five days rest wasn't enough to
overcome his injury and that ``it was painful to sit on the
sidelines and watch my team lose.''
	   Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, head of the Kuwaiti soccer
federation and the Olympic Council of Asia, said his players were
intimidated against the Iranians in the first half and made
mistakes, but found their footing again in the last 45 minutes.
	   ``I'm happy for the Iranians; they deserved it,'' the sheikh
said. ``The Kuwaitis are newcomers and we are missing nine of our
players. They have done very well.''
	   Iran brought a side packed with World Cup veterans. Their
experience showed throughout the three-week soccer competition
among 23 original teams. Tiny Oman upset the Iranians in the second
round, but Iran otherwise dominated its matches.
	   Japan and South Korea, which also went to France and like the
Iranians did poorly, left most of their World Cup veterans at home
in favor of bringing up younger players in preparation for the 2000
Olympics in Sydney.
	   In the battle for bronze, China dashed Thailand's hopes of
capturing its first-ever soccer medal in the regional Olympic-style
sportsfest.
	   Crystal Palace star Fan Zhiyi opened the scoring in the 25th
minute before a capacity crowd of 20,000 screaming, flag-waving
Thais in the southern city of Songkhla, slotting a free kick
through a break in the Thai defensive wall for the only score in
the first half.
	   Substitute Wang Peng added the insurance 21 minutes into the
second half, taking a 12-meter shot that caromed off the keeper
into back of the net. Ma Mingyu later came down the right side and
fired 20 meters at a tight angle for the final 3-0 score.
	   The goals were the third each in the Games for Ma and Wang, and
the second for Fan.
	   The Thais were a laggard shadow of the side that upset heavily
favored South Korea in Monday's quarterfinal. Under English coach
Peter Withe, they were hoping to better their best Asian Games
finish _ fourth place in 1990 _ but China's superior depth kept
them at bay.
	   For China also, the result was a disappointing decline from its
silver at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, four years ago.
The young Chinese squad lost twice to Gulf power Iran in the
tournament, once in a preliminary group and again in Wednesday's
semifinal.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand won two more Asian Games gold
medals in sepak takraw Saturday, boosting its total to five in the
Southeast Asian sport.
	   Myanmar won the silver medal in both Saturday's events _ men's
and women's circle competition, in which teams compete
individually, with the players standing in a circle and kicking a
small rattan ball to teammates to score points.
	   In the men's competition, Thailand had 5,134 to 4,701 for
Myanmar and 3,593 for Malaysia.
	   In the women's, it scored 3,708 to 3,374 for Myanmar and 2,543
for Vietnam.
	   Earlier, the Thais won the men's and women's team events and the
men's regu. Vietnam won the women's regu gold.
	   ``We are very proud of the gold,'' Thai official Suwatchai
Kerdmec said after the final victory, in the men's circles.
	   ``At Hiroshima (the 1994 games), we had zero medals, but the
host Olympic committee set gold medal targets and we met our
goal.''
	   After the women's victory, Thai player Wanwipa Silahoi said,
``I'm very excited and very happy because this is my first time in
a tournament.''
	   The teams events are played like volleyball, but use of the
hands is barred and the ball is sent across the net with acrobatic
kicks.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians clashed violently with
Israeli troops after a pro-Iraq demonstration Saturday, hurling
stones and firebombs at soldiers who fired back rubber-coated
bullets. More than 100 marchers were hurt, hospital officials said.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months, even including
demonstrations that tore through the West Bank last week over
Palestinian demands for release of prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   The rally in the West Bank town of Hebron and a smaller one in
the Gaza Strip town of Rafah came in defiance of a Palestinian
police ban on pro-Iraq demonstrations.
	   In Rafah, about 400 Palestinian protesters burned U.S. and
British flags. Police dispersed them, but without using force.
	   In Hebron, Palestinian police did not attempt to restrain about
3,000 marchers as they set out from Hebron University, some wearing
black hoods or masked with keffiyehs, carrying posters of Iraqi
president Saddam Hussein. They waved Iraqi flags and screamed
``Death to Israel _ death to America!''
	   When the marchers reached the center of Hebron _ the site of
several Jewish settlements and a frequent flashpoint _ about 400
protesters broke away from the main rally and threw stones and
firebombs at Israeli troops. The soldiers responded with volleys of
rubber bullets.
	   Amid pitched battles in the winding, cramped downtown streets,
soldiers and protesters ducked into shops and doorways for cover.
At one point, with stones raining down on them, about 20 Israeli
soldiers grouped and charged stone-throwers, firing rubber bullets
as they ran forward.
	   After two hours of intense fighting, Palestinian police moved in
and kept the demonstrators away from Israeli positions, and the
stone-throwers eventually dispersed.
	   Of 104 Palestinians hurt by rubber-coated bullets, four were
seriously injured, hospital officials in Hebron said. Thirty were
hospitalized and the rest treated at the scene.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's main downtown streets to denounce the
American and British air strikes on Iraq.
	   Witnesses said the U.S. Embassy's Marine guards fired tear gas
to disperse the crowd, but three protesters managed to enter the
grounds and climb the walls of the building to haul down and burn
the American flag.
	   Chanting ``Down with America,'' a crowd estimated at a thousand
surrounded the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. Many
pelted the building with stones, shattering windows.
	   ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a
switchboard operator at the embassy who would not give his name.
	   The mobs later attacked two other American installations and two
British government buildings, but there were no reports of injuries
to any Westerners.
	   Witnesses said about a dozen protesters were taken away to a
hospital after being overcome by tear gas outside the U.S. Embassy.
	   The crowd also marched on the nearby residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ryan Crocker, throwing stones and breaking windows. The
ambassador's wife, Christine, was in the building but was not hurt,
said a Syrian guard outside who would not give his name.
	   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
protesters later broke into a nearby American school and the U.S.
Cultural Center around a corner about a block away, despite efforts
by Syrian police to block their path.
	   The crowd broke up furniture in the two buildings, both closed
for the day.

	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Italy's Kristian Ghedina won
Saturday's World Cup downhill race in Val Gardena _ the second of
back-to-back speed races here + ending the winning streak of
Norwegian Lasse Kjus and extending the winless series of the
Austrians.
	   Ghedina captured his tenth World Cup career victory in a replay
of his 1997 triumph in this northern valley when he won the second
of consecutive downhills.
	   The 29-year-old skier from Cortina d'Ampezzo clocked a winning
time of two minutes, 4.17 seconds down the 3,495-meter long Saslong
course, dropping 839 meters.
	   Kjus, winner of the two previous World Cup downhills, finished
runnerup, 0.14 seconds behind.
	   Second place kept the Norwegian skier atop the World Cup overall
standings.
	   Franz Werner edged Austrian teammate Hermann Maier for third
place, 0.28 seconds behind the winner.
	   Maier complained that a race stewart disturbed his run crossing
the course as he was coming down. The jury did not immediately
accept the Austrian team complaint as the skier did not stop and
made it to the finish line, still in fourth place.
	   The Austrians are winless after three downhill races this season
following a triumphant start in the other three disciplines of the
World Cup.
	   Ghedina's time Saturday was nearly two seconds slower than Kjus'
winning time the previous day, over the same icy course and
distance.
	   The race was marred by a bad spill of Olympic downhill champion
Jean-Luc Cretier.
	   The Frenchman fell at an icy section shortly after the start,
skidded off the track and fell over a ridge of snow and grass.
	   He was taken by helicoper to the nearby hospital of Bressanone
(Brixen). According to initial reports he possibly suffered a knee
injury.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials tried
Saturday to jump-start political negotiations between Serb leaders
and Kosovo's secessionist Albanians by working to solidify the
divided Albanian camp.
	   French and Austrian diplomats led a group of international
officials to the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders in an attempt to bring together the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army and the more moderate followers of Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   ``We're here to convey a unified contact group message to Kosovo
Albanians ... to explore possibilities of unifying Kosovo Albanian
factions in order to enter a new phase of negotiations,'' said Jan
Kickert, spokesman for Austria's Ambassador to Belgrade, Wolfgang
Petritsch.
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to Macedonia Jacques
Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian negotiating team to discuss prospects for solving the
province's conflict through negotiations.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia _ also attended the talks.
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight
for full independence.
	   The talks come on the heels of what has been the bloodiest week
in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people have been
killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting
escalated early last year.
	   Also Saturday, funeral preparations were underway for 36 ethnic
Albanian guerrilla fighters killed in a border clash on Monday, as
well as for a Serb municipal leader found shot dead at the end of
the week.
	   The body of Zvonko Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo Polje, five
kilometers (three miles) west of the provincial capital Pristina,
was found dumped along a roadside early Friday, badly beaten, with
multiple fracture wounds, and was shot between the eyes.
	   Kosovo Liberation Army representative Adem Demaci denied the
rebels were involved in the killing, suggesting Serbian secret
police may have been behind it.
	   ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of the Serbian
regime,'' said Demaci.
	   Serbian police said, however, the five assailants who broke into
Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs
at a rally hours after the killing called the death ``one more
attack on Serbia.''
	   Sainovic accused the KLA and, pledging new action against Serbs,
said ``every perpetrator will be prosecuted.''

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite being down to 10 men, Iran
dominated Gulf rival Kuwait 2-0 to capture the Asian Games gold
medal for soccer Saturday, while China easily outpaced host
Thailand in a consolation match for the bronze.
	   A pair of first-half goals by Ahmed Karimi and World Cup veteran
Karim Bagheri put the match out of reach for the struggling
Kuwaitis, who missed star striker Jasem al-Huwaidi, out since the
semifinal against Thailand with a badly strained thigh.
	   It was the second Asian Games title for Iran, which beat North
Korea for the gold in 1990.
	   The Iranians, always the favorites for a gold, outplayed the
Kuwaitis on every level in the first half. Midfielder Karimi shined
for Iran, scoring on a high, close header in the 4th minute from a
corner kick and showing flair in carving up the Kuwaiti offense.
	   Kuwaiti striker Farj Laheeb, who went into the final with a
games-high nine goals, one more than al-Huwaidi, seldom threatened
in the first half as the Iranians never allowed the Kuwaiti attack
to gel. But the Kuwaitis also managed to shut down Bayern Munich
star Ali Daei, Iran's top games scorer with eight.
	   Bagheri, another key prop in the Iranian side missing the
injured Mohammad Khakpour, struck his third goal of the games in
the 29th minute, skirting the last layer of Kuwaiti defense and
firing a tight shot from the edge of the goal area to just inside
the far post.
	   In the second half, the Iranians largely sat on their lead and
allowed Kuwait to regroup and set up a series of free kicks and
corners. Laheeb and Bader al-Halabeej threatened but couldn't find
the goal.
	   In the 33rd minute, Iran was reduced to 10 men when defender
Mehdi Mahdavikia was sent off after a high-boot interception that
brought down Kuwait's Muhammad Ben Haji. But Iran held off a
relentless series of Kuwaiti attacks to maintain the shutout.
	   ``I'm very happy for the Iranian team,'' said a jubilant Daei
before mounting the podium for the gold medal. ``The Iranian team
is the best in Asia and this feels normal to us.''
	   A dejected al-Huwaidi said that five days rest wasn't enough to
overcome his injury and that ``it was painful to sit on the
sidelines and watch my team lose.''
	   Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, head of the Kuwaiti soccer
federation and the Olympic Council of Asia, said his players were
intimidated against the Iranians in the first half and made
mistakes, but found their footing again in the last 45 minutes.
	   ``I'm happy for the Iranians; they deserved it,'' the sheikh
said. ``The Kuwaitis are newcomers and we are missing nine of our
players. They have done very well.''
	   Iran brought a side packed with World Cup veterans. Their
experience showed throughout the three-week soccer competition
among 23 original teams. Tiny Oman upset the Iranians in the second
round, but Iran otherwise dominated its matches.
	   Japan and South Korea, which also went to France and like the
Iranians did poorly, left most of their World Cup veterans at home
in favor of bringing up younger players in preparation for the 2000
Olympics in Sydney.
	   In the battle for bronze, China dashed Thailand's hopes of
capturing its first-ever soccer medal in the regional Olympic-style
sportsfest.
	   Crystal Palace star Fan Zhiyi opened the scoring in the 25th
minute before a capacity crowd of 20,000 screaming, flag-waving
Thais in the southern city of Songkhla, slotting a free kick
through a break in the Thai defensive wall for the only score in
the first half.
	   Substitute Wang Peng added the insurance 21 minutes into the
second half, taking a 12-meter shot that caromed off the keeper
into back of the net. Ma Mingyu later came down the right side and
fired 20 meters at a tight angle for the final 3-0 score.
	   The goals were the third each in the Games for Ma and Wang, and
the second for Fan.
	   The Thais were a laggard shadow of the side that upset heavily
favored South Korea in Monday's quarterfinal. Under English coach
Peter Withe, they were hoping to better their best Asian Games
finish _ fourth place in 1990 _ but China's superior depth kept
them at bay.
	   For China also, the result was a disappointing decline from its
silver at the last Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, four years ago.
The young Chinese squad lost twice to Gulf power Iran in the
tournament, once in a preliminary group and again in Wednesday's
semifinal.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Wong Kam Po rode to a narrow victory
Saturday in the men's 200-kilometer cycling road race, giving Hong
Kong its fifth gold medal of the Asian Games.
	   Hong Kong is having by far its best games, with golds so far in
bowling, billiards, wushu, yachting and cycling. In all previous
games, it had won only one gold medal _ in bowling in 1986.
	   For host Thailand, also having its best games, Banna Kumfu won
the women's 100-kilometer race. The Thais now have a total of 24
golds _ double their target and also double their best previous
haul, which was 12 in 1966.
	   Wong, the 1997 Tour of the Philippines champion, finished just
ahead of Japan's Makoto Iijima and the Philippines' Victor
Espiritu. All three medalists were timed in 4 hours, 39 minutes,
27.23 seconds, an average of 42.94 kph.
	   Filipino Warren Davadilla, this year's winner of the Tour of the
Philippines, finished sixth in 4:41:20.12. Espiritu was the 1996
winner.
	   In the women's race, Banna, silver medalist Kaori Sakashita of
Japan and bronze medalist Wang Shuqing of China all were timed in
3:01:25.93.

	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Italy's Kristian Ghedina won
Saturday's World Cup downhill race in Val Gardena _ the second of
back-to-back speed races here + ending the winning streak of
Norwegian Lasse Kjus and extending the winless series of the
Austrians.
	   Ghedina captured his tenth World Cup career victory in a replay
of his 1997 triumph in this northern valley when he won the second
of consecutive downhills.
	   The 29-year-old skier from Cortina d'Ampezzo clocked a winning
time of two minutes, 4.17 seconds down the 3,495-meter long Saslong
course, dropping 839 meters.
	   Kjus, winner of the two previous World Cup downhills, finished
runnerup, 0.14 seconds behind.
	   Second place kept the Norwegian skier atop the World Cup overall
standings.
	   Werner Franz edged Austrian teammate Hermann Maier for third
place, 0.28 seconds behind the winner.
	   Maier complained that a race stewart disturbed his run crossing
the course as he was coming down. The jury did not immediately
accept the Austrian team complaint as the skier did not stop and
made it to the finish line, still in fourth place.
	   The Austrians are winless after three downhill races this season
following a triumphant start in the other three disciplines of the
World Cup.
	   Ghedina's time Saturday was nearly two seconds slower than Kjus'
winning time the previous day, over the same icy course and
distance.
	   The race was marred by a bad spill of Olympic downhill champion
Jean-Luc Cretier.
	   The Frenchman fell at an icy section shortly after the start,
skidded off the track and fell over a ridge of snow and grass.
	   He was taken by helicoper to the nearby hospital of Bressanone
(Brixen). According to initial reports he possibly suffered a knee
injury.

Chinese win five golds; Thais say Chinese referee biased
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that Chinese delegation had no immediate comment &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai wushu officials walked out
Saturday in protest against what they called bias by a Chinese
referee as Chinese athletes swept the day's five Asian Games gold
medals in their ancient combat art.
	   ``All final decisions came from the head judge, with great favor
to his own country's fighters. It was unfair,'' Thai assistant
chief referee Voranat Disayabuth said at a news conference,
	   He urged other Asian countries to boycott China by not joining
in future wushu events.
	   A spokeswoman for the Chinese delegation said its office so far
had not received any information on the dispute.
	   Thai technical officials withdrew when the stage referee failed
to stop China's Zheng Kunyou from attacking Taiwan's Hsu Chin-kun
as Hsu was falling from the stage in their 56-kilogram division
bout.
	   Hsu was taken to the first aid room and ordered to rest for 30
minutes. He then refused to return to the stage, and the head judge
announced Zheng as the gold medal winner. The Thais said the judge
ignored a rule against attacking off the stage.
	   Voranat said that if wushu still lacks international judging
standards, it should not become part of the 2008 Olympics, for
which China wishes to be the host.
	   ``Let wushu develop itself to be more standard and fair before
promoting it as an international sport,'' he said.
	   As China originated wushu, the position of head judge always
belongs to a Chinese, while other referees come from other Asian
countries, Voranat said.
	   Dissatisfaction began when judge Wan Yulong awarded China's Xing
Zhujie victory over the Philippines' Chulhang Rolly at 52 kilograms
without extending the match to a third round, even though the two
had received neutral points.
	   Other Chinese winners were Zheng Kunyou, who defeated Thailand's
Pichit Jaisak at 56 kilograms; Sun Xunchang, who beat Thailand's
Komsan Thongtup at 60 kilograms, and You Bangmeng, who beat Iran's
Ojaghi Hossein at 70 kilograms.
	   For wushu sparring events, five judges around the stage hold up
red or black paddles to indicate their votes. The head judge sits
at another table.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians clashed violently with
Israeli troops after a pro-Iraq demonstration Saturday, hurling
stones and firebombs at soldiers who fired back rubber-coated
bullets. More than 100 marchers were hurt, hospital officials said.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months, even including
demonstrations that tore through the West Bank last week over
Palestinian demands for release of prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   The rally in the West Bank town of Hebron and a smaller one in
the Gaza Strip town of Rafah came in defiance of a Palestinian
police ban on pro-Iraq demonstrations.
	   In Rafah, about 400 Palestinian protesters burned U.S. and
British flags. Police dispersed them, but without using force.
	   In Hebron, Palestinian police did not attempt to restrain about
3,000 marchers as they set out from Hebron University, some wearing
black hoods or masked with keffiyehs, carrying posters of Iraqi
president Saddam Hussein. They waved Iraqi flags and screamed
``Death to Israel _ death to America!''
	   When the marchers reached the center of Hebron _ the site of
several Jewish settlements and a frequent flashpoint _ about 400
protesters broke away from the main rally and threw stones and
firebombs at Israeli troops. The soldiers responded with volleys of
rubber bullets.
	   Amid pitched battles in the winding, cramped downtown streets,
soldiers and protesters ducked into shops and doorways for cover.
At one point, with stones raining down on them, about 20 Israeli
soldiers grouped and charged stone-throwers, firing rubber bullets
as they ran forward.
	   After two hours of intense fighting, Palestinian police moved in
and kept the demonstrators away from Israeli positions, and the
stone-throwers eventually dispersed.
	   Of 104 Palestinians hurt by rubber-coated bullets, four were
seriously injured, hospital officials in Hebron said. Thirty were
hospitalized and the rest treated at the scene.
	   The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership.
On the one hand, it is anxious to rein in the unmitigated backing
Palestinians gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that
set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   At the same time, however, Arafat's government apparently wants
to allow some outlet for Palestinian street sentiment in favor of
Iraq. Official Palestinian radio on Saturday played patriotic
songs.
	   The Hebron rally drew Palestinian political groups from across
the political spectrum, ranging from the radical Islamic group
Hamas to Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. Fatah's participation came
despite a declaration by Arafat's own police chief in Gaza that
such demonstrations were banned.
	   On Friday, Palestinian authorities also shut down media
broadcasting pro-Iraqi sentiments and detained journalists _
including some working for foreign media outlets _ who covered
pro-Iraqi unrest. The Gaza City bureau of The Associated Press was
closed down by the authorities, and remained shut on Saturday.
	   The Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a strike starting
Saturday to protest the curbs on their coverage, and said they
would stage a sit-in at the Palestinian legislative council on
Monday.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov Saturday called on all
Russians to unite under a new political movement to restore the
country to its position as a leading world power.
	   Luzhkov, speaking at the founding congress of the Fatherland
movement, urged ``workers, farmers, intelligentsia and military
servicemen'' to unite in the name of Russia, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   ``Join us,'' he said. ``We are facing very difficult and
immensely important tasks.''
	   Luzhkov was elected leader of the movement by the 1,123
delegates attending the congress, Interfax reported. The new
political movement was launched by the mayor in November,
apparently to support Luzhkov's likely presidential bid in 2000.
	   He said Fatherland's goal was to ensure Russia's development as
a market economy with a strong state sector drawing support from
both the left and right of the political spectrum.
	   Luzhkov called for a revival of the defense industry and the
country's nuclear forces to restore Russia to a position of one of
the world's eight leading powers.
	   ``We need a modern army, a reliable nuclear deterrence system,''
Luzhkov told the delegates. ``The international community needs a
strong Russia as a great power that respects itself and other
powers,'' he said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   He said the need for a strong army was illustrated by the attack
on Iraq by Britain and the United States.
	   Domestically, he said he wanted to create a state system ``based
on social democracy and a combination of market-economy methods and
social policies.''
	   Luzhkov lashed out at government reformists, and said they had
not accomplished anything significant.
	   ``Due to the radical reforms implemented in Russia in the past
few years, the country has begun turning into a dump site,'' the
mayor said. ``If the situation in the country remains as it was, we
will all be up against some serious trouble.''
	   So far, Luzhkov has not said outright that he would run for
president. The mayor is popular in Moscow, and has strong ratings
in opinion polls. However, it is unclear how strong a popular
following he has in Russia's outlying regions, where many resent
the capital's relative prosperity.
	   Others expected to run in 2000 are Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov, liberal politician Grigory Yavlinsky, former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Alexander Lebed, a former general
who is now governor of a vast region in Siberia.

	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP)_ Jean-Luc Cretier, the Olympic downhill
champion, was injured in a high-speed fall during Saturday's World
Cup downhill race in Val Gardena and was taken by helicopter to the
nearby hospital of Bressanone (Brixen) for medical examinations and
treatment.
	   According to initial reports the French skier possibly suffered
a knee injury.
	   Cretier, who won the Olympic title at Nagano this year, fell at
an icy section of the Saslong track shortly after start.
	   He skidded through an unfenced area and fell over a ridge of
grass and snow.
	   He was quickly reached by race stewards and doctors. After
initial treatment at the scene of the accident, the 33-year-old
skier of Bourg St. Maurice was taken on a stretcher toward a
waiting helicopter which flew him to hospital.
	   The icy, Saslong course proved extremely dangerous this weekend,
with bad spills marring the back-to-back speed races in this north
Italian valley.
	   American Ehlias Louis and Frenchman David Pretor tore knee
ligaments in spills during Friday's downhill.

Baghdad comes under worst attack in three-day offensive

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Thunderous blasts rocked Baghdad before
dawn on Saturday, with U.S. and British forces pressing a punishing
air offensive on Iraq for a third night.
	   Reporters saw fiery streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk
cruise missiles arcing across the sky and landing in giant
fireballs. Warheads exploded a few seconds later, lighting the
pre-dawn horizon in a red glow that silhouetted palm trees against
the dark sky.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling the
sky with booms and bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets
streaked high above.
	   When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens
blaring were heard speeding away. Officials, who must escort
journalists wishing to tour the city, refused to take them to the
targeted areas.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the Friday and Saturday
attacks was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center of
the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Western reporters staying at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad
saw explosions in nearby areas known to have palaces, a
headquarters of the Special Security service and the command center
for the Popular Army, which is a paramilitary force.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Saturday's attack appeared to be the toughest yet against
Baghdad since the U.S. and British militaries began air strikes
early Thursday to punish Iraq for its obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks.
	   On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more
people were killed and 21 wounded in a missile attack on the
Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The report said an agricultural training center and a number of
houses were damaged.
	   Meanwhile, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by
the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.N. Navy officials said.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's main downtown streets to denounce the
American and British air strikes on Iraq.
	   Witnesses said the U.S. Embassy's Marine guards fired tear gas
to disperse the crowd, but three protesters managed to enter the
grounds and climb the walls of the building to haul down and burn
the American flag.
	   Chanting ``Down with America!'' a crowd estimated at a thousand
surrounded the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. Many
pelted the building with stones, shattering windows.
	   ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a
switchboard operator at the embassy who would not give his name.
	   The mobs later attacked two other American installations and two
British government buildings, but there were no reports of injuries
to any Westerners.
	   Witnesses said about a dozen protesters were taken away to a
hospital after being overcome by tear gas outside the U.S. Embassy.
	   The crowd also marched on the nearby residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ryan Crocker, throwing stones and breaking windows. The
ambassador's wife, Christine, was in the building but was not hurt,
said a Syrian guard outside who would not give his name.
	   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
protesters later broke into a nearby American school and the U.S.
Cultural Center around a corner about a block away, despite efforts
by Syrian police to block their path.
	   The crowd broke up furniture in the two buildings, both closed
for the day.
	   Other demonstrators surrounded and threw stones at the nearby
British Embassy and the British Council, a government institution
that sponsors English language classes and cultural programs.
	   The protesters also overturned a British diplomatic vehicle,
witnesses said.
	   After initially trying to manage the crowds outside the U.S. and
British institutions, Syrian police later tried to break up the
protests but were still having trouble controlling the situation
after about an hour.
	   ``The Americans are trying to make us kneel down and surrender.
... I will not leave before I burn the flag and make my voice
heard,'' said Hafizah Abu Tarbous, a protester outside the U.S.
Embassy.
	   The embassy building was believed to be largely empty and closed
for the day. Embassy officials could not immediately be reached;
someone answering the phone there said no one was available for
comment. Sirens could be heard wailing in the background as the
person spoke.
	   Most of the protesters outside the building apparently were
university students or members of the youth organization of the
ruling Baath Party.
	   Tens of thousands of marchers in Damascus carried banners with
anti-American slogans and chanted demands for an end to the attacks
on Iraq, which have gone on for three nights.
	   ``No to killing and destruction,'' went one chant. ``The Iraqi
people will never kneel down,'' was another.
	   ``The Syrian people are with you, our Iraqi brothers,'' read one
banner carried by protesters.
	   During the protest marches, patriotic Syrian songs blared from
loudspeakers on some government buildings.
	   The protests in Damascus were part of a massive show of support
for the Iraqis across the Arab world. Demonstrations also erupted
Saturday in the West Bank and Egypt, and protests against the U.S.
and British attacks were staged Friday in Jordan, Lebanon and
Yemen.

Breakthrough on delayed sale of state copper mines
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MILDRED MULENGA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ South African investors signed a
long-awaited deal to buy Zambia's state-owned copper mines, Finance
Minister Edith Nawakwi said.
	   The Anglo-American Corp. of South Africa will take over Nchanga,
Nkana and Konkola mines, the remaining major assets of Zambia's
sole mining conglomerate, the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines,
Nawakwi announced.
	   The new owners are expected operate the bulk of copper mining
operations in the central Copperbelt province by March 31 after
months of bickering over the price.
	   Final legal touches to the deal will be completed by then,
Nawakwi said in an announcement late Friday.
	   She said it was also agreed with Anglo-American that government
would retain a 20 percent share holding and would also establish a
team to monitor operations by the private investors.
	   The South African investors have pledged to pump in dlrs 300
million in three years into Nkana, Nchanga and Konkola mines and
buy the nearby Konkola Deep mine a year later with a pledged
investment of dlrs 800 million.
	   Konkola Deep is said be the key to the future viability of
copper mining in Zambia at at time of low copper prices on world
commodity markets.
	   Nawakwi said the agreed initial purchase price was enhanced by
those long term benefits, including another dlrs 10 million in
royalties payable over 10 years and dividends on the government's
20 percent stake.
	   Additionally, the state agreed with the World Bank and other
financial institutions for the financing of social programs to
cushion fired miners and keep schools, health services and water
supplies running that were provided under state control of the
mines.
	   It was not immediately clear how many miners will be laid off.
Layoff packages were being worked out, Nawakwi said.
	   Opponents of privatization have estimated that as many as 15,000
jobs are at risk from the sale of the copper mines. Tens of
thousands more jobs have been lost under the economic
liberalization and privatizations program adopted in 1991.
	   The government has been under intense donor pressure to sell off
the inefficient and overmanned mines, the last of its large
state-owned enterprises.
	   The mines were estimated to be losing up to dlrs 1 million a day
in lost revenues in recent weeks, contributing a slide in the value
of the Zambian currency against the U.S. dollar.
	   Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines accounts for 10 percent of the
economy and earn 90 percent of the nation's foreign currency
earnings.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Thunderous blasts rocked Baghdad before
dawn on Saturday, with U.S. and British forces pressing a punishing
air offensive on Iraq for a third night.
	   Reporters saw fiery streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk
cruise missiles arcing across the sky and landing in giant
fireballs. Warheads exploded a few seconds later, lighting the
pre-dawn horizon in a red glow that silhouetted palm trees against
the dark sky.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling the
sky with booms and bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets
streaked high above.
	   When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens
blaring were heard speeding away. Officials, who must escort
journalists wishing to tour the city, refused to take them to the
targeted areas.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the Friday and Saturday
attacks was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center of
the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Western reporters staying at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad
saw explosions in nearby areas known to have palaces, a
headquarters of the Special Security service and the command center
for the Popular Army, which is a paramilitary force.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Saturday's attack appeared to be the toughest yet against
Baghdad since the U.S. and British militaries began air strikes
early Thursday to punish Iraq for its obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks.
	   On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more
people were killed and 21 wounded in a missile attack on the
Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The report said an agricultural training center and a number of
houses were damaged.
	   Meanwhile, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by
the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.N. Navy officials said.

Thais, Chinese win beach golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's Gu Hongyu and Li Hue rallied
from a first set drubbing Saturday to take the first men's beach
volleyball gold medal ever at the Asian Games.
	   The Chinese pair defeated Indonesia's Irikhun Shofanna and Agus
Salim 1-12, 12-10, 12-7 in the sport's debut at the games.
	   Japan's veteran and favored duo of Miho Saiki and Yuki Takahashi
was upset in the women's final by Thailand's Manatsana Pangka and
Rattanaporn Arlaisuk, 12-5, 12-8.
	   Japan blamed the loss on the large Thai crowd at the resort of
Pattaya.
	   ``Our players have never played before such a big crowd of
spectators _ even at the Olympics _ so they must have been under a
lot of pressure,'' said coach Shoji Setoyama.
	   The Thai winners, both 22, had never played on the pro tour
while Japan players compete in a pro league.
	   Setoyama said the Japanese players couldn't hear each other due
to the cheering crowd for the home team and had to make assumptions
for their moves.
	   Indonesia's Anjas Asmara and Iwan Sumoyo won the men's bronze,
with Japan's Ryoko Tokuno and Chiaki Kusuhara capturing the women's
bronze.

Vatican says pope better and going back to work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with pope receiving Antioch patriarch &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II was feeling better
Saturday after a day of rest to combat a light flu and he has
resumed his audiences, the Vatican said.
	   On Friday, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the flu,
accompanied by a fever of 38 degrees Celsius (100 F), forced the
pope to cancel that day's appointments.
	   But by Saturday morning the pope was doing better and went ahead
with a private meeting with the patriach of Antioch, Ignace Moussa
I Dauod, in the early afternoon, the Vatican said.
	   John Paul used the audience as an occasion to call for more
collaboration between Catholics who follow the Eastern rite, as
does the patriarch, and Orthodox Christians.
	   The pope was scheduled to appear at noon Sunday at his studio
window overlooking St. Peter's Square to give his weekly blessing.
	   The flu hit at the start of the busy holiday period for the
frail pope, who no longer celebrates Mass Christmas morning in St.
Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time to rest after midnight
Mass Christmas eve.
	   The pope is scheduled to journey to Mexico and St. Louis,
Missouri, in January.

Meissnitzer wins first career downhill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup overall leader Alexandra
Meissnitzer of Austria widened the scope of her supremacy on
Saturday, winning her first career World Cup downhill.
	   ``It was a big dream of mine to win in the downhill because I
compete in three disciplines and had never won in the downhill,''
said Meissnitzer, who has also won two super-Gs and a pair of giant
slaloms this season. ``For me it was a big goal as I am not a real
downhiller and it's not so easy. You need a special feeling.''
	   Meissnitzer, who has won five-of-12 races this season, stormed
down the icy, bumpy 2,500-meter (8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours in 1
minute, 42.68 seconds.
	   ``At the top today I didn't do anything differently than
yesterday,'' said Meissnitzer, who finished fourth in Friday's
downhill. ``But at the bottom I pushed more. Yesterday I was too
passive.''
	   The Austrian was the only skier to break the 42 second barrier,
with runnerup Regine Cavagnoud of France crossing in 1:43.00 flat.
	   Cavagnoud, who is having her best season since 1993, finished
ahead of World Cup downhill leader Renate Goetschl of Austria,
third in 1:43.17.
	   For Goetschl, the winner of the season-opening back-to-back
downhills in Lake Louise, Canada, the third place finish was little
consolation.
	   A favorite coming into this weekend's double header, Goetschl
appeared headed for a third consecutive win when a near fall in
Friday's race left the Austrian back in 14th.
	   With the third place, Goetschl managed to cling to her lead in
the World Cup downhill standings where she sits with 278 points.
Her lead is tremulous, however, with Meissnitzer quickly gaining
ground and currently just 23 points behind in second.
	   With five victories and two other podium finishes, Meissnitzer
has rocketed to the top of the overall standings, rapidly pulling
away from her closest challengers.
	   The Austrian leads with 775 points, a whopping 353 ahead of
second place Goetschl. Germany's Martina Ertl, who finished 15th,
dropped to third from second with 416.
	   But while her lead appears solid, the 25-year-old Austrian is
adamant that the overall title does not figure on her ``to do''
list.
	   ``I really don't think about the overall,'' insisted
Meissnitzer, who said her goals did include world championship and
Olympic gold. ``That's something in the heads of the coaches and
the media.
	   ``If you think too much about the overall, it's bad for your
skiing as you tend to be stiff and not relaxed enough,''
Meissnitzer explained. ``My aim this year is to win at the world
championships in Vail.''
	   But whether she likes it or not, Meissnitzer has become the
woman to beat, chased by those who openly have their eye on the
World Cup's most prized trophy.
	   Her biggest rivals, Ertl and teammate Hilde Gerg, second and
third in the overall last year behind Katja Seizinger, and 1997
overall champion Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden, will attempt to narrow
the gap during Sunday's slalom, which also counts towards the
combined.
	   Though she noramlly does not race in the slalom, Meissnitzer has
chosen to try her hand at the combined, relying on her strength in
the downhill to carry her through.

110 reported killed as army forces rogue militia from Brazzaville
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: In 6th graf, Bacongo cq.
 &UR; By LOUIS OKAMBA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Sporadic gun battles
rattled Brazzaville's southern outskirts for a third straight day
on Saturday, and civilians were evacuated by government troops
pinning down a rogue militia group with machine gun and mortar
fire.
	   Police director-general Jean Francois Ndenguec said the
renegades had been forced out of Republic of Congo's capital into
the southern countryside bordering the former Zaire, now known as
Congo.
	   ``We have finished the war in the capital and we expect to
finish it very soon elsewhere,'' Ndenguec told The Associated
Press.
	   Neighborhoods on Brazzaville's south side were largely abandoned
and army officers said they would treat any people remaining in
violence flashpoints as ``enemies.''
	   At least 100 renegade soldiers and 10 government troops were
killed since the fighting began on Wednesday, Ndenguec said. He did
not know whether civilians had been caught in the crossfire and his
estimates could not be independently confirmed.
	   Scattered machine gun and mortar fire could be heard early
Saturday morning in the Bacongo suburb on the southern fringe of
Brazzaville and later in Madibou, a town about 15 kilometers (10
miles) south of the capital. The exact origin of the gunfire was
unclear.
	   More than 10,000 people are believed to have fled the Central
African country. Fighting between the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of
former Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas began Wednesday night and has
continued sporadically ever since.
	   Although earlier in the week many people panicked in downtown
Brazzaville, believing the Ninjas had launched an all-out attack,
by Saturday shops re-opened and commuters returned to the streets.
	   Electricity remained off and working telephones were scarce,
although officials promised power would be restored by Saturday
night.
	   Last year, Kolelas and his sometime-ally, ousted president
Pascal Lissouba, fled the country after President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso and his ``Cobra'' militia _ with the help of Angolan
government troops _ defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil war
last year.
	   Since then, the Ninjas have resisted disarmament and have been
waging a campaign against the government.
	   Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia groups including his own
Cobra militia. Many of his former militia fighters have joined the
army.
	   Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, sending
troops to help Sassou-Nguesso defeat Lissouba. Many Angolan
soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended.
	   Angola joined the civil war because Lissouba was believed to be
sending aid to the Angolan rebel group UNITA, which has been
fighting Angola's government for two decades.
	   The Republic of Congo government says UNITA is now supporting
the Ninjas and that 15 UNITA soldiers were captured last week near
Brazzaville.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's main downtown streets to denounce the
American and British air strikes on Iraq.
	   Witnesses said the U.S. Embassy's Marine guards fired tear gas
to disperse the crowd, but three protesters managed to enter the
grounds and climb the walls of the building to haul down and burn
the American flag.
	   Chanting ``Down with America!'' a crowd estimated at a thousand
surrounded the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. Many
pelted the building with stones, shattering windows.
	   ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a
switchboard operator at the embassy who would not give his name.
	   The mobs later attacked two other American installations and two
British government buildings, but there were no reports of injuries
to any Westerners.
	   Witnesses said about a dozen protesters were taken away to a
hospital after being overcome by tear gas outside the U.S. Embassy.
	   Large demonstrations are rare in the Syrian capital, which is
under tight security control, and Saturday's marches throughout the
downtown could not have occurred without government approval.

Former dictator Ceausescu's old wines to be auctioned off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of bottles of wine,
champagne and cognac that belonged to late Romanian dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, will be auctioned off, an official said
Saturday.
	   The auction will take place Monday in Bucharest.
	   Most of the wines come from Romanian vineyards, others were
given to Ceausescu by other Communist leaders. The oldest two
bottles from Tirnave vineyard, 190 miles north of Bucharest, date
back to 1918, said government spokesman Mihai Nica.
	   Every bottle is sealed with a golden ribbon and bearing an
attached card reading, ``Ceausescu's family residence.''
	   The state-run company that owns the 1,150 bottles, Bucur S.A.,
intends to sell them as a package starting at 35 million lei (dlrs
3,334), roughly dlrs 3 per bottle. The money will be given to
senior citizens home.
	   So far, only one person reportedly announced its intention to
participate to the auction.
	   Following the communist dictator's execution in the 1989
anti-Communist revolution, some 3,000 bottles of spirits were found
in his villa in Bucharest. The following year, 1,800 were sold and
the money was donated to a hospital.
	   Ceausescu's cars and boats are also still in government
possession. The state would like to auction them off, but is still
awaiting a government decision to allow the sale to go ahead.

Norwegian Lasse Kjus and extending the winless series of the
Austrians.
	   Ghedina captured his tenth World Cup career victory in a replay
of his 1996 (cq) triumph in this northern valley when he won the
second of consecutive downhills.
	   ``I did not ski a perfect race. I made some mistakes. But it
does not matter when you win,'' said Ghedina, as he carried his
4-year-old brother Luca shoulder on at the finish line.
	   ``He brings me good luck. He was here two years ago, and I won
the race,'' Ghedina added, after hugging the brother.
	   The 29-year-old skier from Cortina d'Ampezzo clocked a winning
time of two minutes, 4.17 seconds down the 3,495-meter long Saslong
course, dropping 839 meters.
	   Kjus, winner of the two previous World Cup downhills, finished
runnerup, 0.14 seconds behind.
	   Second place kept the Norwegian skier atop the World Cup overall
standings, with 493 points after ten races.
	   Werner Franz edged Austrian teammate Hermann Maier for third
place, 0.28 seconds behind the winner.
	   The two Austrians had placed second and third respectively,
behind Kjus, in Friday's downhill making up for the race canceled
in Whistler Mountain, canada, earlier this month.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion, complained that a race
stewart disturbed his run crossing the course as he was coming
down.
	   The jury rejected a complaint by the Austrian team because Maier
did not stop and made it to the finish line, still placing fourth
with a gap of 0.48.
	   Maier said later he could have hardly beaten Ghedina, even in
absence of the disturbing presence of the steward who was rushing
to help a fallen competitor.
	   The Austrians are winless in three downhill races this season
after starting the season triumphantly in the other three
disciplines of the World Cup.
	   Ghedina's time Saturday was nearly two seconds slower than Kjus'
winning time the previous day, over the same icy course and
distance.
	   The Italian skier had placed fourth Friday and a distant 45th in
the first season downhill at Val D'Isere last week.
	   The race was marred by a bad spill of Olympic downhill champion
Jean-Luc Cretier. The Frenchman tore the cruciate ligament of his
left knee.
	   Cretier, who had won the Olympic title in Nagano this year
beating Kjus, fell at an icy section shortly after the start,
skidded off the track and fell over a ridge of snow and grass.
	   He was taken by helicoper to the nearby hospital of Bressanone
(Brixen).
	   Mauro Cornaz, coach of the French downhill team, said Cretier
suffered a season-ending torn ligament, bruises in his face and in
his hands.
	   Two other skiers, American Ehlias Louis and France's David
Pretot, torn knee ligaments in falls during Friday's race.
	   The men's World Cup circuit continues Sunday with a giant slalom
at nearby Alta Badia.

Meissnitzer wins first career downhill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup overall leader Alexandra
Meissnitzer of Austria widened the scope of her supremacy on
Saturday, winning her first career World Cup downhill.
	   ``It was a big dream of mine to win in the downhill because I
compete in three disciplines and had never won in the downhill,''
said Meissnitzer, who has also won two super-Gs and a pair of giant
slaloms this season. ``For me it was a big goal as I am not a real
downhiller and it's not so easy. You need a special feeling.''
	   Meissnitzer, who has won 5-of-12 races this season, stormed down
the icy, bumpy 2,500-meter (8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours in 1
minute, 42.68 seconds.
	   ``At the top today I didn't do anything differently than
yesterday,'' said Meissnitzer, who finished fourth in Friday's
downhill. ``But at the bottom I pushed more. Yesterday I was too
passive.''
	   The Austrian was the only skier to break 42 seconds, with
runner-up Regine Cavagnoud of France crossing in 1:43.
	   Cavagnoud, who is having her best season since 1993, finished
ahead of World Cup downhill leader Renate Goetschl of Austria,
third in 1:43.17.
	   For Goetschl, the winner of the season-opening back-to-back
downhills in Lake Louise, Canada, the third place finish was little
consolation.
	   A favorite coming into this weekend's double header, Goetschl
appeared headed for a third consecutive win when a near fall in
Friday's race left the Austrian back in 14th.
	   With the third place, Goetschl managed to cling to her lead in
the World Cup downhill standings where she sits with 278 points.
Her lead is shaky, however, with Meissnitzer quickly gaining ground
and currently just 23 points behind in second.
	   With five victories and two other podium finishes, Meissnitzer
has rocketed to the top of the overall standings, rapidly pulling
away from her closest challengers.
	   The Austrian leads with 775 points, a whopping 353 ahead of
second place Goetschl. Germany's Martina Ertl, who finished 15th,
dropped to third from second with 416.
	   But while her lead appears solid, the 25-year-old Austrian is
adamant that the overall title does not figure on her ``to do''
list.
	   ``I really don't think about the overall,'' insisted
Meissnitzer, who said her goals did include world championship and
Olympic gold. ``That's something in the heads of the coaches and
the media.
	   ``If you think too much about the overall, it's bad for your
skiing as you tend to be stiff and not relaxed enough,''
Meissnitzer explained. ``My aim this year is to win at the world
championships in Vail.''
	   But whether she likes it or not, Meissnitzer has become the
woman to beat, chased by those who openly have their eye on the
World Cup's most prized trophy.
	   Her biggest rivals, Ertl and teammate Hilde Gerg, second and
third in the overall last year behind Katja Seizinger, and 1997
overall champion Pernilla Wiberg of Sweden, will attempt to narrow
the gap during Sunday's slalom, which also counts towards the
combined.
	   Though she normally does not race in the slalom, Meissnitzer has
chosen to try her hand at the combined, relying on her strength in
the downhill to carry her through.

Ahonen clinches second World Cup victory of the season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARRACHOV, Czech Republic (AP) _ Reigning world champion Janne
Ahonen of Finland clinched his second World Cup victory of the
season Saturday, soaring a record 132-meters in the second round of
a ski jumping event on the K120 hill at Harrachov.
	   Ahonen, who was seventh after the first round, leaping an
average 109 meters, beat Rony Hornschuh of Germany, who also
improved notably in the second round, by 13 points.
	   Japan's Kazuoshi Funaki finished third, with jumps of 107.5 and
123.5 meters.
	   Olav Magne Doenne of Norway, who was in comfortable lead after
round one with a stylish 122-meter leap, slipped to fourth place
after a weak second-round effort in an increasingly dense fog and
pouring rain, while his teammate Morten Aagheim took fifth.
	   Saturday's event was rescheduled from Liberec to Harrachov due
to a rapid thaw.
	   The overall World Cup leader Martin Schmitt of Germany, who won
the initial three events of the season, didn't take part in the
competition, prefering to practice at home instead.

Terrorist suspect to be extradited from Germany to United States
</HEADLINE>
soon &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ A suspected top aide to Osama Bin Laden,
the Saudi millionaire accused of organizing the deadly bombings at
U.S. embassies in Africa this summer, will be extradited to the
United States from Germany soon, a government spokesman said
Saturday.
	   Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who is jailed in Munich, is to be
extradited on Monday, a report by the Hamburg-based Welt am Sonntag
newspaper said.
	   But the spokesman in Bonn, requesting anonymity, said he could
not confirm what day the extradition would take place.
	   He said that justice and foreign ministry officials had given
final approval for the extradition on Friday. ``So it could happen
in the next few days.''
	   The latest decision comes after the Federal Constitutional Court
threw out an appeal against the extradition by Salim on Dec. 11,
saying it was baseless.
	   The justice ministry said at the time that extradition would be
approved as soon as the U.S. government gave assurances that Salim
would not face a death penalty, which is forbidden by the German
constitution.
	   Salim, 40, has been jailed since his arrest in Bavaria three
months ago on a U.S. warrant. A Munich state court originally
approved his extradition on Nov. 27.
	   U.S. officials claim Salim is Bin Laden's finance chief and have
charged him in New York with murder conspiracy and use of weapons
of mass destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens.
	   Three other alleged accomplices of Bin Laden already are jailed
in the United States.
	   The Aug. 7 bombings in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people,
including 12 Americans.

China piles up more golds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with India winning field hockey, billiards &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Hong Kong cyclist Wong Kam Po scored a
victory for the little teams at the Asian Games Saturday, while
sports giant China swept six gold medals in rowing and five in
wushu and defended its men's basketball title.
	   Thailand, which won two of the silver medals in the ancient
Chinese combat art of wushu, protested that the judging was biased,
and its officials urged a boycott of China in that sport.
	   The Chinese also won three of the day's eight gold medals in
track and field, lifting their overall gold total to 129 with just
one more gold left to be decided in these games, in the men's
marathon Sunday. They won 135 in the last games in 1994.
	   South Korea, a 112-92 loser to China in the men's basketball
final, stood second with 64 golds after being shut out of the
victory column for a full day for the first time in these games.
	   Its favored men's field hockey team lost 4-2 to India in a
penalty shootout after the gold medal game's regulation and extra
time ended with the teams tied 1-1. India gained another gold, its
seventh of the games, when Ashok Shandilya beat compatriot Geet
Sethi 5-4 in the English billiards final.
	   Japan had 52 golds after winning the men's 4 x 400-meter relay
on the track and the individual show jumping event of equestrian
competition.
	   Iran beat Kuwait 2-0 for the men's soccer gold. China shut out
host Thailand 3-0 for the bronze medal.
	   Meanwhile, Qatari runner Mohammed Taib won his fifth Asian Games
over eight years. He added the 5,000-meter title to the 1,500-meter
gold he had won earlier here, and to the one 5,000 and two 1,500
golds he had from past games.
	   As in the 1,500 here, he slowed dramatically at the finish to
let others almost catch up.
	   Kazakstan's Olga Shishigina, who missed the Olympics because of
testing positive for a steroid, set a games record of 12.63 seconds
in winning the women's 100-meter hurdles. China's Liu Jing was
second in 12.82.
	   For China, Chen Yanhao won the men's 110-meter hurdles, former
record holders Cai Weiyan and Sun Caiyun finished first and third
in the women's pole vault, and the women's 4 x 400-meter relay
quartet held off India for gold.
	   Uzbekistan's Sergi Voinov won the men's javelin with a toss of
79.70, and Kazakstan's Sergei Arzamassov beat another Chinese for
the gold in the triple jump by two centimeters, 17.00 to 16.98.
	   In the battle for supremacy in track and field, China had 15
golds to 12 for Japan, with just Sunday's marathon remaining.
	   In the men's 200-kilometer cycling road race, Wong Kam Po gave
Hong Kong its fifth gold these Asian Games. The territory, which
still competes independently although it was returned to Chinese
rule last year, is having by far its best games, with golds so far
in bowling, billiards, wushu, yachting and cycling. In all previous
games, it had won only one gold medal _ in bowling in 1986.
	   Wong, silver medalist Makoto IIjima of Japan and bronze medalist
Victor Espiritu of the Philippines all were timed in 4 hours, 39
minutes, 27.23 seconds.
	   Thailand's Banna Kumfu won the women's 100-kilometer race ahead
of Japan's Kaori Sakashita and China's Wang Shuqing. All three were
timed in 3:01:25.93.
	   The Thais also won two gold medals in the Southeast Asian sport
of sepak takraw, beating Myanmar in both the men's and women's
circle competition.
	   With gold in the women's beach volleyball, for a 12-8, 12-5
victory over Japan, the Thais boosted their gold total to 24 _
double their original target of 12.
	   China won the men's beach volleyball gold with a 1-12, 12-10,
12-7 victory over Indonesia.
	   At the wushu matches, Thai officials walked out in protest
against what they called bias by a Chinese referee.
	   ``All final decisions came from the head judge, with great favor
to his own country's fighters. It was unfair,'' Thai assistant
chief referee Voranat Disayabuth said at a news conference,
	   He urged other Asian countries to boycott China by not joining
in future wushu events.
	   Thais took silver medals in two of the weight classes decided
Saturday, while Chinese won all five golds.
	   Against the Chinese rowers, Japan took three silver medals in
Saturday's six 2,000-meter races, but never came closer than 2.6
seconds.
	   With Saturday's victories, the Chinese completed a sweep of all
11 Asian Games rowing golds.
	   The feat re-established their perfection in the sport in Asia
after they missed one of the 12 decided at the last games in 1994.
China had swept all four in 1982 and all 12 in 1990.
	   Kazakstan won the water polo gold medal ahead of Uzbekistan and
China. In Saturday's final games, Kazakstan beat Japan 12-4,
Uzbekistan beat Iran 11-7, and China trounced Singapore 20-1.

Baghdad comes under worst attack in three-day offensive

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Thunderous blasts rocked Baghdad before
dawn on Saturday, with U.S. and British forces pressing a punishing
air offensive on Iraq for a third night.
	   Reporters saw fiery streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk
cruise missiles arcing across the sky and landing in giant
fireballs. Warheads exploded a few seconds later, lighting the
pre-dawn horizon in a red glow that silhouetted palm trees against
the dark sky.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling the
sky with booms and bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets
streaked high above.
	   When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens
blaring were heard speeding away. Officials, who must escort
journalists wishing to tour the city, refused to take them to the
targeted areas.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the Friday and Saturday
attacks was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center of
the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Western reporters staying at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad
saw explosions in nearby areas known to have palaces, a
headquarters of the Special Security service and the command center
for the Popular Army, which is a paramilitary force.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Saturday's attack appeared to be the toughest yet against
Baghdad since the U.S. and British militaries began air strikes
early Thursday to punish Iraq for its obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks.
	   On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more
people were killed and 21 wounded in a missile attack on the
Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The report said an agricultural training center and a number of
houses were damaged.
	   Meanwhile, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by
the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.

Cardinal reiterates that pope hoping to go to Iraq in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II is still hoping to visit
Iraq in 2000, the Vatican's secretary of state said Saturday as he
renewed the Holy See's call for the end to the U.S-British
bombings.
	   Cardinal Angelo Sodano's, the Vatican's No. 2 official, was
asked by reporters at a ceremony if John Paul might make the
journey as part of Holy Year activities.
	   ``We hope so,'' Sodano replied. ``It's in our prayers.''
	   The pope has mentioned more than once that he would like to make
a pilgrimage to Iraq, which includes the Biblical birthplace of
Abraham, but no plans for such a visit have been announced.
	   Asked if the bombings constituted an aggression, the cardinal
replied: ``Either it's a war of defense or a war of aggression.
There's no middle ground.''
	   Sodano added: ``I hope that, after these three days, by now the
bombings are over.''
	   Earlier in the week, the Vatican's spokesman, Joaquin
Navarro-Valls, said the pope was saddened by the airstrikes and
that the Holy See hoped for a quick end to what it termed
aggression.

Ahonen clinches second World Cup victory of the season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARRACHOV, Czech Republic (AP) _ Reigning world champion Janne
Ahonen of Finland clinched his second World Cup victory of the
season Saturday, soaring a record 132-meters in the second round of
a ski jumping event on the K120 hill at Harrachov.
	   Ahonen, who was seventh after the first round, leaping an
average 109 meters, beat Rony Hornschuh of Germany, who also
improved notably in the second round, by 13 points.
	   Japan's Kazuoshi Funaki finished third, with jumps of 107.5 and
123.5 meters.
	   Olav Magne Doenne of Norway, who was in comfortable lead after
round one with a stylish 122-meter leap, slipped to fourth place
after a weak second-round effort in an increasingly dense fog and
pouring rain, while his teammate Morten Aagheim took fifth.
	   Saturday's event was rescheduled from Liberec to Harrachov due
to a rapid thaw.
	   The overall World Cup leader Martin Schmitt of Germany, who won
the initial three events of the season, didn't take part in the
competition, prefering to practice at home instead.

Olympic champion injured in downhill spill

seson-ending accident &QL; 
 &UR; With Val Gardena-Men-Downhill &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP)_ Jean-Luc Cretier, the Olympic downhill
champion, tore knee ligaments following a season-ending spill
during Saturday's World Cup downhill race in Val Gardena.
	   Mauro Cornaz, coach of the French downhill team, said Cretier
torn the cruciate ligament of his left knee and bruises in his face
and hands following the high-speed fall on an icy course.
	   Cornzas said it was a season-ending injury, also putting at risk
the ski career of the 33-year-old ace from Bourg St. Maurice.
	   Cretier, who had won the Olympic title at Nagano this year, fell
shortly after the start, at a steep, icy section.
	   Cretier, coming down the No. 6 bib, skidded through an unfenced
area and fell over a ridge of grass and snow.
	   He was quickly treated by race stewards and doctors at the scene
of the accident and was later taken by helicopter to the nearby
hospital of Bressanone (Brixen).
	   Saturday's downhill was the second of consecutive World Cup
speed races in this north Italian valley.
	   Cretier had placed 25th on Friday.
	   The icy, Saslong course proved extremely dangerous this weekend,
with bad spills marring both days of competition.
	   American Ehlias Louis and Frenchman David Pretot tore knee
ligaments in spills during Friday's downhill.
	   Canadian Ed Podivinsky also suffered a season-ending knee injury
during Weddnesday's practice here.

Emirates ferry to Iraq suspended because of air strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ A weekly ferry service from
Dubai to the southern Iraqi port of Umm al-Qasr was suspended
Saturday because of the U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   Mohammed Hamdan al-Shamsi, manager of Naif Marine Services, said
the ferry _ the first direct link between the Gulf and its
sanctions-hit neighbor since the 1990 Gulf crisis _ was ``stopped
due to the conditions.''
	   He said the decision was taken Saturday morning despite bookings
by about 60 passengers.
	   ``We didn't launch ... because we were unable to contact our
agent in Umm al-Qasr by phone or telex,'' he said. ``Apparently
their lines are down.''
	   There have been reports from southern Iraq of difficult
communications problems, suggesting that the U.S. and British
attacks may have damaged telephone facilities.
	   The ferry service will restart as soon as it gets a go-ahead
from the Umm al-Qasr agent, al-Shamsi said.
	   The service, which started Nov. 7, caters mainly to businessmen
and Shiite Muslim pilgrims headed to shrines in southern Iraq.
	   It leaves Dubai on Saturday and makes the return trip on Monday.
	   The only other option for traveling to Iraq is a 10-hour road
trip from the Jordanian capital Amman.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Ashok Shandilya, an Indian railroad
officer from Bombay, beat world No. 2 and countryman Geet Sethi to
claim gold in English billiards at the Asian Games Saturday.
	   ``He is a gutsy chap, real champion stuff,'' said Sethi after he
lost 5-4 to Shandilya. ``Indeed, I am disappointed, but I admit I
played badly and the better player won.''
	   Shandilya, 30, who works as a sports officer for the Bombay
railroad, attributed his victory to conviction.
	   ``I thought I have to get going to win. I told myself I must
win,'' Shandilya said.
	   In the best of 9-frame final, Sethi took the first frame 150-62,
but Shandilya fought back and took two frames 152-22 and 150-9.
	   Down 1-3, Sethi, 37 who runs a travel agency in the west Indian
city of Ahmedabad, gained his composure and took the next frame
150-83.
	   After the neck-and-neck battle reached 4-4, Sethi committed a
foul in the decisive frame, leading to his downfall.
	   Shandilya took the final frame 151-23.
	   ``He is the best player India has,'' Shandilya said of Sethi.
``But today for some reason he played badly.''
	   ``When we were tied 4-4, I knew that if I commit one mistake
that will be my end. But fortunately I did not commit any
mistake,'' Shandilya said.
	   The bronze was claimed by host Thailand's Praprut
Chaithanasakul, who beat the Philippines' Reynaldo Grandea 4-1 in
the seven-frame match for third place.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's main downtown streets to denounce the
American and British air strikes on Iraq.
	   Witnesses said the U.S. Embassy's Marine guards fired tear gas
to disperse the crowd, but three protesters managed to enter the
grounds and climb the walls of the building to haul down and burn
the American flag.
	   Chanting ``Down with America!'' a crowd estimated at a thousand
surrounded the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. Many
pelted the building with stones, shattering windows.
	   ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a
switchboard operator at the embassy who would not give his name.
	   The mobs later attacked two other American installations and two
British government buildings, but there were no reports of injuries
to any Westerners. Witnesses said about a dozen protesters were
taken away to a hospital after being overcome by tear gas outside
the U.S. Embassy.
	   The attacks came as tens of thousands of demonstrators marched
peacefully, chanting anti-American slogans and demanding an end to
attacks on Iraq, which have gone on for three nights.
	   Large demonstrations are rare in the Syrian capital, which is
under tight security control, and Saturday's marches throughout the
downtown could not have occurred without government approval
	   A crowd also marched on the nearby residence of U.S. Ambassador
Ryan Crocker, throwing stones and breaking windows. The
ambassador's wife, Christine, was in the building but was not hurt,
said a Syrian guard outside who would not give his name.
	   Witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
protesters later broke into a nearby American school and the U.S.
Cultural Center around a corner about a block away, despite efforts
by Syrian police to block their path.
	   The crowd broke up furniture in the two buildings, both closed
for the day.
	   Other demonstrators surrounded and threw stones at the nearby
British Embassy and the British Council, a government institution
that sponsors English language classes and cultural programs.
	   The protesters also overturned a British diplomatic vehicle,
witnesses said.
	   After initially trying to manage the crowds outside the U.S. and
British institutions, Syrian police later tried to break up the
protests but were still having trouble controlling the situation
after about an hour.
	   ``The Americans are trying to make us kneel down and surrender.
... I will not leave before I burn the flag and make my voice
heard,'' said Hafizah Abu Tarbous, a protester outside the U.S.
Embassy.
	   The embassy building was believed to be largely empty and closed
for the day. Embassy officials could not immediately be reached;
someone answering the phone there said no one was available for
comment. Sirens could be heard wailing in the background as the
person spoke.
	   Most of the protesters outside the building apparently were
university students or members of the youth organization of the
ruling Baath Party.
	   During the protest marches in downtown Damascas, patriotic
Syrian songs blared from loudspeakers on some government buildings
as marchers chanted slogans.
	   ``No to killing and destruction,'' went one chant. ``The Iraqi
people will never kneel down,'' was another.
	   ``The Syrian people are with you, our Iraqi brothers,'' read one
banner carried by protesters.
	   The protests in Damascus were part of a massive show of support
for the Iraqis across the Arab world. Demonstrations also erupted
Saturday in the West Bank and Egypt, and protests against the U.S.
and British attacks were staged Friday in Jordan, Lebanon and
Yemen.

Congolese rebel leader throws wrench into anticipated peace
</HEADLINE>
agreement &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ A Congolese rebel leader on
Saturday cast new doubts on the chances for a cease-fire in the
Congo, saying peace is impossible unless President Laurent Kabila
is removed from power.
	   Bizima Karaha, the declared Foreign Minister in the rebel
hierarchy, said that Kabila's removal from power was just a matter
of time.
	   ``Today the question is not to know if Kabila will go or not. It
is a matter of knowing how and when he will go,'' Karaha said.
``And after Kabila, then what?''
	   Karaha said the rebels believed a cease-fire was ``easy'' to
achieve, but that Kabila was holding up the process by refusing to
meet with the renegades, who launched an uprising to topple Kabila
in August.
	   Since then at least five other countries have been drawn in,
including Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia in support of Kabila and
Rwanda and Uganda on the rebel side.
	   ``We are demanding direct talks before a cease-fire can be
signed,'' Karaha said.
	   He was speaking with journalists shortly before departing
Burkina Faso's capital following an Organization of African Unity
that sought to negotiate an end Congo's war, which has drawn in at
least five other African countries.
	   On Friday, Burkina Faso's president Blaise Compaore said the
warring parties in the Congo agreed to meet Dec. 27 and 28 in the
Zambian capital, Lusaka to sign a cease-fire treaty.
	   Representatives of the five countries embroiled in the war
worked on a ``pre-agreement'' during a summit meeting of the
Organization of African Unity, Compaore said.
	   Karaha claimed that Kabila's troops were no longer willing to
fight for him and the government's main allies Zimbabwe and Angola
were also losing commitment to the war because of domestic
problems.
	   ``Kabila is losing the war because Angola is in trouble with a
civil war in their own country and Zimbabwe has lost a lot of
people and planes so far. It has become very unpopular in
Zimbabwe,'' he said.
	   The rebels have captured the eastern half of Congo, an area with
upwards of 20 million people, Karaha said. Those claims are
difficult to independently verify because the territory is vast and
remote. Congo's government has made equally bold claims of
battlefield successes, saying it has dislodged the rebels from some
of its strongholds with air attacks.
	   Although repeated peace initiatives for Congo have failed,
Compaore expressed confidence that the latest efforts would
succeed. ``The representatives who were here agreed unanimously to
work on the cease-fire agreement,'' he said.
	   Along with Kabila and the rebels, delegates from Angola,
Zimbabwe, Uganda, Rwanda were in Burkina Faso.
	   OAU member heads of state endorsed a recommendation that foreign
observers be prepared to monitor the anticipated treaty.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Iran agreed to boost economic
and trade relations during a visit to Amman this week by Iranian
Industry Minister Gholamreza Shafei, Jordanian officials said.
	   The Iranian side expressed interest in joint ventures in energy
and water projects and launching joint phosphate and potash
ventures, the officials said, speaking on usual condition of
anonymity.
	   Other agreements were reached on Jordan and Iran encouraging
tourism to Muslim holy places in both countries and the start of
Iranian flights to Amman early next year. Jordan's airline has been
flying two weekly Amman-Tehran flights since June.
	   According to the officials, both sides voiced an intention to
cooperate in building infrastructure, developing agriculture and
industry, enlarging sea ports and promoting vocational and
agricultural training.

Palestinian journalists call strike to protest crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian journalists called a strike
Saturday to protest curbs on coverage of pro-Iraq rallies.
	   A day earlier, Palestinian police detained nine journalists who
had covered pro-Iraq demonstrations in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip and sealed the offices of eight news organizations.
	   Those offices shut by police included the Gaza City bureau of
The Associated Press, which remained sealed on Saturday.
	   Also closed down were five local Palestinian TV stations and one
radio station in the West Bank, and the Gaza City branch of Orbit
Satellite Service, an Israeli-based agency that transmits TV
footage.
	   The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said in a statement that
the closing of the offices and the detention of the journalists was
a ``serious violation'' of their basic rights. The syndicate said
it would stage a strike as well as a sit-in at the Palestinian
legislature on Monday.
	   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists also
protested the curbs on coverage. In a letter to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, it urged Arafat to allow the offices to re-open and
denounced ``attempts to silence independent journalism in flagrant
violation of the right to free expression.''
	   The Foreign Press Association in Israel also said it was sending
a letter of protest to Arafat's Palestinian Authority.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with extent of injury, coach saying it's a
season-ending accident &QL; 
 &UR; With Val Gardena-Men-Downhill &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP)_ Jean-Luc Cretier, the Olympic downhill
champion, tore knee ligaments following a season-ending spill
during Saturday's World Cup downhill race in Val Gardena.
	   Mauro Cornaz, coach of the French downhill team, said Cretier
torn the cruciate ligament of his left knee and bruised his face
and hands following the high-speed fall on an icy course.
	   Cornzas said it was a season-ending injury, also putting at risk
the ski career of the 33-year-old ace from Bourg St. Maurice.
	   Cretier, who had won the Olympic title at Nagano this year, fell
shortly after the start, at a steep, icy section.
	   Cretier, coming down the No. 6 bib, skidded through an unfenced
area and fell over a ridge of grass and snow.
	   He was quickly treated by race stewards and doctors at the scene
of the accident and was later taken by helicopter to the nearby
hospital of Bressanone (Brixen).
	   Saturday's downhill was the second of consecutive World Cup
speed races in this north Italian valley.
	   Cretier had placed 25th on Friday.
	   The icy, Saslong course proved extremely dangerous this weekend,
with bad spills marring both days of competition.
	   American Ehlias Louis and Frenchman David Pretot tore knee
ligaments in spills during Friday's downhill.
	   Canadian Ed Podivinsky also suffered a season-ending knee injury
during Weddnesday's practice here.

British attack Republican Guard installations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Blair interview &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British jets attacked a regional headquarters of
the Republican Guard in overnight raids which also targeted air
defense and a battle tank storage area, a senior military officer
said Saturday.
	   Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defense staff, estimated
that the attacks achieved 75 percent of their objectives, without
losing any of Britain's 12 Kuwait-based Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair said in a broadcast interview that
that the United States and Britain had struck against President
Saddam Hussein ``because we genuinely believe the stability of the
world is at risk if this man's allowed to get back out of his
cage.''
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson, who joined Guthrie at a news
briefing, said the Republican Guard was targeted because of its
role in protecting Saddam as well as guarding the chemical and
biological weapons programs which are the prime targets of the
U.S-British operation.
	   ``We want the Republican Guard to know that the cozy life they
have led under Saddam is under attack,'' Robertson said.
	   Britain released video images of laser-guided bombs hitting
Republican Guard facilities at Al Kut, 100 miles (160 kms)
southeast of Baghdad, and the nearby Muhammad Al Amin garrison.
	   Robertson said U.S. and British analysts were continuing to
assess damage and he would not say whether the attacks would
continue.
	   ``We are absolutely determined to reduce the threat that Saddam
poses to the countries of the Middle East, the Gulf states,''
Robert said, adding: ``When we believe that threat has been lifted,
we will stop the operation.''
	   Guthrie said the U.S. and British operations were more intense
than on the previous night, but that British jets encountered less
antiaircraft fire.
	   Guthrie said leaflets dropped by U.S. and British planes in Iraq
had warned the regular army to stay out of the conflict. He said
the message was ``Keep out of this, you are not our targets, remain
in your barracks.''
	   ``And I think it is a message which has got across,'' Guthrie
said. He added that there had been no reports of Iraqi aircraft
challenging the attacking forces.
	   Blair, in an interview with the BBC World Service, said he
regretted civilian casualties but said the military operation was
necessary.
	   ``If we hadn't taken action now then he knows we lack the will
to prevent him developing these weapons,'' Blair said.
	   ``I think the Iraqi people know who's responsible for keeping
them in a state of poverty ... he's turned virtually the entirety
of his country into a semi-military complex for his own purposes.''

After three years of trial in Sicily, date set for final arguments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ After more than three years of trial for
former Premier Giulio Andreotti on Mafia charges, a date has been
set for final arguments, although a verdict is likely months away.
	   The trial in the Sicilian capital of Andreotti, who is accused
of using his political influence to aid Cosa Nostra, began in
September 1995. After calling hundreds of witnesses, including many
mobsters who are now collaborating with the state, the court on
Saturday announced that final arguments will begin on Jan. 19,
after recess for Christmas and New Year's holidays.
	   The arguments by both prosecution and defense are expected to
take months, and no verdict is expected before sometime in the
spring, according to court sources.
	   Andreotti, once one of Italy's most powerful politicians for
decades after World War II while his Christian Democrat party was
predominant, has denied any ties with mobsters.
	   One ex-mobster told the court that Andreotti once received a
kiss of respect from Salvatore Riina, the reputed top boss of Cosa
Nostra who was arrested in 1993.
	   His defense has raised the possibility that turncoats might be
getting back at him for anti-Mafia laws passed by his coalitions.

India beats South Korea in penalty shootout for gold

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ India beat defending champion South
Korea 4-2 in a penalty shootout for the Asian Games field hockey
gold medal Saturday, after the two drew 1-1 in regulation time and
14 minutes' extra time.
	   Earlier, Pakistan defeated Japan 3-0 for the bronze medal.
	   ``Our strong point tonight was teamwork,'' said Indian head
coach M. Kaushik. ``The Koreans are very strong and quick and I
wasn't sure if we would come out on top.''
	   But Korean captain Park Shin-heum wept as he walked off the
field after coming so close to bringing his nation its third men's
hockey gold in four games.
	   ``We played a very good game today,'' said Kim Sang-ryul,
Korea's head coach. ``A high number of penalty corners made
problems for us. They are the fastest players in the world.''
	   At the start, Korea came on strong with short, quick passes that
put the solid Indian team to the test.
	   Five minutes into the game, Korea scored first when Yeo Woon-gon
slammed the ball in on the team's second penalty corner attempt.
	   Korea came close in the 9th minute when Song Seung-tae made it
past the Indian defenders but goalkeeper Ashish Ballal managed to
block the shot with his foot.
	   In the 21st minute, captain Dhannaraj Pillay slammed in an
equalizer for India on a field goal, causing the large and raucous
crowd of Indian fans to shout in delight.
	   India opened the second half with a series of back-to-back
drives and fast breaks that brought the crowd to its feet.
	   Neither team could score in the second half or during the 14
minutes of extra time, forcing the penalty shootout.
	   ``We have one of the best goalkeepers,'' said Indian captain
Pillay. ``The team is great and it should be kept until 2000,'' the
Olympic year.
	   In the battle for the bronze, Pakistan shut out Japan with
superior ball-handling and short, quick passes.
	   Japan put up strong resistance to Pakistan's fast breaks in the
first half, allowing it only a handful of attempts.
	   Japan failed to score from four penalty corners, while Pakistan
was able to score two goals from its seven penalty corner tries.
	   Pakistan's Sohail Abbas scored first in the 34th minute,
slamming the ball in from a penalty corner pass.
	   Abbas, the team's striker, also scored Pakistan's second goal
with another penalty corner in the 8th minute of the second half.
	   A goal in the 21st minute of the second half by Muhammud Nadeem
gave Pakistan insurance.
	   ``The overall performance of the team was very good,'' said
Abbas. ``We wanted to play well and we wanted to win. The players
played as a team and covered up each others' weaknesses.''

Tudjman says Croatia won't be treated as a colony
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said
Saturday that while Croatia is eager to join the West, it would not
accept to be treated as a ``colony.''
	   Tudjman, who spoke to reporters upon his return from his first
official visit to Russia, said Croatia still wanted to be admitted
to Western institutions, but would not accept ``imposed
solutions,'' which are against the national interests.
	   ``We are under the surveillance as rarely any other country,''
Tudjman said, listing international diplomats and humanitarian
agencies based in Croatia that he said ``monitor and report'' the
situation in the country.
	   Earlier this week, he charged that the work of U.S. and European
officials based in Croatia, as well as humanitarian agencies and
media has been aimed at destabilizing the country.
	   His remarks indicated an increased dislike towards the Western
governments, whose support and alliance he desired for long.
	   Nevertheless, Tudjman's government has often complained that
constant criticism from the United States and its allies, who
insist Croatia improve its treatment of Serbs, fully respect
neighboring Bosnia's borders and improve its democracy record
before it will be considered for admission to the European Union or
NATO's Partnership for Peace program, are the equivalent to
interfering with the country's internal affairs.
	   Calling Russia a world superpower despite its current crisis,
Tudjman showed fresh praise for the Christian Orthodox country that
sided with rebel Serbs during the 1991 war of independence from the
former Yugoslavia. The move was seen by some here as a search for
the new allies.
	   Still, the Croatian president argued that his visit to Russia,
which coincided with a serious rift between Washington and Moscow
over the air strikes on Iraq, did not mean Croatia had ``turned its
back'' on the United States.
	   He said it is in Croatia's ``strategic interest'' to have
``partnership and friendly relations'' with Washington. Croatia is
also seeking good relations with Europe.
	   On Friday, Tudjman and Yeltsin signed a declaration on
friendship and cooperation, while their associates signed several
other agreements, including the one on arms trade and defense
cooperation.

Russian foreign minister calls for bombing halt in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Ivanov meeting Iraqi ambassador, phone
call with Egyptian foreign minister. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov insisted
Saturday that airstrikes against Iraq be stopped immediately, and
said that Russia backed Iraq in its commitment to settling the
crisis through political means.
	   In a meeting with Iraq's ambassador to Moscow, Hassan Fahmi
Jumah, Ivanov ``positively assessed the fact that notwithstanding
the use of force, the Iraqi leadership remains ready to cooperate
with the United Nations, in particular with the Special
Commission,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a press statement.
	   The commission is responsible for dismantling Iraq's chemical
and biological weapons and long-range missiles. U.S. President Bill
Clinton ordered the airstrikes, which began Wednesday, to punish
Iraq for its alleged obstruction of the commission.
	   Ivanov warned U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in a
phone call Friday that if the airstrikes are not stopped,
``Russian-American relations could seriously suffer,'' the Foreign
Ministry said.
	   Ivanov said that joint, U.S.-Russian efforts in recent years had
advanced their partnership in key areas of bilateral relations and
international affairs, the ministry said.
	   ``This is important both for the two peoples and for stability
and security in the whole world,'' Ivanov was quoted as saying.
``It is necessary to do everything to prevent backsliding in our
relations.''
	   The Foreign Ministry said Albright will travel to Moscow in
January, apparently in an attempt to isolate the dispute over Iraq
from the rest of the U.S.-Russian relationship.
	   ``We do want to keep our channels of communication open despite
the unfortunate decision of Russia to recall its ambassador,''
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington,
referring to Russia's decision to recall Ambassador Yuli M.
Vorontsov to protest the attack on Iraq.
	   Clinton sent a letter to President Boris Yeltsin on Friday
defending the decision to attack. Yeltsin responded with a message
to Clinton through Ivanov, but the contents of Yeltsin's message
were not disclosed.
	   The Foreign Ministry continued its attempts Saturday to build
consensus against the U.S.-British attacks against Iraq. Ivanov
spoke over the phone with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who
expressed his nation's support for Russia's stance on ending the
military action and defusing the crisis, the Foreign Ministry said.

More than 100 as pro-Iraq protests flare in West Bank despite ban

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Shouts of ``Death to America!'' rang
out at angry pro-Iraq marches staged by Palestinians on Saturday in
the West Bank. Violent clashes in their aftermath left more than
100 Palestinians hurt.
	   Yasser Arafat's government, meanwhile, said it would send a
special envoy to Baghdad to try to help end the crisis in Iraq,
which has been pounded by U.S. and British air strikes to punish
Saddam Hussein for obstructing U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The display of Palestinian frustration and fury _ exacerbated by
Israel's refusal to carry out a troop withdrawal promised under the
Wye River peace accords _ stood in stark contrast to the warm
welcome U.S. President Bill Clinton had received earlier in the
week in the West Bank and Gaza strip.
	   The main fighting came in the West Bank town of Hebron, where
more than 3,000 Palestinians, some masked, marched waving Iraqi
flags and portraits of Saddam. Afterward, hundreds of Palestinians
broke away from the main march and hurled stones and firebombs at
Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish settlements in the center of
Hebron.
	   The soldiers fired rubber bullets at the marchers, injuring 104
of them, hospital officials said. Four were seriously hurt,
according to doctors at Hebron's Aliya Hospital.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months in the
Palestinian lands, even including demonstrations that rocked the
West Bank last week over Palestinian demands for release of
prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   The rally in Hebron and smaller ones in the West Bank town of
Jenin and the Gaza Strip town of Rafah came in defiance of a
Palestinian police ban on pro-Iraq demonstrations.
	   In Rafah, about 400 Palestinian protesters burned U.S. and
British flags. Police dispersed them, but without using force.
	   In Jenin, about 2,500 Palestinians chanted ``Death to America''
but refrained from burning any U.S. flags. Afterward, the marchers
approached the Jewish settlement of Ginat and threw stones at
Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Seven Palestinians were injured.
	   The fighting in Hebron took place amid winding, cramped downtown
streets, where soldiers and protesters ducked into shops and
doorways for cover. At one point, with stones raining down on them,
about 20 Israeli soldiers grouped and charged stone-throwers,
firing rubber bullets as they ran forward.
	   After two hours of intense fighting, Palestinian police moved in
and kept the demonstrators away from Israeli positions, and the
stone-throwers eventually dispersed. Thirty of those hurt were
hospitalized and the rest treated at the scene.
	   The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership.
On the one hand, it is anxious to rein in the unmitigated backing
Palestinians gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that
set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   At the same time, however, Arafat's government apparently wants
to allow some outlet for Palestinian street sentiment in favor of
Iraq.
	   At its meeting Friday night, the Palestinian Cabinet called on
the international community to use diplomatic means to address the
Iraq dispute. It said the Palestinian Authority would send an envoy
to aid in efforts to ``stop the destruction in which the Iraqi
people are paying the price.''
	   The Cabinet also condemned Israel's demand that the Palestinians
take more steps before the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would keep its part of the Wye River pact.
	   ``The Palestinian leadership...has implemented all of its
obligations,'' it said in a statement, calling the Israeli stance a
``dangerous setback.''
	   On Friday, after a series of pro-Iraq rallies at which U.S.
flags were burned, Palestinian authorities declared such
demonstrations banned and briefly detained some journalists _
including some working for foreign media outlets _ who had covered
the pro-Iraq unrest.
	   The Gaza City bureau of The Associated Press was closed down by
the authorities, and remained shut on Saturday, but the Palestinian
outlets were allowed to reopen.
	   The Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a strike starting
Saturday to protest the curbs on their coverage, and said they
would stage a sit-in at the Palestinian legislative council on
Monday.

Germans have big day at biathlon World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSRBLIE, Slovakia (AP) _ The German biathlon team had a
spectacular day Saturday at a World Cup as Sven Fischer swept a
men's sprint and Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm skied away from the
pack in a women's sprint.
	   Greiner-Petter-Memm was perfect in shooting, taking a 7.5
kilometer sprint in twenty minutes, 33.2 seconds. Another German,
Uschi Disl, was second in 20:37.8 and Norways Liv Gret Skjelbreid
third in 21:00.2.
	   ``The success lately is almost eerie. I felt so alone on the
last kilometer,'' said Greiner-Petter-Men.
	   Sweden's Magdalena Forsberg finished fourth and held on to first
in the overall standings against the charging Germans. She has 132
points in five events, Disl 124 and Greiner-Petter-Memm 116.
	   Fischer picked up the first post-Olympics triumph for the German
men's team in a 10-kilometer sprint and also seized the lead in the
overall standings.
	   Fischer won in 24:36.1 after one penalty round for shooting
followed by Latvia's Olegs Maluhin at 24:54.6 and France's Raphael
Poiree at 24:55.3.
	   The German was at 104 points in the overall standings and Poiree
at 99.

More than 100 injured as pro-Iraq protests flare in West Bank

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Shouts of ``Death to America!'' rang
out at angry pro-Iraq marches staged by Palestinians on Saturday in
the West Bank. Violent clashes in their aftermath left more than
100 Palestinians hurt.
	   Yasser Arafat's government, meanwhile, said it would send a
special envoy to Baghdad to try to help end the crisis in Iraq,
which has been pounded by U.S. and British air strikes to punish
Saddam Hussein for obstructing U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The display of Palestinian frustration and fury _ exacerbated by
Israel's refusal to carry out a troop withdrawal promised under the
Wye River peace accords _ stood in stark contrast to the warm
welcome U.S. President Bill Clinton had received earlier in the
week in the West Bank and Gaza strip.
	   The main fighting came in the West Bank town of Hebron, where
more than 3,000 Palestinians, some masked, marched waving Iraqi
flags and portraits of Saddam. Afterward, hundreds of Palestinians
broke away from the main march and hurled stones and firebombs at
Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish settlements in the center of
Hebron.
	   The soldiers fired rubber bullets at the marchers, injuring 104
of them, hospital officials said. Four were seriously hurt,
according to doctors at Hebron's Aliya Hospital.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months in the
Palestinian lands, even including demonstrations that rocked the
West Bank last week over Palestinian demands for release of
prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   The rally in Hebron and smaller ones in the West Bank town of
Jenin and the Gaza Strip town of Rafah came in defiance of a
Palestinian police ban on pro-Iraq demonstrations.
	   In Rafah, about 400 Palestinian protesters burned U.S. and

India, Pakistan expel embassy officials

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan have expelled
non-diplomatic officials from embassies in each other's capital on
charges of spying, Press Trust of India news agency said Saturday.
	   On Friday, India asked a Pakistani embassy official to leave the
country within a week. Pakistan retaliated by expelling an Indian
visa official in Islamabad on Saturday, PTI quoted Indian Foreign
Ministry officials as saying.
	   The names of the expelled officials were not available. This was
the third expulsion this year of embassy officials by the two
countries.
	   In the past two months, senior officials of the two countries
have held a series of meetings to find a solution to the Kashmir
dispute and improve trade and economic ties India and Pakistan have
fought two wars over Kashmir since independence in 1947. India
control two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest.
	   Tension between India and Pakistan mounted after they conducted
nuclear tests in May.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Finland played energetically but
inconclusively Saturday to a 2-2 tie in the Baltika Cup ice-hockey
tournament in Moscow.
	   Russia's Alexei Chupin scored the first goal 22 minutes into the
game, overcoming Meeka Kiprusoff's attempts to block the puck from
flying into the box. Finland's first goal came in the third period,
when Lasse Pirjeta picked up a rebound and put the puck into the
net in the 50th minute.
	   Then Russia was on the offensive again, and the game picked up
speed. Sergei Petrenko put the Russians ahead in the 53rd minute,
but Eric Kakko equalized two minutes later. After the match,
Kiprusoff was judged the best player on the Finnish squad.
	   ``We are happy with this result,'' said Finnish coach Hanno
Aravirta. ``The most important result of this tournament is that we
now have information about the candidates for the World
Championship, and now we are sure that we have two good, young
goalies.''
	   The tournament, which also includes Sweden and Canada, is the
third of four legs of the Euro Hockey Tour and features each
country's best players outside the North American National Hockey
League.
	   The final is Sunday.

	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa urged the United Nations to
fire chief weapons inspector Richard Butler, accusing him of
escalating the tension between Iraq and the United States.
	   The statements represented a hardening of Egypt's position
against the air strikes on Iraq, which have occurred for the past
three nights. After the first wave of attacks in the early hours of
Thursday, Egypt issued a reserved statement urging restraint.
	   The attacks have drawn strong criticism from the Arab world, and
provoked protests in several Arab states such as Syria and Egypt.
	   ``President Mubarak is calling for the immediate halt to the
military operations and the direction of any more strikes against
Iraq,'' Moussa told reporters Saturday.
	   Moussa said he had spoken to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook about the
attacks.
	   Moussa accused Washington of ``ignoring'' the U.N. Security
Council by attacking without seeking the body's specific
authorization. He urged the United States to ``understand that (the
strikes) threaten the interests of every one ... and that
differences can be solved by diplomatic means.''
	   Turning to Butler, who reported early last week that Iraq had
failed to honor its pledge of full cooperation with the U.N.
inspectors, Moussa cast doubt on the fairness of his assessment.
	   ``It is impossible to imagine that no progress was made after
seven years of inspections,'' Moussa said. The inspectors were
mandated after the 1991 Gulf War with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's mass-destruction weapons and long-range missiles.
	   ``There is no mistake that Butler made a mistake in the way that
he acted and escalated the situation by exaggeration,'' Moussa
said.
	   Butler's role ``must end,'' Moussa said.
	   The United States and Britain say they launched the strikes to
degrade Iraq's capacity to manufacture weapons of mass destruction
and to diminish its ability to threaten its neighbors.

Baghdad comes under worst attack in three-day offensive

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Thunderous blasts rocked Baghdad before
dawn on Saturday, with U.S. and British forces pressing a punishing
air offensive on Iraq for a third night.
	   Reporters saw fiery streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk
cruise missiles arcing across the sky. Warheads exploded a few
seconds later, lighting the pre-dawn horizon in a red glow that
silhouetted palm trees against the dark sky.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling the
sky with booms and bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets
streaked above.
	   When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens
blaring were heard speeding away. Officials, who must escort
journalists wishing to tour the city, refused to take them to the
targeted areas.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the Friday and Saturday
attacks was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center of
the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Western reporters staying at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad
saw explosions in nearby areas known to have palaces, a
headquarters of the Special Security service and the command center
for the Popular Army _ a paramilitary force.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Saturday's attack appeared to be the toughest yet against
Baghdad since the U.S. and British militaries began air strikes
early Thursday to punish Iraq for its alleged obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks, but it did not issue further official casualty
figures for the third round in the assault.
	   On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more
people were killed and 21 wounded in a missile attack on the
Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The report said an agricultural training center and a number of
houses were damaged.
	   INA also referred later to a march held Saturday for 68 people
killed in the U.S. and British attacks, but Mohsen al-Tarfa, deputy
director of the government press center, said that was wrong and
the 68 dead were victims of U.N. sanctions.
	   Iraq has complained that thousands have died because limited
medicines have entered the country under the sanctions.

Egypt's Mubarak says strikes on Iraq must stop

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called for
an ``immediate halt'' Saturday to the U.S. and British attacks on
Iraq.

Jailed secessionists in Cameroon ask Western states for help
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EMMANUEL TUMANJONG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ In a scribbled letter smuggled out of
jail, 56 English-speaking separatists imprisoned without trial
appealed to Western countries to pressure Cameroon's
Francophone-led government for their release.
	   The two-page letter, received by journalists on Saturday,
accused Cameroonian authorities of cruel ``inhumane'' treatment,
including withholding medical care to the prisoners.
	   The detainees have been behind bars in two prisons in the
capital for the past 18 months in connection with an uprising by
English-speaking secessionists in this primarily French-speaking
West African country in March 1997 that resulted in about 12 people
killed and several government facilities destroyed.
	   Although no trial date has been announced, only 16 of the
original 79 arrested have been released. Seven of the prisoners
have died behind bars over the past year. Justice Minister Laurent
Esso said last week the case was ``complicated and needs further
careful examination.''
	   The prisoners' letter, signed by the detainees' appointed leader
Philip Tete, was addressed to the embassies of U.S., Canada,
Britain and France among other Western countries.
	   The letter alleged that some of the inmates had been tortured
and deprived of medical care, while others were required to pay for
their own medical treatment and transportation to hospital.
	   ``We want to keep your embassies properly informed that the
regime in place might as usual have fooled the world that we have
been released. That is not true,'' the letter said.
	   Anglophones, who make up 20 percent of Cameroon's 13 million
people, say they are treated as second-class citizens by
Francophone rulers. Militants are threatening a secessionist
battle.
	   Some human rights activists have accused Cameroon's government
of preventing them from leaving the country to try to rally
international support for their cause.
	   Cameroon, a former German colony, was taken over by Britain and
France after World War I. Eight French provinces became independent
in 1960 and a year later the two Anglophone provinces joined in a
federation, which was switched to a unitary state in 1972.
	   President Paul Biya has refused Anglophone demands for a
separatist referendum, or to negotiate changes to the country's
constitution and return to a federal system.
	   Biya was declared the winner in a 1992 election that was widely
denounced as rigged. He won again in 1996 in elections boycotted by
opposition groups.
	   Following the March 1997 uprising, government patrols and
roadblocks have been intensified in English-speaking areas of the
country.

Some media outlets reopen after being closed over Iraq material

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Palestinian authorities allowing some
media outlets to reopen. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian authorities on Saturday allowed
half a dozen Palestinian media outlets to reopen after closing them
a day earlier over coverage of pro-Iraq rallies or for broadcasting
what was deemed to be pro-Iraqi material.
	   However, two other news offices, including the Gaza City bureau
of The Associated Press, remained closed Saturday.
	   On Friday, Palestinian police detained nine journalists,
including some working for foreign news organizations, who had
covered pro-Iraq demonstrations in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip. An AP photographer had covered a rally on Friday in the Gaza
Strip at which a U.S. flag was burned.
	   Five local Palestinian TV stations and one radio station in the
West Bank were closed down, but all were given permission to reopen
Saturday. One, however, refused to do so until given an explanation
for being closed down in the first place.
	   Samir Kumsia, the owner of Mahed TV in Bethlehem, said: ``They
have to give me a logical explanation _ until then I will stay
closed. This is not a civilized manner in which to deal with us.''
	   Also remaining closed Saturday was the Gaza City branch of Orbit
Satellite Service, an Israeli-based agency that transmits TV
footage.
	   Earlier Saturday, the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said in
a statement that the closing of the offices and the detention of
the journalists was a ``serious violation'' of their basic rights.
The syndicate said it would stage a strike as well as a sit-in at
the Palestinian legislature on Monday.
	   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists also
protested the curbs on coverage. In a letter to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, it urged Arafat to allow the offices to re-open and
denounced ``attempts to silence independent journalism in flagrant
violation of the right to free expression.''
	   The Foreign Press Association in Israel also said it was sending
a letter of protest to Arafat's Palestinian Authority.

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's main downtown streets to denounce the
American and British air strikes on Iraq.
	   Before small, violent groups were brought under control, they
had trashed the American ambassador's residence and gotten into
American and British cultural centers, where they scattered library
books and damaged furniture.
	   The rioting persisted on and off for more than six hours around
the buildings, which were largely unmanned because they do not open
for business on Saturday.
	   Syrian security forces struggled to stop the rioting, which
appeared to involve mainly university students and youth groups.
	   At one point, Syrian forces tried to bring in a water truck to
break up the crowd outside the ambassador's house with hoses. But
the truck's way was blocked by protesters who laid down in the
street in its path.
	   The attack on the embassy buildings came amid a massive protest
against the continued bombardment of neighboring Iraq by American
and British missiles.
	   Tens of thousands of marchers carried banners with anti-American
slogans and chanted demands for an end to the attacks on Iraq,
which have gone on for three nights.
	   ``The Syrian people are with you, our Iraqi brothers,'' read one
banner carried by protesters.
	   Large demonstrations are rare in the Syrian capital, which is
under tight security control, and Saturday's marches throughout the
downtown could not have occurred without government approval.
	   The U.S. Embassy was the first site to come under attack.
	   Witnesses said the embassy's Marine guards fired tear gas to
disperse the crowd, but three protesters managed to enter the
grounds and climb the walls of the building to haul down and burn
the American flag.
	   Chanting ``Down with America,'' a crowd estimated at a thousand
surrounded the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. Many
pelted the building with stones, shattering windows.
	   ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a
switchboard operator at the embassy who would not give his name.
	   The mobs later attacked two other American installations and two
British government buildings, but there were no reports of injuries
to any Westerners.
	   Witnesses said about a dozen protesters were taken away to a
hospital after being overcome by tear gas.
	   The crowd also marched on the nearby residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ryan Crocker, throwing stones and breaking windows. The
ambassador's wife, Christine, was in the building but was not hurt,
said a Syrian guard outside who would not give his name.
	   About 100 protesters climbed the wall surrounding the house,
broke down the front door and stormed inside. Before they left they
destroyed everything in their path _ the ambassador's office,
kitchen cabinets, tables and bookcases.
	   They also shattered the windows and lights of Crocker's car,
which was parked in the compound.
	   Some grabbed a bra from the house and wrote the name ``Monica''
on it Arabic. They waved it outside, shouting: ``This is Monica's
bra.''
	   A mob also broke into a nearby American school and the U.S.
Cultural Center, despite efforts by Syrian police to block their
path. Library books later could be seen scattered on the street
outside both facilities.
	   Other demonstrators surrounded and threw stones at the British
Embassy and the British Council, a government institution that
sponsors English language classes and cultural programs.
	   Windows and some furniture were damaged at the British Council,
witnesses said.
	   The protesters also overturned a British diplomatic vehicle,
they said.
	   The protests in Damascus were part of a massive show of support
for the Iraqis across the Arab world. Demonstrations also erupted
Saturday in the West Bank, Egypt, Jordan and Sudan.
	   The Syrian protesters expressed deep anger over the American and
British campaign in Iraq.
	   ``The Americans are trying to make us kneel down and surrender.
... I will not leave before I burn the flag and make my voice
heard,'' said Hafizah Abu Tarbous, a protester outside the U.S.
Embassy.
	   Many in the crowds in Damascus expressed sympathy for the Iraqi
people, and some of the chants and banners pictured the air strikes
on Iraq as part of an assault on all the Arabs.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a student demonstrator.
	   Among the chants shouted by the crowd was: ``You aggressors,
leave our children in Iraq, Libya and Sudan to live in peace.''

Organizers of Chinese opposition movement face prison, labor camps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with detention of activist and his
wife in Sichuan and forced closure of democracy discussion group in
Beijing.
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An organizer of a would-be opposition party in
China has been sent to a labor camp without trial and another
Chinese democracy campaigner has been detained by authorities, a
rights group said Saturday.
	   The move came as the latest development in a crackdown on the
China Democracy Party that intensified over the past week with the
trials of two leading organizers on subversion charges. A third,
veteran activist Xu Wenli, faces a hastily scheduled trial on
Monday.
	   An associate of the three men, Xu Wangping, 36, was detained
Oct. 14 and sent earlier this month to the Xishanping labor camp
outside Chongqing, in southwestern China's Sichuan province, the
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China reported.
	   He is a former factory worker who served an eight-year prison
sentence for trying to organize an independent labor union during
the 1989 democracy protests. Since his release in 1997, he had been
organizing a branch of the China Democracy Party in Sichuan.
	   In addition, Liu Xianbing, another democracy campaigner in
Sichuan province in southwestern China, was detained on Saturday,
the Information Center said. Liu had been working on an article
calling for the release of the three opposition organizers.
	   Also Saturday, an organizer of weekly discussions of social
problems announced the sudden suspension of the gatherings. Peng
Ming of the China Development Union had held the Saturday
discussions since April, even after officials ordered him to
disband.
	   Addressing about 20 dissidents gathered in the group's small
office to talk about the history of democracy movements in China,
Peng said the discussions must end because of a shortage of funds
and because the landlord refused to continue to rent space to the
group.
	   ``We must keep in line with the central government's policy,''
Peng said.
	   On Friday, in a national address marking the anniversary of
China's 20 years of economic reforms, President Jiang Zemin said
China would spurn Western-style democracy and crush threats to
Communist Party rule.
	   Also on Friday, authorities informed the wife of veteran
activist Xu Wenli that his trial on charges of attempting to
subvert state power would open Monday in Beijing. It was the first
He Xintong has heard about her husband since he was arrested on
Nov. 30.
	   Xu Wenli was being held with five criminal suspects at the
Beijing Detention Center, a court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping,
told He on Friday. Mo had just two days to prepare the defense.
	   Xu edited a dissident journal during the Democracy Wall movement
20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary
confinement.
	   Two other leaders, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, were tried
separately on Thursday, but no verdict was immediately announced.
	   Prison terms were virtually certain. The maximum penalty the
three faced were life terms.
	   The Hong Kong rights group also reported that 18 dissidents in
several provinces issued a statement saying more than 20 democracy
campaigners were taken into detention the day before Wang's trial
in Hangzhou and Qin's in Wuhan.

Ghedina wins second Val Gardena downhill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Ams. RECASTS, UPDATES with detail, more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Kristian Ghedina proved himself to be
the wizard of second runs.
	   The 29-year-old Italian skier on Saturday won the second of
back-to-back World Cup downhills in Val Gardena ending the winning
streak of Norwegian Lasse Kjus and extending the winless series of
the Austrians.
	   Ghedina, a daredevil on skis and on his motorbikes, captured his
tenth World Cup career victory in a replay of his 1996 triumph in
this northern valley when he won the second of consecutive speed
races.
	   He also won the second of the Kitzbuhel double downhills last
January.
	   ``I did not ski a perfect race. I made some mistakes. But it
does not matter when you win,'' said Ghedina, as he carried his
4-year-old brother Luca shoulder on at the finish line.
	   ``He brings me good luck. He was here two years ago, and I won
the race,'' Ghedina added, after hugging the brother.
	   The skier from Cortina d'Ampezzo clocked a winning time of two
minutes, 4.17 seconds down the 3,495-meter long Saslong course,
dropping 839 meters.
	   Kjus, winner of the two previous World Cup downhills, finished
second, 0.14 seconds behind.
	   ``I was not as perfect as yesterday and I paid for a few
mistakes. I also lacked some concentration following two wins in a
row,'' Kjus said.
	   Second place kept the Norwegian skier atop the World Cup overall
standings, with 493 points in ten races. He also led the downhill
standings with 280 points.
	   Werner Franz edged Austrian teammate Hermann Maier for third
place, 0.28 seconds behind the winner.
	   The two Austrians had placed second and third respectively,
behind Kjus, in Friday's downhill which made up for the race
canceled in Whistler Mountain, Canada, earlier this month.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion, complained that a race
steward disturbed his run crossing the course as he was coming
down.
	   The jury rejected a complaint by the Austrian team because Maier
did not stop and made it to the finish line, still placing fourth
with a gap of only 0.48 seconds.
	   Maier said later he could have hardly beaten Ghedina, even in
absence of the disturbing presence of the steward who was rushing
to help a fallen competitor.
	   The Austrians are winless in three downhill races this season
after starting the campaign triumphantly in the other three
disciplines of the World Cup.
	   Ghedina's time Saturday was nearly two seconds slower than Kjus'
winning time the previous day, over the same icy course and
distance.
	   ``I beat Kjus today because he made mistakes. He had been
faultless, thus unbeatable, Friday,'' Ghedina said.
	   The Italian skier had placed fourth Friday and a distant 45th in
the first season downhill at Val D'Isere last week.
	   Another Norwegian, Kjetil Andre Aamodt, placed fifth in a replay
of his previous day finish.
	   Other top finishers included Austrians Andreas Schifferer and
Fritz Strobl in sixth and seventh place.
	   Canada's Brian Stemmle was the top north American in 20th place.
American Chad Fleischer came in 23rd.
	   The race was marred by a season-ending accident suffered by
Olympic downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier. The 33-year-old
Frenchman tore the cruciate ligament of his left knee and fractured
his left hand in a high-speed spill.
	   Cretier, who had won the Olympic title in Nagano this year
beating Kjus, fell at an icy section shortly after the start,
skidded off the track and fell over a ridge of snow and grass.
	   He was taken by helicopter to the nearby hospital of Bressanone
(Brixen).
	   Two other skiers, American Ehlias Louis and France's David
Pretot, torn knee ligaments in falls during Friday's race.
	   The men's World Cup circuit continues Sunday with a giant slalom
at nearby Alta Badia.

China launches two U.S.-made satellites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Chinese Long March 2C rocket launched two U.S.
made satellites into orbit on Saturday, China's state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported.
	   The rocket lifted off at 7:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) from the Taiyuan
launch center in north China's Shanxi province. The satellites are
part of a mobile telecommunications system developed by Motorola
Corp.
	   Saturday's was the 13th successful launch since two failures, in
February and August 1996, resulted in the cancellation and
suspension of contracts.
	   Six launches have put 10 satellites into orbit this year and no
more are planned before year's end, the report said.

Baghdad comes under worst attack in three-day offensive

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ The United States blasts military and government
buildings in Baghdad Saturday in what appeared to be the fiercest
attack on the capital in three days of strikes.
	   Fiery streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk cruise missiles
arced across the sky before dawn. Warheads exploded a few seconds
later, lighting the pre-dawn horizon in a red glow that silhouetted
palm trees against the dark sky.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling the
sky with booms and bright red flashes. Orange tracer bullets
streaked above.
	   When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens
blaring were heard speeding away. Officials, who must escort
journalists wishing to tour the city, refused to take them to the
targeted areas.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the Friday and Saturday
attacks was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center of
the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Western reporters staying at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad
saw explosions in nearby areas known to have palaces, a
headquarters of the Special Security service and the command center
for the Popular Army _ a paramilitary force.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Saturday's attack appeared to be the toughest yet against
Baghdad since the U.S. and British militaries began air strikes
early Thursday to punish Iraq for its alleged obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before Saturday's attack, the United States fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks, but it did not issue further official casualty
figures for the third round in the assault.
	   On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more
people were killed and 21 wounded in a missile attack on the
Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The report said an agricultural training center and a number of
houses were damaged.
	   INA also referred later to a march held Saturday for 68 people
killed in the U.S. and British attacks, but Mohsen al-Tarfa, deputy
director of the government press center, said that was wrong and
that the 68 dead were victims of U.N. sanctions.
	   Iraq has complained that thousands have died because limited
medicines have entered the country under the sanctions.
	   Meanwhile, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by
the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   Saturday's explosions were not preceded by air raid sirens,
implying that for the first time the strikes eluded Iraqi air
defenses.
	   When the reverberations from the explosions subsided at about
4:45 a.m. (0145 GMT), the winter air filled with the sounds of
muezzins calling from mosque loudspeakers, informing Muslims to eat
their last meal before beginning the first day of fasting for the
holy month of Ramadan.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice.
	   ``We will not let evil triumph over virtue,'' he said.
	   State-run newspapers on Saturday echoed Saddam's theme. A banner
headline in the Al-Jumhuriya daily read: ``We shall resist and
fight in the name of God.''
	   On Saturday, officials at the Oil Ministry said that crude
exports under the U.N. approved oil-for-food program were
continuing despite the military attacks.
	   The officials said an average of 1.8 million barrels per day
were going out through Mina al-Bakr port and terminals at the
Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   During a Pentagon briefing on Friday, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman Gen. Henry Shelton said that U.S. forces have hit more
than 75 targets in the last two nights.
	   But initial bomb-damage assessments indicate that only a small
number of the targets were destroyed or severely damaged even
though Iraq offered virtually no resistance.
	   ``We ... have had some very good success with our strikes, but
not all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' Shelton said.
	   For example, of 27 Iraqi surface-to-air missile facilities
attacked, only one was destroyed and eight suffered no damage.
	   The Iraqi military claimed its anti-aircraft batteries had shot
down 77 incoming missiles so far.
	   The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to
lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten
its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz questioned that.
	   ``The real objective of this aggression is to show that the
United States is the sole superpower,'' he told reporters Friday.
	   He said the strikes targeted the old defense ministry building,
which houses only administrative department, a refinery in the
southern city of Basra, a trade ministry warehouse and a
radio-television transmission facility.
	   The Pharmacy College of Baghdad and the Museum of Natural
History were also hit.
	   Aziz did not say which military sites had been hit.
	   But in Washington, U.S. officials showed aircraft videotape of
laser-guided bombs slamming into what they said were military
targets, including radar stations, a missile storage facility, and
a missile production plant.
	   Aziz said almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons
inspectors had been monitoring have been hit.
	   The inspectors, who had been working in the country since 1991,
withdrew from the country on Wednesday, complaining of lack of
cooperation from Iraq. The withdrawal became the trigger for the
U.S.-British attack.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the U.N. Security Council
cannot lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The United Nation's efforts to relieve the hardships caused by
the sanctions received a severe blow with the evacuation Friday of
106 international staffers of a program to monitor food aid to the
Iraqis.

	   LA PLAGNE, France (AP) _ Germany's Christoph Langen won his
second World Cup bobsled event in two days Saturday, guiding the
Germany 1 team to success in the four-man competition.
	   Langen, who won the two-man event Friday, took first place with
a time of 1 minute, 55.30 seconds with teammates Sven Ruehr, Marco
Jakobs and Thomas Platzer.
	   As in the two-man event, Langen won comfortably.
	   He came in 46 hundredths of a second ahead of second-placed
Marcel Rohner of Switzerland, with veteran German Harald Czudaj in
third.
	   It was the third consecutive World Cup event in which Langen won
both the two and four man events.
	   Langen also broke the course record with a first heat time of
57.31.
	   The win stretches Langen's lead at the top of the World Cup
standings.
	   Langen now has 130 points, ahead of Rohner and Andre Lange, both
on 113.
	   The World Cup season continues Jan. 16-17 in Winterberg,

Report: Japan says North Korea is building new missile launch sites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Defense Agency believes North Korea has
begun construction of two new missile-launch facilities, which
would increase the number of launch sites in the reclusive
communist state to three, local media said Saturday.
	   The agency also concluded in a report issued Friday that North
Korea maintains three suspected nuclear weapons development
facilities, Kyodo News agency said. The report was submitted to
Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, it said.
	   Defense Agency officials were unavailable late Saturday for
comment.
	   The reported move by North Korea could heighten tensions with
Tokyo and Washington, which already have expressed growing concern
about Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapons development programs.
	   On Aug. 31, North Korea test fired a missile over Japan. The
U.S. says the North has also started construction of a suspected
underground nuclear-related facility.
	   North Korea's hardline communist leadership has rebuffed a U.S.
demand that it allow unconditional inspection of the underground
facility at Keumjang-ri, 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of the
country's main nuclear complex of Yongbyon.
	   U.S. officials have warned the impasse could lead to the
collapse of a 1994 accord under which Pyongyang promised to abandon
its suspected nuclear weapons program. In return, it was promised
aid in the form of oil shipments and a pair of civilian nuclear
power plants.
	   The Japanese Defense Agency report described one of the new
missile launch sites as being near the northern border with China
and the other as near the southern border with South Korea, Kyodo
News said.
	   Its existing launch facility is located on the Japan Sea coast.
	   But the agency reported no signs that North Korea has begun
preparations for a new missile launch, it said.
	   On Thursday, a Russian news report cited Russia Defense Ministry
officials as saying that North Korea is planning another ballistic
missile test.
	   North Korea has said its Aug. 31 firing was a rocket launch
which put a satellite payload into orbit. Japan has dismissed that
claim, saying it was a three-stage ballistic missile. U.S.
officials say they have found no evidence of an orbiting North
Korean satellite.
	   The three nuclear-related sites cited by the agency include a
nuclear reprocessing facility in Kumchangri, a trigger device
testing compound in Kwisong and an underground facility in Taechon,
the report said.
	   It was unclear whether the underground sites at Kwisong and
Keumjang-ri were separate facilities or different names for the
same facility.

Ice-fishing claims 12 lives in southern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ At least 12 people have drowned in southern
Ukraine so far this month after going fishing on thin ice,
officials said Saturday.
	   The regional rescue department in the city of Mykolaiv said a
new death is reported nearly every day as fishermen fall through
the 5-6 centimeter (2-2.4 inch) layer of ice on local rivers.
	   Ice-fishing is a popular pastime in the former Soviet Union. In
Mykolaiv, many residents see it as a major source of food and a way
of supplementing their income, rescue officials told the Interfax
news agency.
	   One kilogram (2.2 pounds) of small river fish sells for about
1.75 hryvna (50 cents) at Mykolaiv markets. But these earnings cost
the residents dearly _ over last winter alone, 60 ice fishermen
have drowned, and the number is expected to increase this winter,
rescuers said.

Olympic champs Daehlie and Danilova post World Cup wins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) _ Triple Olympic champion Bjoern Daehlie
of Norway collected his third consecutive victory Saturday, winning
a men's 30-km (18.6-mile) classic cross country race.
	   On the women's side, double Olympic gold medallist Olga Danilova
won a women's 15-km (9.32-mile) classic, edging World Cup overall
leader Bente Martinsen of Norway for her first victory of the
season.
	   Daehlie, who won Olympic gold in the 10-km (6-mile) classic, the
50-km (30-mile) freestyle and the men's relay in Nagano last
February, completed the course in 1 hour, 14 minutes, 49.2 seconds,
beating out the reigning world champion Alexei Prokurorov of Russia
by over half a minute.
	   The winner of a World Cup knock-out sprint in Milan two weeks
ago, Austria's Mikhail Botwinov finished third in 1:16:15.0, ahead
of Norway's Erling Jevne, fourth in 1:16:19.7.
	   Daehlie's victory solidifies his place atop the overall World
Cup rankings, where he currently leads with 380 points, a
comfortable 104 ahead of his nearest contender Mathias Fredriksson
of Sweden, who was fifth, 1:39.2 adrift on Saturday.
	   On the women's side, Danilova, who won the event at the Nagano
Games, won in 41 minutes, 11.0 seconds, edging Martinsen by a mere
.2.
	   Russia's Larissa Lazutina, another triple Olympic champion in
Japan, crossed third in 41:22.6, followed by compatriot Nina
Gavriljuk in 41:24.3.
	   Russia's women had a fruitful day, with five finishing in the
top six, and six in the top-10.
	   Martinsen's second place was enough to maintain her lead atop
the overall World Cup standings where she sits with 294, nine
points ahead of Czech Katerina Neumannova, who was not at the start
Saturday.
	   Gavriljuk, still winless this season, is third in the rankings
with 250, ahead of Danilova, who climbed from seventh to fourth
with 236.
	   Cross country competition continues Sunday, with a women's
classic/freestyle 4x5-km (4x3-mile) relay, and men's
classic/freestyle 4x10-km (4x6-mile) relay.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, Arab protesters joined
Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   In a rare protest in the Syrian capital, thousands marched
through downtown Damascus Saturday, and about 1,000 people _ most
of them students _ attacked the U.S. Embassy, its nearby residence
and the American Cultural Center.
	   Rioters also threw stones at the British Embassy in Damascus and
broke into the British Council, where they damaged furniture and
scattered library books.
	   At the U.S. residence, more than 100 people climbed over the
wall, broke down the front door and stormed inside, destroying
everything in their path _ furniture, windows, the ambassador's
private office. They knocked books on the floor, and destroyed
kitchen cabinets and bookcases.
	   They also attacked the car of Ambassador Ryan Crocker,
shattering the lights and windows. Crocker's wife, Christine, was
in the house at the time but was not hurt.
	   At the embassy, U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas from the roof
to disperse the stone-throwing crowd. Three protesters managed to
enter the compound, climb the walls and haul down and burn the
American flag.
	   Syrian security forces dispersed the mobs after about six hours.
	   In Hebron in the West Bank, some 3,000 Palestinians defied a ban
from their leadership on pro-Iraq demonstrations, screaming ``Death
to Israel! Death to America!'' Clashes later with Israeli troops
left more than 80 injured.
	   Palestinian police didn't attempt to restrain the marchers as
they set out from Hebron University, some wearing black hoods or
masks of checked scarves and carrying posters of Saddam.
	   In Egypt, 4,000 students burned U.S. and Israeli flags at Banha
University, north of Cairo, as did 200 students at Cairo's Ain
Shams University.
	   ``Oh Baghdad, Oh Baghdad, my love, strike Tel Aviv,'' they
shouted at Ain Shams. ``Iraq's children have no milk for nursing,
so now they're sucking on bullets instead.''
	   Protester Ayman Yassin, 20, called America ``the spawn of all
evil.''
	   ``Because Bill has to play, the Arabs have to pay,'' Yassin
said, referring to the widespread belief among Arabs that Clinton
engineered the attack to delay impeachment proceedings against him
over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   In Jordan, more than 1,000 students expressed their anger at
Jordanian University, where 200 riot police kept them from leaving
the campus.
	   The protests also have hit Sudan, where U.S. forces in August
bombed a pharmaceuticals plant Washington accused of making
components for chemical weapons.
	   In the capital, Khartoum, some students threw Molotov cocktails
at the closed U.S. Embassy during a protest by about 2,000 people,
witnesses said.
	   A Muslim militant group threatened to avenge the American and
British missile attacks, the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   ``The crimes committed by the United States against our Islamic
people will not pass without punishment,'' said a statement from
Islamic Jihad-Vanguards of Conquest quoted by the daily.
	   Both groups were active in a campaign by Muslim extremists,
launched in 1992, to try to overthrow Egypt's secular government
and replace it with strict Islamic rule.

Campaigner for Islamic statehood released from Nigerian prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The leader of a Muslim sect campaigning
for a fundamentalist Islamic state in Nigeria has been freed after
spending two years behind bars, the Lagos Guardian newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zak Zaky, who was jailed for making illegal
radio broadcasts in 1996 during the rule of the late military
dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, spoke with journalists on Friday soon
after being freed from jail in the northern city of Kaduna, about
170 kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital of Abuja.
	   Charges of sedition against El-Zak Zaky were dropped. The
charges had led to numerous violent protests by supporters of the
cleric's Muslim Brothers movement, resulting in a number of
casualties.
	   El-Zak Zaky insisted he would continue to push for a government
upholding Muslim religious principles.
	   ``We can only have a victor and a vanquished,'' he was quoted by
the Guardian as saying.
	   Nigeria's current military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar,
has launched a program of wide-ranging reforms including a planned
transition to civilian democracy following presidential elections
in February. Most of the country's political prisoners jailed under
Abacha's rule have been released.

Ukrainian president asks parliament to abolish death penalty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma asked parliament to
approve a law abolishing the death penalty in Ukraine in accordance
with the nation's international obligations, the presidential press
service said Saturday.
	   Ukraine agreed to abolish capital punishment in 1995 when it
joined the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights
organization. The council, which promotes democracy, human rights
and the rule of law, forbids members from executing criminals.
	   However, 180 convicted criminals were executed before Ukraine
introduced a moratorium on death penalties in March 1997, replacing
executions with life imprisonment. Ukrainian courts have sentenced
more than 80 people to death in 1998, though none have been
executed.
	   The death penalty has become a hot topic again due to the case
of Anatoliy Onoprienko, who is being tried for 52 killings between
1989 and 1996.
	   Kuchma has said he is ready to appeal to the Council of Europe
to make an exception in Onoprienko's case if he's found guilty and
sentenced to death.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's main downtown streets to denounce the
American and British air strikes on Iraq.
	   Before small, violent groups were brought under control, they
had trashed the American ambassador's residence and gotten into
American and British cultural centers, where they scattered library
books and damaged furniture.
	   The rioting persisted on and off for more than six hours around
the buildings, which were largely unmanned because they do not open
for business on Saturday.
	   Syrian security forces struggled to stop the rioting, which
appeared to involve mainly university students and youth groups.
	   At one point, Syrian forces tried to bring in a water truck to
break up the crowd outside the ambassador's house with hoses. But
the truck's way was blocked by protesters who laid down in the
street in its path.
	   The attack on the embassy buildings came amid a massive protest
against the continued bombardment of neighboring Iraq by American
and British missiles.
	   Tens of thousands of marchers carried banners with anti-American
slogans and chanted demands for an end to the attacks on Iraq,
which have gone on for three nights.
	   ``The Syrian people are with you, our Iraqi brothers,'' read one
banner carried by protesters.
	   Large demonstrations are rare in the Syrian capital, which is
under tight security control, and Saturday's marches throughout
downtown could not have occurred without government approval.
	   The U.S. Embassy was the first site to come under attack.
	   Witnesses said the embassy's Marine guards fired tear gas to
disperse the crowd, but three protesters managed to enter the
grounds and climb the walls of the building to haul down and burn
the American flag.
	   Chanting ``Down with America,'' a crowd estimated at a thousand
surrounded the embassy in the upscale al-Rawdha neighborhood. Many
pelted the building with stones, shattering windows.
	   ``It's very crowded. They are throwing stones,'' said a man who
answered the phone at the embassy but who would not give his name.
	   The mobs later attacked two other American installations and two
British government buildings, but there were no reports of injuries
to any Westerners.
	   Witnesses said about a dozen protesters were taken away to a
hospital after being overcome by tear gas.
	   The crowd also marched on the nearby residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ryan Crocker, throwing stones and breaking windows. The
ambassador's wife, Christine, was in the building but was not hurt,
said a Syrian guard outside who would not give his name.
	   About 100 protesters climbed the wall surrounding the house,
broke down the front door and stormed inside. Before they left they
destroyed everything in their path _ the ambassador's office,
kitchen cabinets, tables and bookcases.
	   They also shattered the windows and lights of Crocker's car,
which was parked in the compound.
	   Some grabbed a bra from the house and wrote the name ``Monica''
on it Arabic. They waved it outside, shouting: ``This is Monica's
bra.''
	   A mob also broke into a nearby American school and the U.S.
Cultural Center, despite efforts by Syrian police to block their
path. Library books later could be seen scattered on the street
outside both facilities.
	   Other demonstrators surrounded and threw stones at the British
Embassy and the British Council, a government institution that
sponsors English language classes and cultural programs.
	   Windows and some furniture were damaged at the British Council,
witnesses said.
	   The protesters also overturned a British diplomatic vehicle,
they said.
	   The protests in Damascus were part of a massive show of support
for the Iraqis across the Arab world. Demonstrations also erupted
Saturday in the West Bank, Egypt, Jordan and Sudan.

Governing party, Muslim organizations condemn attacks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The governing People's Progressive
Party condemned the air strikes on Iraq by the United States and
Britain on Saturday.
	   ``The world had hoped that with the end of the Cold War, greater
security would have been achieved for all peoples,'' said the
party's statement. ``Instead, however, we have noticed that less
diplomacy and more force is being used to settle differences and
disputes internationally.''
	   The Central Islamic Organization of Guyana and the Muslim
Masjids of the neighboring country of Suriname also issued
statements criticizing the attacks.
	   ``We condemn this attack against a people that has suffered for
several years under strangling economic sanctions which have led to
the deaths of 5,000 Iraqi children every month,'' said the Suriname
group.

Opposition says Iraq sends troops south for possible Shiite revolt

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein has put Iraq's
southern provinces on maximum alert and deployed thousands of elite
troops to head off a possible revolt by Shiite Muslims, dissidents
and travelers said Saturday.
	   The Iraqi leader also has armed tens of thousands of members of
the ruling Baath Party to guard government offices in Baghdad and
other towns in fear a rebellion could be set off by U.S. and
British airstrikes aimed at the country, they said.
	   The dissidents and travelers, who spoke from Jordan and Syria on
condition of anonymity, said elite Republican Guard divisions were
sent to the provinces of Basra, Nasirriya and Imara, where they
maintained Shiite rebels already were staging an insurgency.
	   Some troops, their tanks and artillery have been stationed in
date palm groves along the 500-kilometer (335-mile) highway from
Basra to Baghdad, they said.
	   There was no way to immediately confirm the reports. Baghdad has
made no mention of the troop deployment, but Iraqi officials have
voiced concern the American and British attacks may be aimed at
destabilizing Saddam's regime and paving the way for a rebellion.
	   Southern Iraq was the site of fierce fighting in the aftermath
of the 1991 Gulf War when the Iraqi military crushed an uprising by
Shiite Muslim rebels. Iraqi opposition groups in London have said
fighting has flared again there in recent months.
	   Hamdi al-Bayati, a spokesman in London for the Supreme Council
of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, said some of the guard units in
the area have been engaged in fighting with Shiite rebels in Imara
since Thursday.
	   He said fighting was still raging in and around the marsh areas
of al-Iz and Umm al-Naaj in the province.
	   The reported security steps follow U.S. and British air strikes
which began Thursday to punish Iraq for its obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered the series of
airstrikes to destroy Iraqi ``military and security'' targets.
	   On Friday, Saddam said he would not ``compromise or kneel'' in
the showdown with U.S. and British military forces.
	   Addressing the nation on television for the first time since the
airstrikes began, Saddam told Iraqis: ``Continue your resistance
and, by God's will, you will be victorious.''
	   But the travelers and dissidents said the Iraqi authorities have
shown considerable nervousness since the bombardment started and
have imposed strict security measures.
	   Among measures they've taken are stopping and turning back many
travelers heading from Baghdad to the southern provinces on the
main highway, they said. The travelers are stopped at military
checkpoints, a permanent feature along the road.

Balloon team sails into Libyan airspace

 &UR; EDS: AMs. UPDATES with balloon on its way over Mediterranean, mood,
course route.
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson and his crew soared
over Libya and across the Mediterranean on Saturday, heading for
Turkey _ and avoiding Iraq _ on day two of their quest to circle
the globe in a balloon.
	   Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate Per
Lindstrand were ``laughing and joking'' and in ``great shape,''
said Jackie McQuillan, spokesman for ICO Global, a mobile telephone
company supporting the trip.
	   The balloon sailed into Libyan airspace from Algeria on Saturday
morning and then out over the Mediterranean Sea at a speed of about
130 miles (210 kilometers) per hour late in the afternoon.
	   Branson, who had a sore throat in the morning, was feeling very
well by the afternoon, said McQuillan, who spoke to him on several
occasions throughout the day via satellite telephone.
	   ``The flight is going very well, according to McQuillan, who has
been monitoring the balloon's progress nonstop since the launch on
Friday.
	   All three adventurers were surviving on a diet of vitamin-packed
food packages of the kind that astronauts eat in space.
	   The crew does have a Christmas pudding, a traditional British
Christmas dessert on board for the upcoming holiday. It was not
clear whether they would be able to pour brandy over the pudding
and light it as is the custom in Britain.
	   After passing over the Mediterranean and eastern Cyprus on
Saturday evening, the 200-foot-high (61-meter) balloon was to cross
into Turkish airspace at the border with Syria about 50 miles from
Iraq.
	   Most of Sunday will be spent flying over Turkey before the
balloon heads up to the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and
Kazakstan before skirting the Himalayas on its way to China.
	   The balloon was cruising at about 28,000 feet on Saturday,
McQuillan said in a telephone interview.
	   Good weather, a good wind and a cloudless sky have helped the
travelers in their attempt to become the first to circle the globe
in a balloon.
	   The balloon took off from a Moroccan airforce base outside
Marrakech on Friday at 0922 GMT after a two-hour delay.
	   After crossing the Atlas mountains, the balloon crossed into
Algerian airspace where the balloon continued its course overnight
before crossing the border with Libya.
	   ``The tricky part is getting through the first 24 hours,''
Branson said Friday shortly before liftoff. ``After that we can
start to relax and enjoy the flight.''
	   Branson and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits,
expressed confidence in the trip, estimating it could last from
eight days to nearly three weeks.
	   The U.S. missile strike on Iraq has complicated the task,
Branson said.
	   The missile strike means the team will have to find the winds to
take them north of Iraq through Turkey instead of cutting over
Saudi Arabia.
	   Branson and his crew hope to touch down somewhere in Europe at
the end of a 24,000-mile flight which will take them over Saudi
Arabia, India, the South China sea, the Pacific ocean and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and had only four refusals - Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe, the last one
ending when his Solo Spirit was ripped apart in a violent storm off
Australia.
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first
person to trek the globe in a balloon.
	   The crew is more confident this time because of improved
technology used to make the balloon, including a Kevlar canopy over
the crew's pressurized capsule. Kevlar is used for bulletproof
vests.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon - from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

International officials arrive in Pristina
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with statements from international
officials in Pristina, relatives recover bodies of Albanians killed
on the border, trims.
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials demanded
unity Saturday from the leaders of Kosovo's pro-independence ethnic
Albanians as a necessary condition for any fruitful talks with the
Serbian government.
	   French and Austrian diplomats led a group of international
officials to the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders, in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and more moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``We want to give a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side
(that) it's time now to start real negotiating at a broad base ...
that represents all the Kosovo Albanian political forces,'' said
Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's Ambassador to Belgrade.
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, Jacques Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating team.
	   ``Time is running out and everybody must make some efforts for
reopening the door for political process. We hope the door will be
open ... in the next days,'' said Huntzinger.
	   Petritsch said they got a ``positive response'' from Agani,
``but we are still short of a real and definite commitment that
will lead to a concrete forming of such a team.''
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight
for full independence.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia _ also attended the talks and later met with KLA spokesman,
Adem Demaci.
	   Asked how and when the KLA might join political negotiations, in
which they have not previously been included because of their
contined military activity, Petritsch challenged the Kosovo
Albanian side to ``come up with a solution to this.''
	   He added ``there are positive signals that the KLA is realizing
... that they have to decide whether to continue on the military
path or if they want to join political negotiating process.''
	   The talks come on the heels of what has been the bloodiest week
in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people have been
killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting
escalated early last year.
	   Just outside of Pristina Saturday, hundreds of Serbs attended
the burial of Zvonko Bojanic, a municipal leader who was brutally
killed. Bojanic's body was found dumped along a roadside early
Friday, badly beaten, and shot between the eyes, with multiple
fracture wounds.
	   The Serbs blame the KLA for the killing, but Demaci has denied
the rebels were involved in the killing, suggesting Serbian secret
police may have been behind it.
	   ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of the Serbian
regime,'' said Demaci.
	   Serbian police said, however, the five assailants who broke into
Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   Also Saturday, relatives of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla
fighters killed in a border clash on Monday recovered the bodies
from the Serb-run morgue in Prizren and were preparing to bury them
in a collective ceremony on Sunday.

Fire destroys Bosnian news agency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A fire wiped out the offices
of Bosnia's leading news agency early Saturday, the agency's
director said. No one was injured.
	   ``We lost everything but we will try to continue our work,
sending at least the most important news to our users'' Mehmed
Husic, a head of Onasa told The Associated Press.
	   Witnesses reported the fire broke out sometime around midnight.
All five offices the agency occupied in a building were damaged and
all the equipment was destroyed. No estimates of damages were
immediately available.
	   Onasa was established in April 1994, during the 1992-95 Bosnian
war, as a branch of Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje. Over the past four
years, it has developed into an independent, nationwide agency.
	   On Saturday, the agency's staff sent a message to their
colleagues, appealing for donations of equipment that would help
them continue their work.
	   ``We didn't stop our work even during the war, and this accident
will not halt us,'' Husic said.
	   Police are investigating the blaze.

Grimmette and Martin win luge race; Germans unbeatable among women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINTERBERG, Germany (AP) _ U.S. Olympic bronze medal winners
Americans Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin set a heat record
Saturday while capturing the doubles at the luge World Cup.
	   But the German's women's team remained nearly unbeatable in the
four-man sled, landing all three teams on the podium as Olympic
champion Silke Kraushaar picked up another win.
	   ``Our winning streak is crazy, but we've got the best starts and
the best sleds,'' said Kraushaar. ``We're all driving each other
forward.''
	   Martin and Grimmette roared to a new record of 45.978 seconds on
their second run at the Winterberg track while overcoming erratic
rainy conditions.
	   ``A lot of sleds seemed to have difficulty with the conditions.
Luckily we made it through,'' said Martin.
	   Martin and Grimmette won in a combined time of of 1 minute,
32.641 seconds, followed by Austrian cousins Tobias and Markus
Schiegl at 1:32.902 and Germany's Patrick Leitner and Alexander
Resch at 1:33.052.
	   The American pair of Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer were fourth.
Teammates Christian Niccum and Matt McClain, who have already won
two events, settled for 15th after crashing on the second run.
	   Grimette and Martin, who are the defending overall world
champion, again lead the standings at 312 points. The Schiegls are
at 301 and Niccum and McLain at 286.
	   ``We were trying to get a victory here before going home for
Christmas,'' said Grimmette.
	   Kraushaar won the four-man sled in a time of 1:33.789 minutes,
followed by Susi Erdmann at 1:34,033 and Barbara Niedernhuber at
1:34,061.
	   The German women have dominated the event this season and have
grabbed the top four spots in the overall standings.
	   Sylke Otto leads at 320 points, followed by Kraushaar with 316,
Niedernhuber, 301, and Erdmann, 255.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, Arab protesters joined
Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   In a rare protest in the Syrian capital, tens of thousands
marched through downtown Damascus Saturday, and about 1,000 people
_ most of them students _ attacked the U.S. Embassy, its nearby
residence and the American Cultural Center.
	   Rioters in Damascus also threw stones at the British Embassy and
broke into the British Council, where they damaged furniture and
scattered library books.
	   At the U.S. residence, more than 100 people climbed over the
wall, broke down the front door and stormed inside, destroying
furniture, windows, kitchen cabinets and bookcases.
	   They also attacked the car of Ambassador Ryan Crocker,
shattering the lights and windows. Crocker's wife, Christine, was
in the house at the time but was not hurt.
	   At the embassy, U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas from the roof
to disperse the stone-throwing crowd. Three protesters managed to
enter the compound, and haul down and burn the American flag.
	   Syrian security forces dispersed the mobs after about six hours.
	   In Hebron in the West Bank, some 3,000 Palestinians defied a ban
from their leadership on pro-Iraq demonstrations, screaming ``Death
to Israel! Death to America!'' Clashes later with Israeli troops
left more than 80 injured.
	   Palestinian police didn't attempt to restrain the marchers as
they set out from Hebron University, some wearing black hoods or
masks of checked scarves and carrying posters of Saddam.
	   In Egypt, 4,000 students burned U.S. and Israeli flags at Banha
University, north of Cairo, as did 200 students at Cairo's Ain
Shams University.
	   ``Oh Baghdad, Oh Baghdad, my love, strike Tel Aviv,'' they
shouted at Ain Shams. ``Iraq's children have no milk for nursing,
so now they're sucking on bullets instead.''
	   Protester Ayman Yassin, 20, called America ``the spawn of all
evil.''
	   ``Because Bill has to play, the Arabs have to pay,'' Yassin
said, referring to the widespread belief among Arabs that Clinton
engineered the attack to delay impeachment proceedings against him
over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   In Jordan, more than 1,000 students expressed their anger at
Jordanian University, where 200 riot police kept them from leaving
the campus.
	   The protests also have hit Sudan, where U.S. forces in August
bombed a pharmaceuticals plant Washington alleged was making
components for chemical weapons.
	   In the capital, Khartoum, some students threw Molotov cocktails
at the closed U.S. Embassy during a protest by about 2,000 people,
witnesses said.
	   A Muslim militant group threatened to avenge the American and
British missile attacks, the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper
reported Saturday.
	   ``The crimes committed by the United States against our Islamic
people will not pass without punishment,'' said a statement from
Islamic Jihad-Vanguards of Conquest quoted by the daily.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns started firing in
Baghdad for the fourth straight night Saturday.
	   Gun batteries on rooftops sent tracer shells streaking across
the sky.
	   The guns began firing minutes after sirens wailed across the
city at 6:36 p.m. local time (1536GMT).
	   The gun batteries fell silent after four minutes. They were
positioned on the eastern outskirts of the city.
	   But about 15 minutes later guns in a different part of the city
opened fire. They stopped firing minutes later.
	   It was not known immediately what had caused the two barrages.
Reporters on the roof of the Information Ministry building in the
city center heard dull thuds in the distance, but they saw no sign
of incoming missiles.
	   In Washington, a White House official said a fourth wave of air
strikes had begun.
	   The United States and Britain launched a series of air strikes
overnight Wednesday to punish Iraq for its alleged obstruction of
U.N. weapons inspectors seeking evidence of the country's weapons
of mass destruction.

Bayern Munich won't keep Thomas Helmer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bayern Munich announced Saturday the side
won't renew the contract of defender Thomas Helmer, a former
captain of the team and German international.
	   The contract of the 33-year-old, whose playing time has
diminshed with a series of injuries, runs out June 30, 1999.
	   ``Everybody reaches an age where it no longer works. That's the
destiny of a professional,'' said Munich president Franz
Beckenbauer.
	   Helmer, who joined Munich in 1992, was a mainstay of the club
for years but has been shoved aside by new coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
The sometimes-libero also has 66 caps with the national team.

 &UR; Servicemen focus on attacking Iraq, not Clinton

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Their president may be under
fire at home, but he is receiving no flak from U.S. military
personnel in the Gulf.
	   ``President Clinton is commander-in-chief ... and he's the best
commander-in-chief there is, until the powers that be decide
differently,'' said Lt. Paul Fermo, a rescue helicopter pilot on
the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the centerpiece of the battle
group that has led the air attacks on Iraq.
	   Aboard the vessel, the impeachment proceedings in Washington are
far away: in geography and in mind set. Airmen and others say they
have no time to worry about politics while they are mounting
airstrikes.
	   And _ in public at least _ they pledge full support to the chain
of command, which ends with Clinton as commander-in-chief of U.S.
military forces.
	   ``He is our leader until proven wrong,'' said rescue helicopter
pilot Lt. Greg Lealand of Marlboro, Massachusetts.
	   Cmdr. Will Cooney, an F-14 pilot from Virginia Beach, Virginia,
said he quite capable of separating military orders from political
developments.
	   ``Whatever's going on back in the House, it has no bearing on
what we're doing out here,'' he said.
	   But there were sharp rebukes for one politically linked
suggestion: that Clinton ordered the attacks to deflect attention
from the Republican Party-led impeachment drive.
	   ``No, not at all ... It's pure coincidence,'' said Marine Maj.
Ross Roberts, an F-18 pilot from Northport, New York.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns shot bright flashes into
the Baghdad sky on Saturday night, an indication that the fourth
wave of punishing U.S. and British air strikes was under way.
	   Gun batteries on rooftops sent tracer shells streaking across
the sky shortly after dusk, as Muslims were breaking their fast on
the first day of the holy fasting month of Ramadan.
	   The guns began firing minutes after sirens wailed across the
capital.
	   In Washington, a White House official said a fourth wave of air
strikes had begun.
	   Iraq has been taking a beating since overnight
Wednesday-Thursday, when U.S. and British forces launched an air
offensive to punish Iraq for obstructing the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The previous attack ended shortly before dawn on Saturday and
had appeared to be the toughest yet against Baghdad.
	   Before this attack, the United States fired nearly 300 Tomahawk
cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Thunderous blasts rocked Baghdad before dawn on Saturday.
	   Reporters saw fiery streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk
cruise missiles arcing across the sky. Warheads exploded a few
seconds later, lighting the pre-dawn horizon in a red glow that
silhouetted palm trees against the dark sky.
	   Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire, filling the
sky with booms and bright red flashes.
	   When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens
blaring were heard speeding away.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the Friday and Saturday
attacks was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center of
the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and offices
of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Western reporters staying at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad
saw explosions in nearby areas known to have palaces, a
headquarters of the Special Security service and the command center
for the Popular Army, which is a paramilitary force.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks, but it did not issue further official casualty
figures for the third round in the assault.
	   On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more
people were killed and 21 wounded in a missile attack on the
Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The report said an agricultural training center and a number of
houses were damaged.
	   INA also referred later to a march held Saturday for 68 people
killed in the U.S. and British attacks, but Mohsen al-Tarfa, deputy
director of the government press center, said that was wrong and
the 68 dead were victims of U.N. sanctions.
	   Iraq has complained that thousands have died because limited
medicines have entered the country under the sanctions.
	   Meanwhile, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by
the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.

Fifty arrested, three police hurt in clashes at exhibit on Nazi

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) - Police arrested 50 people for identity
checks and three police were slightly injured Saturday when
rightists clashed with leftist demonstrators at an exhibition on
the activities of Hitler's military.
	   Police said about 150 young rightists showed up to demonstrate
against the exhibit titled ``War of extermination: Crimes of the
Wehrmacht from 1941 to 1944.''
	   About 2,000 anti-rightists, including from labor unions and the
Greens party, held a counter demonstration and the opposing sides
scuffled with each other on several occasions, police said.
	   Three officers received scratches and bruises breaking up the
clashes, police said.
	   Hanover police chief Hans-Dieter Klosa originally banned the
rightist demonstration on Tuesday fearing violence with leftists
after the National Party of Germany applied for permission to hold
the rally.
	   However, the party appealed the ban and the High State
Administrative Court in Lueneburg overturned it on Friday.
	   The exhibit, which has been traveling to cities in Germany and
Austria over the past three years, uses photographs and documents
to show that ordinary German soldiers killed Jews and other
civilians under Hitler's rule of terror.
	   Many older Germans still view the Wehrmacht as an honorable
force that fought for the homeland. And thousands of neo-Nazis
demonstrated against the traveling exhibit in March 1997 during its
Munich installation - although it has often been displayed without
incident.

	   The United States and Britain launched a series of air strikes
overnight Wednesday to punish Iraq for its alleged obstruction of
U.N. weapons inspectors seeking evidence of the country's weapons
of mass destruction.

Iranians celebrate soccer victory in Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Tens of thousands of Iranians, many with
faces painted in the colors of the Iranian flag, took to the
streets Saturday to celebrate their victory as Asian Games soccer
champions.
	   The fans, mostly young men, congregated on Tehran street corners
playing the trumpet, some dancing in the streets.
	   Despite being down to 10 men, Iran dominated Gulf rival Kuwait
2-0 Saturday to capture the gold medal for soccer.
	   Many of Iran's major cities came to a standstill during the
game, played in Bangkok, Thailand.
	   It was the second Asian Games title for Iran, which beat North
Korea for the gold in 1990.
	   Midfielder Ali Karimi and Karim Bagheri scored the winning goals
in the first half.
	   In the 33rd minute, Iran was reduced to 10 men when defender
Mehdi Mahdavikia was sent off after a high-boot interception that
brought down Kuwait's Muhammad Ben Haji.
	   Iran brought a side packed with World Cup veterans. Their
experience showed throughout the three-week soccer competition
among 23 original teams. Tiny Oman upset the Iranians in the second
round, but Iran otherwise dominated its matches.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's main downtown streets to denounce the
American and British air strikes on Iraq.
	   Before small, violent groups were brought under control, they
had trashed the American ambassador's residence and gotten into
American and British cultural centers, where they scattered library
books and damaged furniture.
	   The rioting persisted on and off for more than six hours around
the buildings, which were largely unmanned because they do not open
for business on Saturday.
	   Syrian security forces struggled to stop the rioting, which
appeared to involve mainly university students and youth groups.
	   At one point, Syrian forces tried to bring in a water truck to
break up the crowd outside the ambassador's house with hoses. But
the truck's way was blocked by protesters who lay down in the
street in its path.

Turkish Premier-designate to return mandate Monday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ After failing to bring together political
rivals in a coalition, Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit announced
Saturday that he was returning his mandate to the Turkish
president.
	   In a statement reported by the Anatolia news agency, Ecevit said
he would see President Suleyman Demirel Monday morning.
	   Ecevit, a veteran leftist, was called on to form a cabinet over
two weeks ago after Mesut Yilmaz' coalition government collapsed in
a no-confidence vote in Parliament. Deputies accused Yilmaz, who
has since been serving as acting premier, of entertaining ties with
the mob and tampering with the sale of a state bank.
	   Refusing any alliance with the pro-Islamic Virtue Party,
Turkey's largest party in Parliament, Ecevit was unable to create a
political alliance strong enough to survive a confidence vote in
the deeply divided legislature.
	   Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two
rival center-right wing parties -- one led by Yilmaz, the other by
former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. Ecevut's alternate efforts to
make a minority coalition with outside backing for his Democratic
Left Party from Parliament also failed.
	   Demirel will now have to either ask someone else to try to form
a government or wait until Jan. 10, when the constitution allows
him to appoint a caretaker cabinet to lead the country to
parliamentary elections, now scheduled for April. Such a cabinet
would not have to face a confidence vote.
	   Or Demirel could choose to leave the current caretaker
government, headed by Yilmaz, in power until the elections.

Albanians &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with statements from international
officials in Pristina; relatives recover bodies of Albanians killed
on the border.
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials demanded
unity Saturday from the leaders of Kosovo's independence-minded
ethnic Albanians, saying that was a necessary condition for any
fruitful talks with the Serbian government.
	   French and Austrian diplomats led a group of international
officials to the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders, in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and more moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``We want to give a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side
(that) it's time now to start real negotiating at a broad base ...
that represents all the Kosovo Albanian political forces,'' said
Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's Ambassador to Belgrade. ``We are
still short of a real and definite commitment that will lead to a
concrete forming of such a team.''
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, Jacques Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head
of the Albanian negotiating team in the southern Serbian province.
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia. The KLA is determined to fight for full independence.
	   ``Time is running out and everybody must make some efforts for
reopening the door for political process. We hope the door will be
open ... in the next days,'' Huntzinger said.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and Russia _
also attended the talks and later met with KLA spokesman, Adem
Demaci.
	   The KLA previously have been barred from political negotiations
because of their continued military activity. Petritsch challenged
the Kosovo Albanian side to ``come up with a solution to this.''
	   He added ``there are positive signals that the KLA is realizing
... that they have to decide whether to continue on the military
path or if they want to join political negotiating process.''
	   The talks come on the heels of what has been the bloodiest week
in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people have been
killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting
escalated early this year.
	   Just outside of Pristina Saturday, hundreds of Serbs attended
the burial of Zvonko Bojanic, a municipal leader who was brutally
killed. Bojanic's body was found dumped along a roadside early
Friday, badly beaten, and shot between the eyes, with multiple
fracture wounds.
	   The Serbs blame the KLA for the killing, but Demaci has denied
the rebels were involved in the killing, suggesting Serbian secret
police may have been behind it.
	   ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of the Serbian
regime,'' said Demaci.
	   Serbian police said, however, that the five assailants who broke
into Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA
uniforms.
	   Also Saturday, relatives of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla
fighters killed in a border clash on Monday recovered the bodies
from the Serb-run morgue in Prizren and were preparing to bury them
in a collective ceremony on Sunday.

Balloon team sails over Libya and out over Mediterranean
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Libya almost thwarting trip, Trims &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson and his crew soared
over Libya and out across the Mediterranean on Saturday, heading
for Turkey _ and avoiding Iraq _ on day two of their quest to
circle the globe in a balloon.
	   Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate Per
Lindstrand were ``laughing and joking'' and in ``great shape,'' on
Saturday, said Jackie McQuillan, spokesman for ICO Global, a mobile
telephone company supporting the trip.
	   The balloon sailed into Libyan airspace from Algeria on Saturday
morning and then out over the Mediterranean Sea at a speed of about
130 miles (210 kilometers) per hour late in the afternoon.
	   A last-minute decision Friday evening by Libya to rescind
permission to fly over its territory almost thwarted the trip, but
intense diplomacy won a reprieve and finally Libya gave the green
light for the balloon to enter its airspace Saturday.
	   Branson, who had a sore throat Saturday morning, felt well by
the afternoon, said McQuillan, who spoke to him on several
occasions throughout the day via satellite telephone.
	   All three adventurers were surviving on a diet of vitamin-packed
food packages of the kind that astronauts eat in space.
	   The crew does have a Christmas pudding, a traditional British
Christmas dessert on board for the upcoming holiday. It was not
clear whether they would be able to pour brandy over the pudding
and light it as is the custom in Britain.
	   After passing over the Mediterranean and eastern Cyprus on
Saturday night, the 200-foot-high (61-meter) balloon was to cross
into Turkish airspace at the border with Syria about 50 miles from
Iraq.
	   Most of Sunday will be spent flying over Turkey before the
balloon heads up to the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and
Kazakstan before skirting the Himalayas on its way to China.
	   The balloon cruised at about 28,000 feet Saturday, McQuillan
said in a telephone interview.
	   Good weather, a good wind and a cloudless sky have helped the
travelers in their attempt to become the first to circle the globe
in a balloon.
	   The balloon took off from a Moroccan airforce base outside
Marrakech on Friday morning.
	   After crossing the Atlas mountains, the balloon crossed into
Algerian airspace where the balloon continued its course overnight
before entering Libyan airspace.
	   Branson and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits,
expressed confidence in the trip, estimating it could last from
eight days to nearly three weeks.
	   The U.S. missile strike on Iraq has complicated the task.
	   The missile strike means the team has to find the winds to take
them north of Iraq through Turkey instead of cutting over Saudi
Arabia.
	   Branson and his crew hope to touch down somewhere in Europe at
the end of a 24,000-mile flight which will take them over Saudi
Arabia, India, the South China sea, the Pacific ocean and the
United States.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and had only four refusals - Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe. Branson has
tried, and failed, four times to become the first person to trek
the globe in a balloon.
	   The crew is more confident this time because of improved
technology used to make the balloon, including a Kevlar canopy over
the crew's pressurized capsule. Kevlar is used for bulletproof
vests.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon - from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

European Union pursues dialogue with Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The European Union is to pursue a
``comprehensive dialogue'' with Iran, including issues of human
rights, international terrorism and the Middle East peace process,
media reported Saturday.
	   Albert Rohan, general secretary of the Austrian foreign ministry
met Friday with Iran's vice-foreign minister Morteza Samadi in
Vienna. A German and British representative also attended the
meeting.
	   Major points to feature in discussions include human rights,
international terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, as well as
the Middle East peace process.
	   Economic support for Iran is also up for discussion, but
presents problems, Rohan said, largely because the EU does not have
an economic agreement with Iran.
	   Special funds for fighting drug smuggling and caring for
refugees in Iran, however, are under consideration, Die Presse
daily reported.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency and Germany
will take over early next year.

Japanese leader strikes deal with minority party to hatch coalition
</HEADLINE>
Cabinet
 &UR; By MARI YAMAGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi announced late
Saturday a formal agreement to launch a coalition government with a
minority opposition party in a move designed to ease the passage of
key legislation.
	   The political deal, which calls for eliminating two Cabinet
posts to signal a commitment to government streamlining, follows a
tentative accord reached last month.
	   It forges a link between Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party and
the Liberal Party headed by bigwig pol Ichiro Ozawa, who bolted
from the ranks of the LDP in 1993. The move appeared likely to give
the government a stronger hand in Parliament to pass promised
economic stimulus measures.
	   Prime Minister Obuchi has come under increasing pressure both at
home and abroad to jump start his nation's economy, which is stuck
in its worst recession since World War II.
	   ``We have agreed to work together to seek ways to overcome these
difficult times,'' Obuchi said at a hastily-arranged midnight news
conference following last minute talks with the Liberal Party.
	   ``And I'm confident that we can solve tough issues through our
coalition.''
	   A new coalition government will be launched before the next
regular Parliamentary session begins in mid-January, Obuchi said.
He did not specify what changes would be made when the Cabinet is
reshuffled _ or which posts would be eliminated by shrinking the
number of ministers from 20 to 18.
	   Liberal Party head Ozawa made it clear at a separate news
conference that his party wants to be fully represented in the
Cabinet, however.
	   ``It's a coalition Cabinet, so I'm relying on common sense,'' he
said of his party's expectations for ministerial posts.
	   The Liberal Party's 93 seats in the more powerful 500-seat lower
house of Parliament, added to the ruling Liberal Democrats' 262
seats, will assure swift passage of bills. It will also give the
governing party a boost in the upper house, where it lacks a
majority.
	   With the backing of the Liberal Party, Obuchi's ruling LDP is
betting it can attract enough independent lawmaker votes in the
upper house to override any objections made by opposition party
forces.
	   The two parties are both viewed as conservative forces in
Parliament. Many Liberal Party lawmakers were once members of the
Liberal Democratic Party.
	   Ozawa originally left the ruling party five years ago, vowing to
offer a real opposition alternative and end the Liberal Democrats'
four decades of political dominance.
	   Although Ozawa was a key backer of reform-oriented
administrations in 1993-94, he was viewed as too closely linked
with the old-style ruling party kingpins to gain much popularity
among voters.
	   In his talks with Prime Minister Obuchi, Ozawa initially played
hard to get by demanding a reduction in the number of Cabinet posts
to 17 and the temporary abolition of an unpopular national sales
tax.
	   But the tax issue eventually was dropped and the LDP simply
agreed to ``review'' other policy reforms pushed by Ozawa such as a
re-interpretation of national defense guidelines.
	   The Asahi Shimbun, a major daily, warned in an editorial in its
early Sunday edition that the coalition could bode a turn to the
political right in the formulation of government policies.
	   ``There is a danger the coalition may shift government policy on
issues such as national security and interpretation of the
constitution'' toward a more conservative view, the paper said.

Composition of new Algerian government announced
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algeria's new Prime Minister announced
the composition of his Cabinet on Saturday, and it looks a lot like
the previous government.
	   The program of the new government is expected to be presented
before the Algerian parliament in less than a week.
	   President Liamine Zeroual will keep control of the Defense
Ministry, and Ahmed Attaf also remains Foreign Minister in the new
government.
	   Prime Minister Smail Hamdani, a former diplomat, announced that
the new Interior Minister would be Abdelmalek Sella, a former
ambassador and specialist in security issues. He replaces Mustapha
Benmansour, who was accused of electoral fraud.
	   The new Justice Minister will be Ahmed Noui, who replaces
Mohamed Adami, while the Finance Minister remains Abdelkrim
Harchaoui.
	   Hamdani was named Prime Minister after the widely unpopular
Ahmed Ouyahia resigned from the post earlier this month.
	   The new government will be responsible for preparing early
presidential elections, which Zeroual has called for April.
	   Preparations for an Organization of African Unity summit in
Algiers in May or June also should fall upon his government.
	   Zeroual, whose five-year term ends in 2000, announced in
September plans to step down early.
	   Ouyahia, who served as prime minister for three years, has been
roundly criticized for fraud in November 1997 local elections,
failing to improve the economy or end a Muslim insurgency.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have been killed in violence since
the start of the insurgency in 1992, triggered by the army's
decision to cancel legislative elections a Muslim fundamentalist
party was on the verge of winning.

Fourth wave of strikes under way as offensive continues

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns shot bright flashes into
the Baghdad sky on Saturday night, an indication that the fourth
wave of punishing U.S. and British air strikes was underway.
	   Gun batteries on rooftops sent tracer shells streaking across
the sky shortly after dusk as Muslims were breaking their fast on
the first day of the holy month of Ramadan. The guns began firing
minutes after sirens wailed across the capital.
	   In Washington, a White House official said a fourth wave of air
strikes had begun.
	   Iraq has been taking a beating since overnight
Wednesday-Thursday, when U.S. and British forces launched an air
offensive to punish Iraq for obstructing the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the previous three nights of
airstrikes was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center
of the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and
offices of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Western reporters staying at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad
saw explosions the previous night in nearby areas known to have
palaces, a headquarters of the Special Security service and the
command center for the Popular Army, which is a paramilitary force.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks, but it did not issue further official casualty
figures.
	   On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi News Agency said five
additional people had been killed overnight and 21 wounded in a
missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of
Kirkuk.
	   The report said an agricultural training center and a number of
houses were damaged.
	   Meanwhile, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by
the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   The thunderous attacks overnight Friday-Saturday were not
preceded by air raid sirens, implying that for the first time the
strikes eluded Iraqi air defenses.
	   When the reverberations from the explosions subsided at about
4:45 a.m. (0145 GMT), the winter air filled with the sounds of
muezzins calling from mosque loudspeakers, informing Muslims to eat
their last meal before beginning the first day of fasting for
Ramadan.
	   U.S. and British officials reported that more than 100 targets
had been hit. Iraq's Republican Guard was a major focus of the
third night of bombing, British officials said.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice.
	   ``We will not let evil triumph over virtue,'' he said.
	   State-run newspapers on Saturday echoed Saddam's theme. A banner
headline in the Al-Jumhuriya daily read: ``We shall resist and
fight in the name of God.''
	   On Saturday, officials at the Oil Ministry said that crude
exports under the U.N. approved oil-for-food program were
continuing despite the military attacks.
	   The officials said an average of 1.8 million barrels per day
were going out through Mina al-Bakr port and terminals at the
Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to
lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten
its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   The trigger for the U.S.-British attack was a report by U.N.
weapons inspectors that Iraq was not cooperating with U.N.-mandated
checks in Iraq for signs of banned weapons programs. The
inspectors, who had been working in the country since 1991,
withdrew from the country on Wednesday.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the U.N. Security Council
cannot lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Baghdad has complained that thousands of Iraqis have died
because limited medicine has entered the country under the
sanctions.
	   The United Nation's efforts to relieve hardships caused by the
sanctions received a severe blow with the evacuation Friday of 106
international staffers of a program to monitor food aid to the
Iraqis.

Investigation: Shevardnadze's attackers trained in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The participants in a February
assassination attempt against Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze were trained at a terrorist camp in Russia's breakaway
region of Chechnya, the official investigation concluded Saturday.
	   Gigla Agulashvili, the deputy director of the investigative
department of the Georgian Prosecutor's office, said that 18
terrorists had taken part: 12 Georgian citizens and 6 citizens of
other countries.
	   He said they had been trained for several months in a region of
Chechnya that was not under control of the Chechen government at
the time. Chechen law enforcement officials aided in the
investigation, he said.
	   Shevardnadze was unhurt in the attack on Feb. 9, when gunmen
showered his motorcade in the capital Tbilisi with grenades and
automatic weapons-fire. Two of Shevardnadze's guards were killed.
	   Shevardnadze blamed the attack on followers of Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it became independent in 1991.
Gamsakhurdia was ousted in early 1992 and he died in mysterious
circumstances in 1994.

Israeli helicopters raid suspected guerrilla bases in Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hezbollah saying two guerrillas killed

<TEXT>
	   TYRE, Lebanon (AP) _ Two guerrillas have been killed in
overnight clashes with Israeli troops in southern Lebanon, the
Hezbollah militant group said Saturday.
	   Israeli helicopter gunships repeatedly attacked suspected
guerrilla bases overnight, Lebanese security officials said. The
air raids occurred near Majdel Selim, about 25 kilometers (15
miles) east of the port of Tyre.
	   A statement by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah said Wafik Zahwi,
22, and Abdul Rasoul Baydoun, 21, were killed ``confronting the
enemy'' near an Israeli outpost.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said at least two
Hezbollah guerrillas were killed and several more injured in the
central sector of the Israeli-occupied zone of southern Lebanon.
	   The guerrillas were apparently laying explosives when the
clashes occurred, the spokesman said, adding no Israeli soldiers
were injured.
	   On Saturday, Israeli troops and the Lebanese guerrillas
exchanged artillery and mortar fire around Sojod, about 22
kilometers (14 miles) southeast of the port city of Sidon, Lebanese
officials said.
	   Also, the pro-Israeli militia, the South Lebanon Army, fired
mortars and 155mm howitzers at villages facing the occupied zone,
the officials said. The villages are believed to be used only by
guerrillas.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties in these
exchanges.
	   Hezbollah and other guerrilla factions are fighting to drive
some 1,500 Israeli troops and their 2,500 militia allies out of
Lebanon.
	   Israel set up the occupied zone in 1985 as a buffer against
guerrilla attacks on its northern territory.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters attacked the U.S.
and British embassies in Damascus on Saturday as tens of thousands
of Syrians took to the city's main downtown streets to denounce the
American and British air strikes on Iraq.
	   Before small, violent groups were brought under control, they
had trashed the American ambassador's residence and gotten into
American and British cultural centers, where they scattered library
books and damaged furniture.
	   The rioting persisted on and off for more than six hours around
the buildings, which were largely unmanned because they do not open
for business on Saturday.
	   Syrian security forces struggled to stop the rioting, which
appeared to involve mainly university students and youth groups.
	   At one point, Syrian forces tried to bring in a water truck to
break up the crowd outside the ambassador's house by spraying
protesters with hoses. But the truck's way was blocked by
protesters who lay down in its path.

Two thirds of NATO extraction force already in Macedonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Two thirds of a 1,800-man NATO force to
be deployed as protection for unarmed international verifiers in
Kosovo, haa already been deployed in Macedonia, a spokesman for the
mission said Saturday.
	   Lt. Col. Andrew Venus said about 650 French, 200 Italian, 150
British and 100 German and Dutch troops, have arrived. The
remaining 600 soldiers will arrive by the end of December or first
week of January 1999.
	   The soldiers are based in barracks of the Macedonian army in the
border town of Kumanovo, western Macedonian town of Tetovo and
Petrovec airport in the capital Skopje.
	   The still-forming observers mission in Kosovo is tasked with
monitoring a shaky truce in the volatile Yugoslav province. The
NATO mission is supposed to provide protection in case the
estimated 2,000 verifiers run into trouble in Kosovo.
	   Kosovo is a predominantly ethnic Albanian province in Serbia,
the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. Macedonia borders Kosovo.

German firm wins auction to buy Gazprom shares
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES attribution, UPDATES with government plans on
privatization in new final 3 grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Germany's Ruhrgas has won an auction to buy 2.5
percent of shares in Russia's Gazprom monopoly, the Federal
Property Fund announced Saturday.
	   Ruhrgas offered to pay dlrs 660 million, dlrs 9 million above
the government's minimum bidding price of dlrs 651 million.
	   The second highest bidder for shares in the world's largest gas
company, Interoil France Ltd., offered to pay dlrs 651.5 million,
said Igor Shuvalov, chairman of the Federal Property Fund, which is
responsible for privatization.
	   The government has been trying to boost its revenues through
privatization, but was recently forced to cancel planned auctions
of the oil company Rosneft and the telecommunications concern
Svyazinvest because of lack of interest.
	   Anticipated proceeds from the Gazprom sale have already been
included in the government's revenues in the final quarter of 1998.
	   The government holds 40 percent of Gazprom shares, with private
investors in Russia and abroad holding the remaining shares. The
government had put off the sale of a Gazprom stake after the
company's share prices plunged in the wake of the August
devaluation of the ruble.
	   The government plans to sell up to 5 percent of Gazprom shares,
but has not yet announced when it will offer the additional 2.5
percent.
	   After repeated setbacks and a few scandals this year, Russia's
privatization program will be redefined in 1999, said Deputy
Minister for State Property, Alexander Braverman.
	   ``It won't have just a fiscal character,'' Braverman told
reporters. ``There will be an emphasis on investment, and the
government won't be motivated by just short-term budget revenues.''
	   The government is also looking at expanding to new privatization
methods, such as sales through the issuance of convertible bonds,
Braverman said.

Opposition says Iraq sends troops south for possible Shiite revolt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has put
Iraq's southern provinces on maximum alert and deployed thousands
of elite troops to head off a possible revolt by Shiite Muslims,
dissidents and travelers said Saturday.
	   The Iraqi leader also has armed tens of thousands of members of
the ruling Baath Party to guard government offices in Baghdad and
other towns in fear a rebellion could be set off by U.S. and
British airstrikes aimed at the country, they said.
	   The dissidents and travelers, who spoke from Jordan and Syria on
condition of anonymity, said elite Republican Guard divisions were
sent to the provinces of Basra, Nasirriya and Imara, where they
maintained Shiite rebels already were staging an insurgency.
	   Some troops, their tanks and artillery have been stationed in
date palm groves along the 500-kilometer (335-mile) highway from
Basra to Baghdad, they said.
	   There was no way to immediately confirm the reports. Baghdad has
made no mention of the troop deployment, but Iraqi officials have
voiced concern the American and British attacks may be aimed at
destabilizing Saddam's regime and paving the way for a rebellion.
	   Southern Iraq was the site of fierce fighting in the aftermath
of the 1991 Gulf War when the Iraqi military crushed an uprising by
Shiite Muslim rebels. Iraqi opposition groups in London have said
fighting has flared again there in recent months.
	   Hamdi al-Bayati, a spokesman in London for the Supreme Council
of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, said some of the guard units in
the area have been engaged in fighting with Shiite rebels in Imara
since Thursday.
	   He said fighting was still raging in and around the marsh areas
of al-Iz and Umm al-Naaj in the province.
	   The reported security steps follow U.S. and British airstrikes
which began Thursday to punish Iraq for its obstruction of U.N.
inspectors searching for evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said he ordered the series of
airstrikes to destroy Iraqi ``military and security'' targets.
	   On Friday, Saddam said he would not ``compromise or kneel'' in
the showdown with U.S. and British military forces.
	   Addressing the nation on television for the first time since the
airstrikes began, Saddam told Iraqis: ``Continue your resistance
and, by God's will, you will be victorious.''
	   But the travelers and dissidents said the Iraqi authorities have
shown considerable nervousness since the bombardment started and
have imposed strict security measures.
	   Among measures they've taken are stopping and turning back many
travelers heading from Baghdad to the southern provinces on the
main highway, they said. The travelers are stopped at military
checkpoints, a permanent feature along the road.

British attack Republican Guard installations; Blair says campaign
</HEADLINE>
'on course' &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Blair news conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. and British forces are ``well on course to
meet our objectives,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday, but
he said attacks in Iraq would continue until military goals are
achieved.
	   British jets based in Kuwait were joining in a fourth day of
attacks, Blair confirmed.
	   ``As well as the military dimension we are already in discussion
with our colleagues and allies and partners around the world as to
how we adopt a forward strategy to insure that three is containment
and stability in the long term,'' he said at a brief news
conference at 10 Downing St., his official residence.
	   Earlier, British officials showed videotapes of bomb hits on
Republican Guard facilities in southern Iraq, and emphasized that
the Guard was a key target of the operation.
	   ``Those are the people that surround him, keep him in office,
have their own system of repression, and of course have been
instrumental in putting together the means of concealing the
weapons of mass destruction,'' Blair said.
	   Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, chief of the defense staff, estimated
that the attacks on Friday night and Saturday morning achieved 75
percent of their objectives, without losing any of Britain's 12
Kuwait-based Tornado fighter-bombers.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson, who joined Guthrie at a news
briefing, said the Republican Guard was targeted because of its
role in protecting Saddam as well as guarding the chemical and
biological weapons programs which are the prime targets of the
U.S-British operation.
	   ``We want the Republican Guard to know that the cozy life they
have led under Saddam is under attack,'' Robertson said.
	   Britain released video images of laser-guided bombs hitting
Republican Guard facilities at Al Kut, 100 miles (160 kms)
southeast of Baghdad, and the nearby Muhammad Al Amin garrison.
	   Guthrie said leaflets dropped by U.S. and British planes in Iraq
had warned the regular army to stay out of the conflict. He said
the message was ``Keep out of this, you are not our targets, remain
in your barracks.''
	   ``And I think it is a message which has got across,'' Guthrie
said. He added that there had been no reports of Iraqi aircraft
challenging the attacking forces.
	   Blair, in an interview with the BBC World Service earlier
Saturday, said the United States and Britain had struck against
Saddam ``because we genuinely believe the stability of the world is
at risk if this man's allowed to get back out of his cage.'' said
he regretted civilian casualties but said the military operation
was necessary.
	   ``If we hadn't taken action now then he knows we lack the will
to prevent him developing these weapons,'' Blair added.

European Union pursues dialogue with Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The European Union is to pursue a
``comprehensive dialogue'' with Iran, including issues of human
rights, international terrorism and the Middle East peace process,
media reported Saturday.
	   Albert Rohan, general secretary of the Austrian foreign ministry
met Friday with Iran's vice-foreign minister Morteza Samadi in
Vienna. A German and British representative also attended the
meeting.
	   Major points to be discussed included human rights,
international terrorism, weapons of mass destruction and the Middle
East peace process.
	   Economic support for Iran is also up for discussion, but
presents problems, Rohan said, largely because the EU does not have
an economic agreement with Iran.
	   Special funds for fighting drug smuggling and caring for
refugees in Iran, however, are under consideration, Die Presse
daily reported.
	   Austria currently holds the rotating EU presidency and Germany
will take over early next year.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Concluding an election campaign
marred by violence and a high-profile political assassination, St.
Petersburg voters were set to decide Sunday who would govern their
city.
	   The second round of voting for the city council is considered
key for Russia's democratic politicians, whose popularity has been
dented by the country's roiling economic crisis. Just six of 50
seats were decided in the first round two weeks ago.
	   Many see the St. Petersburg poll as a first battle in a long
political season leading to national parliamentary elections next
year and elections to replace President Boris Yeltsin in 2000.
	   At stake is not just leadership of the northern port, but also
control over millions of dollars worth of privatization and budget
revenues in the city. St. Petersburg is Russia's second largest
city and a traditional stronghold of support for the country's
democrats.
	   In spite of this reputation, intrigue and violence have blighted
the campaign. One candidate was beaten with metal rods. A gunman
shot out the windows of a city council member's apartment with an
assault rifle. Observers reported vote-buying, in exchange for
money or vodka.
	   The most shocking violence came on Nov. 20, when unidentified
gunmen shot and killed the city's top democratic politician, Galina
Starovoitova. An aide was critically wounded with two gunshots to
the head and neck.
	   Starovoitova's assassination galvanized St. Petersburg. Turnout
for the first round was twice as large as expected and democratic
candidates seem poised to win a majority in the city council as a
result.
	   ``The killing has elevated this to a higher level,'' said Leonid
Kesselman, a sociologist and political columnist.
	   ``It's no longer about local elections, but a symbol of what
will begin in Russia next year.''

BAGHDAD: Gulf War.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Before Ramadan began speaking, gun batteries on rooftops sent
tracer shells streaking across the sky shortly after sundown, as
Muslims were breaking their fast on the first day of the holy
fasting month of Ramadan. The guns began firing minutes after
sirens wailed across the capital.
	   In Washington, a White House official said a fourth wave of
airstrikes had begun.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the previous nights of
airstrikes was heavy and that a number of buildings in the center
of the capital _ including palaces, security headquarters and
offices of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   Western reporters staying at Al-Rashid Hotel in central Baghdad
saw explosions the previous night in nearby areas known to have
palaces, a headquarters of the Special Security service and the
command center for the Popular Army, which is a paramilitary force.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Iraq says 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the first two
nights of attacks, but it did not issue further official casualty
figures.
	   On Saturday, the state-run Iraqi News Agency said five
additional people had been killed overnight and 21 wounded in a
missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the northern town of
Kirkuk.
	   The report said an agricultural training center and a number of
houses were damaged.
	   Meanwhile, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by
the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   The thunderous attacks overnight Friday-Saturday were not
preceded by air raid sirens, implying that for the first time the
strikes eluded Iraqi air defenses.
	   When the reverberations from the explosions subsided at about
4:45 a.m. (0145 GMT), the winter air filled with the sounds of
muezzins calling from mosque loudspeakers, informing Muslims to eat
their last meal before beginning the first day of fasting for
Ramadan.
	   U.S. and British officials reported that more than 100 targets
had been hit. Iraq's Republican Guard was a major focus of the
third night of bombing, British officials said.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice.
	   ``We will not let evil triumph over virtue,'' he said.
	   State-run newspapers on Saturday echoed Saddam's theme. A banner
headline in the Al-Jumhuriya daily read: ``We shall resist and
fight in the name of God.''
	   On Saturday, officials at the Oil Ministry said that crude
exports under the U.N. approved oil-for-food program were
continuing despite the military attacks.
	   The officials said an average of 1.8 million barrels per day
were going out through Mina al-Bakr port and terminals at the
Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea. They spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to
lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten
its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   The trigger for the U.S.-British attack was the chief U.N.
weapons inspectors' report that Iraq was not cooperating with
U.N.-mandated checks in Iraq for signs of banned weapons programs.
The inspectors, who had been working in the country since 1991,
withdrew from the country on Wednesday.
	   Until the U.N. Special Commission certifies that Iraq is free of
biological and chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the U.N.
Security Council cannot lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Baghdad has complained that thousands of Iraqis have died
because limited medicine has entered the country under the
sanctions.
	   The United Nation's efforts to relieve hardships caused by the
sanctions received a severe blow with the evacuation Friday of 106
international staffers of a program to monitor food aid to the
Iraqis.

Chelsea goes top as Manchester United loses at home to Boro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Chelsea soared to the top of the Premier League
for the first time in nine years Saturday after a 2-0 victory over
Tottenham while Manchester United slumped 3-2 at home to
Middlesbrough.
	   Uruguayan star Gustavo Poyet and Norwegian striker Tore Andre
fired the goals at Stamford Bridge as Gianluca Vialli's team, which
scored a 1-1 tie at Manchester United on Wednesday, came up with an
even better result against Spurs.
	   Chelsea took advantage of the fact that leader Aston Villa is
not in action until it goes to Charlton on Monday and went above
Villa on goal difference with both teams on 33 points.
	   United fell 3-0 down at home to Middlesbrough which won at Old
Trafford for the first time since January 1930. A Boro team managed
by former Reds star Bryan Robson raced into a three-goal lead
through Colombian striker Hamilton Ricard, Dean Gordon and Brian
Deane before Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes replied.
	   The loss means that Manchester United still hasn't won in five
games since Brian Kidd quit as assistant manager to move to
Blackburn.
	   Middlesbrough, promoted last season, moved up one to fourth
place and is only three points off the lead and a point behind
United.
	   Arsenal hosts Leeds on Sunday so that West Ham moved up to sixth
by scoring a 2-1 victory over Everton. French midfielder Marc
Keller scored with a floating cross from the right and Trevor
Sinclair netted with a diving header. Danny Cadamateri replied for
Everton.
	   Liverpool's worst run for 44 years ended with a 2-0 victory over
Sheffield Wednesday at Anfield with goals from Czech forward Patrik
Berger and Michael Owen, his 13th of the season. The victory moved
Liverpool up three places to ninth.
	   Southampton climbed off last place with a 3-1 victory over
Wimbledon at the Dell, where Norwegian forward Egil Ostenstad
scored twice and Hassan Kachhoul, a Moroccan on trial at the club,
added the other.
	   The victory means that Nottingham Forest slipped to last after
conceding an equalizer in the third minute of injury time at home
to Blackburn. Rovers' Nathan Blake scored his second of the game
after Steve Chettle and Dougie Freedman had given Forest a 2-0
lead. Blackburn is second from last, with two points more than
Forest.
	   Coventry squandered a first half lead and was held 1-1 at home
by Derby and is only four points off last place, third from last.
	   Instead of fielding its 22 million pound (dlrs 36.7 million)
strikeforce of Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson, Newcastle didn't
have either on the starting lineup in the 1-0 victory over
Leicester at St. James Park.
	   Ferguson was sidelined through injury and Shearer, who has
missed six games with hamstring trouble, made a second half
appearance as a substitute although it was Scottish midfielder
Stephen Glass who scored the winner.
	   Sunderland increased its lead atop division one to 11 points
after a 0-0 tie at Birmingham. Second place Ipswich is in action
Sunday against Sheffield United.
	   Scottish league leader Rangers scored a 3-2 win at Hearts after
falling behind at Tynecastle. French World Cup striker Stephane
Guivarc'h scored twice and Rod Wallace netter his 16th of the
season.
	   Second place Kilmarnock plays Sunday against Dundee United and
will need to win to cut Rangers six-point lead. Defending titlist
Celtic remains third even after a 5-0 crushing of last place
Dunfermline with two goals each from Swedish striker Henrik Larsson
and Skovakia's Lubomir Moravcik and one from another Swede, Johan
Mjallby

 &UR; Servicemen focus on attacking Iraq, not Clinton

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Their president may be under
fire at home, but he is receiving no flak from U.S. military
personnel in the Gulf.
	   ``President (Bill) Clinton is commander-in-chief ... and he's
the best commander-in-chief there is, until the powers that be
decide differently,'' said Lt. Paul Fermo, a rescue helicopter
pilot on the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the centerpiece of
the battle group that has led the air attacks on Iraq.
	   Aboard the vessel, the impeachment proceedings in Washington are
far away: in geography and in mind set. Airmen and others say they
have no time to worry about politics while they are mounting
airstrikes.
	   And _ in public at least _ they pledge full support to the chain
of command, which ends with Clinton as commander-in-chief of U.S.
military forces.
	   ``He is our leader until proven wrong,'' said rescue helicopter
pilot Lt. Greg Lealand of Marlboro, Massachusetts.
	   Cmdr. Will Cooney, an F-14 pilot from Virginia Beach, Virginia,
said he is quite capable of separating military orders from
political developments.
	   ``Whatever's going on back in the House, it has no bearing on
what we're doing out here,'' he said.
	   But there were sharp rebukes for one politically linked
suggestion: that Clinton ordered the attacks to deflect attention
from the Republican Party-led impeachment drive.
	   ``No, not at all ... It's pure coincidence,'' said Marine Maj.
Ross Roberts, an F-18 pilot from Northport, New York.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Anti-American demonstrations to protest airstrikes
against Iraq were held in several French cities on Saturday.
	   At the call of leftist political organizations, several hundred
people gathered in Paris to protest the U.S.-led action against
Iraq.
	   Communist Party leader Robert Hue accused the French government
of timidity and urged that it take a firmer line in criticizing the
airstrikes.
	   Protests were also held in Nancy and Strasbourg in eastern
France.
	   In Paris on Friday night, about 500 people demonstrated against
the airstrikes. ``Immediately stop the bombings,'' and ``Clinton
killer.''

Culture minister, architect meet in Berlin over controversial
</HEADLINE>
memorial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) - Germany's new culture minister, who is embroiled
in disussions about a memorial in Berlin to victims of the Nazis,
met in the capital Saturday with a U.S. architect whose design for
the project was approved by the previous government, but has since
been questioned.
	   Minister Michael Naumann met behind closed doors with New York
architect Peter Eisenman, and neither commented after the meeting.
	   In an interview in Monday's Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper,
Naumann previously described Eisenman's design of 2,500 pillars in
a cemetery-like field of two hectares (5 acres) as a ``landscape of
stone.''
	   Despite the meeting, it appeared Eisenman was considering
dropping out of the project. The Berliner Zeitung daily on Saturday
quoted him as saying he would prefer not to join in developing a
compromise solution if the memorial were rejected.
	   Eisenman's design had previously won the approval of former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose conservative government was ousted by
a center-left coalition of Social Democrats and Greens in Sept. 27
elections.
	   New Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has charged Naumann with coming
up with a rapid solution to the memorial question and the culture
minister said in the Tagesspiegel interview that his new concept
aims above all at educating young people about the Holocaust.
	   He also said he wants to cooperate with Holocaust museums in
Washington and Jerusalem and the Leo Baeck Institute in New York in
setting up a Holocaust library and research center in Berlin as
well as a teaching museum.
	   Plans for a national Holocaust memorial have been in contention
for 10 years, with politicians and intellectuals arguing over
whether a single, giant sculpture could adequately represent an
atrocity so sweeping and horrific. Six million Jews were killed in
the Holocaust.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials demanded
unity Saturday from the leaders of Kosovo's pro-independence ethnic
Albanians as a necessary condition for any fruitful talks with the
Serbian government.
	   French and Austrian diplomats led a group of international
officials to the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders, in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and more moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``We want to give a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side
(that) it's time now to start real negotiating at a broad base ...
that represents all the Kosovo Albanian political forces,'' said
Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's Ambassador to Belgrade.
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, Jacques Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating team.
	   ``Time is running out and everybody must make some efforts for
reopening the door for political process. We hope the door will be
open ... in the next days,'' said Huntzinger.
	   Petritsch said they got a ``positive response'' from Agani,
``but we are still short of a real and definite commitment that
will lead to a concrete forming of such a team.''
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight
for full independence.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia _ also attended the talks and later met with KLA spokesman,
Adem Demaci.
	   Asked how and when the KLA might join political negotiations, in
which they have not previously been included because of their
continued military activity, Petritsch challenged the Kosovo
Albanian side to ``come up with a solution to this.''
	   He added ``there are positive signals that the KLA is realizing
... that they have to decide whether to continue on the military
path or if they want to join political negotiating process.''
	   The talks come on the heels of what has been the bloodiest week
in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people have been
killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting
escalated early last year.
	   Just outside of Pristina Saturday, hundreds of Serbs attended
the burial of Zvonko Bojanic, a municipal leader who was brutally
killed. Bojanic's body was found dumped along a roadside early
Friday, badly beaten, and shot between the eyes, with multiple
fracture wounds.
	   The Serbs blame the KLA for the killing, but Demaci has denied
the rebels were involved in the killing, suggesting Serbian secret
police may have been behind it.
	   Police Saturday organized a search for the men suspected of
carrying out the killing, a group of ``terrorists'' led by Sluejman
Selimi, known by his nom-de-guerre Sultan, the Pristina-based Serb
media center reported, citing a police source.
	   Also Saturday, relatives of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla
fighters killed in a border clash on Monday recovered the bodies
from the Serb-run morgue in Prizren and were preparing to bury them
in a collective ceremony on Sunday.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials demanded

ethnic Albanians, saying that was a necessary condition for any

concrete forming of such a team.''
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, Jacques Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head
of the Albanian negotiating team in the southern Serbian province.
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia. The KLA is determined to fight for full independence.
	   ``Time is running out and everybody must make some efforts for
reopening the door for political process. We hope the door will be
open ... in the next days,'' Huntzinger said.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _

	   The KLA previously have been barred from political negotiations

	   The Serbs blame the KLA for the killing, but Demaci has denied
the rebels were involved in the killing, suggesting Serbian secret
police may have been behind it.
	   ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of the Serbian
regime,'' said Demaci.
	   Serbian police said, however, that the five assailants who broke
into Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA
uniforms.
	   Police Saturday organized a search for the men suspected of
carrying out the killing, a group of ``terrorists'' led by Sluejman
Selimi, known by his nom-de-guerre Sultan, the Pristina-based Serb

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Jesper Mattsson and Andreas Karlson scored eight
minutes apart midway through the first period and led Sweden to a
2-1 victory over the Czech Republic in a battle of unbeatens at the
Baltika Cup Saturday.
	   The victory moved Sweden atop the five team standings with six
points from three games and dropped the Czechs to 2-0-1 with one
game remaining for each.
	   Sweden must play Russia (1-1-1) in Sunday's final games while
the Czechs have Canada (0-0-3).
	   The tournament is the third of four rounds of the Euro Hockey
Tour.
	   The Russians, which can finish second in the tournament with a
victory on Sunday, drew 2-2 with Finland earlier Saturday.
	   Mattsson gave Sweden the lead after only five minutes of play.
Karlson doubled the lead in the 13th minute,
	   Swedish goalkeeper Peter Ronnqvist held off the Czechs until
five minutes remained in the second period, when Jan Coloun cut the
lead in half.
	   Ronnqvist thwarted the Czechs on several breakaways the rest of
the way.
	   Earlier, Eric Kakko scored with five minutes remaining, two
minutes after Sergei Petrenko had given the Russia the lead for the
second time.
	   The draw finished Finland with a 1-1-2 record, assuring it
cannot finish any worse than fourth.
	   Alexei Chupin gave Russia the lead two minutes into the second
period, beeating Finnish keeper Meeka Kiprusoff.
	   Finland finally equalized with 10 minutes remaining the the game
when Lasse Pirjeta put in a rebound.
	   ``We are happy with this result,'' Finnish coach Hanno Aravirta
said. ``The most important result of this tournament is that we now
have information about the candidates for the World Championship,
and now we are sure that we have two good, young goalies.''

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Tens of thousands high school and university
students marched through Rome Saturday to protest initiatives to
funnel taxpayers' money to religious and other private schools.
	   ``No to financing for private schools, yes to textbooks free for
all!,'' said Communist leader Fausto Bertinotti, one of the
politicians leading the students in the peaceful protest.
	   The center-left coalition of Premier Massimo D'Alema, who is a
former Communist, is split over whether to back proposals for
funding for Catholic and other non-public schools.
	   Former Christian Democrats in the coalition are pressing for the
aid. The issue is expected to come up in January when D'Alema is
scheduled to have an audience with Pope John Paul II.
	   Students, who came from all over Italy in chartered buses, also
are demanding elimination of textbook fees in public schools.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, Arab protesters joined
Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   In a rare protest in the Syrian capital, thousands marched
through downtown Damascus Saturday, and about 1,000 people _ most
of them students _ attacked the U.S. Embassy, its nearby residence
and the American Cultural Center.
	   Rioters also threw stones at the British Embassy in Damascus and
broke into the British Council, where they damaged furniture and
scattered library books.
	   At the U.S. residence, more than 100 people climbed over the
wall, broke down the front door and stormed inside, destroying
everything in their path _ furniture, windows, the ambassador's
private office. They knocked books on the floor, and destroyed
kitchen cabinets and bookcases.
	   They also attacked the car of Ambassador Ryan Crocker,
shattering the lights and windows. Crocker's wife, Christine, was
in the house at the time but was not hurt.
	   At the embassy, U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas from the roof
to disperse the stone-throwing crowd. Three protesters managed to
enter the compound, climb the walls and haul down and burn the
American flag.
	   Syrian security forces dispersed the mobs after about six hours.
	   In Hebron in the West Bank, some 3,000 Palestinians defied a ban
from their leadership on pro-Iraq demonstrations, screaming ``Death
to Israel! Death to America!'' Clashes later with Israeli troops
firing rubber bullets left more than 100 Palestinians injured.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months in the
Palestinian lands.
	   In another demonstration in Jenin, about 2,500 Palestinians
approached the Jewish settlement of Ginat and threw stones at
Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Seven Palestinians were injured.

 &UR; U.S. official: no solution for Kosovo without democracy in Serbia

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. official on Saturday
accused the government of President Slobodan Milosevic of
``systematic and widespread'' human rights abuses in Yugoslavia,
declaring American support for pro-democracy forces in the country.
	   Harold Hongju Koh, a U.S. assistant secretary of state, called
human rights abuses ``the root cause'' of the ethnic conflict in
Serbia's southern Kosovo province, and tied solving of the crisis
to democratic changes in the country.
	   ``No long-term resolution to Kosovo is possible without
development of democracy, including a free media climate, in
Serbia,'' said Koh in a statement issued at the end of his tour of
Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and much smaller Montenegro.
	   Koh blasted the ``notorious'' information and university laws
passed by the Serbian parliament last October. The laws impose
restrictions on the press and government control of the university,
the two main basis of anti-government movements in Serbia.
	   ``The regime in Belgrade has sought to further its grip on power
by silencing the independent media and suppressing the truth,''
said Koh.
	   ``We have strong concerns about Belgrade's assault on civil
society,'' he added in the strongly-worded statement. ``Ironically,
by squelching the truth, the Belgrade regime is only painting
itself into a corner. We strongly support aspirations for greater
freedom and democratization.''
	   Koh praised the reformist leadership of Montenegro _ which along
with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia _ where a Milosevic opponent won
presidential election last year. There are fears that Milosevic,
now president of the Yugoslav federation, might try to install his
protege on power in Montenegro by force.
	   ``The United States stands ready to support democracy and
promote respect for human rights in Montenegro however it can in
coming months,'' said Koh.
	   ``True freedom cannot be achieved here unless the people know
the truth ... Respect for democracy and human rights represents a
path back to Europe for all Kosovars, Montenegrins and Serbians,''
he concluded.

	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) - Police arrested 150 demonstrators and 14
people, including three police, were injured Saturday when leftists
clashed with rightist protesters at an exhibition on the activities
of Hitler's military.
	   Police said about 150 young rightists showed up to demonstrate
against the exhibit titled ``War of extermination: Crimes of the
Wehrmacht from 1941 to 1944.''
	   About 2,500 anti-rightists, including from labor unions and the
Greens party, held a counter demonstration and the opposing sides
scuffled with each other on several occasions, police said.
	   Hanover police chief Hans-Dieter Klosa said that more trouble
broke out later as about 150 leftists started throwing stones at
the rightists and police when they were leaving the exhibit.
	   Police used night sticks to break up the demonstrators. At least
11 protesters and three officers received minor injuries, police
said. Some 150 demonstrators were arrested, with most released
after identity checks.
	   Klosa originally banned the rightist demonstration on Tuesday
fearing violence with leftists after the National Party of Germany
applied for permission to hold the rally.
	   However, the party appealed the ban and the High State
Administrative Court in Lueneburg overturned it on Friday.
	   The exhibit, which has been traveling to cities in Germany and
Austria over the past three years, uses photographs and documents
to show that ordinary German soldiers killed Jews and other
civilians under Hitler's rule of terror.
	   Many older Germans still view the Wehrmacht as an honorable
force that fought for the homeland. And thousands of neo-Nazis
demonstrated against the traveling exhibit in March 1997 during its
Munich installation - although it has often been displayed without
incident.

Iraq declares end to U.N. inspections as air strikes resume

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's vice president declared Saturday
that the Baghdad regime will end all dealings with the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees weapons inspections, in response to the
American and British air strikes.
	   Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly after
anti-aircraft guns shot bright flashes into the Baghdad sky on
Saturday night, indicating that the fourth wave of punishing
missile strikes was under way.
	   Iraq has been taking a beating since overnight
Wednesday-Thursday, when U.S. and British forces launched an air
offensive to punish the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
for obstructing the work of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Ramadan told a news conference that ``the Special Commission is
now behind us. Its mission is over.''
	   He repeated Iraq's allegation that UNSCOM was a tool of the
Americans, adding: ``Its only mission in Iraq now is to find a
cover for the genitals of those who want to carry out aggression
against Iraq.''
	   The implications of an Iraqi decision to shut down U.N.
inspections are grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles. It
also is responsible for setting up a long-range monitoring program
to ensure that Iraq doesn't rebuild its lethal arsenal.
	   Destruction of the weapons was mandated by the U.N. Security
Council resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Before the vice president began speaking, gun batteries on
rooftops sent tracer shells streaking across the sky shortly after
sundown, as Muslims were breaking their fast on the first day of
the holy month of Ramadan.
	   Sirens wailed a warning for citizens to take cover.
	   In Washington, a White House official said a fourth wave of air
strikes had begun.
	   The previous attack ended shortly before dawn on Saturday and
had appeared to be the toughest yet against Baghdad.
	   Before this attack, the United States fired nearly 300 Tomahawk
cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from B-52 bombers. The
missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350 kilograms (3,000
pounds).
	   Ramadan declined to give casualty figures, but said that the
number of civilians who had been killed ``was 10 times more than
military men.''
	   He said that 12 students died in a missile strike on a
university on Friday.
	   The government said earlier that 25 people were killed and 75
injured in the first two nights of attacks. On Saturday, the
state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more people died and 21 were
wounded in a missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the
northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to
lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten
its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Ramadan repeated Iraq's contention that the real goal was to
eliminate Saddam.
	   ``I am telling those who were promised the elimination of our
great leader that the symbol of the nation, its lofty example, will
remain,'' Ramadan said.
	   He added: ``We will fight to the last citizen, and history will
glorify us.''
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the missile attacks late
Friday and early Saturday was heavy and that a number of buildings
in the center of the capital _ including palaces, security
headquarters and offices of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Ramadan focused on civilian sites that were hit, confirming
earlier reports that telephone communications with southern
provinces had been broken. He also charged that the United States
and Britain had hit an electricity plant and destroyed a factory
that had been inspected by UNSCOM.
	   In London, British officials showed videotapes of bomb hits on
Republican Guard facilities in southern Iraq, and emphasized that
the Guard was a key target of the operation.
	   ``Those are the people that surround him, keep him in office,
have their own system of repression, and of course have been
instrumental in putting together the means of concealing the
weapons of mass destruction,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said.
	   In a radio address from the White House, U.S. President Bill
Clinton told listeners ``I believe the mission is going well.''
	   He added: ``Where do we go from here? We stand ready to use
force again'' should Saddam threaten his neighbors or attempt to
reconstitute his weaponry.
	   Also Saturday, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led
by the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   The inspectors, who had been working in Iraq since 1991,
withdrew on Wednesday, a day after U.N. inspection chief Richard
Butler told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq was not
cooperating. That became the trigger for the U.S.-British attacks.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the Security Council will
not lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

Pele calls Vampeta best player in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Corinthians midfielder Vampeta
received the highest sort of praise from soccer legend Pele,
Brazilian media reported Saturday.
	   ``Vampeta is the best player currently playing in Brazil,'' Pele
told Globo television news.
	   Speaking at the inauguration of a Sao Paulo hospital Friday
commended Vampeta for his playing style and ability.
	   Vampeta, a starter on Brazil's national team who made headlines
earlier this week for agreeing to pose nude in a gay magazine _
although he denied being homosexual _ said he was overjoyed with
the compliment.
	   ``I am happy to know that Pele _ imagine that! _ said that I'm
the best player in Brazil,'' Vampeta was quoted by the Jornal do
Brasil, ``This will only serve to increase my enthusiasm. I'm not
going to get over excited, I'm just going to work to keep worthy of
the compliment.''

Olympic champion is latest casualty at demanding World Cup course
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Val Gardena-Men Downhill &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ An American rookie and an Olympic
downhill champion were among the latest casualties at the
treacherous Saslong course in Val Gardena _ one of the top-five
World Cup downhill venues.
	   The icy and fast track of 3.5 kilometers (2 miles), which hosted
back-to-back speed races this weekend, was the scene Saturday of a
streak of spectacular spills which caused season-ending injuries to
at least five skiers.
	   The French team was especially hard-hit, with three athletes
knocked out in three days.
	   Saslong has been long known as a demanding, tough course
alternating long jumps, bumps and fast S-shaped curves on which
skiers still can reach peak speeds of up to 120 kph (75 mph).
	   ``You certainly take risks down the Saslong, but it's downhill
racing. It's quite normal,'' says Kristian Ghedina, winner of
Saturday's speed race ahead of Lasse Kjus, the previous day winner.
	   ``You certainly feel the effect of the jumps and of the bumps in
your legs as you ski down Saslong,'' said Kjus.
	   American downhill hero Bill Johnson, Swiss Peter Mueller and
Italy's Michael Mair were among the skiers who suffered bad spills
and knee injuries at the so-called Camels' bumps section of the
track, back in the 80s.
	   On Saturday, Olympic champion Jean-Luc Cretier tore a ligament
in his left knee and fractured his left hand in a spill shortly
after the start.
	   His French teammates David Pretot and Vincent Blanc sustained
severe knee injuries in Friday's race and in practice,
respectively.
	   Young American Ehlias Louis, of Park City, tore the knee
ligament in Friday's race while a practice spill ended the season
of Canadian veteran Ed Podivinsky on Wednesday.
	   Podivinsky's teammate Brian Stemmle, 10th on Friday, said spills
and injuries were part of speed races.
	   ``You know it can happen every time in downhill,'' said Stemmle,
who broke his pelvis in a crash at the Kitzbuhel track in Austria a
few years ago.

Russian foreign minister calls for bombing halt in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ivanov predicting crisis will soon be settled
politically in grafs 1-3, liberal deputy blaming airstrikes on
Russian stance in new final graf. Trims outdated material. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov insisted
Saturday that airstrikes against Iraq be stopped immediately, and
predicted that the crisis around Iraq could soon be settled by
diplomatic means.
	   ``In the next few days, we will be able to return the situation
in the direction of the U.N. Security Council and continue joint
efforts to solve the conflict through political means,'' Ivanov
told Russian state television.
	   ``We think that in this case the Iraqi leadership has displayed
restraint and wisdom and has not taken any steps that could further
complicate the situation.''
	   Ivanov said that Russia backed Iraq in its commitment to
settling the crisis through political means.
	   In a meeting with Iraq's ambassador to Moscow, Hassan Fahmi
Jumah, Ivanov ``positively assessed the fact that notwithstanding
the use of force, the Iraqi leadership remains ready to cooperate
with the United Nations, in particular with the Special
Commission,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a press statement.
	   The commission is responsible for dismantling Iraq's chemical
and biological weapons and long-range missiles. U.S. President Bill
Clinton ordered the airstrikes, which began Wednesday, to punish
Iraq for its alleged obstruction of the commission.
	   The Foreign Ministry continued its attempts Saturday to build
consensus against the U.S.-British attacks against Iraq. Ivanov
spoke over the phone with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who
expressed his nation's support for Russia's stance on ending the
military action and defusing the crisis, the Foreign Ministry said.
	   In a rare sign of dissent from the unified Russian stand against
the airstrikes, a liberal lawmaker said Russia's foreign policy
makers were to blame for the Iraqi crisis, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Sergei Yushenkov, a member of the Russia's Democratic Choice
party, said the government and the Foreign Ministry were allowing
the communist and nationalist majority in the parliament to
determine the course of foreign policy.
	   ``If Russian had made Saddam Hussein comply with U.N.
resolutions, these airstrikes wouldn't have happened,'' ITAR-Tass
quoted Yushenkov as saying.

underground protest over unpaid wages Saturday, after the

	   Sixteen miners who had remained underground since Wednesday
morning, ended their protest late Saturday, after the management
agreed to their demands they be paid the remainder of their October
wages and at least part of their November pay, private TV Markiza

colleagues, had demanded the remainder of their October pay, and
3,000 crowns (83 dlrs) from their November wages. Late Saturday,

Iraq declares end to U.N. inspections as air strikes resume

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's vice president declared Saturday
that Baghdad will end all dealings with the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees inspections of Iraqi weapons as required
by the United Nations, in response to the American and British
airstrikes.
	   Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly after
anti-aircraft guns shot bright flashes into the Baghdad sky on
Saturday night, indicating that a fourth wave of punishing missile
strikes was underway.
	   Gun batteries on rooftops sent tracer shells streaking across
the sky after dusk as Iraqis broke their first day of fasting for
the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The guns began firing minutes
after sirens wailed across the capital.
	   In Washington, a White House official said the fourth wave of
air strikes had begun.
	   Iraq has been taking a beating since overnight
Wednesday-Thursday, when U.S. and British forces launched an air
offensive to punish the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
for obstructing the work of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The Iraqi vice president told a news conference that ``the
Special Commission is now behind us. Its mission is over.''
	   He repeated Iraq's allegation that UNSCOM was a tool of the
Americans, adding: ``Its only mission in Iraq now is to find a
cover for the genitals of those who want to carry out aggression
against Iraq.''
	   The implications of an Iraqi decision to shut down U.N.
inspections are grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles. It
also is responsible for setting up a long-range monitoring program
to ensure that Iraq doesn't rebuild its lethal arsenal.
	   Destruction of the weapons was mandated by the U.N. Security
Council resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The third wave of airstrikes against Iraq, which ended shortly
before dawn on Saturday, had appeared to be the toughest yet
against Baghdad. Prior to that attack, the United States had fired
nearly 300 Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or from
B-52 bombers. The missiles carry warheads weighing up to 1,350
kilograms (3,000 pounds).
	   Ramadan, the Iraqi vice president, declined to give casualty
figures so far, but said that the number of civilians who had been
killed ``was 10 times more than military men.''
	   He said that 12 students died in a missile strike on a
university on Friday.
	   The government said earlier that 25 people were killed and 75
injured in the first two nights of attacks. On Saturday, the
state-run Iraqi News Agency said five additional people died and 21
were wounded in a missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of
the northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to
lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten
its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Ramadan repeated Iraq's contention that the real goal was to
eliminate Saddam.
	   ``I am telling those who were promised the elimination of our
great leader that the symbol of the nation, its lofty example, will
remain,'' Ramadan said.
	   He added: ``We will fight to the last citizen, and history will
glorify us.''
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the missile attacks late
Friday and early Saturday was heavy and that a number of buildings
in the center of the capital _ including palaces, security
headquarters and offices of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   Ramadan focused on civilian sites that were hit, confirming
earlier reports that telephone communications with southern
provinces had been broken. He also charged that the United States
and Britain had hit an electricity plant and destroyed a factory
that had been inspected by UNSCOM.
	   In London, British officials showed videotapes of bomb hits on
Republican Guard facilities in southern Iraq, and emphasized that
the Guard was a key target of the operation.
	   ``Those are the people that surround him, keep him in office,
have their own system of repression, and of course have been
instrumental in putting together the means of concealing the
weapons of mass destruction,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said.
	   In a radio address from the White House, U.S. President Bill
Clinton told listeners ``I believe the mission is going well.''
	   He added: ``Where do we go from here? We stand ready to use
force again'' should Saddam threaten his neighbors or attempt to
reconstitute his weaponry.
	   Also Saturday, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led
by the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   The inspectors, who had been working in Iraq since 1991,
withdrew on Wednesday, a day after U.N. inspection chief Richard
Butler told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq was not
cooperating. That became the trigger for the U.S.-British attacks.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the Security Council will
not lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
	   WINTERBERG, Germany (AP) _ U.S. Olympic bronze medal winners
Americans Mark Grimmette and Brian Martin set a heat record
Saturday while capturing the doubles at the luge World Cup.
	   But the German's women's team remained nearly unbeatable in
singles, sweeping the top three spots as Olympic champion Silke
Kraushaar picked up another win.
	   ``Our winning streak is crazy, but we've got the best starts and
the best sleds,'' said Kraushaar. ``We're all driving each other
forward.''
	   Martin and Grimmette roared to a new record of 45.978 seconds on
their second run at the Winterberg track while overcoming erratic
rainy conditions.
	   ``A lot of sleds seemed to have difficulty with the conditions.
Luckily we made it through,'' said Martin.
	   Martin and Grimmette won in a combined time of of 1 minute,
32.641 seconds, followed by Austrian cousins Tobias and Markus
Schiegl at 1:32.902 and Germany's Patrick Leitner and Alexander
Resch at 1:33.052.
	   The American pair of Chris Thorpe and Gordy Sheer were fourth.
Teammates Christian Niccum and Matt McClain, who have already won
two events, settled for 15th after crashing on the second run.
	   Grimette and Martin, who are the defending overall world
champion, again lead the standings at 312 points. The Schiegls are
at 301 and Niccum and McLain at 286.
	   ``We were trying to get a victory here before going home for
Christmas,'' said Grimmette.
	   Kraushaar won the singles in a time of 1:33.789 minutes,
followed by Susi Erdmann at 1:34,033 and Barbara Niedernhuber at
1:34,061.
	   The German women have dominated the event this season and have
grabbed the top four spots in the overall standings.
	   Sylke Otto leads at 320 points, followed by Kraushaar with 316,
Niedernhuber, 301, and Erdmann, 255.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, Arab protesters joined
Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   In a rare protest in the Syrian capital, tens of thousands
marched through downtown Damascus Saturday, and about 1,000 people
_ most of them students _ attacked the U.S. Embassy, its nearby
residence and the American Cultural Center.
	   Rioters also threw stones at the British Embassy in Damascus and
broke into the British Council, where they damaged furniture and
scattered library books.
	   At the U.S. residence, more than 100 people climbed over the
wall, broke down the front door and stormed inside, destroying
furniture, windows, kitchen cabinets and bookcases.
	   They also attacked the car of Ambassador Ryan Crocker,
shattering the lights and windows. Crocker's wife, Christine, was
in the house at the time but was not hurt.
	   At the embassy, U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas from the roof
to disperse the stone-throwing crowd. Three protesters managed to
enter the compound, and haul down and burn the American flag.
	   Syrian security forces dispersed the mobs after about six hours.
	   In Hebron in the West Bank, some 3,000 Palestinians defied a ban
from their leadership on pro-Iraq demonstrations, screaming ``Death
to Israel! Death to America!'' Clashes later with Israeli troops
firing rubber bullets left more than 100 Palestinians injured.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months in the
Palestinian lands.
	   In another demonstration in Jenin, about 2,500 Palestinians
approached the Jewish settlement of Ginat and threw stones at
Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Seven Palestinians were injured.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, protesters across the Arab
world joined Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes
on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   In a rare protest in the Syrian capital, thousands marched
through downtown Damascus Saturday, and about 1,000 people _ most
of them students _ attacked the U.S. Embassy, its nearby residence
and the American Cultural Center.
	   Rioters also threw stones at the British Embassy in Damascus and
broke into the British Council, where they damaged furniture and
scattered library books.
	   At the U.S. residence, more than 100 people climbed over the
wall, broke down the front door and stormed inside, destroying
everything in their path _ furniture, windows, the ambassador's
private office. They knocked books on the floor, and destroyed
kitchen cabinets and bookcases.
	   They also attacked the car of Ambassador Ryan Crocker,
shattering the lights and windows. Crocker's wife, Christine, was
in the house at the time but was not hurt.
	   At the embassy, U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas from the roof
to disperse the stone-throwing crowd. Three protesters managed to
enter the compound, climb the walls and haul down and burn the
American flag.
	   Syrian security forces dispersed the mobs after about six hours.
	   In Hebron in the West Bank, some 3,000 Palestinians defied a ban
from their leadership on pro-Iraq demonstrations, screaming ``Death
to Israel! Death to America!'' Clashes later with Israeli troops
firing rubber bullets left more than 100 Palestinians injured.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months in the
Palestinian lands.
	   In another demonstration in Jenin, about 2,500 Palestinians
approached the Jewish settlement of Ginat and threw stones at
Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Seven Palestinians were injured.
	   In Egypt, 4,000 students burned U.S. and Israeli flags at Banha
University, north of Cairo, as did 200 students at Cairo's Ain
Shams University.
	   ``Oh Baghdad, Oh Baghdad, my love, strike Tel Aviv,'' they
shouted at Ain Shams. ``Iraq's children have no milk for nursing,
so now they're sucking on bullets instead.''
	   Protester Ayman Yassin, 20, called America ``the spawn of all
evil.''
	   ``Because Bill has to play, the Arabs have to pay,'' Yassin
said, referring to the widespread belief among Arabs that Clinton
engineered the attack to delay impeachment proceedings against him
over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   In the Yemeni capital of San`a, more than 15,000 marched,
beginning at the university and heading to the embassies of China
and Russia in appreciation for their position. The Chinese and
Russians have bitterly denounced the airstrikes.
	   ``Look, look at America, look at the scandal of Monica,'' they
chanted.
	   In Jordan, about 1,000 students expressed their anger at Jordan
University, where 200 riot police kept them from leaving the
campus.
	   The protests also have hit Sudan, where U.S. forces in August
bombed a pharmaceuticals plant Washington accused of making
components for chemical weapons.
	   In the capital, Khartoum, some students threw Molotov cocktails
at the closed U.S. Embassy during a protest by about 2,000 people,
witnesses said.

Russian prime minister to visit India to strengthen economic and
</HEADLINE>
military ties &QL; 
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The U.S. airstrikes on Iraq will be a
key issue for talks when the Russian prime minister begins a visit
Sunday to India in which the two countries are to strengthen
economic and military ties, an Indian official said.
	   Both Russia and India have demanded an immediate end to military
action by the United States and Britain. India and Russia have ``a
fairly close position'' on the issue, the Foreign Ministry
spokesman in New Delhi said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Russia on Thursday recalled its ambassador to the United States
to protest President Bill Clinton's decision to launch air attacks
against Iraq.
	   During Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov's visit India,
the two countries will sign seven agreements, including one on
extending military and technical cooperation through 2010. The two
countries have an agreement now that expires in the year 2000.
	   India is a leading buyer of Russian arms, receiving up to 80
percent of its military equipment from Russia. India also is
building two nuclear reactors purchased from Russia in a dlrs 2.6
billion contract. Both sides say the reactors are for energy
purposes and cannot be used militarily.
	   President Boris Yeltsin had planned to visit India in January,
but put off his trip after falling ill.
	   The two sides also will sign an extradition treaty and an
agreement covering legal assistance in criminal matters to deal
with terrorism, the Foreign Ministry official said.
	   The economic agreements will seek to enhance cooperation in
steel, power and telecommunication sectors. The two countries also
will study the possibility of jointly undertaking oil exploration
in the two countries and in Central Asian republics.
	   In September, Russia delivered the first of seven contracted
cryogenic engines to India.The engines are crucial to the
development of a geo-synchronous satellite launch vehicle that
would carry a 2,500-kilogram communication satellite.
	   India plans to launch a satellite to a stationary point in an
orbit high above the earth's surface in 1999.

Baghdad markets filled as Iraqis mark holiday amid bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAG-111, 115
 &UR; By LOUIS MEIXLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Shoppers streamed into the al-Amir
mini-market Saturday shouting orders for sweets above the roar of
an excavating machine digging around a water main ruptured by a
U.S. missile.
	   Despite pre-dawn bombardments, the streets of Baghdad were
filled Saturday with Iraqis preparing to mark the end of the first
day of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
	   ``The Iraqi people have learned to live with raids,'' said Majid
al-Anbaki, a law professor at Saddam University.
	   Like many Iraqis, he said this week's missile strikes against
factories and government buildings were far less severe than the
1991 Gulf War blitz which devastated the capital's infrastructure,
leaving roads and bridges shattered and civilians without
electricity and water.
	   During the 43-day Gulf War, Anbaki sent his wife and his two
children to a town in the countryside as a U.S.-led coalition
pounded Iraq and its soldiers in Kuwait with 110,000 tons of bombs.
Hundreds of civilians in Baghdad were killed.
	   ``It was scary. There was no water, no electricity. Baghdad was
a deserted city,'' said Anbaki.
	   This year, he plans to stay in Baghdad, despite the danger.
	   ``We live together, we die together,'' he said.
	   Last night at 4:00 a.m., U.S. cruise missiles slammed into the
city, sending fiery plumes of smoke into the sky.
	   Anbaki grabbed his children _ still in their pajamas _ and his
wife and rushed them to an air shelter in his building.
	   ``I am worried about my kids, my family, my future,'' he said.
	   But he added that a few minutes after the sirens sounded, he
went back upstairs to check on his abandoned apartment.
	   Like many Iraqis, al-Anbaki said he was not able to stock up on
water and foods such as rice, beans and peas, which he stockpiled
before the Gulf War.
	   ``We didn't expect the United States to take action,'' he said.
``We did not have time to store up on food or anything.''
	   In the al-Amir shop, cashier Ali Hafez said he has grown tired
of the threats of airstrikes.
	   As soon as he heard the air raid sirens, he ran up to the roof
because he was curious to see which buildings were being targeted.
	   He ignored the danger because ``we're use to it,'' he said.
	   The U.S. and British raids have targeted communications,
military and government centers in four days of air attacks.
	   Iraq says at least 50 civilians have been killed in the raids.
	   The government, however, has not brought journalists to sites
where civilians were killed. This suggests that, unlike during the
Gulf War, the missiles and bombs have not caused large numbers of
casualties.
	   The government also has not allowed the foreign media to visit
government buildings that have suffered heavy damage.
	   The missile that exploded near the sweet shop ruptured a water
pipe, shattered windows and damaged two homes, but caused no
casualties.
	   Anbaki said his family's sundown meal to break the Ramadan fast
will be modest meal of lamb kebab and a special type of nougat
because his family can't afford many of the treats at shops like
the al-Amir.
	   The store stocks five types of dates, which cost about 350
dinars a kilogram (about a dime a pound), traditional cakes and
sesame-seed sweets.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1991 invasion of Kuwait have
devastated the economy and impoverished most of its citizens.
	   Baghdad's main Shorja market was crowded Saturday morning. Shops
were filled with clothing, fruits, spices and sweets, but there
seemed to be few customers buying anything except the cheapest
goods.
	   ``There is a shortage of everything: food, supplies, money,''
Anbaki said.
	   At the al-Amir shop, cashier Hafez says that sales are up, but
that is due only to the Ramadan holiday. It is traditional in the
Arab world to break the fast with special holiday treats.
	   Despite the hard times ``some people are buying extra for the
holidays,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Two-day municipal elections in
Slovakia ended on Saturday, with voter turn-out believed to be
below 52 percent.
	   Polls across the country closed at 2 o'clock (1300 GMT)
Saturday. While votes are still being counted, election officials
have estimated that few voters turned out this year than in the
1994 elections that saw only 52 percent of eligible voters going to
the polls.
	   The central election commission in the capital Bratislava is
expected to announce results Tuesday.
	   The government's presidential candidate, Rudolf Schuster, was
among the 2,912 people running for mayors' offices across the
country. Schuster is backed by the government in direct
presidential elections planned for early next year. He and three
other candidates are running for mayor of Kosice, Slovakia's
second-largest city.
	   Jozef Moravcik, a former prime minister who was in the office
briefly in 1994, is running for the post in the capital. Moravcik
faces six other candidates.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House of Representatives impeached
President Bill Clinton on Saturday for obstructing justice and
lying under oath about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky,
voting largely along party lines to send his case to the Senate. It
was only the second presidential impeachment in American history.
	   The House approved articles of impeachment accusing Clinton of
committing perjury before a federal grand jury and obstruction of
justice. It rejected an article accusing him of perjury in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, then began to vote on a
fourth article, alleging abuse of power.
	   The first vote was announced at 1:24 p.m. EST (1824 GMT),
leaving the 42nd president to face trial in the Senate on whether
he should be removed from office. Clinton was secluded with a
minister at the time, but planned a public appearance later in the
day.
	   It was the gravest moment of Clinton's political career. Five
members of each party defected on the first article, voting 228-206
to impeach the president.
	   The House then voted:
	   _229-205 to reject a second article accusing Clinton of
committing perjury in the Jones suit. More than two dozen
Republicans defected to join Democrats.
	   _221-212 to approve a third article accusing Clinton of
obstruction of justice in the Lewinsky matter.
	   Divided along party lines to the end, the House was stunned by
the abrupt resignation of its incoming speaker, Rep. Bob
Livingston, in the hours just before the vote.

Italian police break up alleged ring to evade liquor taxes

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian tax police on Saturday said they had
broken up an alleged liquor smuggling ring that had avoided nearly
dlrs 90 million in excise taxes due British, Irish and EU
authorities.
	   The probe, carried out in the area of Milan and Brescia, another
northern Italian city, and codenamed Double Malt, uncovered some
350 shipments of whiskey, brandy, vodka and gin which had been
accompanied by false documents.
	   Four suspects in Italy were detained on suspicion of having
formed a company allegedly aimed at evading taxes, Italy's fiscal
police said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Shoppers streamed into the al-Amir
mini-market Saturday shouting orders for sweets above the roar of a
backhoe digging around a water main ruptured by a U.S. missile.
	   Despite pre-dawn bombardments, the streets of Baghdad were
filled during Saturday's daylight hours with Iraqis preparing to
mark the end of the first day of the Islamic fasting month of
Ramadan.
	   Anti-aircraft gunfire and loud blasts resumed after nightfall,
indicating a fourth wave of airstrikes was underway.
	   ``The Iraqi people have learned to live with raids,'' said Majid
al-Anbaki, a law professor at Saddam University.
	   Like many Iraqis, he said this week's missile strikes against
factories and government buildings were far less severe than the
1991 Gulf War blitz which devastated the capital's infrastructure,
leaving roads and bridges shattered and civilians without
electricity and water.
	   During the 43-day Gulf War, Anbaki sent his wife and his two
children to a town in the countryside as a U.S.-led coalition
pounded Iraq and its soldiers in Kuwait with 110,000 tons of bombs.
Hundreds of civilians in Baghdad were killed.
	   ``It was scary. There was no water, no electricity. Baghdad was
a deserted city,'' said Anbaki.
	   This year, he plans to stay in Baghdad, despite the danger.
	   ``We live together, we die together,'' he said.
	   Last night at 4:00 a.m. local time (0100 GMT), U.S. cruise
missiles slammed into the city, sending fiery plumes of smoke into
the sky.
	   Anbaki grabbed his children _ still in their pajamas _ and his
wife and rushed them to an air shelter in his building.
	   ``I am worried about my kids, my family, my future,'' he said.
	   But he added that a few minutes after the sirens sounded, he
went back upstairs to check on his abandoned apartment.
	   Like many Iraqis, al-Anbaki said he was not able to stock up on
water and foods such as rice, beans and peas, which he stockpiled
before the Gulf War.
	   ``We didn't expect the United States to take action,'' he said.
``We did not have time to store up on food or anything.''
	   In the al-Amir shop, cashier Ali Hafez said he has grown tired
of the threats of airstrikes.
	   As soon as he heard the air raid sirens, he ran up to the roof
because he was curious to see which buildings were being targeted.
	   He ignored the danger because ``we're use to it,'' he said.
	   The U.S. and British raids have targeted communications,
military and government centers in four days of air attacks.
	   Iraq says at least 50 civilians have been killed in the raids.
	   The government, however, has not brought journalists to sites
where civilians were killed. This suggests that, unlike during the
Gulf War, the missiles and bombs have not caused large numbers of
casualties.
	   The government also has not allowed the foreign media to visit
government buildings that have suffered heavy damage.
	   The missile that exploded near the sweet shop ruptured a water
pipe, shattered windows and damaged two homes, but caused no
casualties.
	   Anbaki said his family's sundown meal to break the Ramadan fast
will be modest meal of lamb kebab and a special type of nougat
because his family can't afford many of the treats at shops like
the al-Amir.
	   The store stocks five types of dates, which cost about 350
dinars a kilogram (about a dime a pound), traditional cakes and
sesame-seed sweets.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1991 invasion of Kuwait have
devastated the economy and impoverished most of its citizens.
	   Baghdad's main Shorja market was crowded Saturday morning. Shops
were filled with clothing, fruits, spices and sweets, but there
seemed to be few customers buying anything except the cheapest
goods.
	   ``There is a shortage of everything: food, supplies, money,''
Anbaki said.
	   At the al-Amir shop, cashier Hafez says that sales are up, but
that is due only to the Ramadan holiday. It is traditional in the
Arab world to break the fast with special holiday treats.
	   Despite the hard times ``some people are buying extra for the
holidays,'' he said.

Ghedina wins second Val Gardena downhill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with detail, more quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Kristian Ghedina again proved himself
to be the wizard of second chances.
	   The 29-year-old Italian repeated his 1996 feat in this northern
Italian valley Saturday, winning the second of consecutive World
Cup downhills, ending the winning streak of Norwegian Lasse Kjus,
and continuing the frustration of the Austrians.
	   It was the third time Ghedina, who has a reputation as a
daredevil, has won the second of back-to-back downhills, having
also managed the accomplishment in January in Kitzbuehel.
	   ``I did not ski a perfect race. I made some mistakes. But it
does not matter when you win,'' said Ghedina as he carried his
4-year-old brother Luca shoulder on at the finish line.
	   ``He brings me good luck. He was here two years ago, and I won
the race.''
	   The Cortina d'Ampezzo native finished the 3,495-meter Saslong
course in 2 minutes, 4.17 seconds for his 10th World Cup victory.
	   Kjus, winner of the two previous World Cup downhills including
Friday's, finished second, 0.14 seconds behind.
	   ``I was not as perfect as yesterday and I paid for a few
mistakes. I also lacked some concentration following two wins in a
row,'' Kjus said.
	   Second place kept the Norwegian atop the World Cup overall
standings with 493 points from 10 events. He also leads the
downhill standings with 280 points.
	   Werner Franz edged Austrian teammate Hermann Maier for third
place, 0.28 seconds behind the winner.
	   The two Austrians had placed second and third respectively,
behind Kjus, in Friday's downhill, which replaced the race canceled
in Whistler Mountain, Canada, earlier this month.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion, complained that a race
steward disturbed his run crossing the course as he was coming
down.
	   The jury rejected a complaint by the Austrian team because Maier
did not stop and made it to the finish line, still placing fourth
only 0.48 seconds behind.
	   Maier said later he doubted he could have beaten Ghedina, even
in the absence of the steward, who was rushing to help a fallen
competitor.
	   The Austrians are winless in this season's three downhill races
after starting the campaign triumphantly in the other three
disciplines of the World Cup.
	   Ghedina's time was nearly two seconds slower than Kjus' winning
time on Friday over the same icy course and distance.
	   ``I beat Kjus today because he made mistakes. He had been
faultless, thus unbeatable, Friday,'' Ghedina said.
	   The Italian was fourth on Friday and a distant 45th in the first
downhill of the season at Val D'Isere last week.
	   Another Norwegian, Kjetil Andre Aamodt, repeated his fifth-place
finish from Friday.
	   Other top finishers included Austrians Andreas Schifferer and
Fritz Strobl in sixth and seventh place.
	   The race was marred by the season-ending crash of Olympic
downhill champion Jean-Luc Cretier. The 33-year-old Frenchman tore
a ligament in his left knee and fractured his left hand in a
high-speed spill.
	   Cretier, who had won the Olympic title in Nagano, fell at an icy
section of the course shortly after the start, skidded off the
track and fell over a ridge of snow and grass.
	   He was taken by helicopter to the nearby hospital of Bressanone.
	   He was the third skier to be seriously injured at Val Gardena
this weekend.
	   American Ehlias Louis and France's David Pretot also tore knee
ligaments in falls during Friday's race.
	   The men's World Cup circuit continues Sunday with a giant slalom
at nearby Alta Badia.

About 40,000 Kurds demonstrate in Bonn against suppression in
</HEADLINE>
Turkey &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ About 40,000 Kurds gathered in Bonn
Saturday for a peaceful demonstration against oppression of the
Kurdish population in Turkey, police said.
	   Police said the Kurds arrived on two trains and more than 400
buses from throughout Germany and other European countries. After
assembling at two sites the crowd marched to a central
demonstration point on the Rhine river in the suburb of Beuel.
	   The marchers carried banners inscribed with ``Peace, Freedom and
Democracy,'' and shouted political slogans in unison demanding a
solution to the Kurdish problem in Turkey, police said.
	   Some also carried posters with the picture of Kurldish rebel
leader Abldullah Ocalan, whose Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) is
banned in Turkey and Germany as a terrorist group.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 15 in Rome, where he remained under
police guard until officials announced this week he was free to
travel. He has asked for political asylum in Italy, but a decision
has not been made.
	   Turkey has asked Italy to extradite Ocalan, but the Italian law
does not permit them to extradite someone to a country that has a
death penalty.
	   An arrest warrant also exists for Ocalan for murder in Germany,
which has no death penalty, but Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder ruled
out seeking his extradition for fear of stirring unrest among the
nation's Turkish population of 2 million, one-fifth of which are
Kurds.
	   The PKK has fought a 14-year war for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey,
in which about 37,000 people have been killed.

Strikers agree to open port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Striking banana workers agreed
to drop their blockade of the Fort-de-France port Saturday morning
and allow a backlog of goods to begin flowing into the island, a
radio station reported.
	   The decision was made after a general meeting of the striking
unions, RFO radio reported. The strikers agreed to reopen the port
while watching the progress of new negotiations that were also
announced Saturday.
	   Banana workers have been on strike since talks broke down on
Nov. 21, but protests have taken place several times over the past
six months.
	   The blockage of the port, which was part of the strikers'
tactics, caused a backlog of 5,500 containers that will take days
to deliver. Business managers said the delayed deliveries during
the holiday season have disrupted commerce.

Bayern Munich again proves it is class of Bundesliga
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;  

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Bayern Munich capped a big week Saturday,
rolling to its third rout and proving once again the
team is in a league of its own in the Bundesliga.
	   Munich blasted VfL Wolfsburg 3-0, polishing off six
remarkable days in which the side jumped from second in the
table to eight points clear as the league breaks for the
winter.
	   Along the way, the Bavarians ended up with a league record
for the break of 14-2-2. 
	   ``We're all happy for the vacation,'' said Wolfsburg coach
Wolfgang Wolf. ``I can only congratulate Munich on their
performance.'' 
	   Munich crushed Bayer Leverkusen, which led the table on
goal differential, in a lopsided 3-0 affair Sunday. On Tuesday,
the team strolled past Moenchengladbach 2-0.
	   Wolfsburg entered the match against Munich in seventh place
and riding a streak of 11 contests with only one loss.
	   But its only real hopes of a upset may have been wasted 24
seconds into the match when striker Roy Praeger stunned Munich
by popping up unattended in front of the goal.
	   Keeper Oliver Kahn barely one-handed away Praeger's shot. After
that the hunt was on for the Bavarians, who boast a 43-13 goal
differential this season, as they tried to break through a
packed-in defense.
	   Munich's non-stop attack was rewarded in the 40th minute
when French World Cup midfielder Bixente Lizarazu sent a
perfect cross flying into striker Carsten Jancker. The big
striker outleaped three defenders to head in the first goal.
	   Giovane Elber's header in the 86th was his 11th goal,
matching the league high. Bosnia' Hasan Salihamidzic then
converted a penalty just before the whistle to cap the scoring.
	   ``In the end our victory was deserved, even that one-sided.
But it wasn't easy against that packed-in defense,'' said
Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld.
	   Leverkusen, still reeling from being humiliated by Munich,
struggled to a 1-1 draw against Hansa Rostock despite playing
against 10 men in the second half. Kaiserslautern and 1860
Munich, third against fourth place, also played to 1-1.
	   Hamburger SV also beat Nuremberg 2-0 and Frankfurt and
Duisburg played a 0-0 draw. On Friday, Dortmund overpowered
Stuttgart 3-0 and Freiburg and Bochum played to 1-1.
	   Hansa's German national team player Oliver Neuville
connected for the equalizer against Leverkusen in the 72nd
minute, 10 minutes after a teammate was sent packing for a
foul.
	   Defender Boris Zivkovic had shot Leverkusen, which had two
frustrated players thrown out in the final minutes, into the
lead in the 29th minute.
	   Bernhard Winkler's 51st minute goal put visiting 1860 up
against Kaiserslautern, but Marco Reich levelled nine minutes
later.
	   Visiting 1860 dominated the first half against sluggish
Kaiserslautern in front of 41,500 fans.
	   ``Playing good isn't enough _ we should have used our
chances,'' said 1860 coach Werner Lorant at the half.
	   Schalke is back on the winning side since long-injured Marc
Wilmonts has returned to the lineup. This time the Belgium
international connected on a sharply angled gamewinner in the
77th minute.

Netanyahu views soccer game in opening of election campaign

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an apparent opening of his campaign for
re-election, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on
Israelis to chose a strong leader when he attended a soccer game in
Jerusalem Saturday.
	   Netanyahu has said that he will call elections 18 months early
if the parliament, the Knesset, does not approve his hawkish peace
policies in a vote on Monday.
	   The prime minister is slated to ask the Knesset to support
several conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians before
Israel carries out another promised troop withdrawal from parts of
the West Bank.
	   Regardless of the result of the vote, a motion for early
elections submitted by the opposition Labor Party is practically
guaranteed to pass on the same day.
	   Nationalists in Netanyahu's fragile coalition have threatened to
support the opposition's motion to voice their displeasure with the
Wye River land-for-security accord Netanyahu signed with the
Palestinians in October.
	   ``The basic strength of this people is that it wants a strong
government and a strong prime minister to win,'' Netanyahu told
Israel radio at Jerusalem's Teddy Stadium.
	   ``And I know we will continue and will receive the mandate from
the people,'' Netanyahu added.
	   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak opened his campaign Thursday for
the elections slated for April with an emphasis on social issues,
which have typically taken a back seat to the peace process in
national elections.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, pledged to implement the Wye River Memorandum.
	   Netanyahu and Barak have come out neck-in-neck in polls in
recent months. But surveys taken in recent days have found that
Barak leads by about five percentage points.
	   The peace policies of Netanyahu and Barak, a former army chief
of staff, are seen as largely identical with a strong emphasis by
both on Israel's need for security.
	   Taking a similar line of his campaign in 1996, Netanyahu said at
the game that he would never divide Jerusalem. Israel captured east
Jerusalem in 1967.
	   ``United Jerusalem will always stay united and always stay in
the hands of Israel,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a future state
in east Jerusalem and vehemently oppose Israeli settlement there.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, protesters across the Arab
world joined Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes
on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   In a rare protest in the Syrian capital, tens of thousands
marched through downtown Damascus on Saturday, and about 1,000
people _ most of them students _ attacked the U.S. Embassy, its
nearby residence and the American Cultural Center.
	   Rioters also threw stones at the British Embassy in Damascus and
broke into the British Council, where they damaged furniture and
scattered library books.
	   At the U.S. residence, more than 100 people climbed over the
wall, broke down the front door and stormed inside, destroying
furniture, windows, kitchen cabinets and bookcases.
	   They also attacked the car of Ambassador Ryan Crocker,
shattering the lights and windows. Crocker's wife, Christine, was
in the house at the time but was not hurt.
	   At the embassy, U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas from the roof
to disperse the stone-throwing crowd. Three protesters managed to
enter the compound, and haul down and burn the American flag.
	   Syrian security forces dispersed the mobs after about six hours.
	   In Hebron in the West Bank, some 3,000 Palestinians defied a ban
from their leadership on pro-Iraq demonstrations, screaming ``Death
to Israel! Death to America!'' Clashes later with Israeli troops
firing rubber bullets left more than 100 Palestinians injured.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months in the
Palestinian lands.
	   In another demonstration in Jenin, about 2,500 Palestinians
approached the Jewish settlement of Ginat and threw stones at
Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Seven Palestinians were injured.
	   In Egypt, 4,000 students burned U.S. and Israeli flags at Banha
University, north of Cairo, as did 200 students at Cairo's Ain
Shams University.
	   ``Oh Baghdad, Oh Baghdad, my love, strike Tel Aviv,'' they
shouted at Ain Shams. ``Iraq's children have no milk for nursing,
so now they're sucking on bullets instead.''
	   Protester Ayman Yassin, 20, called America ``the spawn of all
evil.''
	   ``Because Bill has to play, the Arabs have to pay,'' Yassin
said, referring to the widespread belief among Arabs that Clinton
engineered the attack to delay impeachment proceedings against him
over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   In the Yemeni capital of San`a, more than 15,000 marched,
beginning at the university and heading to the embassies of China
and Russia in appreciation for their position. The Chinese and
Russians have bitterly denounced the airstrikes.
	   ``Look, look at America, look at the scandal of Monica,'' they
chanted.
	   In Jordan, about 1,000 students expressed their anger at Jordan
University, where 200 riot police kept them from leaving the
campus.
	   The protests also have hit Sudan, where U.S. forces in August
bombed a pharmaceuticals plant Washington alleged was making
components for chemical weapons.
	   In the capital, Khartoum, some students threw Molotov cocktails
at the closed U.S. Embassy during a protest by about 2,000 people,
witnesses said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials demanded
unity Saturday from the leaders of Kosovo's pro-independence ethnic
Albanians as a necessary condition for any fruitful talks with the
Serbian government.
	   French and Austrian diplomats led a group of international
officials to the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders, in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and more moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova.
	   ``We want to give a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side
(that) it's time now to start real negotiating at a broad base ...
that represents all the Kosovo Albanian political forces,'' said
Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's Ambassador to Belgrade.
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, Jacques Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating team.
	   ``Time is running out and everybody must make some efforts for
reopening the door for political process. We hope the door will be
open ... in the next days,'' said Huntzinger.
	   Petritsch said they got a ``positive response'' from Agani,
``but we are still short of a real and definite commitment that
will lead to a concrete forming of such a team.''
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight
for full independence.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia _ also attended the talks and later met with KLA spokesman,
Adem Demaci.
	   Asked how and when the KLA might join political negotiations, in
which they have not previously been included because of their
continued military activity, Petritsch challenged the Kosovo
Albanian side to ``come up with a solution to this.''
	   He added ``there are positive signals that the KLA is realizing
... that they have to decide whether to continue on the military
path or if they want to join political negotiating process.''
	   The talks come on the heels of what has been the bloodiest week
in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people have been
killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting
escalated early last year.
	   Saturday morning, three men appeared in a car outside the house
of William Walker, who leads the roughly 2,000-strong international
observer mission, shouting and pointing their machine gun at
Walker's unarmed security guards, said mission spokesman Jorgen
Grunnet.
	   The incident was reported to the Serbian police, but Grunnet
said the response was not adequate. He said Walker complained
sharply about the incident to the Yugoslav authorities who are
obliged to protect the monitors.

U.S. head of Kosovo verifiers threatened by unidentified man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The American chief of the
international monitors in Kosovo was threatened Saturday by an
unidentified man holding a gun and a hand grenade, the mission
spokesman said.
	   Saturday morning, three men appeared in a car outside the house
of William Walker, who leads the roughly 2,000-strong international
observer mission, shouting and pointing their machine gun at
Walker's unarmed security guards, said mission spokesman Jorgen
Grunnet.
	   The three then disappeared into a nearby house. Upon learning of
the incident, Walker rushed from his office to his home, at which
time one of the men reappeared, holding a gun and hand grenade,
Grunnet said.
	   When the man, who was visibly drunk, started approaching Walker,
the security guards rushed the U.S. official away. Grunnet said it
was not clear who the men were, but eye witnessed claimed the man
was a member of the Serbian police.
	   The incident was reported to the Serbian police, but Grunnet
said the response was not adequate. He said Walker complained
sharply about the incident to the Yugoslav authorities who are
obliged to protect the monitors.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Belgrade authorities on
the incident, which Grunnet described as ``obvious violation to the
commitment to provide security to ambassador Walker and the
mission.''
	   But a source close to police in Kosovo denied that the alleged
perpetrator held a grenade and described the incident as a verbal
argument between the man and the security guards. An investigation
was underway, both the source and Grunnet said.
	   The deployment of the mission, set up by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe to observer the peace, was part
of a U.S.-mediated agreement on Kosovo signed by President Slobodan
Milosevic last October.
	   Some 1,800 NATO soldiers are also being deployed in neighboring
Macedonia as a backup force for the verifiers in case they run into
trouble in Kosovo.

Strikers in Martinique agree to open port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) _ Striking banana workers agreed
to drop their blockade of the Fort-de-France port Saturday morning
and allow a backlog of goods to begin flowing into the island, a
radio station reported.
	   The decision was made after a general meeting of the striking
unions, RFO radio said. The strikers agreed to reopen the port
while watching the progress of new negotiations, which also were
announced Saturday.
	   Banana workers have been on strike since talks broke down on
Nov. 21, and protests have taken place several times over the past
six months.
	   The strikers' blockage of the port caused a backlog of 5,500
containers that will take days to deliver. Business managers said
the delayed deliveries during the holiday season have disrupted
commerce.

<TEXT>
	   HARRACHOV, Czech Republic (AP) _ Janne Ahonen of Finland
clinched his second ski jumping World Cup victory of the season
Saturday, soaring a hill record 132 meters in the second round of
K120 event at Harrachov.
	   Ahonen, who was seventh after the first round with a leap of 109
meters, finished with 235.3 points and beat Rony Hornschuh of
Germany, who also improved notably in the second round, by 13.5
points.
	   Japan's Kazuoshi Funaki finished third, with jumps of 107.5 and
123.5 meters and 217.8 points.
	   Olav Magne Doenne of Norway, who comfortably lead after the
first round with a 122-meter leap, slipped to fourth place after a
weak 180.5-meter second effort in an increasingly dense fog and
pouring rain. His teammate Morten Aagheim took fifth.
	   Saturday's event was rescheduled from Liberec to Harrachov due
to a rapid thaw.
	   The overall World Cup leader Martin Schmitt of Germany, who won
the initial three events of the season, didn't compete, prefering
to practice at home instead.

U.S. expats in Gabon shocked by killing of Peace Corps volunteer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ U.S. diplomats and aid workers in Gabon
attended a memorial service in the capital Saturday to mourn a
Peace Corps volunteer who police said was raped and stabbed to
death two days earlier.
	   The partially-naked body of Karen Phillips, 37, was discovered
in the forest about 200 meters from her home in the logging town of
Oyem, about 190 miles (320 kilometers) northwest of the capital, a
police spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
	   Three people were arrested on Friday but there identities had
not been released and it was not clear if they knew the victim.
	   Phillips, a former charity worker in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
arrived in this Central African country in June on a two-year
assignment as a volunteer agriculture project management officer
and part-time English teacher, according to Peace Corps manager
Paulette Korazemo.
	   ``We are shocked and horrified to see that someone who came to
this country to work for the people was killed by some of the
people,'' Korazemo said.
	   It was the first violent death in the Peace Corp's 31-year
history in Gabon.
	   There are several dozen Peace Corps workers in the country, and
two remain in Oyem. The Peace Corps has no immediate plans to
evacuate its volunteers or take other protective measures, Korazemo
said.
	   ``We are waiting for the result of the police investigation,''
she said. ``There is sadness and shock surely, but no one has
expressed the desire to leave.''
	   High-level government officials and ordinary Gabonese people
``who knew Karen or knew of her'' have flooded the Peace Corps
office with expressions of sympathy and regret, she added.
	   ``The response has been overwhelming. Gabonese people are as
shocked as we are,'' Korazemo said.
	   Phillips is survived by her mother and father in the
Philadelphia area.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In apparent anticipation of new elections,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on Israelis to
choose a strong leader when he attended a soccer game Saturday in
Jerusalem.
	   Netanyahu has said that he will call elections for April _ 18
months early _ if the parliament, the Knesset, does not approve his
handling of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process in a vote Monday.
	   The prime minister is slated to ask the Knesset to support
several conditions he has demanded of the Palestinians before
Israel carries out another promised troop withdrawal from parts of
the West Bank.
	   Regardless of the result of the vote, a motion for early
elections submitted by the opposition Labor Party is practically
guaranteed to pass on the same day.
	   Nationalists in Netanyahu's fragile coalition have threatened to
support the opposition's motion to voice their displeasure with the
Wye River land-for-security accord Netanyahu signed with the
Palestinians in October.
	   ``The basic strength of this people is that it wants a strong
government and a strong prime minister to win,'' Netanyahu told
Israel radio at Jerusalem's Teddy Stadium.
	   ``And I know we will continue and will receive the mandate from
the people,'' Netanyahu added.
	   Labor Party leader Ehud Barak opened his campaign Thursday for
the elections slated for April with an emphasis on social issues,
which have typically taken a back seat to the peace process in
national elections.
	   Barak, whose party began the Israel-Palestinian peace process in
1993, pledged to implement the Wye River Memorandum.
	   Netanyahu and Barak have come out neck-in-neck in polls in
recent months. But surveys taken in recent days have found that
Barak leads by about five percentage points.
	   The peace policies of Netanyahu and Barak, a former army chief
of staff, are seen as largely identical with a strong emphasis by
both on Israel's need for security.
	   Taking a similar line of his campaign in 1996, Netanyahu said at
the game that he would never divide Jerusalem. Israel captured east
Jerusalem in 1967.
	   ``United Jerusalem will always stay united and always stay in
the hands of Israel,'' Netanyahu said.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a future state
in east Jerusalem and vehemently oppose Israeli settlement there.

Mexican television star quits Televisa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ One of Latin America's most famous television
personalities, Raul Velasco, says he is quitting the TV network
where he worked for 29 years.
	   ``I do not have conflicts with Televisa, but today I present my
resignation,'' Velasco said in a statement carried by newspapers
Saturday.
	   Velasco hosted the popular variety show ``Always on Sunday'' for
28 years until April, when he left to undergo a liver transplant
forced by hepatitis C.
	   After receiving the transplant in Houston, he returned to
Mexico. But since then he was unable to secure any regular spot on
Televisa, Latin America's largest television network.
	   ``Televisa is not the same anymore. Working there no longer
holds the mystique it did 20 years ago. I have not been able to
adjust to that,'' he was quoted as saying by the daily Reforma.
	   He said he presented his resignation by fax because he was
unable to arrange an appointment with the head of the network,
Emilio Azcarraga Jean.
	   There was no word on Velasco's future plans.
	   While directing ``Always on Sunday,'' Velasco helped launch the
careers of musicians as Julio Iglesias, Luis Miguel and Juan
Gabriel.

Police and students clash outside U.S. Embassy in Rome
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian police clashed with hundreds of youths
advancing on the U.S. Embassy here Saturday evening to protest the
bombings of Iraq.
	   Reports by RAI, the Italian state TV network, and by the Italian
news agency ANSA, said that about 500 youths headed toward the
Embassy complex at the top of Via Veneto after they broke away from
a march of tens of thousands of high school and university students
who were in the capital to protest against proposals to use tax
money to help private schools.
	   With arms raised and singing ``Bella Ciao,'' the ``anthem'' of
Italian communists, the youths started pressing up against police
barriers, ANSA reported. Police charged, and both sides briefly
scuffled, the report said.
	   No arrests were reported.
	   Buses and other traffic were diverted from the hilly, winding
road, which was once the heart of Roman nightlife during the
``Dolce Vita'' days of the 1960s.
	   One of two Italian parliamentary deputies in the demonstration,
Paolo Cento of the Greens party, said he would demand that the
interior minister report on what happened.
	   ``You can't deny the right to show anger against the war,''
Cento was quoted as saying.
	   Earlier in the day, other groups of demonstrators, then
pro-and-con, took up positions outside the Embassy.
	   Leading those backing the U.S.-British airstrikes was Marco
Panella, a former Radical party politician who contended the
American action helped favor freedom for Iraqis. Opposing him were
the heirs of a neo-fascist group, the Italian Social Movement.
	   Panella's group later claimed that the rightwing militants tried
to rip away the American flags they were carrying.
	   Italy's president and premier have strongly denounced the
airstrikes.
	   On Saturday, Premier Massimo D'Alema, a former Communist,
demanded that the bombings cease. The Iraqi crisis ``needs
political solutions, certainly not bombings. Our position is that
of giving back to the U.N. its centrality,'' D'Alema said.
	   The harsh anti-American assessment by those in Italian
government threatened to hurt traditionally good relations between
the two NATO allies.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's vice president declared Saturday
that the Baghdad regime will end all dealings with the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees weapons inspections, in response to the
American and British air strikes.
	   Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly before a
half-dozen loud blasts rocked the capital, indicating that the
fourth wave of punishing missile strikes was under way.
	   Witnesses said that three struck near Al-Mustansiriya University
in central Baghdad and that smoke could be seen rising from the
area. It was not immediately clear what the missiles hit.
	   Trails of smoke also could be seen rising from a building near
the city's center.
	   Iraq has been taking a beating since overnight
Wednesday-Thursday, when U.S. and British forces launched an air
offensive to punish the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
for obstructing the work of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said about 90 targets had been struck in Iraq so far and
that some were hit more than once.
	   ``I am very pleased by the result of our strikes,'' he said.
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen, meanwhile, said the missiles
had inflicted ``significant damage.'' He declined to say when the
campaign would end, saying: ``It will stop when the president
orders it to stop.''
	   Ramadan told a news conference that ``the Special Commission is
now behind us. Its mission is over.''
	   He repeated Iraq's allegation that UNSCOM was a tool of the
Americans, adding: ``Its only mission in Iraq now is to find a
cover for the genitals of those who want to carry out aggression
against Iraq.''
	   The implications of an Iraqi decision to shut down U.N.
inspections are grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles. It
also is responsible for setting up a long-range monitoring program
to ensure that Iraq doesn't rebuild its lethal arsenal.
	   Destruction of the weapons was mandated by the U.N. Security
Council resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Before the vice president began speaking, gun batteries on
rooftops sent tracer shells streaking across the sky shortly after
sundown, as Muslims were breaking their fast on the first day of
the holy month of Ramadan.
	   Sirens wailed a warning for citizens to take cover.
	   The previous attack ended shortly before dawn on Saturday and
had appeared to be the toughest yet against Baghdad.
	   Ramadan declined to give casualty figures, but said that the
number of civilians killed ``was 10 times more than military men.''
	   He said that 12 students died and many more were wounded Friday
night when a missile hit a dormitory in the northern province of
Tameem.
	   The government said earlier that 25 people were killed and 75
injured in the first two nights of attacks. On Saturday, the
state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more people died and 21 were
wounded in a missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the
northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to
lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten
its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Ramadan repeated Iraq's contention that the real goal was to
eliminate Saddam.
	   ``I am telling those who were promised the elimination of our
great leader that the symbol of the nation, its lofty example, will
remain,'' Ramadan said.
	   He added: ``We will fight to the last citizen, and history will
glorify us.''
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the missile attacks late
Friday and early Saturday was heavy and that a number of buildings
in the center of the capital _ including palaces, security
headquarters and offices of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said a missile had damaged an
historic Abbasid palace in Baghdad, parts of which date to the year
1180.
	   Ramadan focused on civilian sites that were hit, confirming
earlier reports that telephone communications with southern
provinces had been broken. He also charged that the United States
and Britain had hit an electricity plant and destroyed a factory
that had been inspected by UNSCOM.
	   In London, British officials showed videotapes of bomb hits on
Republican Guard facilities in southern Iraq, and emphasized that
the Guard was a key target of the operation.
	   ``Those are the people that surround him, keep him in office,
have their own system of repression, and of course have been
instrumental in putting together the means of concealing the
weapons of mass destruction,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said.
	   In a radio address from the White House, U.S. President Bill
Clinton told listeners ``I believe the mission is going well.''
	   He added: ``Where do we go from here? We stand ready to use
force again'' should Saddam threaten his neighbors or attempt to
reconstitute his weaponry.
	   Also Saturday, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led
by the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   The inspectors, who had been working in Iraq since 1991,
withdrew on Wednesday, a day after U.N. inspection chief Richard
Butler told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq was not
cooperating. That became the trigger for the U.S.-British attacks.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the Security Council will
not lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

	   LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) _ U.S. diplomats and aid workers in Gabon
attended a memorial service in the capital Saturday to mourn a

	   The partially-naked body of Karen Phillips, 37, was discovered

Protests in Arab world over attacks on Iraq

 &UR; Eds: ADDS United Arab Emirates criticism grafs 8-9 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, protesters across the Arab
world joined Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes
on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The United Arab Emirates' minister of defense criticized the
strikes for taking place during the Islamic fasting month.
	   ``I have mixed feelings of sadness and anger for seeing strikes
against Iraq these days as we welcome the holy month of Ramadan,''
Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum said in a statement carried by
the official WAM news agency.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, protesters across the Arab
world joined Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes
on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The United Arab Emirates' minister of defense criticized the
strikes for taking place during the Islamic fasting month.
	   ``I have mixed feelings of sadness and anger for seeing strikes
against Iraq these days as we welcome the holy month of Ramadan,''
Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum said in a statement carried by
the official WAM news agency.

Substitute's strike seals victory for PSV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ In their last match before the
Dutch league's winter break, PSV Eindhoven beat Willem II Tilburg
1-0 Saturday thanks to a 61st-minute strike by substitute Arnold
Bruggink.
	   Bruggink hit the cross bar shortly after scoring and the Dutch
league's top scorer, PSV's Ruud van Nistelrooy also hit the bar but
failed to add to his 16 league goals this season.
	   Struggling De Graafschap Doetinchem came back from a goal down
to earn a draw with AZ Alkmaar despite being reduced to 10 men.
	   AZ took the lead in the 21st minute through Max Huiberts and De
Graafschap appeared deep in trouble in the 40th minute when
midfielder Michael Nok was sent off. But the ``Super Farmers'' from
Doetinchem dug deep and equalized just before half time through
defender Olaf Lindenbergh.
	   In the day's other match, second-placed Vitesse Arnhem shared a
0-0 draw with 6th-placed FC Twente.
	   On Friday night SC Heerenveen missed a chance to go level on
points with Vitesse when it drew with 13th-placed MVV Maastricht.
	   Ali Elkhattabi gave Heerenveen the lead in the 51st minute but
Brazilian Emerson scored in the 70th minute to level the match at
1-1.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, protesters across the Arab
world joined Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes
on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus, where protesters broke into and damaged the U.S.
ambassador's residence.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The United Arab Emirates' minister of defense criticized the
strikes for taking place during the Islamic fasting month.
	   ``I have mixed feelings of sadness and anger for seeing strikes
against Iraq these days as we welcome the holy month of Ramadan,''
Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum said in a statement carried by
the official WAM news agency.
	   In a rare protest in the Syrian capital, thousands marched
through downtown Damascus Saturday, and about 1,000 people _ most
of them students _ attacked the U.S. Embassy, its nearby residence
and the American Cultural Center.
	   Rioters also threw stones at the British Embassy in Damascus and
broke into the British Council, where they damaged furniture and
scattered library books.
	   At the U.S. residence, more than 100 people climbed over the
wall, broke down the front door and stormed inside, destroying
everything in their path _ furniture, windows, the ambassador's
private office. They knocked books on the floor, and destroyed
kitchen cabinets and bookcases.
	   They also attacked the car of Ambassador Ryan Crocker,
shattering the lights and windows. Crocker's wife, Christine, was
in the house at the time but was not hurt.
	   At the embassy, U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas from the roof
to disperse the stone-throwing crowd. Three protesters managed to
enter the compound, climb the walls and haul down and burn the
American flag.
	   Syrian security forces dispersed the mobs after about six hours.
	   In New York, a U.S. State Department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the United States was ``deeply
concerned'' about Syria's failure to protect the ambassador's
residence.
	   ``The ambassador has waged a very strong protest with the
government of the Syria Arab Republic,'' the official said. ``We
have protested in the strongest possible terms to the Syrian
ambassador in Washington, D.C., as well.''

Initial reaction muted to impeachment vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton's impeachment vote produced
little official reaction on Saturday, but TV bulletins worldwide
focused on the battle in the House of Representatives over his
future.
	   A German newspaper lamented the loss to American prestige, while
a senior aid to Israel's prime minister said that the impeachment
vote would likely have little influence on the Middle East peace
process.
	   The British Broadcasting Corp. World Service TV and the Sky TV,
Britain's two satellite TV news services, both led their news
bulletins with running coverage of the impeachment vote and the
political fallout in the United States, interspersing coverage with
pictures from Baghdad under a fourth night of U.S. and British
airstrikes.
	   The London-based Middle East Broadcasting Corp., which
broadcasts in Arabic throughout the Middle East, ran the story of
Clinton's impeachment second after the latest reports from Iraq.
	   On Friday in Iraq, Al-Thawra, the paper of Saddam's ruling Baath
Party, headlined its anti-American editorial ``Operation Monica,''
and said that the airstrikes aimed to deflect attention from
Clinton's political problems at home and his relationship with the
former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
	   The House of Representatives impeached Clinton on Saturday for
obstructing justice and lying under oath about his sexual affair
with Ms. Lewinsky, voting largely along party lines to send his
case to the Senate.
	   It was only the second presidential impeachment in American
history.
	   Saying that the vote was an internal affair for the United
States, British Prime Minister Tony Blair, the president's
strongest ally outside the United States, said he would not comment
on the impeachment proceedings. ``That's not right for me to do
so,'' Blair said at a news conference Saturday.
	   In Israel, David Bar-Illan, aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said: ``Until now, none of this domestic embroilment has
affected the administration's involvement in the peace process and
we don't expect it to now.''
	   Calling the impeachment vote ``horrible theater,'' the Berliner
Morgenpost daily newspaper, said in a Sunday editorial that the
Lewinsky affair had ``poisoned the political climate of the United
States'' and damaged the country's standing abroad.
	   ``Already the damage for the image and believability of the
United States is alarming,'' the editorial said, noting that of the
seven Republicans who voted in 1868 against the impeachment of an
early president, Andrew Johnson, ``none were reelected.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ U.S. and British forces are ``well on course to
meet our objectives,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday, but
he said attacks in Iraq would continue until military goals are
achieved.
	   British jets based in Kuwait were joining in a fourth day of

completed their missions successfully,'' the spokesman, speaking on
conditions of customary anonymity, said.

Some media outlets reopen after being closed over Iraq material

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with AP and Orbit Gaza offices opened &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian authorities allowed several
Palestinian media outlets to reopen Saturday after closing them a
day earlier over coverage of pro-Iraq rallies or for broadcasting
what was deemed to be pro-Iraqi material.
	   Two other news offices, including the Gaza City bureau of The
Associated Press, were opened Saturday night after they were closed
on Friday to prevent what a police official said would be
violations of ``national interests.''
	   On Friday, Palestinian police detained nine journalists,
including some working for foreign news organizations, who had
covered pro-Iraq demonstrations in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.
	   Five local Palestinian TV stations and one radio station in the
West Bank were closed down, but all were given permission to reopen
Saturday. One, however, refused to do so until given an explanation
for being closed down in the first place.
	   Samir Kumsia, the owner of Mahed TV in Bethlehem, said: ``They
have to give me a logical explanation. Until then I will stay
closed. This is not a civilized manner in which to deal with us.''
	   In addition to the AP Gaza City office, the office of Orbit
Satellite Service, an Israeli-based agency that transmits TV
footage, was reopened Saturday.
	   A Palestinian police official, Col. Mohammed Hindi, told the AP
that the foreign news organizations had been closed ``to prevent
any material from being transmitted from the offices to the world
that could violate Palestinian national interests.''
	   Earlier Saturday, the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said in
a statement that the closing of the offices and the detention of
the journalists was a ``serious violation'' of their basic rights.
The syndicate said it would stage a strike as well as a a sit-in at
the Palestinian legislature on Monday.
	   The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists also
protested the curbs on coverage. In a letter to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, it urged Arafat to allow the offices to re-open and
denounced ``attempts to silence independent journalism in flagrant
violation of the right to free expression.''
	   The Foreign Press Association in Israel also said it was sending
a letter of protest to Arafat's Palestinian Authority.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Pelting stones, burning flags and even
breaking into a U.S. ambassador's home, protesters across the Arab
world joined Saturday in a bitter wave of anger over the airstrikes
on Iraq.
	   A common theme of the protests was that all Arabs _ not just
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein _ are being targeted by the U.S. and
British attacks.
	   ``The aggression on Iraq is an aggression on the whole Arab
nation,'' said Aziza Fadhel, a university student in the Syrian
capital, Damascus, where protesters broke into and damaged the U.S.
ambassador's residence.
	   That was exactly the idea U.S. President Bill Clinton was trying
to fight in a message offered for broadcast in Arab countries.
	   Saddam ``threatens Muslims and non-Muslims alike,'' Clinton said
in the videotaped message. ``We had to act.''
	   But there was little empathy with that position.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a key Arab ally during the
Gulf War, sent a message to Clinton urging him to halt the attacks
that began Thursday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The United Arab Emirates' minister of defense criticized the
strikes for taking place during the Islamic fasting month.
	   ``I have mixed feelings of sadness and anger for seeing strikes
against Iraq these days as we welcome the holy month of Ramadan,''
Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum said in a statement carried by
the official WAM news agency.
	   In a rare protest in the Syrian capital, thousands marched
through downtown Damascus Saturday, and about 1,000 people _ most
of them students _ attacked the U.S. Embassy, its nearby residence
and the American Cultural Center.
	   Rioters also threw stones at the British Embassy in Damascus and
broke into the British Council, where they damaged furniture and
scattered library books.
	   At the U.S. residence, more than 100 people climbed over the
wall, broke down the front door and stormed inside, destroying
everything in their path _ furniture, windows, the ambassador's
private office. They knocked books on the floor, and destroyed
kitchen cabinets and bookcases.
	   They also attacked the car of Ambassador Ryan Crocker,
shattering the lights and windows. Crocker's wife, Christine, was
in the house at the time but was not hurt.
	   At the embassy, U.S. Marine guards fired tear gas from the roof
to disperse the stone-throwing crowd. Three protesters managed to
enter the compound, climb the walls and haul down and burn the
American flag.
	   Syrian security forces dispersed the mobs after about six hours.
	   In New York, a U.S. State Department official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the United States was ``deeply
concerned'' about Syria's failure to protect the ambassador's
residence.
	   ``The ambassador has waged a very strong protest with the
government of the Syria Arab Republic,'' the official said. ``We
have protested in the strongest possible terms to the Syrian
ambassador in Washington, D.C., as well.''

More than 100 injured as pro-Iraq protests flare despite ban

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Shouts of ``Death to America!'' rang
out at angry pro-Iraq marches staged by Palestinians on Saturday in
the West Bank. Violent clashes in their aftermath left more than
100 Palestinians hurt.
	   Yasser Arafat's government, meanwhile, said it would send a
special envoy to Baghdad to try to help end the crisis in Iraq,
which has been pounded by U.S. and British air strikes to punish
Saddam Hussein for obstructing U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The display of Palestinian frustration and fury _ exacerbated by
Israel's refusal to carry out a troop withdrawal promised under the
Wye River peace accords _ stood in stark contrast to the warm
welcome U.S. President Bill Clinton had received earlier in the
week in the West Bank and Gaza strip.
	   The main fighting came in the West Bank town of Hebron, where
more than 3,000 Palestinians, some masked, marched waving Iraqi
flags and portraits of Saddam. Afterward, hundreds of Palestinians
broke away from the main march and hurled stones and firebombs at
Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish settlements in the center of
Hebron.
	   The soldiers fired rubber bullets at the marchers, injuring 104
of them, hospital officials said. Four were seriously hurt,
according to doctors at Hebron's Aliya Hospital.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months in the
Palestinian lands, even including demonstrations that rocked the
West Bank last week over Palestinian demands for release of
prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   The rally in Hebron and smaller ones in the West Bank town of
Jenin and the Gaza Strip town of Rafah came in defiance of a
Palestinian police ban on pro-Iraq demonstrations.
	   In Rafah, about 400 Palestinian protesters burned U.S. and
British flags. Police dispersed them, but without using force.
	   In Jenin, about 2,500 Palestinians chanted ``Death to America''
but refrained from burning any U.S. flags. Afterward, the marchers
approached the Jewish settlement of Ginat and threw stones at
Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Seven Palestinians were injured.
	   The fighting in Hebron took place amid winding, cramped downtown
streets, where soldiers and protesters ducked into shops and
doorways for cover. At one point, with stones raining down on them,
about 20 Israeli soldiers grouped and charged stone-throwers,
firing rubber bullets as they ran forward.
	   After two hours of intense fighting, Palestinian police moved in
and kept the demonstrators away from Israeli positions, and the
stone-throwers eventually dispersed. Thirty of those hurt were
hospitalized and the rest treated at the scene.
	   The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership.
On the one hand, it is anxious to rein in the unmitigated backing
Palestinians gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that
set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   At the same time, however, Arafat's government apparently wants
to allow some outlet for Palestinian street sentiment in favor of
Iraq.
	   At its meeting Friday night, the Palestinian Cabinet called on
the international community to use diplomatic means to address the
Iraq dispute. It said the Palestinian Authority would send an envoy
to aid in efforts to ``stop the destruction in which the Iraqi
people are paying the price.''
	   The Cabinet also condemned Israel's demand that the Palestinians
take more steps before the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would keep its part of the Wye River pact.
	   ``The Palestinian leadership...has implemented all of its
obligations,'' it said in a statement, calling the Israeli stance a
``dangerous setback.''
	   On Friday, after a series of pro-Iraq rallies at which U.S.
flags were burned, Palestinian authorities declared such
demonstrations banned and briefly detained some journalists _
including some working for foreign media outlets _ who had covered
the pro-Iraq unrest.
	   The Gaza City bureaus of The Associated Press and the
Israeli-based Orbit Satellite Service were closed down by the
authorities on Friday but allowed to reopen on Saturday.
	   Six Palestinian TV and radio stations in the West Bank that had
also been closed a day earlier were reopened Saturday.
	   The Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a strike starting
Saturday to protest the curbs on their coverage, and said they
would stage a sit-in at the Palestinian legislative council on
Monday.

	   Key developments in the airstrikes against Iraq:
	   ___
	   _U.S. and British warplanes launch a fourth wave of strikes on
Iraq; A half-dozen loud blasts rocked the capital, indicating
missile hits.
	   _A defiant Iraq declared it would cut off all dealings with
United Nations weapons inspectors.
	   _In a radio address from the White House, President Clinton told
listeners ``I believe the mission is going well.''
	   _At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters
the airstrikes had inflicted ``significant damage'' on Iraq's
military systems. He said U.S. analysts believe the assault had set
back Iraq's ballistic missile program by one year.
	   _Iraqi vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan focused on civilian
sites hit in the strikes, confirming earlier reports that telephone
communications with southern provinces had been broken. He also
said that the United States and Britain had hit an electricity
plant and destroyed a factory that had been inspected by the UNSCOM
weapons inspectors.
	   _State-run Iraqi News Agency said five people died and 21 were
wounded in a missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the
northern town of Kirkuk. The government said earlier that 25 people
were killed and 75 injured in the first two nights of attacks.
	   _ A second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by the USS
Carl Vinson _ moved into the Persian Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.

according to doctors at Hebron's Aliya Hospital.
	   The unrest was among the most intense in months in the
Palestinian lands, even including demonstrations that rocked the
West Bank last week over Palestinian demands for release of
prisoners held in Israeli jails.
	   The rally in Hebron and smaller ones in the West Bank town of
Jenin and the Gaza Strip town of Rafah came in defiance of a
Palestinian police ban on pro-Iraq demonstrations.
	   In Rafah, about 400 Palestinian protesters burned U.S. and
British flags. Police dispersed them, but without using force.
	   In Jenin, about 2,500 Palestinians chanted ``Death to America''
but refrained from burning any U.S. flags. Afterward, the marchers
approached the Jewish settlement of Ginat and threw stones at
Israeli troops, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Seven Palestinians were injured.
	   The fighting in Hebron took place amid winding, cramped downtown
streets, where soldiers and protesters ducked into shops and
doorways for cover. At one point, with stones raining down on them,
about 20 Israeli soldiers grouped and charged stone-throwers,
firing rubber bullets as they ran forward.
	   After two hours of intense fighting, Palestinian police moved in
and kept the demonstrators away from Israeli positions, and the
stone-throwers eventually dispersed. Thirty of those hurt were
hospitalized and the rest treated at the scene.
	   The Iraq crisis poses a dilemma for the Palestinian leadership.
On the one hand, it is anxious to rein in the unmitigated backing
Palestinians gave Saddam during the 1991 Gulf War _ a stance that
set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   At the same time, however, Arafat's government apparently wants
to allow some outlet for Palestinian street sentiment in favor of
Iraq.
	   At its meeting Friday night, the Palestinian Cabinet called on
the international community to use diplomatic means to address the
Iraq dispute. It said the Palestinian Authority would send an envoy
to aid in efforts to ``stop the destruction in which the Iraqi
people are paying the price.''
	   The Cabinet also condemned Israel's demand that the Palestinians
take more steps before the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu would keep its part of the Wye River pact.
	   ``The Palestinian leadership...has implemented all of its
obligations,'' it said in a statement, calling the Israeli stance a
``dangerous setback.''
	   On Friday, after a series of pro-Iraq rallies at which U.S.
flags were burned, Palestinian authorities declared such
demonstrations banned and briefly detained some journalists _
including some working for foreign media outlets _ who had covered
the pro-Iraq unrest.
	   The Gaza City bureaus of The Associated Press and the
Israeli-based Orbit Satellite Service were closed down by the
authorities on Friday but allowed to reopen on Saturday.
	   Six Palestinian TV and radio stations in the West Bank that had
also been closed a day earlier were reopened Saturday.
	   The Palestinian journalists' syndicate called a strike starting
Saturday to protest the curbs on their coverage, and said they
would stage a sit-in at the Palestinian legislative council on
Monday.

With commissioner pessimistic, players still optimistic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ In this seaside, gambling
resort, everybody thinks everybody else is bluffing. It was no
different Saturday with a bunch of American professional basketball
players around.
	   Remaining steadfast in their belief that there will be a
settlement that ends the National Basketball Association lockout
and saves the season, the players said commissioner David Stern's
threat of no basketball was as weak as a dlrs 5 chip at a dlrs 100
blackjack table.
	   ``Everyone wants to make it seem like a false sense of security
on the players' behalf,'' said Karl Malone, one of 16 current and
former All-Stars who played in a charity exhibition game at the
Convention Center Saturday night. ``I think it will end in the next
week. Sometimes when it's Christmas, you're in a giving mood. We've
been doing it all summer; maybe it's their turn now.''
	   Nearly all the players involved in the charity game were
veterans and millionaires who are set for life financially.
Consequently, their optimism might not be a reflection of the
feelings among the broader population of locked out NBA players.
	   Still, as they offered reassurances, they seemed genuine in
their belief that it would be too risky for the owners to imperil
the value of their franchises by scrapping an entire season. There
has been talk that a rival league would be formed and the NBA would
never recover.
	   ``My man went on vacation, so obviously he's not too worried
about it,'' Houston forward Charles Barkley said in reference to
Stern's much-publicized holiday trip to Aspen, Colorado.
	   ``This is about money, a lot of money. The owners are greedy and
the players are greedy. I can sympathize with both. I don't care
about either one of them. I just want it to get resolved because
it's not good for the game of basketball.''
	   ``If he wants to do it, do it. If he cancels the season, he
cancels the season,'' Seattle guard Gary Payton said sarcastically.
``He's going to hurt himself and he's going to hurt us and the fans
will be hurt, so that would be crazy.''
	   NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said Stern was expected to leave New
York Saturday but would be able to return within a few hours if
necessary.
	   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik said there was no news to
report.
	   Brienza also said no undue significance should be attached to
Stern's statement Friday that the cancellation of the season was
``virtually inevitable.''
	   ``It's nothing different,'' Brienza said. ``You could go back to
his comments after the last full negotiating session (Dec. 3) when
he said it was more probable than not that the season won't be
played.''
	   Union director Billy Hunter also dismissed the statement.
	   ``It's no different from what he has been saying,'' Hunter said.
``And my position hasn't changed. We are prepared to compromise and
we are prepared to negotiate.''
	   The first 2 1-2 months of the season already have been lost and
a deal needs to be reached soon in order to save the season. The
opposing sides are fighting over the rules for dividing about dlrs
2 billion in annual revenue.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Under
American labor law, without a contract _ or in this case a
collective bargaining agreement, owners can prohibit _ or lock out
_ players from working until a deal is reached.
	   The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) is the ground rules
which sets things like minimum salaries, pension and health
insurance benefits, roster limits and a salary cap.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is money. The owners
have insisted on maximum salary costs and the union has refused to
accept a ``hard'' salary cap.
	   The league has a limit each team can spend on salaries, but the
so-called ``Larry Bird'' exemption allows clubs to disregard the
cap to re-sign their own free agents. It virtually makes the salary
cap an invisible ceiling.
	   The problem comes down to how much of the dlrs 2 billion in
projected annual revenues should be dedicated to player salaries.
	   The club owners have asked for a 50-50 split, while the players
have tied many of their concessions to receiving 60 percent.

Marseille beats Le Havre to stay top but Bordeaux keeps in touch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Marseille goes into the winter break of the French
first division with a three-point lead over Bordeaux after beating
Le Havre 2-0 on Saturday.
	   Robert Pires, signed from Metz in pre-season, continued his fine
form with a goal in each half to clinch the points at the Stade
Velodrome.
	   Bordeaux thrashed Metz 6-0 - the biggest win of the season so
far - to stay in touch with the leader.
	   Lilian Laslandes scored a hatrick, while Johan Micoud scored
twice and Sylvain Wiltord another.
	   The race for the championship is a clear two-horse race with
Marseille on 47 points and Bordeaux on 44.
	   Lyon and Rennes are joint third on 32 points.
	   Lyon leapt to third place with a fine 1-0 win at Monaco, thanks
to a goal from Polish midfielder Jacek Bak.
	   Rennes picked up a 1-1 draw at Strasbourg.
	   Cedric Bardon scored a first half goal for Rennes, but Denni
Conteh equalized in the second half.
	   Powerhouse Paris Saint-Germain ended a catastrophic year with a
2-0 defeat at minnow Lorient.
	   To rub salt in the Parisians' wounds, Patrice Loko - sold by PSG
last month - scored both goals.
	   In other games: Bastia 2, Auxerre 0; Nancy 0, Lens 1; Sochaux 1,
Nantes 1; Toulouse 2, Montpellier 5.

Corporate sponsors watching Olympic scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By MATTHEW BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ As revelations keep arising of corruption
surrounding the bidding of the Olympics, the high-priced
constituency that finances the games is getting anxious.
	   Some corporate sponsors, who make millions of dollars on the
Olympics' revered reputation of honor and integrity, have urged
Olympic officials to hurry and fix any problems that threaten to
tarnish the image of the event.
	   ``We've expressed our concerns to the International Olympic
Committee and they assured us they will take swift and decisive
action and we will monitor them to ensure that,'' said Ben Deutch,
spokesman for Coca-Cola, a long and influential sponsor of the
Olympics.
	   The IOC has responded with an investigation into allegations of
its members selling their votes, with particular focus on Salt Lake
City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   On Friday, Salt Lake City Olympic organizers pledged that an
independent probe into the scandal would be undertaken and the
results made public no later than Feb. 11.
	   Leaders of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee didn't say they
had been pressured to resolve the controversy by the more than two
dozen top-level sponsors, who will cover more than dlrs 600 million
of the event's estimated dlrs 1.4 billion budget.
	   But the SLOC executive committee resolution calling for an
ethics probe was a clear indication that the demands of many
sponsors who want the issue dealt with quickly and in the open were
taken into consideration.
	   ``I think the steps taken today by the executive committee to
refer this matter to the ethics board will be a matter of
reassurance to sponsors,'' Frank Joklik, SLOC president and CEO,
said.
	   The U.S. Olympic Committee has suggested the possibility of
opening its own investigation into the Salt Lake bid. And the FBI
in Salt Lake confirmed that it, too, was reviewing the allegations
to determine whether to open a formal investigation.
	   While allegations of influence peddling and corruption in the
Olympic movement are not uncommon, this latest controversy is the
biggest scandal ever.
	   Charges of bribery and corruption by IOC members and so-called
agents who claim to buy and sell IOC votes have steadily escalated
since it was revealed three weeks ago that SLOC had paid the
college tuition of at least six relatives of IOC members when
bidding for the 2002 Winter Games.
	   The son of Libyan IOC member Bashir Attarabulsi, who is
attending Utah Valley State College, told a newspaper his father
would never sell his vote. He said the checks for tuition and books
stopped coming two weeks ago.
	   ``People think it is bribery. For us as Muslims, it is forbidden
and we would not accept that,'' Suhuel Attarabulsi, 26, was quoted
in a copyright story in Saturday's Deseret News. ``My dad, he knows
God is watching him all the time.''
	   But a senior IOC member, Marc Hodler of Switzerland, last
weekend claimed Salt Lake used the scholarships and other favors to
bribe IOC members. Later, he said Salt Lake and other recent bid
cities were the victims of extortion by greedy IOC members and
their agents, although he did not name names. IOC officials have
said Hodler has offered no evidence to prove his claims.
	   This past week more revelations cropped up daily of Salt Lake
bid officials currying favor with IOC members by offering expensive
gifts, such as skis and shotguns made in Utah, and performing
cosmetic surgery _ most of it at no cost to IOC members.
	   IOC rules limit the value of gifts to its members from bidding
cities to dlrs 150.
	   The IOC has reassured Salt Lake organizers that the 2002 Winter
Games will stay in Utah and sponsors are publicly holding back
judgment.
	   But sponsors agree the mounting allegations and admissions of
corruption in the Olympic bidding process make them uneasy about
their investment.
	   The Olympics have had the reputation of the highest standards of
true sportsmanship that companies bank on when they tout their ties
with the games, hoping the association with the event's ideals will
attract and keep customers.
	   ``As an Olympic sponsor, we are very concerned that the Olympics
keep the proper perspective and any allegation raises a concern,''
said Bill Berry, spokesman for Delta Air Lines, a sponsor of the
2002 Winter Games.

Iraq declares end to U.N. inspections as air strikes resume

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's vice president declared Saturday
that the Baghdad regime will end all dealings with the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees weapons inspections, in response to the
American and British air strikes.
	   Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly before a
half-dozen loud blasts rocked the capital, indicating that the
fourth wave of punishing missile strikes was underway.
	   Two of the missiles struck near the Labor and Social Affairs
Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter) hole into the earth, just 10
feet (3 meters) from the information office by the ministry gate.
	   The impact of the missiles, which struck at 9:45 p.m. (1845
GMT), shattered the windows of the small, one-story information
office.
	   Three night guards were injured in the blast, Iraqi officials
said.
	   A third missile shot past the ministry, a large complex of
several buildings. The ministry is responsible for social security,
pensions, prisons and benefits for the handicapped.
	   Iraqi officials, who escorted journalists to the area, would not
permit them to examine the site where the third missile struck.

Substitute's strike seals victory for PSV
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Substitute Arnold Bruggink scored
in the 61st minute and PSV Eindhoven ended its pre-winter break
campaign with a 1-0 victory over Willem II Tilburg on Saturday.
	   Bruggink hit the crossbar shortly after scoring and Ruud van
Nistelrooy also hit the bar but failed to add to his league-leading
total of 16 goals.
	   Struggling De Graafschap Doetinchem rallied from a goal down to
earn a 1-1 draw with AZ Alkmaar despite being reduced to 10 men for
the final 50 minutes.
	   AZ took the lead in the 21st minute through Max Huiberts, and De
Graafschap appeared deep in trouble when midfielder Michael Nok was
sent off in the 40th minute. But the Olaf Lindenbergh equalized
just before halftime and the ``Super Farmers'' from Doetinchem for
its ninth draw of the season.
	   In the day's other match, second-placed Vitesse Arnhem shared a
0-0 draw with sixth-placed FC Twente.
	   On Friday night, SC Heerenveen drew with 13th-placed MVV
Maastricht. 1-1.
	   Ali Elkhattabi gave Heerenveen the lead in the 51st minute but
Brazilian Emerson scored in the 70th minute to equalize.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's vice president declared Saturday
that the Baghdad regime will end all dealings with the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees weapons inspections, in response to the
American and British air strikes.
	   Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly before a
half-dozen loud blasts rocked the capital, indicating that the
fourth wave of punishing missile strikes was underway.
	   Two of the missiles struck near the Labor and Social Affairs
Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter) hole into the earth, just 10
feet (3 meters) from the information office by the ministry gate.
	   The impact of the missiles, which struck at 9:45 p.m. (1845
GMT), shattered the windows of the small, one-story information
office.
	   Three night guards were injured in the blast, Iraqi officials
said.
	   A third missile shot past the ministry, a large complex of
several buildings. The ministry is responsible for social security,
pensions, prisons and benefits for the handicapped.
	   Iraqi officials escorted journalists to the area but would not
permit them to examine the site where the third missile struck.

	   LONDON: Blair said.
	   ''Tonight, I can only tell you that our objectives have been
achieved. We set out to diminish and degrade Saddam's military
capability, and we have done so,'' Blair said in a short statement
outside his official office at No. 10 Downing Street.
	   ''Substantial damage has been inflicted upon his air defense
systems, the command and control system for his armed forces,
missile production capability, and the systems which could be used
for chemical and biological warfare.''
	   Blair, speaking at the same time as President Bill Clinton was
addressing the American people, said that ''real'' damage had also
been done to Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, Iraq's best trained
troops.
	   Blair said that U.S. and British attacks had been targeted
''with the greatest precision to minimize civilian casualties to
the greatest extent possible. We regret deeply any loss of civilian
life there has been.''

Jets win division with 17-10 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: WILL be UPDATED with late game. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Vinny Testaverde threw for two touchdowns and
the New York Jets took advantage of Buffalo's sloppiness to win
17-10 Saturday and capture its first U.S. National Football League
divisional title.
	   It gave New York (11-4) the American Football Conference's East
Division crown _ the last time it won a division was in 1969, when
it was part of the old American Football League _ and the inside
track for a first-round playoffs bye.
	   If Jacksonville loses either of its final two games, the Jets
will move directly to the second round of the playoffs.
	   The Bills (9-6), who lost a fumble and an interception, dropped
several passes and failed to stay in-bounds on others, must try for
a ``wild-card'' berth to make the playoffs. They were hurt by
Victor Green's controversial interception on a tipped ball with
3:52 to go; replays showed he dropped the ball.
	   Buffalo has more victories (44) against the Jets than any other
team. The Bills have been particularly dominant at the newly named
Ralph Wilson Stadium, where they had won three straight and eight
of their past 10 against the Jets.
	   Testaverde completed a 71-yard touchdown pass to Dedric Ward in
the third quarter for the winning points and also connected with
Wayne Chrebet for a 7-yarder on the Jets' first drive.
	   He finished 14-for-23 for 184 yards and was not intercepted on a
blustery day that clearly affected Buffalo's Doug Flutie. He was
14-for-38 for 220 yards.

	   LONDON: has been.
	   Blair warned that Britain and the U.S. ''remain ready to act
again'' if Saddam's Iraqi regime continued to pose a threat to
security.
	   ``I say to the Iraqi people, our quarrel is not and never has
been with you. We have a common enemy in Saddam. But whilst he
remains in power we will remain determined to prevent him abusing
that power and putting at risk the stability of his region and the
world.''
	   The fourth wave of airstrikes were unleashed Saturday as Iraq
officially cut off all cooperation with United Nations weapons
inspections, and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began.
	   Blair said that an important reason for halting the action was
due to British and U.S. sensitivity to Ramadan.
	   Earlier Saturday, British officials showed videotapes of bomb
hits on Republican Guard facilities in southern Iraq, and
emphasized that the Guard was a key target of the operation.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's vice president declared Saturday
that the Baghdad regime will end all dealings with the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees weapons inspections, in response to the
American and British air strikes.
	   Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly before a
half-dozen loud blasts rocked the capital, indicating that the
fourth wave of punishing missile strikes was underway.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton announced that the U.S.
and British offensive was over for now, but added that the United
States was ready to resume airstrikes if it sees Iraq is building
weapons of mass destruction.
	   In the attack Saturday night, two of the missiles struck near
the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter)
hole into the earth, just 10 feet (3 meters) from the information
office by the ministry gate.
	   The impact of the missiles, which struck at 9:45 p.m. (1845
GMT), shattered the windows of the small, one-story information
office.
	   Three night guards were injured in the blast, Iraqi officials
said.
	   A third missile shot past the ministry, a large complex of
several buildings. The ministry is responsible for social security,
pensions, prisons and benefits for the handicapped.
	   Iraqi officials, who escorted journalists to the area, would not
permit them to examine the site where the third missile struck.
	   Iraq has been taking a beating since overnight
Wednesday-Thursday, when U.S. and British forces launched an air
offensive to punish the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
for obstructing the work of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said about 90 targets had been struck in Iraq so far and
that some were hit more than once.
	   ``I am very pleased by the result of our strikes,'' he said.
	   Ramadan told a news conference that ``the Special Commission is
now behind us. Its mission is over.''
	   He repeated Iraq's allegation that UNSCOM was a tool of the
Americans, adding: ``Its only mission in Iraq now is to find a
cover for the genitals of those who want to carry out aggression
against Iraq.''
	   In Washington, Clinton said the United States would welcome the
return of UNSCOM arms inspectors to Baghdad, but only if they
received complete cooperation to do their job.
	   He said the attacks had inflicted ``significant damage'' on
Iraq's weapons programs and command structure. He added the United
States would be vigilant in ensuring Iraq is not renewing weapons
production and would keep its forces in the Gulf.
	   ``We will maintain a strong military presence in the area and we
will remain ready to use it,'' he said from the White House.
	   Clinton also said his government still believed Iraq would be
better off with a leader other than Saddam. In London, Prime
Minister Tony Blair made a similar statement about an end to
British and U.S. attacks.
	   The implications of an Iraqi decision to shut down U.N.
inspections are grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles. It
also is responsible for setting up a long-range monitoring program
to ensure that Iraq doesn't rebuild its lethal arsenal.
	   Destruction of the weapons was mandated by the U.N. Security
Council resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Before the vice president began speaking, gun batteries on
rooftops sent tracer shells streaking across the sky shortly after
sundown, as Muslims were breaking their fast on the first day of
the holy month of Ramadan.
	   Sirens wailed a warning for citizens to take cover.
	   The previous attack ended shortly before dawn on Saturday and
had appeared to be the toughest yet against Baghdad.
	   Ramadan declined to give casualty figures, but said that the
number of civilians killed ``was 10 times more than military men.''
	   He said that 12 students died and many more were wounded Friday
night when a missile hit a dormitory in the northern province of
Tameem.
	   The government said earlier that 25 people were killed and 75
injured in the first two nights of attacks. On Saturday, the
state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more people died and 21 were
wounded in a missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the
northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to
lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten
its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Ramadan repeated Iraq's contention that the real goal was to
eliminate Saddam.
	   ``I am telling those who were promised the elimination of our
great leader that the symbol of the nation, its lofty example, will
remain,'' Ramadan said.
	   He added: ``We will fight to the last citizen, and history will
glorify us.''
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the missile attacks late
Friday and early Saturday was heavy and that a number of buildings
in the center of the capital _ including palaces, security
headquarters and offices of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said a missile had damaged an
historic Abbasid palace in Baghdad, parts of which date to the year
1180.
	   Ramadan focused on civilian sites that were hit, confirming
earlier reports that telephone communications with southern
provinces had been broken. He also charged that the United States
and Britain had hit an electricity plant and destroyed a factory
that had been inspected by UNSCOM.
	   In London, British officials showed videotapes of bomb hits on
Republican Guard facilities in southern Iraq, and emphasized that
the Guard was a key target of the operation.
	   ``Those are the people that surround him, keep him in office,
have their own system of repression, and of course have been
instrumental in putting together the means of concealing the
weapons of mass destruction,'' Blair said.
	   Also Saturday, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led
by the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   The inspectors, who had been working in Iraq since 1991,
withdrew on Wednesday, a day after U.N. inspection chief Richard
Butler told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq was not
cooperating. That became the trigger for the U.S.-British attacks.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the Security Council will
not lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

Barkley says Jordan will retire when lockout ends
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Michael Jordan will retire as
soon as the U.S. National Basketball Association lockout ends,
according to Charles Barkley.
	   ``Michael is done,'' Barkley said Saturday at a shootaround
prior to a charity exhibition game. ``Let me tell you something,
you can hope and hope and hope, but Michael is gone.
	   ``He's not going to play anymore. He's just waiting for the
lockout to end. Everybody keeps trying to make him play, or ask if
he will play if they shorten the season. But he has said from Day 1
he's not going to play. He wants this thing to end so he can make
it public.''
	   Barkley said he played golf with Jordan last week and discussed
Jordan's future.
	   Jordan has not spoken publicly about his future since early in
the summer when he said he would announce his decision after the
lockout. Before winning his sixth championship last season, Jordan
insisted he would not play for any coach other than Phil Jackson.
	   Jackson left the Bulls after the season, and Tim Floyd has been
hired as Chicago's coach-in-waiting.
	   When pressed on his statements about Jordan, Barkley said
talking to reporters is ``like talking to rocks.''
	   ``Look, he has had enough. He's done everything. He made his
last shot to win a world championship. What more do you need?
That's every player's fantasy.
	   ``Let the man enjoy the rest of his life. I'm more concerned
about the other 399 guys.''
	   As for his own future, Barkley said he has been in contact with
six teams he would like to play for _ all of which have a shot a
winning a championship.
	   Coming off hernia surgery and a shoulder operation, Barkley did
not plan to play in the exhibition game but coached one of the
teams.
	   He will be a free agent when _ or if _ the lockout ends.
	   ``I want to stay in Houston,'' he said. ``If they sign Scottie
(Pippen) or (Antonio) McDyess, our team would be very good.
	   ``The money doesn't matter to me. The Knicks are a team I will
consider. I'd love to play with Patrick Ewing and Allan Houston.''
	   Barkley refused to disclose the six teams he's interested in
``because it's actually illegal that I've been talking to them.''

Hemingway bullfighting hero Antonio Ordonez dies aged 66
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Antonio Ordonez, one of Spain's most
famous former bullfighters and a close friend of Ernest Hemingway
and Orson Welles died in a hospital in this southern city Saturday.
He was aged 66 and had been suffering from an unspecified illness
for several months, news reports said.
	   The son of well-known bullfighter Cayetano Ordonez, Antonio was
born in the southern Spanish town of Ronda in 1932. He became a
professional bullfighter in 1951 and established a reputation for a
disciplined classical style of bullfighting. He fought more than
2,000 bulls in a career that spanned some 30 years.
	   He married Carmen Dominguin, the sister of fellow bullfighter
Luis Miguel Dominguin and the rivalry between the two matadors in
the late 1950s inspired Hemingway's novel, 'The Dangerous Summer.'
	   On his formal retirement in 1971, he dedicated his time to
breeding bulls for bullfights and became the owner of the bullring
in his native town of Ronda, where the remains of Orson Welles are
interred.
	   A funeral mass is to be held Sunday in Seville. Ordonez is to be
cremated and his ashes are to be dispersed about the Ronda bullring
later next week. He is survived by two daughters and one grandson,
Francisco Rivera Ordonez, one of the country's leading matadors.

Blair says military aims of U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
achieved
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, EDITS

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Saturday
that the United States and Britain had halted airstrikes against
Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime. All military objectives for the
four-day operation had been achieved, Blair said.
	   ``We set out to diminish and degrade Saddam's military
capability, and we have done so,'' Blair said in a short statement
outside his official office at No. 10 Downing Street.
	   ``Substantial damage has been inflicted upon his air defense
systems, the command and control system for his armed forces,
missile production capability, and the systems which could be used
for chemical and biological warfare.''
	   Blair, speaking at the same time as President Bill Clinton was
addressing the American people, said that the U.S. and British
attacks had been targeted ``with the greatest precision to minimize
civilian casualties to the greatest extent possible. We regret
deeply any loss of civilian life there has been.''
	   Blair also said that ``real'' damage had been done to Saddam
Hussein's Republican Guard, Iraq's best trained troops.
	   The fourth wave of airstrikes - in which 12 British Tornado
fighter-bombers were used - was unleashed earlier Saturday as Iraq
officially cut all cooperation with United Nations weapons
inspections, and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began.
	   Blair said that an important reason for halting the action was
due to British and U.S. sensitivity to Ramadan.
	   But Blair warned that Britain and the U.S. ``remain ready to act
again'' if Saddam's Iraqi regime continued to pose a threat to
security.
	   ``I say to the Iraqi people, our quarrel is not and never has
been with you. We have a common enemy in Saddam. But whilst he
remains in power we will remain determined to prevent him abusing
that power and putting at risk the stability of his region and the
world.''
	   The United States and Britain decided on airstrikes after the
U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, reported that Iraq had failed
to cooperate fully with its arms inspectors. The two nations say
that Saddam has tried to produce weapons of mass destruction and to
use them against his neighbors.
	   British officials Saturday showed videotapes of bomb hits on
Republican Guard facilities in southern Iraq, and emphasized that
the Guard was a key target of the operation.
	   U.S. and British officials reported that more than 100 targets
had been hit during the first three days of airstrikes. Iraq's
Republican Guard was a major focus of the third night of bombing,
marked by thunderous attacks against targets in and around Baghdad.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States and Britain ended air
strikes against Iraq late Saturday, hours after Iraq's vice
president said the Baghdad regime will end all dealings with the
U.N. Special Commission overseeing weapons inspections.
	   Taha Yassin Ramadan made the statement shortly before a
half-dozen loud blasts rocked the capital in the fourth and last
wave of missile strikes.
	   In Washington President Bill Clinton said the U.S. and British
offensive was over for now, but added that the United States was
ready to resume airstrikes if it sees Iraq is building weapons of
mass destruction. In London, Prime Minister Tony Blair also
announced the end of attacks.
	   In the attack Saturday night, two of the missiles struck near
the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, gouging a 40-foot (12-meter)
hole into the earth, just 10 feet (3 meters) from the information
office by the ministry gate.
	   The impact of the missiles, which struck at 9:45 p.m. (1845
GMT), shattered the windows of the small, one-story information
office.
	   Three night guards were injured in the blast, Iraqi officials
said.
	   A third missile shot past the ministry, a large complex of
several buildings. The ministry is responsible for social security,
pensions, prisons and benefits for the handicapped.
	   Iraqi officials escorted journalists to the area but would not
permit them to examine the site where the third missile struck.
	   Iraq has been taking a beating since overnight
Wednesday-Thursday, when U.S. and British forces launched an air
offensive to punish the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
for obstructing the work of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In Washington, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said about 90 targets had been struck in Iraq and that
some were hit more than once.
	   ``I am very pleased by the result of our strikes,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile Ramadan repeated Iraq's allegation that UNSCOM was a
tool of the Americans. ``Its only mission in Iraq now is to find a
cover for the genitals of those who want to carry out aggression
against Iraq,'' he said.
	   In Washington, Clinton said the United States would welcome the
return of arms inspectors to Baghdad, but only if allowed to do
their job.
	   He said the attacks had inflicted ``significant damage'' on
Iraq's weapons programs and command structure. He added the United
States would be vigilant in ensuring Iraq is not renewing weapons
production and would keep its forces in the Gulf.
	   Clinton also said his government still believed Iraq would be
better off with a leader other than Saddam.
	   The implications of an Iraqi decision to shut down U.N.
inspections are grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's
chemical and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles. It
also is responsible for setting up a long-range monitoring program
to ensure that Iraq doesn't rebuild its lethal arsenal.
	   Destruction of the weapons was mandated by the U.N. Security
Council resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Before the vice president began speaking, gun batteries on
rooftops sent tracer shells streaking across the sky shortly after
sundown, as Muslims broke their fast on the first day of the holy
month of Ramadan.
	   Sirens warned citizens to take cover.
	   The previous attack ended shortly before dawn on Saturday and
had appeared to be the toughest yet against Baghdad.
	   Ramadan declined to give casualty figures, but said that the
number of civilians killed ``was 10 times more than military men.''
	   He said that 12 students died and many more were wounded Friday
night when a missile hit a dormitory in the northern province of
Tameem.
	   The government said earlier that 25 people were killed and 75
injured in the first two nights of attacks. On Saturday, the
state-run Iraqi News Agency said five more people died and 21 were
wounded in a missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the
northern town of Kirkuk.
	   The United States says the aim of Operation Desert Fox is to
lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction, threaten
its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Ramadan repeated Iraq's contention that the real goal was to
eliminate Saddam.
	   ``I am telling those who were promised the elimination of our
great leader that the symbol of the nation, its lofty example, will
remain,'' Ramadan said.
	   He added: ``We will fight to the last citizen, and history will
glorify us.''
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the missile attacks late
Friday and early Saturday was heavy and that a number of buildings
in the center of the capital _ including palaces, security
headquarters and offices of the ruling Baath Party _ had been hit.
	   The walls of the Military Industrialization Corporation, which
oversees state-run factories, were still standing, but the building
appeared to have been gutted by missiles.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said a missile had damaged an
historic Abbasid palace in Baghdad, parts of which date to the year
1180.
	   Ramadan focused on civilian sites that were hit, confirming
earlier reports that telephone communications with southern
provinces had been broken. He also charged that the United States
and Britain had hit an electricity plant and destroyed a factory
that had been inspected by UNSCOM.
	   In London, British officials showed videotapes of bomb hits on
Republican Guard facilities in southern Iraq, and emphasized that
the Guard was a key target of the operation.
	   ``Those are the people that surround him, keep him in office,
have their own system of repression, and of course have been
instrumental in putting together the means of concealing the
weapons of mass destruction,'' Blair said.
	   Also Saturday, a second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led
by the USS Carl Vinson _ moved into the Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.
	   The inspectors, who had been working in Iraq since 1991,
withdrew on Wednesday, a day after U.N. inspection chief Richard
Butler told the U.N. Security Council that Iraq was not
cooperating. That became the trigger for the U.S.-British attacks.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the Security Council will
not lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

 &UR; Eds: Items include Robin Williams, Sean Connery, the Pope, Cher and
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Robin Williams is still crazy after all these
years.
	   ``Yeah! Literally, it's like possession _ all of a sudden you're
in, and because it's in front of a live audience, you just get this
energy that just starts going,'' Williams, 47, says in the January
issue of US magazine of his still manic presence when doing
stand-up comedy.
	   Years of movie stardom and acting credibility built doing
serious dramas like ``Dead Poets Society'' and his Academy
Award-winning turn in ``Good Will Hunting'' haven't truly tempered
his zany performance style on stage.
	   ``There's a bit of restraint,'' he said. ``Maybe now there's
this kind of creature going, `Are you going to be comfortable if
you go too far?' But there's still a part that goes, `No. Go!'''
	   William's latest picture is the upcoming ``Patch Adams,'' which
blends his comedy and dramatic skills in the true story of a doctor
who makes patients laugh to ease their suffering.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Movies have always been Sean Connery's top
priority, even long before he even dreamed of becoming a star.
	   ``I would play hooky and go to the Blue Hall, the local movie
house, to watch the pictures,'' Connery, 68, says in the January
issue of Biography magazine of his childhood in Fountainbridge,
Scotland.
	   He got his start in acting after winning a medal in a
bodybuilding competition in London, where a casting director
noticed him and offered a part in a British production of the
musical ``South Pacific.''
	   ``I didn't have a voice, couldn't dance,'' Connery said. ``But I
could look good standing there.''
	   One rehearsal was all it took for Connery to decide on his
professional goal.
	   ``I decided then and there to make acting my career,'' he said.
	   Connery is the star of numerous James Bond films and many others
including ``The Wind and the Lion,'' ``The Name of the Rose,''
``The Hunt for Red October,'' ``The Untouchables'' and ``The
Rock.''
	    &UR; ___
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II was feeling better
Saturday and had resumed his audiences after a day of rest to
recover from a slight case of the flu, the Vatican said.
	   On Friday, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the
pope's flu, which brought on a 100-degree F (37.8-degree C) fever,
forced the pontiff to cancel that day's appointments.
	   But by Saturday, the pope was doing better and went ahead with a
private meeting with the patriarch of Syrian Eastern Rite
Catholics, Ignace Moussa I Dauod, the Vatican said.
	   John Paul used the audience as an occasion to call for more
collaboration between Catholics who follow the Eastern Rite, as
does the patriarch, and Orthodox Christians.
	   The pope was scheduled to appear at noon Sunday at his studio
window overlooking St. Peter's Square to give his weekly blessing.
	   The flu hit the frail pope at the start of the busy holiday
period. The pontiff no longer celebrates Mass on Christmas morning
in St. Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time to rest after
midnight Mass on Christmas Eve.
	   The pope is scheduled to travel to St. Louis and Mexico in
January.
	    &UR; ___
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Cher will have to wait a little longer to be
reunited with the silver wedding ring Sonny Bono gave her 30 years
ago.
	   The woman who now has the ring was supposed to give it to Cher
on Friday during a live broadcast on KIIS-FM radio in Los Angeles.
Instead, the woman turned up with a photo of the cherished ring _
and an attorney.
	   ``Cher verified the ring was hers. (The woman and her attorney)
want to do a private meeting with Cher in a safe area,'' said Von
Freeman, marketing director for KIIS-FM's parent company, Jacor of
Los Angeles.
	   ``She is now convinced it is for real after seeing it. This is
the ring.''
	   Arlyn Robinson saw the Academy-award winning actress on
television in November speaking about losing the keepsake from her
failed marriage to Bono. He died last January in a skiing accident.
	   When Cher appeared on KIIS-FM later that month, Robinson called
and said her husband had found the ring 30 years ago when he was
doing construction work.
	   Cher has no plans to purchase the ring and expected the woman to
give it to her by the end of the year, said Carri McCluie, Cher's
publicist.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A martial arts expert has been denied a
rematch with Jean-Claude Van Damme.
	   On Friday, a Superior Court judge rejected Frank Dux's request
for a new trial in his breach of contract suit against the movie
star.
	   In November, a jury dismissed Dux's claims that ``The Quest,'' a
1991 movie that Van Damme directed and starred in, was similar to
the manuscript ``Enter the New Dragon: The Kumite,'' which they
both wrote. Dux sought dlrs 1.5 million.
	   A spokesperson for Van Damme could not be reached for comment
after business hours Friday.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States and Britain ended air
strikes against Iraq late Saturday, hours after Iraq's vice
president said the Baghdad regime will end all dealings with the
U.N. Special Commission overseeing weapons inspections. Taha Yassin
Ramadan made the statement shortly before a half-dozen loud blasts
rocked the capital in the fourth and apparently last wave of
missile strikes. In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the
U.S. and British offensive was over for now, but added that the
United States was ready to resume airstrikes if it sees Iraq is
building weapons of mass destruction. In London, Prime Minister
Tony Blair also announced the end of attacks. (IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. House of Representatives impeached
President Bill Clinton on Saturday for obstructing justice and
lying under oath about his sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky,
voting largely along party lines to send his case to the Senate. It
was only the second presidential impeachment in American history.
The House approved two of the four articles of impeachment lodged
against Clinton, formally recommending that he be tried in the
Senate for committing perjury before a federal grand jury and
obstructing justice. Lawmakers rejected two other articles accusing
the president of perjury in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit and abuse of his presidential powers.
(US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International officials demanded
unity Saturday from the leaders of Kosovo's independence-minded
ethnic Albanians, saying that was a necessary condition for any
fruitful talks with the Serbian government. French and Austrian
diplomats led a group of international officials to the provincial
capital Saturday for talks with ethnic Albanian leaders, in an
attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and more
moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova. ``We want to give a strong
signal to the Kosovo Albanian side (that) it's time now to start
real negotiating at a broad base ... that represents all the Kosovo
Albanian political forces,'' said Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's
Ambassador to Belgrade. ``We are still short of a real and definite
commitment that will lead to a concrete forming of such a team.''
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Defense Agency believes North Korea has
begun construction of two new missile-launch facilities, which
would increase the number of launch sites in the reclusive
communist state to three, local media said Saturday. The agency
also concluded in a report issued Friday that North Korea maintains
three suspected nuclear weapons development facilities, Kyodo News
agency said. The report was submitted to Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, it said. Defense Agency officials were
unavailable late Saturday for comment. The reported move by North
Korea could heighten tensions with Tokyo and Washington, which
already have expressed growing concern about Pyongyang's missile
and nuclear weapons development programs. (JAPAN-NKOREA MISSILES)
	   PARIS (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson and his crew soared
over Libya and across the Mediterranean on Saturday, heading for
Turkey _ and avoiding Iraq _ on day two of their quest to circle
the globe in a balloon. Branson, Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett
and teammate Per Lindstrand were ``laughing and joking'' and in
``great shape,'' said Jackie McQuillan, spokesman for ICO Global, a
mobile telephone company supporting the trip. The balloon sailed
into Libyan airspace from Algeria on Saturday morning and then out
over the Mediterranean Sea at a speed of about 130 miles (210
kilometers) per hour late in the afternoon. (BALLOON QUEST)

as international officials tried to strengthen unity among Albanian
leaders.
	   Relatives of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla fighters killed in a
border clash last Monday recovered the bodies from the Serb-run
morgue in Prizren and were to bury them on Sunday.
	   French and Austrian diplomats led a group of international
officials to the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders, in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and more moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova for
talks with Serbian officials.
	   ``We want to give a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side
(that) it's time now to start real negotiating at a broad base ...
that represents all the Kosovo Albanian political forces,'' said
Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's Ambassador to Belgrade.
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, Jacques Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating team.
	   He said they got a ``positive response'' from Agani, ``but we
are still short of a real and definite commitment that will lead to
a concrete forming of such a team.''
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight
for full independence.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia _ also attended the talks and later met with KLA spokesman,
Adem Demaci.
	   Asked how and when the KLA might join political negotiations, in
which they have not previously been included because of their
continued military activity, Petritsch challenged the Kosovo
Albanian side to ``come up with a solution to this.''
	   He added ``there are positive signals that the KLA is realizing
... that they have to decide whether to continue on the military
path or if they want to join political negotiating process.''
	   The talks come on the heels of what has been the bloodiest week
in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people have been
killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting
escalated early last year.
	   Saturday morning, three men appeared in a car outside the house
of William Walker, who leads the roughly 2,000-strong international
observer mission, shouting and pointing their machine gun at
Walker's unarmed security guards, said mission spokesman Jorgen
Grunnet.
	   The incident was reported to the Serbian police, but Grunnet
said the response was not adequate. He said Walker complained
sharply about the incident to the Yugoslav authorities who are
obliged to protect the monitors.

	   Key developments in the airstrikes against Iraq:
	   ___
	   _The United States and Britain announce the suspension of
attacks, declaring the mission complete. Hours earlier, the nations
launched a fourth and final wave of strikes on Iraq. A half-dozen
loud blasts rocked the capital, indicating missile hits.
	   _A defiant Iraq declared it would cut off all dealings with
United Nations weapons inspectors.
	   _At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters
the airstrikes had inflicted ``significant damage'' on Iraq's
military systems. He said U.S. analysts believe the assault had set
back Iraq's ballistic missile program by one year.
	   _Iraqi vice president Taha Yassin Ramadan focused on civilian
sites hit in the strikes, confirming earlier reports that telephone
communications with southern provinces had been broken. He also
said that the United States and Britain had hit an electricity
plant and destroyed a factory that had been inspected by the UNSCOM
weapons inspectors.
	   _State-run Iraqi News Agency said five people died and 21 were
wounded in a missile attack on the Al-Riyad neighborhood of the
northern town of Kirkuk. The government said earlier that 25 people
were killed and 75 injured in the first two nights of attacks.
	   _ A second U.S. aircraft carrier battle group _ led by the USS
Carl Vinson _ moved into the Persian Gulf to join the USS
Enterprise group, U.S. Navy officials said.

Clinton legacy marked by sexual indiscretion, partisan hostilities

 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ William Jefferson Clinton will be forever
marked as the second president in history to be impeached, struck
low by sexual indiscretions and legal deception. The legacy he
fretted over so much and worked so hard to build is indelibly
stained.
	   The president will endeavor to redeem his presidency, but his
struggle for achievements in his last two years in office _ if he
survives at all _ will be waged against long odds and a backdrop of
unrelenting partisanship that strike many Americans as spinning out
of control.
	   Surely history will be struck by the bewildering hostilities
that strew casualties across the political battlefield of 1998,
Republican and Democrat alike. Many social observers see the battle
over Clinton as one more rancorous chapter in the culture clash
going back to the 1960s over the Vietnam war, marijuana, Watergate,
CIA spying and other troubles.
	   Even as they quarreled over Clinton's fate, lawmakers decried
the poisonous atmosphere surrounding their debate. Before shocking
his colleagues by declaring he would not run for speaker and would
resign from Congress, Rep. Bob Livingston lamented ``the enmity and
the hostility that has been bred in the halls of Congress for the
last months and year.''
	   Clinton vowed to remain in office ``until the last hour of the
last day of my term.''
	   But the months ahead won't be easy, for Clinton or for Congress,
after the House impeached Clinton for perjury and obstruction of
justice.
	   Can Clinton wage a successful battle for survival in a Senate
trial as did President Andrew Johnson in 1868? Will the public turn
and clamor for his resignation, forcing him to resign as Richard
Nixon did 24 years ago even before the House took up articles of
impeachment against him?
	   With an impeachment vote that seemed unthinkable after
Republican election losses in November, the nation plunges into
uncertainty _ unlike anything Americans have seen in 130 years.
	   The stakes are huge.
	   ``This is a mighty step because you're pulling out of office a
man who was reelected by 50 million Americans in 1996,'' said
Columbia University historian Henry Graff. ``It has always been my
belief that democracies only work well when what the people want
and what they require coincide. Here we're seeing a Congress mostly
on the Republican side saying this is what you need, and the public
saying this isn't what we want.''
	   The Republicans' crusade against the president, and the
Democrats' support for him, raised the likelihood of more
divisiveness in the new Congress that takes office in January,
jeopardizing a Social Security rescue plan and other major
legislation.
	   Some believe Republicans will be punished in 2000 congressional
elections by voters weary of the Republicans' handling of the
yearlong scandal.
	   Indeed, Clinton's extraordinarily high approval ratings in the
polls were never shaken by the revelations of his affair or the
coverup attempt that even his lawyer said could be reasonably
construed as lying.
	   The capital's bitter mood was underscored by the sour cynicism
that greeted Clinton's decision to launch airstrikes against Iraq
on the eve of the scheduled impeachment vote.
	   ``He's had nine lives or 12 lives or 14 lives,'' said Tom
Cronin, president of Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington.
``Clinton watchers are not going to rule him out. He's maybe a
lame, lame duck but he's still president. In three months he'll be
viewed as a different president because he's been impeached but
we'll be back to business as usual.''
	   Clinton's former chief of staff, Leon Panetta, said sadly,
``This will always cast a shadow over his accomplishments.''
	   Perhaps over time, history will soften the harsh judgment.
	   ``It may not ultimately be a disgrace,'' said University of
Pennsylvania political scientist Mark Rozell. ``If historians years
down the road conclude that the constitutional basis for
impeachment was flimsy, that this was a partisan travesty, then
historians will condemn Congress and not the president.''

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Ford Motor Co.'s Brazilian subsidiary
plans to lay off 2,800 workers, or 41 percent of the work force at
one of their main factories, Brazilian media reported Saturday.
	   According to the O Globo newspaper, the layoffs will take place
in January because of an agreement with the government that
provided the company tax breaks in exchange for not firing workers
in 1998.
	   Ford said the layoffs were necessary because sales had dropped
by 40 percent since the advent of the Asian financial crisis.
	   No one at Ford was available to confirm the reports.
	   In July, Ford suspended production at three of its assembly
lines for seven working days to reduce their accumulating stocks.
	   Luiz Carlos de Oliveira, head of the Sao Bernardo do Campo
factory's coordinating committee said he would work to save the
jobs.
	   ``We are going to try and negotiate other alternatives. If that
doesn't happen the company is going to have to face the
consequences. We are going to organize,'' Oliveira was quoted by
the O Globo newspaper.
	   Brazil's auto industry, which accounts for 12 percent of the
country's industrial gross domestic product, has seen sales and
production plummet to their lowest levels in years.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Corinthians midfielder Vampeta
received the highest sort of praise from soccer legend Pele,
Brazilian media reported Saturday.
	   ``Vampeta is the best player currently playing in Brazil,'' Pele
told Globo television news.
	   Speaking at the inauguration of a Sao Paulo hospital Friday
commended Vampeta for his playing style and ability.
	   Vampeta, a starter on Brazil's national team who made headlines
earlier this week for agreeing to pose nude in a gay magazine _
although he denied being homosexual _ said he was overjoyed with
the compliment.
	   ``I am happy to know that Pele _ imagine that! _ said that I'm
the best player in Brazil,'' Vampeta was quoted by the Jornal do
Brasil, ``This will only serve to increase my enthusiasm. I'm not
going to get over excited, I'm just going to work to keep worthy of
the compliment.''
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ One of Latin America's most famous television
personalities, Raul Velasco, says he is quitting the company where
he worked for 29 years, newspapers reported Saturday.
	   ``I do not have conflicts with Televisa, but today I present my
resignation,'' Velasco said in a statement released Friday.
	   Velasco hosted the popular variety show ``Always on Sunday'' for
28 years until April, when he left to undergo a liver transplant
forced by hepatitis C.
	   After receiving the transplant in Houston, he returned to Mexico
but had not found a regular space on Televisa, Latin America's
largest television network, since then.
	   Velasco said he presented his resignation by fax because he had
been unable to arrange an appointment with the head of the network,
Emilio Azcarraga Jean.
	   There was no word on Velasco's future plans.
	   While directing ``Always on Sunday,'' he helped launch the
careers of musicians as Julio Iglesias, Luis Miguel and Juan
Gabriel.

Mexico completes World Cup field

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Mexico became the 16th and final
team to qualify for next year's Women's World Cup on Saturday,
beating Argentina 3-2 in the second leg of their two-leg playoff.
	   Monica Gerardo and Evelyn Lopez both scored second-half goals,
Lopez with only 10 minutes remaining, to rally Mexico from a 2-1
deficit and qualify it with an aggregate score of 6-3.
	   Mexico beat Argentina 3-1 on Dec. 11 in Mexico City in its home
leg and prevailed in the playoff between the runners-up from
qualifying tournaments in South America and CONCACAF.
	   With a more dominant midfield, Mexico pushed forward from the
start while Argentina looked to counterattack.
	   Maribel Dominguez gave Mexico the lead in the 28th minute, but
two minutes later Yanina Gaitan equalized on a penalty kick after
Fatina Leyva was called for fouling Maria Villanueva.
	   The Argentines immediately went on the offensive, and Malvina
Peralta put the South Americans ahead with a header off a corner
kick in the 38th minute.
	   But the Mexicans regrouped after halftime. Gerardo scored from
outside the penalty area five minutes into the second half, and
after confusing Argentina by dropping back into its own half,
scored the game-winner in the 80th.
	   Mexico was then forced into a shell minutes later when Leyva was
ejected and reduced her team to 10 players for the remainder of the
match.
	   Mexico joins fellow qualifiers Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,
Denmark, Germany, Ghana, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, North Korea,
Norway, Russia and Sweden and the host United States for the third
quadrennial championship June 19-July 10.
	   The draw is set for Feb. 14 in San Jose, California, during the
halftime of a women's all-star game pitting the U.S. national team
agains a world selection.

Colbert, Costner win Lexus Challenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA QUINTA, California (AP) _ Jim Colbert and actor Kevin Costner
fired a closing-round, 10-under-par 62 on Saturday to win the Lexus
Challenge by a shot over the fast-closing team of Hubert Green and
American television personality Matt Lauer.
	   Colbert and Costner, the latter twice a second-place finisher in
this pro-celebrity tournament, combined to shoot a 36-hole score of
24-under-par 120.
	   Green and Lauer, a host of a morning news show, shot a
tournament-record 56 on Saturday, a round that featured 12 birdies
and two eagles without a bogey. They broke the day-old record of 58
established by Colbert and Costner.
	   ``I learned yesterday that I can play better when I focus,''
Costner said. ``I really wanted to win this tournament. I was sure
hoping I wasn't going to come in second again.''
	   Costner learned to play golf in 1995 for the film ``Tin Cup,''
in which he played a golf pro.
	   ``I'll tell you it's a great relief when Jim made a birdie or a
par,'' Costner added. ``So when Jim started to make some birdies it
really took the pressure of my shoulders.''
	   Larry Nelson and actor Sean Connery, who team with Hale Irwin to
win the title two years ago, shot a 65 Saturday over the 6,825-yard
Citrus course to finish at 126.
	   Defending champions Raymond Floyd and actor William Devane
finished at 127 after closing with a 61.
	   Bob Murphy and American baseball player Ken Griffey were at 128
along with Jay Sigel and actor Randy Quaid. Five teams were at 134
while Gary Player and American baseball player Roger Clemens
brought up the rear in the 12-team field at 8-under 136.

First test abandoned without a ball bowled
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ The first cricket test between New
Zealand and India was abandoned Sunday on the third day without a
ball being bowled at Carisbrook.
	   After sweeping rain robbed play on the first two days, match
referee Barry Jarmon and the two umpires Steve Dunne and Eddie
Nicholls abandoned the game before lunch.
	   Both teams agreed to play a day/night limited-overs exhibition
match on Monday, but the rainy weather forecast placed that match
in doubt.
	   New Zealand Cricket (NZC) chief executive officer Chris Doig
described the washout as a ``terrible shame'' but said the
financial implications were minor.
	   ``Both teams are keen to get something out of the remaining two
days. The Indians have warmly embraced the idea of playing a
one-dayer,'' Doig said.
	   Jarman said the one-day game will be used as an experiment for
the use of red ball under lights in white clothing.
	   Traditionally day/night internationals are played in colored
clothing and with a white ball.
	   At the start of the series India had turned down an offer to
utilize the International Cricket Council's (ICC) experimental laws
regarding lost time.
	   Under the ICC rule lost time can be made up by using floodlights
or by altering the start or finish times later in the match.
	   ``I think this game will help us identifying a few problems. The
cricket world is still split and is not comfortable with the law,''
Jarman said.
	   Recently England refused to use lights in the current Ashes
series against Australia because ground lights are a relatively new
addition to the English scene and the team has not played often
under those conditions.
	   This is the second test to be abandoned without a ball bowled in
Dunedin. Nine years ago a test between the hosts and Pakistan was
also abandoned without a ball being bowled.
	   This is only the eighth test to be abandoned in the history of
cricket.
	   The last was in 1994 when the second test between Sri Lanka and
Pakistan in Colombo was canceled due to post-election curfew.
	   Persistent rain has left soft underfooting at Carisbrook and
according to curator Mark Perham, a minimum of ``four clear hours''
with bright sunshine will be needed to get the ground to playable
conditions.
	   After Perham had criticized NZC for scheduling a test here in
December, Doig said criticism was ``very naive and illogical''
given that the entire country had been lashed by steady rain.
	   The second test will be played in Wellington on Dec. 26 and the
third on Jan. 2 in Hamilton. (ik/djp)

Jets win division with 17-10 victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with late game. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Vinny Testaverde threw for two touchdowns and
the New York Jets took advantage of Buffalo's sloppiness to win
17-10 Saturday and capture its first U.S. National Football League
divisional title.
	   It gave New York (11-4) the American Football Conference's East
Division crown _ the last time it won a division was in 1969, when
it was part of the old American Football League _ and the inside
track for a first-round playoffs bye.
	   If Jacksonville loses either of its final two games, the Jets
will move directly to the second round of the playoffs.
	   The Bills (9-6), who lost a fumble and an interception, dropped
several passes and failed to stay in-bounds on others, must try for
a ``wild-card'' berth to make the playoffs. Playing at home in
Orchard Park, New York, They were hurt by Victor Green's
controversial interception on a tipped ball with 3:52 to go;
replays showed he dropped the ball.
	   Buffalo has more victories (44) against the Jets than any other
team. The Bills have been particularly dominant at the newly named
Ralph Wilson Stadium, where they had won three straight and eight
of their past 10 against the Jets.
	   Testaverde completed a 71-yard touchdown pass to Dedric Ward in
the third quarter for the winning points and also connected with
Wayne Chrebet for a 7-yarder on the Jets' first drive.
	   He finished 14-for-23 for 184 yards and was not intercepted on a
blustery day that clearly affected Buffalo's Doug Flutie. He was
14-for-38 for 220 yards.
 &UR; Redskins 20, Bucs 16
	   At Landover, Maryland, Trent Green hit rookie tight end Stephen
Alexander for a 15-yard touchdown pass with 5:49 to play, lifting
Washington to a 20-16 victory and dealing a likely fatal blow to
Tampa Bay's playoffs hopes.
	   It was the fourth straight victory and sixth in eight games for
the Redskins (6-9), who became only the second team in NFL history
to win six in a season after starting 0-7. Tampa Bay (7-8), which
had also won three in a row, will be eliminated from playoff
contention if Arizona defeats New Orleans on Sunday. The result
also clinched postseason berths for Dallas and Green Bay.
	   The Buccaneers, 1-6 on the road this season, have not won an
away game in December since a 7-3 victory over the Cardinals on
Dec. 27, 1992. There have been only three other away victories in
December in franchise history, all inside domed stadiums.
	   Tampa Bay appeared to have the game in hand with another solid
game by its defense, although its lead was never comfortable
because the offense kept converting good field position into field
goals instead of touchdowns.
	   With the score 16-10 in the fourth quarter, a bad punt by Tommy
Barnhardt gave the Redskins the ball at their 42. Eight plays
later, Cary Blanchard kicked a 35-yard field goal with 6:06 to play
to make it 16-13.
	   On the ensuring kickoff, Chris Thomas jarred the ball loose from
Jacquez Green. Mike Sellars recovered, setting up Alexander's
winning catch.

Art, politics met in 1998

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Politics and art, never so far apart, found
themselves in some odd juxtapositions in 1998, with Nicole Kidman's
nudity, pregnant Spice Girls and film riots in India all grabbing
headlines.
	   There were events of purely artistic importance, of course, but
those were less evident in the year just ending than those
reminding us that art is hardly a world apart.
	   From the sublime to the ridiculous: Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago, a communist and atheist, won the Nobel Prize for
literature; artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude fulfilled a
30-year-old dream by wrapping 163 trees in a Swiss park in silvery
fabric; and New York City and Britain fought over custody of the
original Winnie the Pooh and his stuffed friends Eeyore, Kanga,
Piglet and Tigger.
	   A drop of Pablo Picasso's blood on a scrap of paper sold, along
with four other small souvenirs, for dlrs 3,590 at an auction of
the belongings of the late Dora Maar, Picasso's companion of eight
years and an artist herself.
	   The venerable Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden
continued its downward slide, crippled by a financial crisis and
mass resignations.
	   South Korea lifted import prohibitions on Japanese comic books,
magazines and movies, goods banned for a half-century because of
Korea's deep animosity toward its former colonial ruler.
	   In Paris, Orsay Museum employees struck for a bonus because of
huge, unruly crowds at an exhibit of works by Van Gogh and
Jean-Francois Millet.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair decided that it was time to
burnish the sceptered isle's reputation, so he started a ``Cool
Britannia'' publicity campaign. Stars include the Spice Girls and
Shakespeare.
	   Germany marked the 100th birthday of Bertolt Brecht, the
idealistic Marxist playwright best known for his ``Threepenny
Opera,'' with festivals, performances, film showings and other
tributes.
	   Other centennials marked in 1998 include those of Spanish poet
and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca, American songsmith George
Gershwin and British sculptor Henry Moore.
	   Israel's 50th birthday bash turned into a battle over the role
of religion vs. freedom of expression.
	   Dancers from Israel's premier dance troupe, Batsheva, walked out
of the celebrations on April 30th, refusing to capitulate to
religious leaders' demands that they perform one of their most
highly acclaimed numbers fully clothed. They became heroes to
Israel's secular majority for taking a stand against religious
coercion.
	   Nicole Kidman took the lead in David Hare's ``The Blue Room,''
first in London, then in New York. But the furor wasn't over her
move from screen to stage. It was over the skin. She briefly
appears on stage in the nude. ``No _ repeat no _ cellulite,''
gasped one London critic. ``Pure theatrical Viagra,'' panted
another. (Both are male).
	   Officials at the Manhattan Theatre Club reported anonymous death
threats against actors, audiences and playwright Terrence McNally
after announcing that they would stage his ``Corpus Christi,''
about a gay Jesus-like figure. It opened anyway.
	   Ginger Spice said goodbye to the gang, but the rest of the
Spices made a triumphant tour of North America. Then Scary Spice
and Posh Spice got pregnant, sparking concerns that hordes of very
young fans would follow their example.
	   A Somali writer and playwright won the prestigious Neustadt
International Prize for Literature. Nuruddin Farah's
English-language novels include ``From a Crooked Rib,'' ``Close
Sesame'' and ``Gifts.''
	   The year's big names in popular music included Garth Brooks,
Celine Dion, Usher, Shania Twain, Natalie Imbruglia, Lauryn Hill
and the Backstreet Boys.
	   On the museum blockbuster front, a rare exhibition of nearly two
dozen paintings by the Dutch Old Master Johannes Vermeer ran longer
than scheduled in the Netherlands because of the intense demand for
tickets. A Jackson Pollock retrospective at New York's Museum of
Modern Art was pulling in throngs as the year ended.
	   Stockholm, as the EU's Cultural Capital of Europe for 1998,
hosted a wide range of innovative cultural events. Among the best
received was a production of August Strindberg's ``A Dream Play,''
directed by American Robert Wilson. The stylish, austere sets and
the actors' dazed Kabuki-like movements complemented the script's
shifts between eerie allegory and heartbreakingly intimate
expressions of loneliness and loss.
	   ``Eternity and a Day,'' by Greek director Theo Angelopoulos, won
Cannes' Golden Palm, and the Grand Prize went to ``Life is
Beautiful'' by Italy's Roberto Benigni, who directed and starred as
a father who uses desperate and hilarious means to shield his son
from the reality of a Nazi death camp.
	   Dogma 95, a collective of renegade Danish film directors, won
attention with its neo-cinema verite style. ``The Idiots'' and
``The Celebration'' display the collective's, well, dogma, which
calls for movies to be shot only on location, in color, with
handheld cameras.
	   ``Godzilla'' did significantly less than monster business at the
box office, but ``Titanic'' stayed afloat well into 1998, then
bobbed up again with people standing on line for hours to buy the
video. The ``X-Files'' film came out, without actually revealing
much more of the TV show's mythology, and ``Wag the Dog,'' released
at the tail end of 1997, only gathered momentum as the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal brewed up in 1998.

	   The film with the biggest gross in 1998 was ``Titanic,'' which
brought in an estimated dlrs 1.7 billion globally, according to
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. The film released in 1998 that made
the most was ``Armageddon,'' which made more than dlrs 400 million
globally.
	   In the political realm, leftists in Bombay tried censorship,
mounting demonstrations that closed down a play about the slaying
of Indian independence leader Mohandas ``Mahatma'' Gandhi.
Playwright Pradeep Dalvi said he wanted to give a fair hearing to
assassin Nathuram Godse, a radical Hindu.
	   It worked two other times, too. Members of a radical Hindu group
forced a New Delhi gallery to take down an exhibit of painter M.F.
Husain's work and ransacked his Bombay apartment, newly enraged by
his 20-year-old nude sketches of a Hindu goddess. Husain said he
did not mean to offend, saying that ancient Hindu art is filled
with celebrations of the beauty of the human figure.
	   And right-wing protesters forced movie theaters in Bombay and
New Delhi to stop showing ``Fire,'' the story of sisters-in-law in
unhappy marriages who seek comfort with each other in a lesbian
relationship.
	   But then there was just plain fun, too.
	   The wackiest cultural sight of the year in Paris had to be the
four jolly giants who opened the World Cup by lumbering through
Paris like Godzillas with a date at the Place de la Concorde.
	   Blaring ethno-techno music and escorted by 4,500 costumed
extras, the 18-meter (60-foot) robots formed the heart of a party
for 1 million people celebrating the globe's biggest sports
tournament. (In case anyone forgot, France won.)

Rushdie gets some slack, but many find free expression costly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-1998-Arts Overview &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Salman Rushdie got a break in 1998. He's still
under a death sentence, but the government of Iran decided it had
no interest in executing it. For many others around the world, the
cost of venting unpopular opinions remained high.
	   It has been nearly a decade since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
the spiritual leader of Iran's revolution, declared that Rushdie's
novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was blasphemous and that its author
must die.
	   In September, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi announced
in New York that his government ``disassociates itself from any
reward'' and no longer supports the edict against Rushdie.
	   ``I've had 10 years of my life deformed by this,'' Rushdie said,
rejoicing in the announcement. ``I've had friends of mine
threatened, had my family messed about, had people that I care
about shot and killed. I could ask for an apology, but I'm not
doing so.''
	   This year was also the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, whose provisions include: ``Everyone
has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right
includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek,
receive and impart information and ideas through any media and
regardless of frontiers.''
	   But many others around the world still faced strictures on free
expression. The issue is at the heart of human culture _ a point
made in Stockholm at a conference _ ``No Freedom ... No Culture'' _
organized by the World Association of Newspapers.
	   Faraj Sarkoohi, an Iranian editor and writer who spent a year in
prison, was barred from attending but sent a letter.
	   ``I know in detail the restrictions of authoritative censorship,
and am familiar with the activities of various pressure groups,
both official and non-official, who create an atmosphere of fear,
terror and murder imposing a kind of self-censorship upon
journalists and writers,'' he said in the letter, which was read at
the gathering.
	   Homero Aridjis, a Mexican poet, writer and political activist,
and president of International PEN, has reported a dozen death
threats since late 1997.
	   ``This is affecting me, my writing, my thinking, my freedom of
expression and my human rights,'' Aridjis told a news conference in
August. ``I don't see why a human being like me should continue to
stand for all this.''
	   In a case that echoes the Rushdie saga, Taslima Nasrin is
charged with blasphemy in her native Bangladesh. In between court
appearances, she hides in fear for her life.
	   Nasrin, a poet, novelist and essayist, fled the country four
years ago because of threats and street protests after a newspaper
quoted her as saying the Koran should be rewritten.
	   She denies making any statements against Islam's holy book, but
has called for changes in Islamic laws to give greater freedom to
women.
	   Speaking at a conference on ``The Artist and Human Rights'' in
Ottawa, Canada, in July, she said:
	   ``If I had had that freedom _ the freedom of speech _ I would
not have had to leave my own country and drift like this from one
country to another, from Germany to France to Sweden. I am
dangerous as a human being not because I am a terrorist with lethal
arms but because I am a writer armed with a mere pen, and I write
against that coterie of the ruling class that is guided by its
vested interests.''
	   For journalists around the world, death can be the price of free
expression.
	   Two dozen were slain this year, including four in Colombia and
three in Mexico. Killings were also reported in Afghanistan,
Angola, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Congo, Ethiopia, Georgia, Iran,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Rwanda, Sierra
Leone and Thailand.

Italian mezzo-soprano's voice and personality fill the house
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Newsfeatures Writer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When Cecilia Bartoli talks about music, her eyes
gleam and her face glows. Even her luxuriant dark hair seems to
crackle with electricity.
	   Bartoli, the Italian mezzo-soprano who is among the hottest
singers in the opera world, isn't exhibiting diva airs during an
interview in the Manhattan apartment she has taken across Central
Park from the Metropolitan Opera.
	   She goes into her kitchen, where dishes dry on a drainboard,
grinds coffee beans, makes coffee and pours it into two Met Opera
mugs.
	   When she goes to the Met for rehearsals, Bartoli says, she walks
across the park. ``To be outside and walk I get energy from the
street, from the air, so I can get oxygen in my lungs before I go
on stage,'' she says. ``I need a lot of energy in this
production.''
	   The production she mentions is ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' in
which Bartoli sings Susanna, Figaro's bride-to-be. Bryn Terfel
sings Figaro.
	   The last time Bartoli sang with Terfel, she says, was in ``Don
Giovanni'' in Salzburg, Austria, three and a half years ago. It was
then that Terfel's wife had their first child; just before the
current production Mrs. Terfel delivered their second back in
Wales. Bartoli laughs and says she doesn't know when she and Terfel
are scheduled to sing together next.
	   Music writers often mention Bartoli's small voice. ``Why do they
insist so much to have me back at the Met if it really is this
problem?'' she asks.
	   ``It isn't a problem. The problem is here,'' she says, pointing
to her feet. ``After three hours with 18th century shoes, the first
thing I do after rehearsal is take off the shoes. They didn't use
sneakers at that time.''
	   Bartoli says, ``I have a voice for 18th century music. You don't
need a big voice to sing Susanna or the Cinderella of Rossini. You
need a big voice for Azucena (in Verdi's ``Il Trovatore'') and
Amneris (in Verdi's ``Aida''), but I'm not singing those.
	   ``Honestly, I think in my profound, deep soul I am a daughter of
the 18th century. It's not just the voice. My way to feel is close
to the surrealistic way of the 16th, 17th and 18th century,'' she
says.
	   In ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' Susanna usually is sung by a
soprano and Cherubino, the young boy in love with the opera's
countess, is sung by a mezzo. Bartoli has sung Cherubino many
times.
	   ``In the 18th century, mezzo-soprano was not part of the
categories. If you see the score of `Figaro,' the countess,
Cherubino and Susanna are all sopranos. The categories of the voice
for women were soprano and contralto. The colors of the voice were
more important than the categories at that time.
	   ``Susanna is absolutely in the middle of the range. It's no
trouble for me, a light mezzo, never too high, never too low, very
comfortable. I'm surprised how the high sopranos can manage it. The
high line is for the countess. Renee (Fleming) sings the high line.
A high soprano singing Susanna was not Mozart's intention.''
	   Mozart's intention is also revealed when she sings two arias
that the composer wrote for a second production of ``Figaro'' in
Prague after its less than stellar opening in Vienna in 1786.
	   ``I think it's a very creative thing to bring alive again these
alternative pieces,'' which she has previously sung in concert, she
says.
	   In the alternative arias, the voice plays with a basset horn, a
type of alto clarinet. In the original arias, which traditionally
are used, the voice is prominent.
	   ``Which is better? Every single note of Mozart is important,''
Bartoli says.
	   When she suggested singing the alternative arias in performances
filmed for television, Met artistic director James Levine was
enthusiastic. That, she says, will allow ``the audience to discover
what Mozart did 200 years ago.''
	   Two seasons ago, Bartoli upset the Met by not singing in a
Saturday broadcast matinee of ``Cosi fan tutte,'' when Levine, the
tenor and the baritone were all out sick. ``The Met isn't really
angry,'' she says, ``because I'm here.''
	   Bartoli will be seenon PBS twice this month, in Rossini's ``La
Cenerentola,'' videotaped last November at the Met (showing Dec.
28), and in a recital last summer with pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet,
at the Teatro Olympico in Vicenza, Italy (showing through the end
of the year; check local listings). A CD of that recital, ``Cecilia
Bartoli, Live in Italy,'' was released by London Records in
October, joining her 12 opera CDs.
	   The mezzo performs about 50 times a year and spends a lot of
time studying new roles. In Zurich last March, she sang Paisiello's
``Nina,'' in which her dramatic mad scene was compared with Maria
Callas'. At a July festival in Graz, Austria, she sang ``Armida''
by Haydn for the first time.
	   ``This is exciting,'' Bartoli says. ``The most exciting part is
discovering new pieces.''

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Philip Gourevitch was flipping through a
newspaper as he waited outside the Holocaust Museum in Washington,
D.C., when a photograph jolted him. Under the tumbling waters of an
idyllic waterfall bobbed masses of mutilated, bloated bodies,
victims of the Rwandan genocide.
	   Gourevitch looked up and saw museum workers wearing lapel
buttons that read ``Remember'' and ``Never Again.''
	   ``I thought these were emptied-out slogans now,'' he said.
	   Fascinated and horrified, Gourevitch went to Rwanda, and now,
four years after the genocide ended, he has written a book
documenting the killings and exploring why, nearly 50 years after
the Nazi Holocaust, the world failed to stop the slaughter of up to
1 million people.
	   Published in September by Farrar Straus and Giroux, ``We Wish to
Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families:
Stories From Rwanda,'' has received critical acclaim.
	   ``There is something troubling about the idea that large chunks
of humanity, that whole classes of humanity, can be slaughtered
without people being disturbed,'' he said.
	   Gourevitch first traveled to Rwanda as a freelancer for The New
Yorker in the spring of 1995, a year after the genocide. He quickly
lost faith in the humanitarian rhetoric of the international
community, which, he says, could have stopped the killings even
before they started, but instead chose to ignore the strategically
obscure country.
	   ``There are fights worth fighting, and one of them ought to be
against people who commit genocide,'' he said. ``What would it cost
us ... to prevent all that? Not too much I think.''
	   Officials from the U.S. government and the United Nations,
however, have repeatedly argued that poor intelligence, lack of a
clear mission and public opposition to such interventions would
have resulted in disaster had they sent a force to Rwanda.
	   Gourevitch argues that Western powers, fresh from humiliations
in other peacekeeping missions, were simply loath to fight a war
that did not directly advance their political or economic
interests.
	   Gourevitch, 37, is now a staff writer for The New Yorker and a
contributing editor to The Forward, a New York-based Jewish
newspaper. Before he became interested in Rwanda, he wrote several
magazine essays criticizing other attempts to grapple with
genocide, calling the movie ``Schindler's List'' morally ambiguous
and the Holocaust Museum superficial and morally unchallenging.
	   A year after walking through the museum and looking at
photographs of the Nazi genocide, Gourevitch stepped gingerly
through a Rwandan church, trying not to crush the dried,
dismembered remains that authorities left untouched as a memorial
to the hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus
slaughtered by the Hutu nationalist regime.
	   He talked to survivors, who faced not only the task of
reconstructing their shattered lives, but also the trauma of
watching their families' killers stroll unpunished through their
villages.
	   The title of Gourevitch's book,is the written plea of seven
Adventist pastors who learned that they and the nearly 2,000
refugees they were protecting in a church hospital were to be
massacred.
	   Their superior, a pastor from the majority Hutu ethnic group,
responded: ``Your problem has already found a solution,'' one
survivor of the slaughter told Gourevitch. ``You must die.''
	   Gourevitch tells of a Tutsi doctor, who was captured with her
family by Hutu thugs after a harrowing chase through a papyrus
marsh. They were released only after her husband pulled out two
grenades, threatening to kill himself, his family and his
attackers.
	   He tells of a Hutu journalist who covertly filed reports on the
genocide to French radio. He was eventually beaten and told he was
about to die before an army major inexplicably saved him.
	   The genocide ended only when a Tutsi-led rebel force took over
the country.
	   Before the killings began in April 1994, U.N. peacekeepers in
Rwanda reported that Hutu mercenaries were collecting guns and
machetes for a planned genocide. But their superiors dismissed
those reports, and the U.N. force eventually was slashed to a tiny
group of powerless observers.
	   Nearly 50 years before, the United Nations, in reaction to the
Holocaust, made genocide a crime under international law,
obligating its signatories to prevent it. But now, when presented
with a clear example of the crime, the international community
abandoned its moral obligation, refusing to fight a war solely on
the basis of humanitarian beliefs, Gourevitch said.
	   ``The promise we made to ourselves that we would not tolerate
genocide in the future proved to be hollow,'' he said.
	   In the months before the genocide, U.N. peacekeepers were
humiliated in Bosnia and Somalia, where 18 Army Rangers were killed
and dragged through the streets. The United States and the United
Nations were not eager for a repeat of that spectacle, especially
in Rwanda, a tiny African country of almost no strategic importance
to Western powers.

	   ``Rwanda is landlocked and dirt-poor,'' Gourevitch writes. ``As
far as the political, military and economic interests of the
world's powers go, it might as well be Mars. In fact, Mars is
probably of greater strategic concern.''
	   Many countries say they were unwilling to act without the
imprimatur of the United Nations. But that is a poor excuse, given
the rarity of the consensus necessary for the United Nations to
take action, Gourevitch said.
	   ``The U.N. mostly serves in these cases as a sheltering place, a
place where everybody can get together when they don't want to act
individually and kind of blame it on the institution,'' he said.
	   The United States, which has little trouble acting on its own
when its national interests are at stake, had long ignored
sub-Saharan Africa as a strategic black hole, Gourevitch said. To
U.S. leaders, there was simply no reason to risk American lives to
save masses of people in a country thousands of miles (kilometers)
away.
	   Other Western powers also refused to intervene, incorrectly
painting the genocide as simple tribal violence. In fact,
Gourevitch said, Hutus and Tutsis had lived together relatively
peacefully for centuries, turning violent only under the
divide-and-conquer politics of European colonists.
	   The sheer speed of the killings _ 100 days _ also gave plodding
international institutions and foreign ministries little chance to
react before hundreds of thousands were killed.
	   ``That's not to excuse anybody. The right people knew what was
happening at the time it was happening. The U.N. knew, Clinton
knew, the French knew, the Europeans knew. There just wasn't the
will, and it leaves us with a very altered world,'' Gourevitch
said.

Country music insiders spill beans, nicely
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY352-NY353 &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ The photos and mementos spill out of
Ralph Emery's office into a hall.
	   There's Ralph with Reba McEntire. Ralph with Dolly Parton. Gold
records. A red, white and blue guitar given to Ralph by Buck Owens.
Ralph with former President George Bush.
	   Emery, 65, is the consummate Nashville insider and the author of
three books on country music. The latest is ``The View From
Nashville,'' co-written with Patsi Bale Cox.
	   ``The View From Nashville'' and the chatty ``Nashville Wives,''
by Nancy Jones (wife of George Jones) and Tom Carter, are the
latest efforts by the close-knit Nashville music industry to define
itself rather than have outsiders do the job.
	   ``I got a review in Publishers Weekly that liked the book except
it felt that I was myopic,'' Emery said. ``They said I didn't give
a balanced view. I interpreted that to mean that I didn't trash the
Nashville singers. And if that's being myopic, that's fine with
me.''
	   Twice in the past two years the Nashville music industry has
been stung by critical books.
	   ``Three Chords and the Truth,'' by Laurence Leamer came out in
the summer of 1997 and was followed by Bruce Feiler's ``Dreaming
Out Loud.''
	   Leamer and Feiler, New York writers, focused on Nashville in the
1990s, especially Garth Brooks. The superstar avoided Leamer and
cooperated with Feiler, but in the end disavowed both books.
	   Nashville is used to gentler books done by locals like Emery.
Autobiographies co-written by stars like Naomi Judd, Dolly Parton
and Barbara Mandrell also have done well.
	   Emery is the man who proved there was a huge market for the
stuff.
	   He made his name as an all-night disc jockey on WSM-AM starting
in the late 1950s, then as host of the cable-TV show ``Nashville
Now'' on The Nashville Network from 1983-93.
	   His first book, in 1991, was ``Memories,'' an autobiography. It
was on The New York Times best-seller list for six months. ``More
Memories'' followed in 1993.
	   All three of his books borrow heavily from his friendships with
country stars, some dating to the 1950s.
	   ``I write from the standpoint of humor, and the unique qualities
I find in these very talented individuals,'' Emery said. ``And
these are people I love. So I'm not going to do a rag piece, if you
will. Most of these people are my friends.''
	   One of the best anecdotes in ``The View From Nashville''
involves the late Faron Young, a big star in the 1960s with hits
like ``Four in the Morning.''
	   Young was talkative, profane and unafraid to offend. When black
country singer Charley Pride came along, many in Nashville assumed
Young would say something embarrassing. Instead, Young became
Pride's defender.
	   Once, Emery said, a racist DJ told Young he was going to throw
out all of Pride's records. Young, then at the height of his
stardom, told the DJ to throw away his Faron Young records, too.
	   ``If I ever hear of your station playing one of my songs again
I'll come back and burn the ... place down!'' Young told the DJ,
according to Emery.
	   ``I tell outsiders that the Nashville music community is really
one big family,'' Emery said. ``When an outside force comes in to
trash us, then we bond a little bit. Most of us take exception to
that.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Nancy Jones married into country music, hooking up with George
in the early 1980s when many in Nashville wouldn't have anything to
do with him because of his drinking and drug abuse. She quickly
earned respect by getting him to sober up and resurrect his career.
	   Jones says wives of Nashville stars sometimes have mixed
feelings about their situation, especially when their husbands are
traveling.
	   ``That's when the anger builds up and you are mad and you wished
it never happened,'' said Jones, who now manages her husband's
career.
	   ``But then you go to a show and you watch George Jones walk on
there and you're like, `Man, I'm Mrs. George Jones!'''
	   Jones says her book is no whitewash, citing chapters on her own
life and Kim Campbell, Glen Campbell's fourth wife.
	   ``Glen and George were just mean little boogers when they were
drinking,'' Jones said. ``They lost their respect for women and
they were cruel.''
	   Knowing her subjects socially was a big help. Sandy Brooks
talked to Jones against the wishes of her husband, Garth. Wynonna
Judd granted a rare interview, then filed for divorce just as
``Nashville Wives'' arrived in book stores.
	   Like Emery's book, ``Nashville Wives'' is best when it looks
back.
	   Jones and Carter found and interviewed Billy Jean Horton, the
young beauty Hank Williams Sr. married in 1952 two months before
his death. Later, she was married to singer Johnny Horton (``The
Battle of New Orleans'').
	   Billy Jean Horton recalled Williams' death and her
less-than-warm relationship with his mother, Lillian Stone.
	   ``The old lady had chartered a plane and beat me to the body,''
Horton said. ``She took all of his personal possessions. She took
his car, and I never saw either of our cars again.''
	   The viewing was held in Stone's living room in Montgomery, Ala.
Billy Jean showed up uninvited.
	   ``While Hank's body lay in state, Billy Jean encountered Hank's
mother in the bathroom,'' Jones and Carter wrote.
	   ``He had not been embalmed for 48 hours. People were weeping and
pacing. Meanwhile, Billy Jean was pounding Hank's mother in the
head inside the woman's own bathroom.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ ``It's early,'' Ewan McGregor says with a smile,
as he launches into conversation at a less-than-sociable time of
day early in the morning. ``I apologize for the earliness of the
hour.''
	   That's not all McGregor says on the subject, but it's as much as
can be printed in a family newspaper, coming from a feisty actor
whose language is considerably saltier than most Hollywood movies.
	   Not that McGregor has much to do with Hollywood, despite his
starring presence as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi in what should well
be next year's biggest movie, the first of three ``Star Wars''
prequels.
	   His admiration for ``Star Wars'' wizard George Lucas
notwithstanding, the 27-year-old Scot speaks mostly disparagingly
of the American studios, of blockbusters like ``Independence Day''
(a pet peeve), and of producers too timid to voice an opinion lest
they get fired.
	   ``They're so terrified,'' McGregor says. ``I've sat out there
with studio heads _ you know, people who are supposed to know
better than I. And they go, `Oh, my God, your last movie was so ...
Oh, my God ... it was just Oh, my God,' and I'm like `What? What is
it? What was my last movie? What do you think?' And they're all so
terrified to say anything in case it's the wrong thing ... and they
suddenly lose their job.''
	   Fear certainly doesn't enter into McGregor's own conversational
orbit, and you could argue that the same take-no-prisoners quality
fuels his work on screen.
	   After all, how many actors would allow their bodies to become
experiments in calligraphy, as McGregor did last year in Peter
Greenaway's ``The Pillow Book''? Or leap to the public's attention
as a heroin addict, and take a swim in a toilet bowl, in
``Trainspotting''?
	   Currently, McGregor can be seen as an Iggy Pop equivalent in all
but name _ the character is aptly known as Curt Wild _ in Todd
Haynes' provocative, surprisingly melancholic ``Velvet Goldmine,''
a requiem for the bygone glitter of Glam Rock.
	   And just when you thought McGregor would be incapable of
suggesting a quiet presence on screen, along he comes as the shy
Billy _ the telephone repairman who woos an even more withdrawn
Jane Horrocks in ``Little Voice.''
	   ``Hallelujah, that's a stroke of luck, that one,'' says McGregor
of appearing back-to-back in such dissimilar movies. ``The two
right next to each other _ it's just everything you could want.''
	   In ``Velvet Goldmine,'' the actor dons tight-fitting, spangly
gold with matching nail varnish to play a pop icon who thinks
nothing of dropping his trousers in performance.
	   ``It's debauched and mad, like the '70s were,'' McGregor says
with a grin. ``I get off quite lightly in the camp stakes because
I'm the butch American guy.''
	   ``Little Voice,'' by contrast, finds him delicately handling
pigeons. ``It's very, very British,'' he says of that movie.
``There's something really lovely about it.''
	   While British actors of previous generations tended to move from
play to play, McGregor is attempting the same spread of work on
screen.
	   ``People like Jimmy Stewart would make three to four movies a
year. It was almost like repertory theater, but in movies,'' he
says. ``That was my idea of what being an actor was like, so I
guess I'm just trying to do the same thing.''
	   His approach typifies a career that has traveled its own
idiosyncratic path while making McGregor, no doubt unintentionally,
the thespian embodiment of ``cool Britannia.''
	   These days, he's one of the few acting success stories that his
own country's press _ a notoriously fickle lot _ have notably taken
to heart.
	   ``That's what's nice about him: He's got sense and optimism
written all the way through,'' said The Observer newspaper in a
profile in October. Chimed in British GQ, which cited McGregor
among its Men of the Year: ``Ewan McGregor is the kind of movie
star it's OK to like. A lot.''
	   His colleagues agree.
	   ``He's a hip actor in an unhip role,'' notes Mark Herman of the
actor's participation in ``Little Voice.'' Last year, Herman
directed McGregor as an amorous horn player in the terrific but
little-seen ``Brassed Off.''
	   Says Jenny Topper, artistic director of north London's tiny
Hampstead Theater, where the theater-trained McGregor is making his
London stage debut through Jan. 2: ``Ewan himself is so unaffected
and open and natural. He has no side whatsoever.''
	   And, she adds wryly, ``He can talk the hind legs off a donkey.''
	   That much may be due to sheer Scottish loquacity, a trait used
to advantage in the actor's bravura stage turn as the scrappy,
soliloquizing radical (or so the character imagines himself) in
David Halliwell's ``Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the
Eunuchs.''
	   The play has become the hottest ticket in town. It is directed
by McGregor's uncle, the actor Denis Lawson, who himself had small
roles in the ``Star Wars'' movies, but is better known for his
performance in ``Local Hero'' with Burt Lancaster.

	   For his efforts as Malcolm, the anarchic art student of the
title, McGregor is being paid a less-than-stratospheric dlrs 400 a
week.
	   ``I wanted to do a play. I needed to do a play,'' he says of a
career move that must have left his agents speechless following the
multimillion-dollar ``Star Wars'' franchise.
	   ``The theater is a joy, a joy,'' he says. ``It's brilliant.''
	   McGregor has a sheer appetite for work _ he has three films
expected for release next year in addition to episode one of ``Star
Wars'' _ and he doesn't seem to know when to stop.
	   ``He'd been doing too much too quickly. He was a bit frazzled,''
says Herman, the ``Little Voice'' director.
	   Maintaining the pace, McGregor was set to appear last July as
Irish writer James Joyce in a new film, ``Nora,'' until the project
was postponed yet again for financial reasons.
	   ``The money fell through,'' he says, ``and in a way it was a
stroke of luck because I had the summer off. I haven't had time off
for three years. It's been really good for me.''
	   Among other things, it meant time at home and on vacation to
Scotland and France with wife Eve, a French production designer,
and their daughter, Clara, 2 1-2 . The McGregors live a short walk
from the 174-seat playhouse where ``Little Malcolm'' sold out its
entire run within three days of tickets going on sale.
	   As for his work, what matters at the end of the day isn't budget
or scale but, McGregor hopes, quality.
	   ``There are people who make really good films, and the other
side of the coin is people who make really ... bad films,'' he
says. ``I'm glad to be in with the people who make the good
films.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Politics and art, never so far apart, found
themselves in some odd juxtapositions in 1998, with Nicole Kidman's
nudity, pregnant Spice Girls and film riots in India all grabbing
headlines.
	   There were events of purely artistic importance, of course, but
those were less evident in the year just ending than those
reminding us that art is hardly a world apart.
	   From the sublime to the ridiculous: Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago, a communist and atheist, won the Nobel Prize for
literature; artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude fulfilled a
30-year-old dream by wrapping 163 trees in a Swiss park in silvery
fabric; and New York City and Britain fought over custody of the
original Winnie the Pooh and his stuffed friends Eeyore, Kanga,
Piglet and Tigger.
	   A drop of Pablo Picasso's blood on a scrap of paper sold, along
with four other small souvenirs, for dlrs 3,590 at an auction of
the belongings of the late Dora Maar, Picasso's companion of eight
years and an artist herself.
	   The venerable Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden
continued its downward slide, crippled by a financial crisis and
mass resignations.
	   South Korea lifted import prohibitions on Japanese comic books,
magazines and movies, goods banned for a half-century because of
Korea's deep animosity toward its former colonial ruler.
	   In Paris, Orsay Museum employees struck for a bonus because of
huge, unruly crowds at an exhibit of works by Van Gogh and
Jean-Francois Millet.
	   Germany marked the 100th birthday of Bertolt Brecht, the
idealistic Marxist playwright best known for his ``Threepenny
Opera,'' with festivals, performances, film showings and other
tributes.
	   Other centennials marked in 1998 include those of Spanish poet
and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca, American songsmith George
Gershwin and British sculptor Henry Moore.
	   Israel's 50th birthday bash turned into a battle over the role
of religion vs. freedom of expression.
	   Dancers from Israel's premier dance troupe, Batsheva, walked out
of the celebrations on April 30th, refusing to capitulate to
religious leaders' demands that they perform one of their most
highly acclaimed numbers fully clothed. They became heroes to
Israel's secular majority for taking a stand against religious
coercion.
	   Nicole Kidman took the lead in David Hare's ``The Blue Room,''
first in London, then in New York. But the furor wasn't over her
move from screen to stage. It was over the skin. She briefly
appears on stage in the nude. ``No _ repeat no _ cellulite,''
gasped one London critic. ``Pure theatrical Viagra,'' panted
another. (Both are male).
	   Officials at the Manhattan Theatre Club reported anonymous death
threats against actors, audiences and playwright Terrence McNally
after announcing that they would stage his ``Corpus Christi,''
about a gay Jesus-like figure. It opened anyway.
	   Ginger Spice said goodbye to the gang, but the rest of the
Spices made a triumphant tour of North America. Then Scary Spice
and Posh Spice got pregnant, sparking concerns that hordes of very
young fans would follow their example.
	   A Somali writer and playwright won the prestigious Neustadt
International Prize for Literature. Nuruddin Farah's
English-language novels include ``From a Crooked Rib,'' ``Close
Sesame'' and ``Gifts.''
	   The year's big names in popular music included Garth Brooks,
Celine Dion, Usher, Shania Twain, Natalie Imbruglia, Lauryn Hill
and the Backstreet Boys.
	   On the museum blockbuster front, a rare exhibition of nearly two
dozen paintings by the Dutch Old Master Johannes Vermeer ran longer
than scheduled in the Netherlands because of the intense demand for
tickets. A Jackson Pollock retrospective at New York's Museum of
Modern Art was pulling in throngs as the year ended.
	   Stockholm, as the EU's Cultural Capital of Europe for 1998,
hosted a wide range of innovative cultural events. Among the best
received was a production of August Strindberg's ``A Dream Play,''
directed by American Robert Wilson. The stylish, austere sets and
the actors' dazed Kabuki-like movements complemented the script's
shifts between eerie allegory and heartbreakingly intimate
expressions of loneliness and loss.
	   ``Eternity and a Day,'' by Greek director Theo Angelopoulos, won
Cannes' Golden Palm, and the Grand Prize went to ``Life is
Beautiful'' by Italy's Roberto Benigni, who directed and starred as
a father who uses desperate and hilarious means to shield his son
from the reality of a Nazi death camp.
	   Dogma 95, a collective of renegade Danish film directors, won
attention with its neo-cinema verite style. ``The Idiots'' and
``The Celebration'' display the collective's, well, dogma, which
calls for movies to be shot only on location, in color, with
handheld cameras.
	   ``Godzilla'' did significantly less than monster business at the
box office, but ``Titanic'' stayed afloat well into 1998, then
bobbed up again with people standing on line for hours to buy the
video. The ``X-Files'' film came out, without actually revealing
much more of the TV show's mythology, and ``Wag the Dog,'' released
at the tail end of 1997, only gathered momentum as the
Clinton-Lewinsky scandal brewed up in 1998.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United States and Britain ended air
strikes against Iraq, hours after Iraq's vice president said
Baghdad will end dealings with the U.N. Special Commission
overseeing weapons inspections.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton later said he hoped U.N. arms
inspectors could return to Baghdad with full Iraqi cooperation. But
Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan's words suggested Iraq would not
allow the arms inspection program to resume.
	   ``The Special Commission is now behind us. Its mission is
over,'' Ramadan told a news conference Saturday night, referring to
the U.N. agency in charge of the inspections.
	   The implications of Iraq's decision to end U.N. inspections are
grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction as well as overseeing long-range monitoring to ensure
Iraq does not rebuild its lethal arsenal.
	   Ramadan made his statement just after air raid sirens wailed and
anti-aircraft guns opened fire, signaling a fourth round of strikes
was underway. A half-dozen loud blasts from incoming missiles then
rocked Baghdad.
	   Two missiles struck near the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry,
gouging a 40-foot (12-meter) hole into the earth, just 10 feet (3
meters) from an information office by the ministry gate.
	   The impact of the missiles, which struck at 9:45 p.m. (1845
GMT), shattered the windows of the small, one-story office. Three
guards were injured in the blast, Iraqi officials said.
	   The attacks came soon after Baghdad's residents broke their fast
on the first day of Ramadan, the Muslim holiday that marks Prophet
Mohammed's receiving the Koran from God 1,400 years ago. Muslims
fast during daylight throughout the month-long holiday.
	   Iraq has faced repeated airstrikes since early Thursday morning
when U.S. and British forces launched an air offensive to punish
the regime of President Saddam Hussein for obstructing the U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   The government has not given complete casualty tolls from the
air strikes. It said 25 people were killed and 75 wounded in the
first two attacks, and later reports said 17 died and 21 were
wounded in strikes on the northern city of Kirkuk and the province
of Tameem.
	   Ramadan refused to give a casualty figure, but said the number
of civilians killed was ``10 times more than the military men.''
	   In declaring the strikes over, Clinton said the 70-hour
Operation Desert Fox had inflicted ``significant damage'' on Iraq's
arms programs, command structure and military and security
infrastructure.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a similar announcement in
London about the airstrikes ending.
	   Speaking from the White House, Clinton said the United States
would welcome the return of inspectors from UNSCOM and the separate
U.N. nuclear agency to Baghdad but insisted on full Iraqi
cooperation.
	   If the inspectors cannot return, he said, the United States will
be ready to unleash its formidable force in the Gulf in new attacks
on Iraq if Saddam's government renews weapons-building.
	   ``We will maintain a strong military presence in the area and we
will remain ready to use it,'' Clinton said.
	   He said the United States wanted to maintain U.N. sanctions on
Iraq imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But he also urged
continuing the oil-for-food program that is an exception to the
sanctions ban on Iraqi oil exports and provides food and medicine
for the 22 million Iraqis.
	   The president said, too, that the United States would continue
working with Iraqi opposition groups in hopes of replacing Saddam's
regime.
	   At his Baghdad news conference, Ramadan repeated Iraq's
contention that ousting Saddam was the real goal of the military
strikes.
	   ``I am telling those who were promised the elimination of our
great leader that the symbol of the nation, its lofty example, will
remain,'' Ramadan said.
	   He also repeated Iraq's allegation that the arms inspection
program was a tool of the Americans aimed at keeping sanctions on
Iraq.
	   Under U.N. resolutions adopted after the 1991 Gulf War, the
economic sanctions cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq is free of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   The airstrikes began a day after U.N. inspection chief Richard
Butler declared that Iraq had not cooperated with inspectors since
promising to do so after the end of another crisis in mid-November.
	   U.S. and British officials maintained their strikes were aimed
at military targets, and Britain showed videotapes of hits on posts
of the elite Republican Guard. But Ramadan listed such civilian
targets as communications and electricity facilities.
	   Baghdad residents said damage from the attacks was heavy and
that a number of buildings in the capital's downtown _ including
palaces, security headquarters and offices of the ruling Baath
Party _ had been hit.

Kosovo Albanians prepare to bury dead

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians were preparing to
bury 36 men killed last week in a clash with Serbian border guards,
as international officials tried to strengthen unity among Albanian
leaders.
	   Relatives of 36 ethnic Albanian guerrilla fighters killed in a
border clash last Monday recovered the bodies from the Serb-run
morgue in Prizren and were to bury them on Sunday.
	   French and Austrian diplomats led a group of international
officials to the provincial capital Saturday for talks with ethnic
Albanian leaders, in an attempt to bring together the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army and more moderate followers of Ibrahim Rugova for
talks with Serbian officials.
	   ``We want to give a strong signal to the Kosovo Albanian side
(that) it's time now to start real negotiating at a broad base ...
that represents all the Kosovo Albanian political forces,'' said
Wolfgang Petritsch, Austria's Ambassador to Belgrade.
	   Petritsch, along with French Ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, Jacques Huntzinger, met first with Fehmi Agani, the head
of Kosovo's ethnic Albanian negotiating team.
	   He said they got a ``positive response'' from Agani, ``but we
are still short of a real and definite commitment that will lead to
a concrete forming of such a team.''
	   Agani represents Rugova's camp, which has said it will accept
broad autonomy within Serbia, while the KLA is determined to fight
for full independence.
	   Representatives of the six-member international Contact Group _
including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States and
Russia _ also attended the talks and later met with KLA spokesman,
Adem Demaci.
	   Asked how and when the KLA might join political negotiations, in
which they have not previously been included because of their
continued military activity, Petritsch challenged the Kosovo
Albanian side to ``come up with a solution to this.''
	   He added ``there are positive signals that the KLA is realizing
... that they have to decide whether to continue on the military
path or if they want to join political negotiating process.''
	   The talks come on the heels of what has been the bloodiest week
in Kosovo since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to
scale back his troops in October. More than 1,000 people have been
killed and up to 300,000 forced from their homes since fighting
escalated early last year.
	   Saturday morning, three men appeared in a car outside the house
of William Walker, who leads the roughly 2,000-strong international
observer mission, shouting and pointing their machine gun at
Walker's unarmed security guards, said mission spokesman Jorgen
Grunnet.
	   The incident was reported to the Serbian police, but Grunnet
said the response was not adequate. He said Walker complained
sharply about the incident to the Yugoslav authorities who are
obliged to protect the monitors.

Anniversary celebration for first great hymn writer in English

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Few who sing ``Joy to the world'' this holiday
season would suspect they're singing a psalm.
	   For one thing, you wouldn't look in the Old Testament for such a
joyous salute to the birth of Jesus, an event far in the future.
	   But Isaac Watts, whose great hymns include ``O God our help in
ages past'' and ``When I survey the wondrous cross,'' wanted psalms
and hymns to convey a distinctly Christian message to the
churchgoers of his time.
	   Thus, he reworked Psalm 98 as ``Joy to the world.'' And Psalm
72, in Watts' version, became ``Jesus shall reign, where're the
sun.''
	   In the 250th year since his death, the songs of Isaac Watts
remain a staple of the Christian repertoire.
	   ``Simply, he is the best hymn writer that there has ever been,''
said J.R. Watson, professor of English at the University of Durham.
	   Watson's book, the ``The English Hymn _ A Historical and
Critical Study,'' published last year by Oxford University Press,
includes a large chapter on Watts.
	   ``What he does is to take all the elements of post-Reformation
religious expression _ metrical psalms, divine lyrics, the first
stabs at hymn writing _ and forges them into one magnificent art,''
Watson said. ``I think he is an extraordinarily clear writer,
wonderfully direct and pierces to the heart of things, as great
poetry should.''
	   Watts wrote more than 600 psalms and hymns. His contemporary,
the lexicographer and critic Samuel Johnson, said Watts ``was one
of the first who taught the Dissenters to write and speak like
other men, by showing them that elegance might consist with
piety.''
	   Watts died on Nov. 25, 1748, and commemorations of the 250th
anniversary centered on his native Southampton. He is recalled in
that city every four hours when the clock in the Civic Center
chimes the tune of ``O God our help in ages past.''
	   (Watts' original version was ``Our God, our help'' _ the
revision was by John Wesley.)
	   The Rev. Cliff Bembridge of Avenue St. Andrew's United Reformed
Church in Southampton said Watts' hymns continue to appeal because
of their simplicity and their depth.
	   ``He had a wonderful ability to put across deep theological
concepts in language ordinary people could relate to,'' Bembridge
said.
	   Born July 17, 1674, Watts was the son of a dissenter who refused
to conform to the Church of England and was in prison when Watts
was born. However, the boy had a privileged upbringing, being
schooled in Latin, Greek and French.
	   His hymn-writing stemmed from his dissatisfaction with practice
at the time of singing versified translations of the Psalms.
	   ``To see the dull indifference, the negligent and thoughtless
air that sits upon the faces of a whole assembly, while the psalm
is upon their lips, might tempt even a charitable observer to
suspect the fervency of their inward religion,'' he once declared.
	   In one of his hymn books, Watts summarized his method and aims:
	   ``I have entirely omitted several whole psalms, and large pieces
of many others; and have chosen out of all of them, such parts only
as might easily and naturally be accommodated to the various
occasions of Christian life, or at least might afford us some
beautiful allusions to Christian affairs ...
	   ``Where the Psalmist uses sharp invectives against his personal
enemies, I have endeavored to turn the edge of them against our
spiritual adversaries, sin, Satan, and temptation. Where the
flights of his faith and love are sublime, I have often sunk the
expressions within the reach of an ordinary Christian.''
	   And where the psalms referred to ``Israel,'' Watts might well
substitute ``Britain,'' as in his version of Psalm 47, which
includes the phrase ``the British islands are the Lord's, there
Abraham's God is known.''
	   ``Joy to the world,'' so prominent in American celebrations of
Christmas, is largely unknown in Britain, and is only now beginning
to spread through the hymnals.
	   The song's popularity in the United States owes much to Lowell
Mason, the Presbyterian hymn composer. Mason paired Watts' words
with an English tune, ``Antioch,'' in a collection titled
``Occasional Psalm and Hymn Tunes, Selected and Original,''
published in 1836.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ At first, the crowd at the opening of a
recent art exhibit looked like typical well-bred aesthetes, cocking
their heads and rubbing their chins as they regarded the sculptures
on display.
	   Then they went pagan _ grinning fiercely and cheering as the
5-meter-tall (15-foot-tall) works were consumed by flames. It was
opening night at the first European Championships in Fire
Sculpture, whose combination of the creative and destructive urges
is spreading through the Continent from its Swedish birthplace.
	   Swedes can't lay claim to inventing fire, but they're the first
to codify it as an art form _ not surprisingly, given the
importance of fire in Swedish culture, from the giant celebratory
blazes of Midsummer's Eve to the crowns of candles worn by girls on
Sankta Lucia Day in September.
	   Plus, ''In our weather, you have to have fire to make it
through,'' said Gunnar Carl Nilsson of the Swedish Fire Sculpture
Association, shivering in the snow-laced exhibition field under a
sky already black at 4 p.m.
	   The exhibitors weren't just acting out latent adolescent
pyromaniac tendencies; Nilsson's sponsoring association was at
pains to point out that at least one member of each competing team
had to have a genuine college degree in art or five years
documented experience as a working artist.
	   The association knows that good art is more than
self-indulgence, so it imposes rules: each team had to build its
sculpture within eight hours, using only straw, twine and wooden
supports; the sculpture must take no less than five and no more
than 20 minutes to burn, the rules say, adding sniffily that the
work should go up ``not like a mere bonfire.''
	   ``It is a matter of form,'' said Nilsson, a man who combines the
powerful build of a fireman with the extensive beard of a bohemian.
	   Meeting that goal is a surprising challenge. Of the nine
sculptures that were featured in the competition, held in a
snow-laced field raked by icy winds, only a couple looked as good
burning up as they did before the flames _ or vice versa.
	   The work that caught many eyes early on was an elegant sculpture
by a Polish team that resembled the skeleton of a Viking ship. But
the thin ropes of straw that made it a striking sight pre-flames
burned feebly.
	   On the other end of the continuum, the assemblage by Mental
Istid (Mental Ice Age) of Sweden of three boulder-like masses on
long poles burned wonderfully, and were cleverly constructed to
fall open as they blazed. But the sculptures were so ugly that one
would have wanted to set them on fire even if that hadn't been what
they were built for, just to get rid of them.
	   The crowd favorite _ it even prompted barks from some
spectators' dogs _ was a French team's work. Intact, it was rather
Brancusi-like, a heavy mass with pleasing curves. Once afire, the
panels that made it up separated in stages, unpeeling like an
artichoke.
	   Then a laugh ran through the crowd of about 500, everybody
seeming to get the joke at once: the sculpture was an artichoke and
the team called themselves Arti-Chaud (loosely Art and Heat).
	   Although the spectators left the hour-long show clearly pleased,
it's unclear how much of a future fire sculpture will have. The
artists likely can't go the usual route of getting galleries
interested in selling their works for high prices: someone who
shells out thousands of dollars for a sculpture presumably wants to
look at it for more than 20 minutes.
	   Are fire sculptors doomed to poverty and obscurity, then?
	   ''Don't say that!'' Nilsson laughed. Seriously, he said, he
thinks organizers of pageants and other outdoor events would be
perfect customers for this sort of work _ a market ready to get
hot.

After a 20-year absence, Hollywood enigma Terrence Mallick returns
</HEADLINE>
with 'Thin Red Line' &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``The Thin Red Line'' opens with a crocodile
disappearing into murky green water. That this begins an epic World
War II film and not a nature documentary speaks volumes about the
style and sensibilities of its director, Terrence Malick.
	   But it is also a metaphor for Malick's own Hollywood career. In
the 1970s, he directed two critically acclaimed films, ``Badlands''
and ``Days of Heaven,'' then gave it all up for 20 years, slipping
into the mysterious murk, before returning to direct ``The Thin Red
Line.''
	   The poetic, violent and visually stunning story of a squad of
GIs ordered to take a hill from the Japanese on Guadalcanal is one
of the most anticipated films of the year and a strong Academy
Award contender.
	   Why Malick dropped out, why he came back, and what he'll do next
are not entirely clear. The privacy-obsessed Malick hasn't given an
interview in more than two decades, and he isn't starting now.
	   ``You need mysteries in life and Terry certainly has provided
one,'' said George Stevens Jr., a longtime acquaintance and the
executive producer of ``The Thin Red Line,'' which opens in New
York and Los Angeles on Christmas Day and goes nationwide in
January.
	   Stevens is among those who believe the 55-year-old Malick, who
lives in Austin, Texas, isn't ready for another retirement, saying,
``I would make a daring prediction and say that he would undertake
another film before the millennium.''
	   Or not.
	   In 1978, Malick was at the peak of his creativity and power when
he stunned Hollywood by suddenly disappearing, becoming the movie
industry's own J.D. Salinger, the ``Catcher in the Rye'' author
whose mystique as a recluse almost eclipses his seminal work.
	   A former journalist, Rhodes scholar and college lecturer, Malick
had studied filmmaking in the first class of the American Film
Institute and impressed critics with his directorial debut in
``Badlands'' (1973). An eerie, fictionalized take on a 1958 killing
spree in the Midwest, ``Badlands'' introduced audiences to Martin
Sheen and Sissy Spacek.
	   His follow-up was ``Days of Heaven,'' a dark study of a romantic
triangle, starring another unknown, Richard Gere. Another feast for
the eyes, the film received four Oscar nominations, winning for
cinematography.
	   Neither film scored at the box office. But Paramount Pictures
loved ``Days of Heaven'' so much it gave Malick a production deal.
	   ``Days of Heaven,'' however, apparently drained Malick, who
clashed with his star and the producers and labored over the final
cut, tinkering with the film in the editing room for nearly two
years before its release.
	   ``Terry is a sensitive guy, and I know he got discouraged about
Hollywood,'' said Stevens, a veteran producer who had been the head
of AFI when Malick studied there. ``He went away for a year and
lost track of the time.''
	   The details of his exile from Hollywood are sketchy. He was in
Paris. He was in Austin. He was taking long walks in Canada to look
at birds. He was working on screenplays. He was working on a play.
Hollywood types who wanted to contact him had to leave a message
with his family in Oklahoma. Maybe he'd call back.
	   Somewhere in the middle of all this, in the late 1980s, Malick
got together with two independent producers in New York City, John
Roberdeau and Bobby Geisler, and pounded out a first draft of ``The
Thin Red Line,'' based on the James Jones novel in which Malick had
long been interested.
	   By 1995, the producers presented the ``Red Line'' project to
Mike Medavoy, a former studio head who was setting up a production
shop called Phoenix Pictures. Medavoy had also once been Malick's
agent.
	   Medavoy's clout and Malick's reputation got the project moving _
and brought some big-time talent out of the woodwork with offers to
work cheap. Brad Pitt stopped by for readings. Nicolas Cage, Johnny
Depp and Kevin Costner were all said to be interested. Major
actresses came forward, even though for a long time the only female
in the movie was in a photograph.
	   After Sony Pictures balked at co-financing the film, Medavoy and
company went to Fox 2000, which agreed to pony up money as long as
the movie had some name actors, and came in on time and on a budget
of about dlrs 50 million, tight for a war picture of such sweep and
with many battlefield special effects.
	   The movie did meet its timeline and budget requirements, and
Malick did sign up major talent, though mostly in cameos by George
Clooney, John Travolta and Woody Harrelson. Sean Penn got a beefy
supporting role as a cynical sergeant, as did Nick Nolte, as the
sadistically ambitious colonel.
	   ``The first thing that got me interested in movies was because
of his movies,'' said Penn, who, like other actors, gave up a large
salary for the chance to work with Malick. ``There's a poetry to
them that was very dramatic and affecting and exciting.''
	   Penn recalled that several years ago, while he was on a
cross-country driving trip, he met Malick in Texas. ``I as much as
told him if he ever made a movie again, let me know where to go and
give me a dollar, and I'll do it,'' Penn said.

	   The biggest role, that of the idealistic Kentucky-born Pvt.
Witt, went to an unknown: Jim Caviezel, whose most significant part
to date had been as Costner's little brother in ``Wyatt Earp.''
	   But the star of this picture is clearly Malick.
	   Filmed mostly on location in the Daintree Rainforest in
Queensland, Australia, ``The Thin Red Line'' drips with his lyrical
vision of the story, alternating horrific battle images with
National Geographic-style nature shots, some bloodied bodies here,
a soaring bird there, and lots of scenes of grass waving in the
wind.
	   The dialogue is spare and poetic, with extensive use of
voice-overs, from numerous characters, who say things like, ``How
did we lose the good that's given us?''
	   By all accounts, Malick was quick to shed 20 years of rust, and
the shoot went as smoothly as could be expected, considering the
harsh Australian location, a huge cast, an army of extras and
plenty of pyrotechnics.
	   The sweeping grass shots required Malick to learn the use of a
new camera crane, but, says producer Grant Hill _ a logistics
expert who worked on the monumental ``Titanic'' _ Malick ``went
very comfortably back into the process.''
	   ``I saw no hesitation there,'' Hill said.
	   Another thing Malick hasn't lost is his love of the editing
room. Less than two weeks before Christmas, he was still cutting
the film; a week earlier, he screened the movie for media and
trimmed scenes between two screenings.
	   And while those who worked on the movie say they believe Malick
hasn't made his last film for the next 20 years, one can never be
sure. Malick, Medavoy says, has something that many self-absorbed
movie types lack: a sense of perspective.
	   ``Only people in Hollywood would ask the question of why he
stopped directing,'' Medavoy said. ``Everybody else can fully
understand why he doesn't have to be in Hollywood. He once said to
me, 'You know, there's something to be said about not making
movies.''

Five questions with James Nesbitt: In a film full of charm, the pig
</HEADLINE>
farmer holds his own &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Like many an Irish film before it, the sweetly
quirky ``Waking Ned Devine'' is full of sweetly quirky folks.
There's the batty postmistress, the lusty young brunette, the
crotchety spinster.
	   And then there's Pig Finn, who raises hogs for a living and
can't shed the stench, even with the strongest of soaps. He longs
for that lusty young brunette, and she would gladly marry him, if
it weren't for the pigs.
	   With his wild dark curls and ready smile, Irish actor James
Nesbitt makes Pig Finn look like quite a catch. American audiences
may recognize him from the film ``Welcome to Sarajevo,'' in which
he played the cameraman. His latest project is the British TV
series, ``Cold Feet.''
	   ``I play a lovable, but sort of annoying, former serial
womanizer who's now married and committed,'' he said.
	   Nesbitt, 33, is married, and happily committed to his wife and
15-month-old daughter, Peggy. His daughter was born during the
filming of ``Waking Ned Devine,'' and while Nesbitt witnessed the
delivery during a break in shooting, he's still sorry that he was
on location on the Isle of Man for the first three weeks of her
life.
	   Nonetheless, Nesbitt said making the film was pure pleasure. The
lush, misty island provided a perfect backdrop for the picturesque
film, and its remoteness encouraged camaraderie among cast and
crew.
	   ``We spent a lot of time with each other in the pub,'' he said.
``There are worse ways to earn a living.''
	   1. ``Waking Ned Devine'' is filled with an awfully eccentric
cast of characters. Do you think it's typical of small-town
Ireland?
	   Nesbitt: Well, there's lots of dramatic license, but the west
coast of Ireland is full of these little tiny communities, where
there's about 60 people and everyone knows everyone else. I think
those types of places encourage eccentricity. They're bound to!
People have great battles and great friendships. And in those kind
of communities, there is tremendous warmth.
	   2. Did you ever have any experience with pigs?
	   Nesbitt: I did, actually. My first 11 years, I grew up in farm
country because my father was a private school headmaster. My
classmates were all farmers' children, so I was always around cows
and pigs. They're incredibly affectionate and friendly. I can see
getting attached to them. There is, undoubtedly, the smell. And you
know, they're often too friendly. They'll kind of try to mate with
you, which is really just too much.
	   3. The only strike against Pig Finn is the smell. Do you have
any little quirks that could potentially make you resistible?
	   Nesbitt: I suppose I'm too neat; I'm always tidying the place
up. God, there's all kinds of things I do that would drive a person
nuts. I should ask my wife.
	   4. The movie centers on a plot to help every villager share in a
big lottery jackpot. If you won 6 million pounds ( dlrs 10
million), what would you do with the money?
	   Nesbitt: There's nothing I particularly want for. I'd buy a
bigger house. I'd give some to my family. We'd probably go on a
grander holiday. But I have no grand ambitions to have that much
money. I know I'd spend it all, though.
	   5. What are you working on next?
	   Nesbitt: I've kind of been nonstop for the last three years, so
I'm taking a little break until February. If something great comes
along, I'll do it, but I'm looking forward to spending time with my
family.

	   In the spotlight: Andy Dick
	    &UR; Image: Andy Dick has dressed in a diaper and impersonated a
Calvin Klein underwear model.
	   He's also wrapped himself in orange paper and announced, ``I am
a torch for the Olympics.''
	    &UR; Personal Stats: Born on Dec. 21, 1965, in Charleston, South
Carolina, Dick learned early in life to use his sense of humor to
gain friends and to keep attention centered on himself.
	   ``Humor makes everyone your best friend. I had to make a
decision. I was either going to be the lonely, quirky guy, or I was
going to learn to walk into a room and get everyone's attention,''
he says.
	   Dick attended Illinois Wesleyan University and Columbia College
in Chicago. He was doing television commercials when actor-director
Ben Stiller cast him in the short film, ``Elvis Stories.'' It was
the first of several projects involving Dick and Stiller.
	    &UR; Television: His TV credits include the short-lived '90s version
of the '60s classic, ``Get Smart,'' as well as appearances on ``The
Nanny'' and ``The Ben Stiller Show.''
	   He is also known for his frequent appearances on the ``Late Show
With David Letterman'' as Donnie, ``the page who likes to suck
up,'' and as Ben, ``the guy who really likes milk.''
	    &UR; Theater: His theater credits include ``The Best of Second
City,'' ``Sony and Shares,'' ``Andy Dick's Circus of Freaks,''
``Without a Net'' and ``Willard Scott Dancers.''
	    &UR; Films: Dick has appeared in ``Flashback,'' ``In the Army Now,''
``For the Boys'' and ``Reality Bites.'' He had a cameo role in
``The Cable Guy.''
	    &UR; Andy on Matthew: Dick landed the role of Matthew Brock on NBC's
``NewsRadio'' when the show was launched in 1995. ``Matthew is very
emotionally invested in his work,'' says Dick. ``When we started
with this character, he was very sweet and sincere, then sarcastic
and mean. And finally the 'overly sensitive' guy won out.''
	    &UR; Other Tidbits: Dick is the voice of Nuka, an evil lion, in the
direct-to-video, ``The Lion King II: Simba's Pride.'' He is one of
the stars of the film, ``The Real Inspector Gadget,'' opposite
Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher and Cheri Oteri. He
has a role in ``Best Men,'' a dark comedy with Drew Barrymore and
Dean Cain. He also appears in the independent film, ``Advice From a
Caterpillar.''
	   He spends much of his time performing with underground,
alternative comedy groups in Los Angeles, where he hopes to open
his own comedy showcase theater.
	    &UR; Quote: ``Sometimes I feel like vanilla. Other days I feel like
orange sherbet. In the end, we're all melted in a huge puddle on
the kitchen floor.''

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ If James M. Cain (``Double Indemnity,'' ``The
Postman Always Rings Twice'') had ever written a Western novel, it
may well have turned out like ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' The new
Stephen Frears film is more about deceit, adultery and murder than
cattle drives and land grabs.
	   Actually the novel was written by Max Evans in 1961, and its raw
drama in post-World War II New Mexico appealed to a young director
named Sam Peckinpah. The maverick filmmaker (``The Wild Bunch'')
tried several times to make a deal for ``The Hi-Lo Country'' with
no success, and the project fell into limbo with his death in 1984.
	   More recently Martin Scorsese became interested in the novel.
Lacking time to direct it himself, he hired Stephen Frears (``The
Grifters,'' ``My Beautiful Laundrette''). Walon Green wrote the
screen adaptation.
	   The film opens with Pete Calder (Billy Crudup) waiting in his
pickup truck outside a prairie church where a funeral is taking
place. With a shotgun in his lap, he is obviously bent on revenge.
The reason why is told in flashback.
	   Pete and his best friend, Big Boy Matson (Woody Harrelson), have
returned from the war with plans for their own cattle operations.
Both represent a dying breed: the hard-drinking, wenching, fiercely
independent cowboy, prepared to use fists or guns to settle a
dispute.
	   Both men run their own herds of cattle, combining forces when
necessary. Their main competitor is Jim Ed Love (Sam Elliott), who
has established a major enterprise by amassing foreclosed land and
herds.
	   Before going off to war, Pete had been in love with Mona
(Patricia Arquette). He returned to discover that she has married
an older man (John Diehl), who is one of Jim Ed's lieutenants. That
doesn't stop Big Boy from pursuing a flaming affair with Mona and
flaunting it in her husband's face. Violence is inevitable.
	   Frears, who is British, obviously reveres the Western and its
traditions, and his fellow countryman and frequent collaborator,
Oliver Stapleton, captures the unspoiled beauty of the untamed West
with his camera. Walon Green, who co-wrote ``The Wild Bunch,''
knows the territory, and he keeps the tangled love duel in focus.
	   As the roisterous, impulsive but loyal Big Boy Matson, Harrelson
delivers another of his grimacing, manic portrayals. Crudup as Pete
Calder narrates the film and becomes a tragic figure because of his
own love for Mona. His handsome, expressive face fits the role,
which could be a breakout for Crudup's career.
	   Arquette invests her role with sympathy despite Mona's
wantonness. The Western types are ideally cast, especially Elliott
as the sly, ruthless landowner.
	   Enthusiasts for the traditional Western may be put off by the
dark, foreboding tone that pervades ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' But it
is fascinating to watch a collection of good actors in
uncompromising drama against the wide-open New Mexico skies.
	   The Gramercy Pictures release was produced by Scorsese and
Barbara De Fina, Eric Fellner and Tim Bevan. Running time: 114
minutes.

At The Movies: `The Prince of Egypt'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Movie opened Friday. `Rameses' is cq &QL; 
 &UR; By MALCOLM RITTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Move over, Cecil B. De Mille.
	   ``The Prince of Egypt'' is a powerful, moving dramatization of
the story of Moses, filled with enough spectacle to make De Mille
envious.
	   Huge vistas, mass crowd scenes and stunning special effects make
this an epic tale. It would be easy to sit there and just wait for
the next visual treat, but the story itself is too engrossing to
let you go.
	   Parents, beware. Just because this movie is animated doesn't
mean it's right for all kids. It doesn't sugarcoat grisly aspects
of the Old Testament story. The viewer is right there with the
slaves as they're whipped and with the Egyptian soldiers as they're
swallowed up by the Red Sea. A prominent hieroglyphic plainly shows
soldiers dropping babies into crocodile-infested waters. And don't
expect any comic relief.
	   Most disturbing to kids might be an absolutely chilling scene
where a mistlike Angel of Death snakes through town at night,
killing first-born children. You see a child's arm fall limp; you
hear the wailing of the mothers; you see Pharaoh carrying the body
of his son. If you take your kids, be prepared to explain why God
would do this.
	   The movie follows Moses from the time his mother sets him afloat
to a better life _ a surprisingly touching scene _ to his
descending from the mountains with the Ten Commandments. But this
story isn't quite the one from the Bible. At the opening, a printed
announcement says it's an adaptation, and that if you want the real
story, read Exodus.
	   Fair enough. In the DreamWorks version, Moses (with the voice of
Val Kilmer) grows up in his adoptive family as a son of Pharaoh and
the brother of Rameses (voiced by Ralph Fiennes). Moses is shaken
when a chance meeting with his biological sister Miriam (voice of
Sandra Bullock) makes him realize his Israelite origins. He flees
the palace, finding love and a sheepherder's life.
	   But when he encounters the burning bush, he has a new mission:
to free his people from slavery under Pharoah. He returns to the
palace and discovers that Rameses is now on the throne. From here,
the movie plays the story as a conflict between brothers. It makes
for a powerfully human tale.
	   The filmmakers blended traditional and computerized animation,
with outstanding results. For example, a chariot race between Moses
and Rameses is dizzying as they dart through streets and careen
down a collapsing scaffold. There's also a clever dream scene where
hieroglyphics come alive and dash across a textured wall.
	   The biggest visual stunner, as one might guess, is the parting
of the Red Sea. DreamWorks says it took more than 318,000 hours of
work by animators, technicians and others to create these seven
minutes of screen time. The result is spectacular.
	   Two quibbles. The last scene, where Moses comes down from the
mountain with the stone tablets, just seems tacked on. And while
the music deftly turns the mood from somber to hopeful as Moses and
his people leave their former captors _ a scene that includes the
moving ``When You Believe'' _ the songs and score in general don't
stick with the viewer after the show.
	   No matter. There's still a lot to savor.
	   ``The Prince of Egypt'' was directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve
Hickner and Simon Wells, and produced by Penney Finkelman Cox and
Sandra Rabins. In addition to those already mentioned, among the
actors lending their voices are Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum,
Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin and
Martin Short.

	   LONDON (AP) _ After signaling an end to airstrikes in Iraq,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair defended the decision to use
military force, and told Iraqi civilians that they were not targets
of the four-day bombing mission which ended Saturday.
	   ``We have attacked targets with the greatest precision to
minimize civilian casualties to the greatest extent possible,''
Blair said in an announcement Saturday made outside his official
No. 10 Downing Street residence.
	   ''We regret deeply any loss of civilian life there has been,''
he said.
	   Blair, speaking at the same time as President Bill Clinton
addressed the American people, said that the military operation,
codenamed ''Desert Fox,'' ended Saturday in part due to British and
U.S. ''sensitivity'' to Ramadan, the month in which observant
Muslims should spend fasting and in ritual prayer.
	   In a message designed for skeptics of military action, both in
the West and the Middle East, Blair reiterated the reasons for
airstrikes, and said that they were aimed solely at Saddam
Hussein's regime.
	   ``I say to the Iraqi people, our quarrel is not and never has
been with you. We have a common enemy in Saddam. But whilst he
remains in power we will remain determined to prevent him abusing
that power and putting at risk the stability of his region and the
world.''
	   Although Britain's military role was as a junior partner to the
larger U.S. force, military planners here say that targets for
attack by the 12 Royal Air Force Tornado GR1 bombers, stationed in
Kuwait 35 miles (55 kilometers) from the southern Iraqi border,
included elite Republican Guard units on which Saddam relies to
defend his regime, and sites which Britain and the United States
believe are linked to Saddam's attempt to acquire chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.
	   ``We set out to diminish and degrade Saddam's military
capability, and we have done so,'' Blair said. ``Substantial damage
has been inflicted upon his air defense systems, the command and
control system for his armed forces, missile production capability,
and the systems which could be used for chemical and biological
warfare.''
	   But Blair warned that Britain and the U.S. ``remain ready to act
again'' if Saddam's regime continued to pose a threat to security.
The prime minister said he would give further details on Sunday of
initial damage assessment caused by the airstrikes.
	   The United States and Britain decided to attack Iraq after the
U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, reported last week that
Saddam's regime had failed to cooperate fully with its arms
inspectors.
	   The two nations say that Saddam has tried to produce weapons of
mass destruction, and has used them against his neighbors.
	   U.S. and British officials have reported that more than 100
targets were hit during the first three days of airstrikes. Iraq's
Republican Guard was a major focus of the third night of bombing,
marked by thunderous attacks against targets in and around Baghdad.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Hours before the announced end of U.S. and
British airstrikes on Iraq, a leading Iraqi official said the
attacks had prompted his government to end all dealings with U.N.
arms inspectors searching for Iraq's prohibited weapons.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, in announcing an end to the
attacks, said he hoped U.N. arms inspectors could return to Baghdad
with full Iraqi cooperation. But Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan
suggested the arms inspection program would never resume.
	   ``The Special Commission is now behind us. Its mission is
over,'' Ramadan told a news conference Saturday night, referring to
the U.N. agency in charge of the inspections.
	   The implications of Iraq's decision to end U.N. inspections are
grave. UNSCOM is charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction as well as overseeing long-range monitoring to ensure
Iraq does not rebuild its lethal arsenal.
	   After Clinton's announcement, some Iraqis said the president's
decision to bomb had only produced more destruction for Iraq and
failed to change the situation of Iraqis suffering under U.N.
sanctions.
	   ``What has he gained? All these missiles and destruction ... all
this suffering and ends it as if nothing has happened,'' said
Muhend Fawzi, an engineer.
	   Fawzi was among a group of young Iraqis who spent the past four
nights in a government shelter in fear of the airstrikes.
	   ``I'm afraid it isn't taking us anywhere. Again we are back to
where we started,'' said one of Fawzi's companions, laborer Khalid
Zuheir.
	   ``May God curse him (Clinton). I can't see why he bombed and why
he stopped,'' said Falah Hassan.

Iraqis curse Clinton as they they leave air raid shelters

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Some Iraqis cursed U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Sunday as he ended U.S. airstrikes on their country, and others
said the four days of missile attacks would produce no change in
their sad situation.

<TEXT>
	   ``What has he (Clinton) gained? All these missiles and
destruction ... all this suffering and it ends it as if nothing has
happened,'' said Muhend Fawzi, an engineer.
	   Fawzi was among a group of young Iraqis who spent the past four
nights in a government shelter for fear of being hit by U.S. or
British bombs.
	   They rolled their bed sheets and left the concrete underground
shelter, discontent evident on their faces.
	   ``I am not happy. I'm afraid it isn't taking us anywhere. Again
we are back to where we started,'' said Fawzi's companion, laborer
Khalid Zuheir.
	   ``May God curse him (Clinton). I can't see why he bombed and why
he stopped,'' said Falah Hassan.
	   Clinton on Saturday night announced he was halting the
airstrikes, saying the attacks achieved their goal and caused
``significant'' damage to the arms-making abilities of President
Saddam Hussein's government.
	   But he also said the United States urged the continuation of
trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Iraq that
have impoverished the once-rich country by cutting off its oil
exports.
	   Murad Muhsen, who had a radio with him inside the shelter, said
those holed up inside got up-to-date coverage not only on Iraq but
on impeachment proceedings against Clinton.
	   ``If the U.S. Congress accuses Clinton of perjury and
obstruction of justice how can we Iraqis believe what he says,''
Muhsen said when asked his feelings about Clinton saying the latest
offensive would help the Iraqis out of their predicament.
	   As dawn approached Sunday, it looked like a normal day for
Ramadan, the holy month when Muslims fast during the daylight
hours. The month began Saturday.
	   In Bab al-Sharji in downtown Baghdad, restaurants prepared
lentil soup for sohour _ the pre-dawn breakfast Muslims have during
Ramadan.
	   At Sahat al-Tayran, a main Baghdad square, members of the
militia of the ruling Baath Party sat in cafes with their rifles on
their laps, sipping tea and listening to the radio.
	   Some militia members brandished rifles and shouted: ``Saddam,
your name has shaken America.''
	   Abdulrazzaq Abdulhameed, who was cooking kebabs over burning
coal on a vendor's cart, said: ``The one who starts the war and
ends it at whim is the culprit. The Congress is right to send a
liar like Clinton to trial.''
	   Abu Yarub, a soldier, was bitter. ``Clinton this time inflicted
great harm on us. He had no reason to do that.''
	   The loudspeakers atop a mosque minaret blared recitations from
the Koran, the Muslim holy book. Old men strolled to mosque for
prayer.
	   ``I do not understand politics. I am going to pray,'' said Haji
Umer, 65.

tide Saturday while swimming at Waiotahi Beach, 300 kilometers (190
miles) south of Auckland.
	   The pair, one believed by local police to be an Israeli tourist,
and the other living locally but carrying a British passport, were
swimming outside the lifeguard-flagged and patrolled area at the
beach when they were swept away by the rip.
	   Names of the missing have not been released.
	   Despite an extensive search by two surf rescue boats, a
helicopter and along the shoreline, the pair had not been located
or seen more than 24 hours later, police said Sunday.

South Korean wins men's marathon as Asian Games competition ends

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Olympic silver medalist Lee Bong-ju of
South Korea outdueled a stubborn Japanese in the men's marathon
Sunday, winning the final gold medal of the 13th Asian Games.
	   Running neck-and-neck with Japan's Akira Manai for all but the
last three kilometers of the 42.195-kilometer (26-mile, 385-yard)
race, Lee captured the gold in 2 hours, 12, minutes, 32 seconds.
	   Manai finished in 2:13:25, with the bronze going to North
Korea's Kim Jung Won in 2:16:30.
	   The men's marathon concluded 15 days of competition at the Asian
Games. Thailand's Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn was to formally
close the 41-nation sportsfest Sunday night.
	   The race was a relatively slow one for the goateed, 28-year-old
South Korean. At Rotterdam earlier this year, he ran history's 23rd
fastest marathon in 2:07:44.
	   At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Lee missed gold by just three
seconds, finishing behind Josia Thugane, the first black South
African to win an Olympic gold medal.
	   Starting at 7 a.m. (0000 GMT) amid the ancient temples of
Ayuthaya, north of Bangkok, most among the field of 15 were soaked
in sweat by the fifth kilometer, which Lee, Manai, Kim Jung Won and
South Korea's Kim Yi-yong passed in 15 minutes, 59 seconds.
	   This quartet ran the next 10 kilometers in a closely bunched
pack. At the 15-kilometer mark, Lee was clocked in 46:40, with the
other three a second behind.
	   At 1:01:58, Lee was still a second ahead of Manai and Kim
Jung-won at 20 kilometers, while the North Korean began to slip
back. He did not make his move for the bronze until the last stages
of the race.
	   Although Kim Yi-yong nipped at their heels, the rest of the race
proved a grueling duel between Lee and Manai.
	   At 30 kilometers, Lee was just three seconds ahead of Manai and
at 35 kilometers, four seconds. Just before the 40-kilometer mark
Lee began to widen the gap.
	   Although Japan's Tsutomu Sassa finished fourth, a Japanese camp
seeking Olympic and international glory was not cheering too loudly
at the men's marathon results.
	   ``We must work harder,'' Teruji Kogake, who heads Japan's team
at the games, said on the eve of the marathon. ``Unfortunately our
men are not up to the high standard of the women marathoners.''
	   He said about 20 men were now in the ``development stage'' but
no champions had yet emerged.
	   By contrast, Japan's wispy Naoko Takahashi came within a minute
of the women's world marathon record when she won the games' first
gold in 2:21:47. Running without any serious challengers, she
crossed the finish line 13 minutes ahead of her nearest rival.

Kuwaiti player injured in Asian Games final goes home with broken

arm &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Kuwaiti midfielder Ahmad al-Mutairi
broke his arm in the Asian Games soccer final with Iran but was
able to join his disappointed teammates in flying home to the
oil-rich sheikdom, Kuwaiti sporting officials said Sunday.
	   ``He's feeling better now and went home with the team last
night,'' said Saoud Mohammad, a Kuwaiti soccer federation official.
	   Iranian defender Mehdi Madhavikia was sent off in the 78th
minute after raising his boot high during a running interception,
colliding with al-Mutairi. The Kuwaiti player was carried off the
field and did not return.
	   The sending-off failed to help Kuwait score, and Iran won its
second Asian Games gold medal, 2-0. Kuwait's coach, Milan Macala,
called al-Mutairi's injury a result of poor officiating that failed
to keep the bruising Iranian defense in check.

China sends jailed dissident into exile ahead of other's trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China released an ailing labor rights campaigner
from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile
in the United States, a human rights group reported.
	   Liu Nianchun's release contrasted with a relentless
three-week-old crackdown against dissidents trying to form an
opposition political party. A third leading organizer of the China
Democracy Party and the group's most prominent leader, Xu Wenli,
goes on trial for subversion Monday.
	   Liu was taken from the Tuanhe labor camp on the outskirts of
Beijing, driven to the capital's airport and put on a Northwest
Airlines flight, the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported. It added that he was
ultimately headed for New York.
	   Authorities released Liu exactly six months before the end of
his prison term but made his freedom conditional on his going into
exile, the Hong Kong-based group reported.
	   Liu was one of the most respected figures in China's fractured,
persecuted dissident community. His more than 3 1/2 years in
prisons and labor camps was a sad illustration of the way China's
Communist Party rulers punish people they deem a threat.
	   Liu was imprisoned at three times in the past 17 years. His last
arrest came after he signed a petition calling for labor rights in
May 1995.
	   Liu was never put on trial. Fourteen months passed before his
wife, Chu Hailan, first learned of his whereabouts: a labor camp in
the frigid, far northeast.
	   Police have the power to send criminal suspects to labor camps
for up to three years without trial. Labor camp officials later
extended Liu's sentence by a year for trying to escape, a charge
Chu claimed was fabricated.
	   Inside the labor camp, Liu once started a hunger strike to
protest his treatment. He was beaten with cattle prods and confined
to a room of 2 square meters (2 square yards) where he could only
sit or stand.
	   His wife tirelessly campaigned for his release. Chu was dragged
away and hit by security forces when she tried to hand a letter to
U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson outside a Beijing hotel in
September.

South Korea's Lee wins final race of Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Lee Bong-ju pulled away
from Japan's Akira Manai in the marathon Sunday, pounding a final
stamp of victory on the Asian Games' real battle _ between their
two nations for second in the gold standings.
	   After Lee won the games' final race by nearly a minute, he ran a
victory lap with a South Korean flag while Manai took one step over
the finish line and hung his head in fatigue.
	   Lee's triumph left South Korea ahead of Japan 65 to 52 in gold
medals, although Japan came out ahead 180-165 in total medals.
	   Nobody expected to surpass sports giant China, which finished
with 129 of the 378 gold medals awarded, or 34 percent. The Chinese
had taken 135 of the 342 golds, or 39 percent, at the last games in
1994.
	   Compared to four years ago, the Chinese lost some ground to
Japan in swimming and track events.
	   In some cases where the Chinese won, such as in diving and
rowing, they said the Asian competition was too easy. The diving
coach said his team still faced hard work if it wanted to make the
desired impact at the 2000 Olympics.
	   Looking ahead to 2000 at Sydney was a major theme for China,
South Korea and Japan, while some of the smaller teams were
celebrating their chance to shine on the Asian stage.
	   Host Thailand finished with 24 gold medals, double its initial
target and double its best previous finish _ 12 in 1966.
	   That tied it with Kazakstan for fourth in golds.
	   Hong Kong, which had only one gold from all previous Asian
Games, came out with five.
	   But 2000 also was a concern for marathon winner Lee, who missed
a 1996 Olympic gold by just three seconds.
	   ``I was disappointed with the time. The temperature was too
high,'' Lee said. ``But I am delighted to win the gold.''
	   ``Now I have two goals: a gold medal at the Sydney Olympics and
to break the world marathon record, maybe next year at London,
Rotterdam or Boston,'' he added.
	   Chinese women weightlifters did all the world record setting
here, breaking marks on all seven days of their competition at the
games.
	   But in the more prestigious track events, Japanese runners
turned in the best time. Koji Itoh just missed the exclusive club
of men who have run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds, turning in
a 10-flat semifinal in the semifinals before winning the gold in a
slightly slower time.
	   With nobody pushing her, Japan's Naoko Takahashi missed the
world women's marathon record by just one minute as she won the
games' opening race by 13 minutes.
	   South Korea and Japan, the 2002 soccer World Cup co-hosts,
suffered the embarrassment of not reaching the semifinals of the
games' soccer tournament. Iran beat Kuwait 2-0 for the gold medal,
while China shut out Thailand 3-0 for the bronze.
	   And overall, said Japanese delegation leader Teruji Kogake,
``our total number of gold medals did not reach our target.''
	   Kogake noted that Japan lost to the South Koreans in 14 of 15
team sports, and suffered humiliating defeats in baseball and
volleyball.
	   ``We must use the setbacks in the games as an impetus to put
together the strongest possible team for the Sydney Olympics,''
Kogake said.
	   On the plus side, there had been only two positive tests for
doping as of Sunday, compared with 15 at the 1994 games, when the
disqualification of 11 Chinese in track and swimming affected the
medals standings.
	   Both cases at these games were weightlifters _ a Jordanian and a
Kuwaiti _ who finished no better than seventh in their events.
	   ``I hope we don't have any more in future,'' said Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia, the games'
governing body.
	   But, he added, ``I am very happy that there have been only two
cases, not important cases, not involving champions.''
