<HEADLINE> Belgrade Calls for More Respect for Yugoslav Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade Tuesday called
on the U.N. Security Council to nullify "all illegal regulations
and decisions" of the U.N. special representative in Kosovo, a
Serbian province, in order to fully honor the Security Council
Resolution 1244, which demands full respect for the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a letter to the president of the
Security Council from Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslav Government insists that all illegal regulations
and decisions of the Special Representative of the
Secretary-General violating the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, such as the
introduction of a separate currency and customs duties, the
arbitrary appointment of judges, the opening of the Pristina
airport for civilian flights, etc., be nullified," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslav Government firmly demands that the document on
the transformation of the self-styled Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
be nullified, that the KLA be disarmed immediately,
unconditionally and fully and that its leaders who are accountable
for mass crimes and systematic ethnic cleansing be brought to
justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic wrote the letter after the Yugoslav Government
adopted a memorandum on the implementation of the Security Council
Resolution 1244 at the end of the November 4 meeting.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolution, the NATO-led international peacekeeping
force, known as KFOR, and the U.N. Interim Administrative Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK) arrived in Kosovo, a Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Government said that the security and overall
situation in Kosovo after the deployment of the international
security and civil presences, "was characterized by mass terror
against Serbs and other non-Albanians."
</P>
<P>
"The murders of 447 Serbs and members of other ethnic
communities, the abduction of 648 persons and the expulsion of
over 330,000 Serbs, Montenegrins and other non-Albanians from the
province are a direct result of the irresponsible and indolent
attitude of KFOR and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),
in particular the special representative of the Secretary-General,
Bernard Kouchner," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Out of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as set out in Security
Council resolution 1244 (1999), the Yugoslav Government will not
recognize KFOR and UNMIK decisions that are not in line with the
said resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Yugoslavia, as a sovereign country and a United Nations Member
State, has willingly accepted the deployment of international
forces under United Nations auspices in its territory, but insists
that the Security Council ensure the full respect of its
sovereignty and territorial integrity and take measures set out in
its resolution 1244 (1999) in that regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslav Government also demands that the Security Council
guarantee the free and safe return of all Serbs and other
non-Albanians expelled in the campaign of ethnic cleansing since
the arrival of KFOR and UNMIK in the Serbian province," he said.
"It demands that all foreign nationals who have entered the
territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia illegally be
expelled."

<HEADLINE> High Street Sales In UK Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Britain rose 1.7
percent last month compared to the previous October, the British
Retail Consortium (BRC) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest BRC's survey found that the value of total retail
sales in October was 4.7 percent above the same month in 1998,
making it the highest growth rate since January.
</P>
<P>
Despite the sales rise, the BRC maintained that conditions
remained difficult on the high street amid heavy price
discounting.
</P>
<P>
The BRC warned that the figures were flattered by poor sales in
October last year, the low point of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Analysts cautioned that new evidence of rising factory gate
prices meant that cost pressures could soon flow through to the
retail level.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the cost pressures, last week's decision by the Bank
of England to raise interest rates by 0.25 percent to 5.5 percent
prompted retail concerns of subdued Christmas sales.

<HEADLINE> UK Chancellor Raises Growth Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain can secure rising living
standards for all its people, Chancellor Gordon Brown told MPs in
the House of Commons Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brown predicted the UK's economy would expand by 1.75 percent
this year, and by 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said no-one could be left behind in building
prosperity for the new millennium, adding the New Deal for the
unemployed would be extended from the under-25s to everyone out of
work.
</P>
<P>
A taskforce would at the same time consider new measures to
force people to work, including making the unemployed sign on
every day instead of once a fortnight.
</P>
<P>
On public fiances, Brown said public finances were in better
shape than at the time of the main budget last March.
</P>
<P>
He forecast a public sector surplus of 3.5 billion pounds (5.69
billion US dollars) in the current fiscal year to next March and
3.0 billion pounds in the year after.
</P>
<P>
Brown said: "The challenge a year ago amid the global
turbulence and predictions of recession was to steer a course of
stability."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The 54th session of the
United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution
which once again urged the United States to put an end to the
embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted with 155 votes for, 2 against and
eight abstentions. The United States and Israel voted against the
Resolution.
</P>
<P>
This is the eighth year in a row that the United Nations
General Assembly overwhelmingly endorsed such a resolution.

According to U.N. diplomats, the record majority is larger than
that of last year's, 152 votes for, two against and 12
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly this morning debated on the necessity of
ending the U.S. 40-year-old embargo against Cuba. Almost all of
the allies and friends of the United States voted for the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the debate, President of Cuba's National Assembly
Ricardo Alarcon said Cuba would file a law suit against the United
States for more than 100 billion U.S. dollars in compensation for
the enormous damages caused by the U.S. economic embargo.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Army Asked to Be on Alert Against Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile Lahoud
Tuesday ordered his country's army to be on the alert in order to
cope with the aftermath of a possible Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The president issued the order while meeting with his successor
Army Commander Gen. Michel Suleiman.
</P>
<P>
"We are not afraid though we are passing through a delicate
situation, not dangerous," Lahoud said, alluding to the impact of
a possible Israeli pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Since assuming power in July, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has repeated his pledge to withdraw Israeli troops from
south Lebanon before next July 7, even without a peace deal
with Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria have rejected an Israeli offer by
its former government of Benjamin Netanyahu to withdraw from
Lebanon in return for an enhanced security guarantee by Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, which have been keeping a special
relationship, insist on a comprehensive peace settlement including
a withdrawal from Syrian Golan Heights captured by Israel during
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
"A withdrawal only from Lebanon, instead of both Lebanon and
Syria, will not be considered as a comprehensive and fair
peace. We will not be satisfied with that," the president added.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's remarks, which hinted that Lebanon is taking Barak's
pledge seriously, came one day after U.S. Ambassador in Beirut
David Satterfield made his first tour to the embattled south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
His tour has been portrayed by the Beirut and Tel Aviv press as
an on-the-spot survey of potential locations for radar and early
warning systems to be used by a multi-national force while policing
south Lebanon areas vacated by Israeli troops.

It was reported that some foreigners possess illegal passports

<HEADLINE> Corruption Accounts for Pakistani Previous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Pakistani Chief
Executive Pervez Musharraf on Tuesday attributed his ousting of
former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to "corruption and
mismanagement" of his government.
</P>
<P>
"Corruption and mismanagement of Sharif's government reflected
negatively on the performance of the security forces and the
army, which started to feel uneasy," said Musharraf, who arrived
here earlier in the day for a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
He said the Pakistanis are sick of corruption and wanted
change.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf ousted Sharif in a military coup on October
12.
</P>
<P>
On political life in Pakistan, Musharraf said the army does
not intend to interfere in civilian affairs, noting that the
judicial system is still operating effectively.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Kashmir, he said that his country wants a happy
ending to the decades-old dispute, adding that he has ordered some
of his forces on the borders with India to return to previous
positions.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India fought a 53-day war in the disputed Kashmir
region from late May to mid-July, after armed infiltrators, who
New Delhi claimed supported by Pakistan's armed forces, entered
the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani military leader had earlier met with Kuwaiti
Emir Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah on upgrading bilateral relations and
the latest situation in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This is Musharraf's second trip abroad, and also his second
time to visit the Gulf region since he took power. He has visited
Qatar and Turkey in his current tour.
</P>
<P>
He paid visits to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
late October.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's New Police Chief Vows to Combat Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The newly-appointed
commissioner of the South African Police Services, Jackie Selebi,
on Tuesday vowed to fight crimes with tougher measures, the South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
In his first briefing to Parliament's safety and security
committee, Selebi put violent crime at the top of his list which
he said had to be hit in the strongest possible way.
</P>
<P>
He also believed the perception that the city of Johannesburg
was the crime capital of the world was wrong, and that the police
would dispel this notion in " the shortest possible time".
</P>
<P>
Selebi said combating domestic violence needed the involvement
of the whole of society. It even needed the public broadcaster to
stop producing programs that encouraged violence.
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman Mluleki George warned that Parliament
would not allow budget constraints to be used as an excuse for not
dealing with crime.
</P>
<P>
"Money or no money, we're going to bring crime rate down in
this country, " George said at the briefing.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing commissioner George Fivaz told the committee that the
police needed more money to get rid of "old wood" in the force and
bring in new, and to fight crime in general.

CAIRO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Some 483,000 tourists visited Egypt in August this
year, 63,000 more than the figure in August 1998, promoting the
continued growth of the country's tourism, the Central Bank of
Egypt said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The tourist arrivals in August also set a record high by
topping the 445,000 who came in the same month of 1997, a report
issued by the bank said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.11 million tourists visited Egypt in the first
eight months of 1999, up from 2.78 million in the same period of
1997.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, Egypt's second largest source of foreign currency
after remittances from workers abroad, brought in 3.2 billion
U.S. dollars in last fiscal year ending June 30.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's foreign currency reserves stood at 17.47
billion dollars in August, the lowest level in at least three
years, the Central Bank of Egypt reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reserves fell by 111 million dollars compared with July due
to the bank's continued spending to meet demand for dollars.
</P>
<P>
They were sufficient to cover 12.4 months of imports, said the
bank.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Foreign oil companies will be invited to participate

WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said he is not "troubled" by the planned mass demonstration in
Athens, Greece, when he pays a visit there later this week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is to visit Greece between November 13 to 15. Several

<P>
"I expect the demonstrations, and I'm not troubled by them,
and I think that the security issues will be fine," Clinton told
reporters before a cabinet meeting at the White House.
</P>
<P>
Polls show that Clinton is very unpopular in Greece. More than
80 percent in a survey said they had negative opinion of Clinton.
The poll also shows that more than 90 percent of Greeks were
against the U.S.-led NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>

Most Greeks also blame the U.S. for doing nothing to stop
Turkey from invading and dividing Cyprus in 1974.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad
Bin Khalifa Al-Thani held talks with visiting Jordanian King
Abdullah in the Qatari capital of Doha on Tuesday over the the
latest developments in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Their talks also tackled other Arab and international issues of
common concern, the Kuwait News Agency reported from Doha. But it
did not go into further details.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah arrived in Qatar earlier in the day on a two-day
visit, his first to the Gulf emirate since he took the throne of
Jordan following the death of his father King Hussein last
February.
</P>
<P>
The new Jordanian monarch had visited several other Gulf
countries, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain, for talks
on bilateral ties as well as regional and world issues.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arab world was a stronghold for Jordanian labor and a
major donor to the resource-hungry Middle East kingdom before the
1991 Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, while feeling the economic stretches themselves which
resulted from the sharp decreasing of oil revenues, the oil-rich
Gulf states appear to be unable to make such generous donations to
Amman as they did before.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arab states, which are pushing ahead with their
schemes of manpower localization, are not poised to accept the
Jordanian workers in large numbers either.

<HEADLINE> Coordination Is "Decisive" for Success in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Coordination of efforts on the
ground is "one of the most decisive" elements for success in
international reconstruction, a senior U.N. official said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tom Koenigs, the U.N. deputy special representative for
Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), said "This
means the coordination of the military, the U.N. agencies and
the NGOs (the non-governmental organizations)."
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in an address to the media in New York on
"Lessons of Kosovo for East Timor."
</P>
<P>
Coordination, which is important for East Timor too, is basic
because it will not only be the U.N. undertaking reconstruction on
the ground but also several agencies including the
non-governmental organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Koenigs said it was found useful in Kosovo to have a meeting
every week with all the players at the local, municipal and
regional levels to ensure coordination of efforts.
</P>
<P>
Another Kosovo experience, useful for East Timor, is that it is
important to focus on the municipal level of government so as not
to "create or tolerate a power and administrative vacuum at the
local level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under a Security Council resolution adopted on June 10, UNMIK,
composed of four pillars including the European Union and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and the
international peacekeepers arrived in Kosovo to begin the post-war
reconstruction process.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Members of the U.N.
Security Council on Monday evening expressed dismay at recent
clashes in Sierra Leone and urged the parties to abide by the Lome
Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the Council president for the month of
November, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, said the members expressed
concern at recent serious violations of the Agreement, which had
resulted in the deterioration of the security situation in the
country, and urged the parties to solve their differences by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Council members also noted reports of the failure of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and Civil Defense Force fighters
to enter the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR)
process last week "despite the fact that the DDR camps in Phase
One have now opened," Turk said.
</P>
<P>
Members also emphasized the obligation of the parties
concerned, in particular RUF leader Foday Sankoh, to meet their
obligations of the Lome Agreement in full, Turk said. They called
on Sankoh to implement all the provisions of the Agreement for
which he is responsible and especially to ensure the participation
of the RUF in the DDR program.
</P>
<P>
Turk said Council members also expressed concern at the fate of
refugees and internally displaced persons and underlined the need
for humanitarian aid and rehabilitation assistance.
</P>
<P>
Council members also underlined the importance of the speedy
and effective deployment of the United Nations Mission in Sierra
Leone (UNAMSIL) to the successful implementation of the Lome
Agreement, and urged those countries in a position to do so to
facilitate this through the provision of logistical and other
specialist support, Turk said.

cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, who is on a tour of fellow ASEAN countries, arrived here
for a one-day unofficial visit to Vietnam.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Air Canada Moves to Take Over Canadian Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- After twists and turns, Canada's
top two airlines have returned to their old track of last winter,
when No 1 Air Canada approached the No 2, Canadian Airlines
International, for talks of merger.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada intends to move quickly and, perhaps in a week or
weeks, to buy Canadian Airlines and nurse the financially crippled
carrier back to health, Air Canada President Rober Milton
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Transport Minister David Collente has also expected
Air Canada to proceed with its merger plan.
</P>
<P>
The country's No 1 airline suddenly saw its way cleared last
Friday, when its formidable arch-rival dropped a bid of 21 billion
Canadian dollars (about 14.3 billion U.S. dollars) from the race.
</P>
<P>
Onex Corp. announced withdrawal after a Quebec court ruled that
the Toronto based buyout specialist violate the legal restriction
on individual ownership of 10 percent of Air Canada.
</P>
<P>
With Onex's dropout, Air Canada is left the only bid on the
table out of an escalating merger war. But it is facing an even
more complicated challenge of negotiating a buyout of 25 percent
of Canadian from the Texas-based American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
American is part of AMR Corp's Oneworld alliance, which also
includes British Airways. The alliance was backing its partner
Onex in a plan to buy Canada's largest two carriers and merge them
into one between late August and early November.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada, whose Star Alliance ally United Airlines has a
heated rivalry with American, is offering nearly 1 billion
Canadian dollars (about 680 million U.S. dollars) to pry Canadian
away.
</P>
<P>
When the discussions started, the two airlines could likely
discuss everything from American's Sabre reservation system, a
possible partnership in Canadian, to the fees American gets from
Canadian's membership in the Oneworld alliance.
</P>
<P>
AMR's agreement with Canadian also allows it to veto any change
in ownership.
</P>
<P>
The bargain is, therefore, between the world's two leading air
industry alliances, rather than between the country's top two
airlines.
</P>
<P>
With a paltry 88 million Canadian dollars in cash at the end of
its last quarter, Canadian Airlines has repeatedly warned that it
can survive only a few more months without support.
</P>
<P>
But still, Canadian doesn't hold Air Canada's offer as the only
option left. The debt-laden carrier insisted after a board meeting
Monday that it and American Airlines "continue to aggressivly seek
out any and all options."
</P>
<P>
Air Canada has yet to hear back from American after sending a
letter in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
Under Air Canada's plan, Canadian would be operated as a
separate brand. Air Canada would also restructure Canadian's debt
of 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 680 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
President Milton of the airline Monday promised to make
Canadian a partner in its Star alliance of international airlines,
and with Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to speed up the process, saying Canadian's
debt situation "will deteriorate rapidly as we go into these
winter months."
</P>
<P>
He also expected to mail Air Canada's bid of 2 dollars (about
1.36 U.S. dollars) a share to Canadian shareholder next week.
</P>
<P>
Shares in Canadian Monday fell 18 Canadian cents (about 0.12
U.S. dollars) by 11 percent to a new 52-week low of 1.44 dollars
(about 0.98 U.S. dollars) on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada's initial takeover talks with Canadian in January
collapsed over the pricetag of the deal, which was followed by 10
weeks of merger war between Air Canada and Onex.

ANC said in a statement that the principal challenge facing the

"The ANC is in full support of ongoing research aimed at
finding an HIV vaccine that would provide some protection against
HIV strains common in our region," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> China On State Sovereignty and Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Maintenance of state
sovereignty and protection of human rights are not mutually
exclusive, China stressed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the U.N., Shen
Guofang, made the remarks at the Third Committee (Social,
humanitarian and Cultural) of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang said the purposes and principles of the Charter of
the United Nations have rendered them equally status, namely, the
human rights need to be promoted and protected, but at the same
time, state sovereignty must be respected.
</P>
<P>
Respect for state sovereignty is the prerequisite for the
existence and development of human rights, and human rights in
reality are not an abstract concept which relies on the society
for necessary conditions for its enjoyment and on the power of the
state for protection, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
There is no human rights to talk about for a country that has
lost its sovereignty, and when a country is conquered, the home
of its people will inevitably be ruined, Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that countries and people who suffered under
foreign aggression during the two World Wars and those who lost
their state sovereignty and home at disintegration of their
country must have an acute feeling about this," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"Ant act of interfering in other country's internal affairs
by using or threatening to use force in order to change that
country's social system or value, be it under the name of
protecting human rights or stopping humanitarian crisis, are
grave violations of the purposes and principles of the U.N.
Charter and basic norms of international law," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The consequence of such act is inevitably blatant violation
of the most fundamental human rights, such as the right to life
and the right to existence, Shen added.

JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel has barred a
Palestinian writer from leaving the West Bank for Denmark to
attend an international conference on political prisoners in
Israel and Palestine, said a local human rights group on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has rejected, for security reasons, Ahmad Qatamesh's
application to leave the West Bank for Denmark to attend the
meeting which will focus on the issue of political prisoners in
Israel and Palestine, said B'TSELEM, the Israeli Information
Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories.
</P>
<P>
Qatamesh was invited to speak at the conference, which will be
held in the Danish parliament on Saturday, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's refusal to allow Qatamesh to leave the West Bank
without explanation and without a right of appeal violate his
right to free movement and contravene international law," it
added.
</P>
<P>
B'TSELEM called on the Israeli authorities to change their mind
and allow Qatamesh to leave the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Qatamesh, 47, a resident of the West Bank city of Ramallah, had
been held in Israel under administrative detention for five years
without any charge. He was released in April 1998.

<P>
BUCHAREST, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan government led by
Prime Minister Ion Sturza resigned on Monday after it had lost a
confidence vote in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is the second government crisis in less than a year in the
former Soviet republic of the 4.3 million people, which lies
between Romania and Ukraine. Sturza took office after Ion Ciubuc
resigned in February over divisions in his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Sturza last Thursday threatened to quit if parliament failed to
pass privatization laws and changes to the 1999 budget as
requested by the International Monetary Fund. But the Parliament
on Friday rejected again privatization plans for the key tobacco
and wine-making sectors as well as voted against amendments to the
1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has since announced an indefinite freeze on its loan
program. Moldova had expected to receive a 35-million-U.S. dollars
loan tranche from the IMF by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The President of the country Petru Lucinschi, who is in favor
of resignation, told the press that he will soon begin
consultations with the parliamentary groups to highlight a
candidate for the office of prime minister. The prerogative to
move a candidature for this post belongs to the head of the state,
as it is stipulated in the constitution.

<HEADLINE> EU Executive Calls for Agreement on Aid for Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- European Commissioner for
Budget Michaele Schreyer has called on the European Union (EU)
Council of ministers and the European Parliament to find a rapid
agreement on the financing of the 500 million euros (520 million
U.S. dollars) for the reconstruction in Kosovo, the European
Commission said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 500 million euros which the Commission proposed for the
reconstruction in Kosovo next year are necessary in order to
fulfil the most urgent demand, Mrs. Schreyer said, adding "the
need is especially high in the year 2000".
</P>
<P>
She said the EU executive's proposal is backed by the recent
report "Towards stability and prosperity - a program for
reconstruction and recovery in Kosovo", jointly prepared by
European Commission and World Bank staff.
</P>
<P>
The report estimates external financing requirements until
December 2000 at 1.1 billion U.S. dollar with housing, energy and
private sector development as being priority areas.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council, the EU's decision-making body, wants to finance
the funding of the reconstruction in Kosovo next year by an
across-the-board cut in external policy programs. Meanwhile, the
parliament has rejected this approach in its first reading of the
2000 budget, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The commission then proposed to finance the funding by
redeployment, use of the flexibility reserve and a revision of the
financial perspective in 2000. The report estimates the
requirements for all donor financial assistance for the year 2000
at 1.1 billion U.S. dollars and in total until 2003 at 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- In the reform process of
the United Nations, reform of the human rights mechanism of the U.N.
is also a pressing task, China stressed here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations,
Shen Guofang, made the statement at the Third Committee (Social,
Humanitarian and Cultural) of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Shen said the reform should be aimed at the goals
such as to reduce confrontation and enhance cooperation, correct the
severe imbalance between the two types of rights and give due
priority to the economic social and cultural rights and the right
to development, improve the efficiency of the Human Rights
Commission and make its work genuinely conducive to the promotion
and protection of human rights worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Shen called on countries and personages concerned to go along
with the historical trend, discard their Cold-War mentality and
confrontation behavior, abandon the so-called "value superiority"
and enter into human rights dialogue on the basis of equality,
mutual respect and seeking common ground while shelving
differences, so as to enhance understanding, narrow differences and
promote cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We must strive to make dialogue, cooperation and equal
treatment to all types of rights the main stream of human rights
activities around the world in the 21st century, with a view to
guaranteeing faithful implementation of the tasks entrusted by the
Charter of the United Nations, promoting and protecting in a
genuine and effective manner the universally-recognized human
rights and realizing common prosperity of mankind," he added.

their attacks on rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
Tuesday as Prime Minister Vladimir Putin defended the actions amid
Western pressure to ease the military campaign.
</P>
<P>
Despite poor weather, federal airplanes flew some 20 sorties of
bombing and reconnaissance missions Tuesday, the Interfax news
agency reported, citing the Air Force Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"Today, airstrikes are delivered to militant positions in
southern districts and to bandits' facilities in Grozny
outskirts," the Air force said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ground troops continued to expand the security zone
and strengthen their position in Chechnya, the Defense Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia launched the military campaign against rebels inside
Chechnya in late September, following rebel incursions into
neighboring Daghestan and a spate of apartment block explosions
that killed more than 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian
cities.
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities have accused Chechen warlords Shamil
Basayev and Khattab, a Jordanian native known only by his last
name, of masterminding the terrorist blasts.
</P>
<P>
In response to Western criticism of the military actions in
Chechnya, Prime Minister Putin said the operations in the North
Caucasus are commensurate with the threat Moscow faces.
</P>
<P>
"You realize the threat best when you face actual result,"
Putin said after a Tuesday meeting at the Interior Ministry with
the families of police officers killed in the line of duty,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces are not dealing with some scattered
criminals in the North Caucasus, they are actually "dealing with
well-organized gangs of international terrorists," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1,500 civilians in large cities alone had fallen
victim to the actions of Chechen terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus "is the only
possible way to destroy the terrorists at their bases," Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
Most Russians support the current federal campaign in Chechnya,
especially after the series of terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist Party, urged
the federal authorities to follow military leaders' advice on
Chechnya. The Russian military are believed to be pursuing a tough
line in order to shake off the shame caused by the defeat in the
previous Chechen war in 1994-1996.
</P>
<P>
"Bandits and terrorists must be done away with or they will
completely destroy the country," Zyuganov said, brushing away
Western pressure as "interfering in Russia's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
However, liberal Yabloko movement leader Grigory Yavlinsky on
Tuesday urged the authorities to halt the the massive bombing of
Chechnya, and put the large-scale ground operations there on hold
while beginning talks with Aslan Maskhadov as the lawfully elected
Chechen president, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Yavlinsky said in a statement that the Russian armed forces in
August-November fulfilled their tasks in the North Caucasus and
for the first time in five years created compelling prerequisites
for conducting a political process.
</P>
<P>
He said talks should be held on the following terms: the
liberation of all hostages, an end to the kidnapping and slave
trade, the handover of internationally sought terrorists to the
Russian authorities for trial, and resolute steps toward the
disarming of all non-governmental formations under arms.
</P>
<P>
If Maskhadov refuses to negotiate under these conditions, a
30-day grace period for refugees to leave Chechnya should be
given, after which "the above-mentioned tasks will be carried out
by the federal forces independently," Yavlinsky said.

<HEADLINE> Belarussian PM Urges "Changes in Every Field" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian Prime Minister
Sergei Ling on Tuesday called for both economic and political
changes in order to woo foreign investment in the former Soviet
republic.
</P>
<P>
"If we want to hit Europe's economic roads, we must meet
certain international standards," the Interfax news agency quoted
Ling as saying at cabinet meeting on the 2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
These standards include development of small businesses,
economic reforms, and a constructive political opposition with
access to mass media, Ling said.
</P>
<P>
"What political figures think of Belarus dictates the amount of
foreign investments. Investors will not come until they trust us.
This is why we should have a realistic view of the situation and
carry out changes in every field," he said.
</P>
<P>
The talks with the International Monetary Fund will not succeed
until the fund's managers see that changes are implemented in
fields other than economic, Ling said. "Private investors will not
come before the IMF gives its go-ahead," he said.

<P>
DHAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
Tuesday urged the opposition to shun the path of confrontation and
conflict and "come to discussion table for resolving any issue."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to sit anywhere, anytime and over any issue to
resolve everything amicably through discussion," she said while
making her valedictory speech at the 15th session of the present
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the on-going agitation programs of the opposition,
Hasina said the opposition has no right to impose hartal (strike)
on the people by creating an artificial situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day countrywide hartal which ended Tuesday,
three people were killed and hundreds were injured in clashes
between the hartal supporters and police.
</P>
<P>
The hartal was enforced by the opposition alliance to press
their demand for the resignation of the government.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Offensive Against Organized Crime, Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin on Tuesday urged the country's law enforcement agencies to
launch an offensive against organized crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
He said such an offensive should be as resolute as the military
campaign against rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of senior Interior Ministry officials, Putin said
the state has not yet given a resolute response to the challenge
of the organized criminals and "is only engaged in defensive
operations."
</P>
<P>
"The time has come to assume an offensive," he said. "The
people are waiting for the most resolute and rigorous actions. We
must preserve the population's trust in the state."
</P>
<P>
Putin said that organized criminal groupings have projected
their influence not only to individual enterprises, but also to
entire economic branches across the country, damaging the Russian
economy, undermining Russia's international prestige and hampering
Moscow's efforts to get foreign loans and investments.
</P>
<P>
If no resolute measures are taken now to improve the situation,
Putin warned, Russia will have a market economy governed by
criminals.
</P>
<P>
He called for stronger state regulation in the economic sector
to cope with the situation.
</P>
<P>
Putin listed three tasks for the Interior Ministry and other
law-enforcement agencies -- to reduce the so-called shadow sector,
to prevent capital flight and to bar criminals from infiltrating
power structures.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the country's shadow economy now
accounts for 40 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and
that 1.5 billion to 2 billion U.S. dollars left the country every
month.

<HEADLINE> Chinese-American Painter Opens Exhibition in New York  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Wearing three flowers in hair
and a jade ring around wrist, a Chinese lady is playing pipa, a
traditional Chinese plucked string instrument, beside a quiet
pond teeming with Lotus flowers.
</P>
<P>
A fisherwoman mother is helping his son walk in shallow waters
from the fish boat to the shore in South China. A pavilion in
Suzhou Garden is greeting its reflection in the tranquil pond.
</P>
<P>
These are the scenes from the painting exhibition, which opened
at the well-known Hammer Galliers here on Monday night. With the
theme "A Breeze from China," the painter, Chen Yiming, offers New
Yorkers a pleasant and quiet world in the city with so many
skyscrapers and so heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
Here and there, some 40 paintings are all mirroring Chinese
culture, which, to a large extent, remains mysterious to American
viewers.
</P>
<P>
"As modern technology -- e-mail, fax, the global internet --
draws the world closer together, it creates a more dehumanized
environment, replacing, in many instances, actual human
interaction," said Ronald Pisano, a famous American scholar.
</P>
<P>
"Communication may be improved (certainly with regard to
speed and efficiency), but emotional content -- the inflection
of one's voice, the expression on one's face -- are sacrificed
in the process," Pisano said.
</P>
<P>
Although not intended as a social commentary, the delicate
figure paintings of Chen Yiming express this alienation. His art,
which he clearly maintains is not intended to be narrative or
symbolic, does invite interpretation and, most definitely, elicits
an emotional response from the viewer.
</P>
<P>
His masterful technique is used to entice the viewer to take
part in an emotional experience, rather than entertain or create a
specific story of some sort.
</P>
<P>
"I want to give the viewer space to communicate with the
painting -- to promote a personal exchange," Chen told Xinhua.
"Each person will bring something different to the experience."
</P>
<P>
"Painting figures is the most difficult job," he said. "Just
like you are setting your foot into a mine field, one careless
step will lead you to nowhere."
</P>
<P>
"I have been working very hard to portray the inner world of
the people in my paintings, trying to bring an unfinished story to
my viewers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although his paintings are generally large in scale and
conception, the mood Chen creates is very personal. And, though
the emotions he deals with are universal, they are at the same
time limited in range -- serenity, introspection, nostalgia,
reverie, or even sadness -- and the time frame, a mere interlude,
is restricted as well.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing, the Chinese ambassador to the United States,
told Xinhua, "I love these paintings, because they are telling
Chinese stories."
</P>
<P>
"I am proud of Chen because he was nurtured by New China," Li
said. "This exhibition is very helpful in promoting the Sino-U.S.
cultural and art exchange."
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, was also
present at the opening ceremony. He voiced his appreciation of the
paintings and said that he would find some more time to view the
paintings a couple of days later.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1951 in Shanghai, east China, Chen has been working as
both a peasant and a worker when he was young. After his training
program at the Shanghai School of Fine Art, he enrolled himself
into the Department of Oil Painting, Shanghai Drama College in
1979.
</P>
<P>
Chen was a teacher of fine art at Shanghai Light Industry
College from 1979 to 1981, when he came to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, he made a successful debut with his paintings
exhibition at the New York-based International Gallery. Since
then, he gave a series of art displays in Shanghai, Paris,
Singapore, Canada and some other Asian countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> France Criticizes Russian Military Operation in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- France criticized on Tuesday
Russia's on-going military operation in Chechnya, and warned
Moscow of great pressure at the summit of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to be held in Istanbul
this month.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said at the French
National Assembly that Russia has got "astray"in the Chechen war
and he called on Russia to solve the conflict on a political
basis.
</P>
<P>
"We think that Russia has got astray in this adventure of the
North Caucasus and that, in one way or another, it should
recognize there is a problem which goes far beyond the question of
terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This Chechen problem should be approached on a political
basis... We are going to say it at the summit of the OSCE in
Istanbul in a clear way and we will prepare for a pressure of all
the countries which want another solution of another nature be
found in Chechnya," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "foreign minister" of the "government" of
Chechnya, Ilias Akhmadov, is in Paris since Monday to talk with
French Foreign Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly invited by the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe,
Akhmadov arrived in France from the Netherlands because the French
government has refused to issue a visa to him.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Speaker Opposes Turkey's EU Status Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's possible acceptance
as a candidate for European Union (EU) membership may make a
settlement to the Cyprus issue more difficult, Cypriot Parliament
Speaker Spyros Kyprianou said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides, Kyprianou said
the Turkish side has not shown any sign it is ready to make a move
on Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He warned against the prospect of disengaging Turkey's course
to Europe from progress towards a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots walked out of the peace talks with the
Greek Cypriots in 1997 to protest against a EU decision to remove
Turkey from the candidates for immediate EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago in Luxembourg, the EU said it can not open
accession talks with Turkey unless Ankara improves its human
rights record, supports a settlement in Cyprus and improves

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Policy On Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Tuesday that it has adopted a policy document about "new
challenges of climate change" in a bid to enhance economic and
development cooperation in the 15-nation European Union (EU) and
to help developing countries deal with the greenhouse gas
emissions.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive arm said the policy document reflects the
importance it attaches to the issue of climate change and which
serves as an initial response to an important ongoing public
debate.
</P>
<P>
The document also addresses challenges and options concerning
climate change and the EU economic and development cooperation,
the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
"Many developing countries contribute little to climate change,
but are nevertheless vulnerable to its effects and have little
resources for adaptation," the EU executive said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The greenhouse gas emissions of developing countries, in
particular the emerging economies, are forecast to increase
rapidly and eventually to surpass developed countries' emissions,"
it stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore crucial, the Commission said, to involve
developing countries in the global efforts to slow down climate
change.
</P>
<P>
The European Union also noted that developing countries differ
significantly in terms of their development status, contribution
to climate change and their vulnerability to its effects.
</P>
<P>
Mainstreaming of climate change considerations into EU
cooperation policies has to be done with a view to ensuring that
it dose not divert the focus from sustainable development
priorities of the developing country partners, the EU policy
document said.

ANKARA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will provide medical
assistance to neighboring Iraq under an agreement signed here on
Tuesday in Ankara, the semi-official Anatolia news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Turkish Health Minister Osman
Durmus and his Iraqi counterpart Umid Medhat Mubarak, who arrived
here on Monday to discuss the terms of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Mubarak said that though Iraq is
allowed to purchase a certain amount of medical supplies under the
oil-for-food deal, the supplies are far from being sufficient
compared with the needs of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak stressed that the amount of medicine Iraq is permitted
to purchase is only 20 percent of the country's total needs. The
agreement with Turkey will enable Iraq to obtain more medicine,
he added.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Durmus made assurances that they would
provide assistance to Iraq in the form of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
"I deem it necessary because disease in a neighboring country
will inevitably affect my country...and because Iraq and Turkey
are two countries with historical ties," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Tuesday urged the Commonwealth government and business
leaders to find practical ways to close the wealth gap between
developing countries and their richer counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said greater efforts should be made by developed
countries to help the world's poorest nations eliminate poverty.
</P>
<P>
The forum and the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting,
which start Friday in Durban, must prioritise poverty relief and
development, especially as they were bell
focus on various topics relating to investment, trade and the
private sector and hand its conclusions to the heads of government
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In order to eliminate poverty, political and business leaders
from the 54 Commonwealth states must cooperate to address the
international debt burden and establish a more equitable global
trading system, Mbeki said, adding that foreign investment to
Africa should also be increased.
</P>
<P>
"It cannot be beyond our human capabilities to find practical
ways... to build a world economy that results in an end to poverty
and the reduction of the disparity between the rich and the poor,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our practical actions will answer the question whether we have
the will, the courage and the sense of human solidarity in fact to
end the human tragedy to which billions are condemned," Mbeki
said.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders must "banish tyranny, war and corruption from
our countries and this continent."

"We have to create conditions, policies and programs conducive
to investment, growth and job creation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: IMF Chief to Step Down Early Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus, who guided the
agency through the turbulence of the Asian currency crisis, will
step down early next year, local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press quoted an IMF official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, as saying that Camdessus hopes to be able
to leave the agency by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus' early departure from the job of managing director,
which he has held longer than any other official in the history of
the 185-nation lending agency, had been rumored for some time.
</P>
<P>
A former head of the Bank of France, Camdessus, 66, began his
first term as IMF managing director in January 1987. He was
reappointed to a second term in 1996 and to an unprecedented third
five-year term in January 1997. That term would have not have
ended until 2002.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, on Capitol Hill for a
hearing on Social Security, praised Camdessus for the job he had
done during a turbulent time in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"Michel Camdessus has done an outstanding job as the IMF's
longest-serving managing director," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
By tradition, the IMF has been headed by a European while its
sister lending agency, the World Bank, is headed by an American.
</P>
<P>
Among names that have been mentioned as possible successors to
Camdessus are the current head of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude
Trichet; Italian Treasury Director General Mario Draghi; Andrew
Crockett of Britain, who is head of the Bank of International
Settlements in Switzerland; Mervyn King, deputy governor of the
Bank of England; and Horst Koehler, head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliament Urges U.N. to Lift Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi National Assembly
(parliament) on Wednesday demanded that the U.N. Security Council
lift the embargo on Iraq, abrogate the so-called no-fly zones in
the country and stop the U.S.-British military aggression against
it.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the Iraqi parliament
stressed that the Iraqi MPs fully reject the British-Dutch draft
proposal currently under discussion at the Security Council, and
that there is no alternative to the total lifting of the
embargo imposed on Iraq nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
The British-Dutch proposal recommends a conditional suspension
of sanctions on Iraq after Baghdad allows an enlarged weapons
inspection body to return and puts its oil revenues under the
U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi parliament condemned the stand of some Arab
governments for their public or secret support for the
continuation of the embargo and the political and financial aid to
the U.S.-British aggression against Iraq, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British warplanes taking off from Kuwaiti, Saudi
and Turkish air bases have been regularly attacking Iraqi
civilian and military targets in the two no-fly zones in northern
and southern Iraq since last December's airstrikes against the
country.
</P>
<P>
The statement called upon Arab MPs to implement the
resolutions of Arab Parliamentary Union conference held in Amman,
Jordan last December in the wake of U.S.-British four-night
bombardment of Iraq which urged Arab governments to work for
lifting sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It lauded the humanitarian mission made by British MP
George Galloway and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
After a two-month intercontinental trip to drum up support for
lifting sanctions on Iraq, Galloway's red London double-decker
arrived in Bagdhad last Saturday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Arab Councils Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Municipal services in all Arab
towns and villages throughout Israel are closed Wednesday as part of
a one-day warning strike by Arab Councils to press the government to
budget more funds to them.
</P>
<P>
Council leaders said Wednesday that the Councils and other local
Arab authorities are all facing financial problems due to the
government's low allocation of funds to them during the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
They warned that further measures are planned, including a mass
demonstration in Jerusalem on Sunday, to coincide with the weekly
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
They also intended to shut down their Councils for an indefinite
period and begin a sit-in at a protest tent outside the Prime
Minister's office beginning the same day.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Zeidan, Chairman of the Forum of Arab Councl Heads,
noted that 54 local Arab Councils had accumulated deficits
totalling about 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Many Councils had been unable to pay the wages of municipal
employees for periods ranging from one to six months and others are
nearing the point of bankruptcy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zeidan also blamed Barak and the government for neglecting the
problems of the Arab sector.
</P>
<P>
"Barak has made many promises prior to the elections regarding
his intention to improve the situation in the Arab sector in
general, but nothing of this is reflected in the budget for next
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have been pressing for weeks for a meeting with Barak in order
to discuss with him the problems and ways of solving them, but we
have not even received a response to our repeated requests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Arabs compose nearly 20 percent of the total Israeli
population. Most of them are living in northern part of Israel and
some in the south.

<HEADLINE> China to Help Push Peace Process: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen reiterated here today that China will work together with
the international community to push for an early settlement of the
Mideast issue.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Mahmoud Abbas, secretary-general of the Executive
Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Qian
expressed China's deep concern over the Mideast peace process,
which, he said, has shown positive signs recently.
</P>
<P>
Qian offered congratulations for the hard-won agreement between
Palestine and Israel on September 5 on implementing the Wye
accords by conducting talks on Palestine's final status.
Reconciliation between Arabs and Jews and the long-term stability
of the region can only be achieved through peaceful negotiations,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The present moment is a good opportunity for the settlement of
the issue, although there's still a long way to go and much to be
done, Qian said. Citing an old Chinese saying "Do not impose on
others what you yourself do not desire," Qian said China has
always tried to persuade both parties to understand each other,
and proceed with the peace process through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said China highly appreciates the flexible and practical
attitude toward the peace talks shown by the Palestinian National
Authority and its efforts to strengthen domestic unity. China was
among the first to recognize the PLO and the State of Palestine,
and it is an established policy of the Chinese government to
actively develop relations with Palestine, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Abbas discussed in detail the progress of the peace process
since the Madrid peace conference, noting that although the way
was arduous, progress has been made through these talks.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that as long as the two sides show
sincerity and continue talks based on UN Security Council
resolutions No. 242 and No. 338, a final solution will be found.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Palestine will adhere to its strategy of
seeking a solution through peace talks, expressing the hope that
China and other countries will make efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Palestine greatly treasures its relations with China, and is
grateful for China's long-term support of its just cause, Abbas
said. He congratulated the country on the impending return of
Macao, and wished for an earlier solution of the Taiwan issue,
stressing that Palestine steadfastly supports China's
reunification.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Minister resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Minister in charge of
the National Development Planning Commission, Kojo Yankah,
Wednesday announced his resignation from President Jerry Rawlings'
Administration, citing personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the President, Yankah, who had served
in the government for nearly seven years, said he will continue to
serve in his capacity as a Member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Yankah was last week moved to the Office of the National
Development Planning Commission (NDPC) from the post of Regional
Minister for Ashanti.
</P>
<P>
The change drew mixed feelings among Ghanaians, including some
members of government who felt it was a demotion for a
"hardworking minister", according to a press report from the Ghana
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Yankah, won a Parliamentary seat in 1993 on the ticket of the
ruling National Democratic Congress from where he won the favor
of President Rawlings one year after when he earned his first
appointment as a deputy minister for the then Ministry of
Information.
</P>
<P>
Two years later, he was reassigned Minister for the Central
Region and again Ashanti Regional Minister.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Newly Listed Bank Stirs Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Pudong
Development Bank (Pufa Bank) caused a stir today when it was
listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Investors flocked to the new issue, Pufa Bank shares, which are
expected to become a market leader on the Shanghai exchange.
</P>
<P>
Pufa opened at 29.5 yuan, climbed as high as 29.8 yuan, and
closed at 27.75 yuan, 2.7 times the issuing price.
</P>
<P>
A total of 174 million Pufa Bank shares were traded at a value
at 4.86 billion yuan, more than 60 percent of the day's trading on
the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Some local analysts call this a breakthrough for the country's
financial and securities sectors. Currently, Pufa Bank shares are
the largest issue in China, with capital of 2.41 billion yuan, 1.6
times larger than the Shenfazhan (Shenzhen Development Bank) stock,
the largest issue on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and previously
the largest for both exchanges in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the issuance of Pufa Bank shares will boost
the image of the country's listed banking companies as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Shenfazhan and Pufa, other financial firms which
have gone public include Aijian Stock, Anshan Trust, Hongyuan
Trust, and Shaan Guotou.
</P>
<P>
Local financiers have shown great interest in Pufa Bank shares.
An official with a Shanghai-based commercial bank said, on
condition of anonymity, this action means that other Chinese banks
may follow the example of Pufa's raising funds from the public.
</P>
<P>
The bank official predicted that more commercial banks in China
will sell shares in the future, and that the country's ongoing
financial reform will force the local financial industry to ride
on the international track.
</P>
<P>
A bank official from Pufa said raising funds from the market
will greatly contribute to the improvement of the bank's
management and its capability to counter market risks.
</P>
<P>
Pufa, which was founded in 1993, is headquartered in the Pudong
New Area, a reform pioneer zone in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of this June, the bank had 73.1 billion yuan in
deposits, 49.4 billion yuan of outstanding loans, 87.2 billion
yuan in capital including net capital of 3.84 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the bank generated 4.79 billion yuan in sales and
earned 1.16 billion yuan in net profits. Its economic performance
ranked first among all nine stock-holding commercial banks in the
mainland of China, while its outstanding deposits in foreign
currencies ranked third.

<HEADLINE> China's Banking Sector Prepares for Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China's banking sector is
basically ready to ensure financial security if the millennium bug
strikes when the year 2000 arrives.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, made
this announcement today at a symposium on year 2000 computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
This problem, also known as Y2K or the millennium bug, derives
from the way that early computer programmers used only the last
two digits of the four-digit year number in an effort to save
memory. Because of this, computers may take the year 2000 as the
year 1900, and havoc could result.
</P>
<P>
All the banks in China, including commercial banks, policy
banks, and the central bank, have reported success in the past
three nationwide validation tests aimed at preventing possible
disruptions caused by the millennium bug, and emergency plans have
also been mapped out.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of ten billion yuan has been invested in
efforts to address the Y2K problem.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Malaysia Goes for Early General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad announced Wednesday the dissolution of Parliament
effective Thursday to pave the way for a new general election.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir hoped that the next general election would be held
before December 9 when Muslims start observing Ramadan (the
fasting month) although he said it was upto the Election
Commission to decide the dates for nomination and polling.
</P>
<P>
The present 9th parliament, which had its first session in June
1995 after the general election held in April that year, was due
to complete its term in next June and in the parliament,
Mahathir-led coalition Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front)
enjoyed a comfortable overwhelming majority of four fifths seats
of the total 1992, why did the prime minister decide to dissolve
it to go to new polls?
</P>
<P>
Analysts say, firstly, Mahathir's decision was prompted by the
fact that the economy is on the upswing thanks largely to the
recovery efforts made by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government projected a 4.3 percent gross domestic product
growth for this year after last year's 7.5 percent contraction.
The quick economic recovery is a strong point for the 14-party BN
government to seek the voters' new mandate.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, effects of the events related to former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim are weakening after he was sentenced to a
six-year imprisonment on conviction of corrupt practices, one of
five sodomy charges against him now on trial was established and
after his other misdeeds such as his secret "political money" in
banks were exposed recently.
</P>
<P>
And thirdly, they believe, Mahathir's decision to go to new
polls might be that the ruling coalition wanted to avoid the
650,000 new voters who were registered in May this year but could
only be added to the electorate list by January next year because
most of the new voters are youths and the opposition claimed they
would win the support of most new voters.
</P>
<P>
When the next general election is held this year, the ruling
coalition could reduce the pressure to some extent put on it by
the major opposition parties which already came into an alliance
known as "Alternative Front" to challenge the ruling BN in the
coming general election.
</P>
<P>
Though the ruling BN faces challenges in the next general
election, the analysts generally believe the president political
and economic environments are in favor of the ruling BN which will
come out with a win in the election to form a new government but
whether it can win an overwhelming two thirds majority out of the
193 seats at stake in the new election is a question mark.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Braces for Post-Israeli Pullout Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is forging contingency
plan to thwart possible attempts by the Palestinians to
destabilize the country in the event of a unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"There is a group in the (Palestinian) refugee camps in south
Lebanon that could stir up trouble if the Israelis pull out," the
Daily Star on Wednesday quoted Interior Minister Michel Murr as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters Tuesday after chairing a meeting
of the Central Council attended by the commanders of security
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has set next July 7 as the
deadline for an Israeli troop withdrawal from south Lebanon where
the Jewish state set up a self-styled security zone in 1985.
</P>
<P>
"When they train 400 members, surely not to liberate Palestine,
we'd like to know the reason behind their actions," Murr said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to reports that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction is training and arming Palestinians in
four refugee camps in Lebanon it controls.
</P>
<P>
"We'll put together a plan to confront any situation that might
arise in the south," Murr said, adding that he had asked the
commanders to submit him a plan within a week.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's generally strained relationship with Arafat plummeted
to new depths late last month when a military court handed down a
death sentence against Brigadier Sultan Abul-Ainayn, Arafat's top
commander in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Abul-Ainayn is now a fugitive in the Rashidieh refugee camp
near the country's southern-most port city of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have viewed the tension surrounding Abul-Ainayn's
sentence as part of the greater struggle over the fate of the
350,000 Palestinian refugees now living in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Beirut fears that a permanent settlement of the refugees here
would destroy the country's delicate sectarian balance.

<P>
Turkish Daily News:

President Bill Clinton indicated that Turkey had a significant
role in the shaping of next century.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, speaking at Georgetown University, stressed the
pivotal position that Turkey will occupy.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that Turkey was a bridge between the Muslim and
Christian cultures, Clinton said "Turkey is a country at the
crossroads of Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. The future
can be shaped for the better if Turkey can fully become a part of
Europe, as a stable, democratic, secular, Islamic nation."
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also attend the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) summit to be held in Istanbul,
Turkey, on November 17-19.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- During the monitoring conference organized before the OSCE
summit in Istanbul, human rights issues were discussed. Ulrich
Fischer, representative of the German Human Rights Helsinki
Committee, said that Turkey was part of Europe and had recorded
significant developments recently in the field.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Turkey had not attained the standard desired
as a European country. During the meeting which was closed to the
press, the human rights practices of OSCE member countries were
reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Six billion cubic meters of natural gas is coming from

<HEADLINE> Armenian Parliament Member Arrested on Charge of Murdering Ex- Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Armenian National Assembly
deputy Musheg Movsisian was arrested Wednesday during a parliament
session in Yerevan on suspicion of murdering Prime Minister
Vazgen Sarkisian and seven others.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Armenian Prosecutor-General's Office, the
parliament gave its go-ahead earlier in the day to the arrest and
initiation of criminal charges against Movsisian of complotting
the terrorist shooting in parliament on October 27.
</P>
<P>
As many as 90 of all 96 deputies consented to Movsisian's
arrest with six abstaining from voting, reported the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the assembled deputies, Armenian Prosecutor General
Agvan Ovsepian said there is ample evidence that the terrorist act
led by Nairi Unanian had been prepared and carried out with
Movsisian's involvement.
</P>
<P>
Ovsepian said that Movsisian had "held a grudge against Prime
Minister Vazgen Sarkisian for having made him withdraw his
candidacy in the 1995 parliamentary elections."
</P>
<P>
"Movsisian was convinced that the prime minister was
responsible for the serious socioeconomic situation in Armenia and
wanted to kill him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Movsisian and Unanian worked out a plan under which the
terrorist act was to be committed while the government and
parliament members gathered in the parliament building. Following
the attack, a coup was planned to be accomplished with the backing
of certain political forces, said Ovsepian.
</P>
<P>
Movsisian categorically denied all the charges against him and
demanded the parliament set up a commission to investigate into
his case.
</P>
<P>
Parliament Speaker Karen Demirchian was among the killed on
October 27, and nine parliament members and ministers were wounded.

<P>
The Athens News Agency (ANA) Wednesday quoted well-informed

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Kodak held a ceremony here
today to celebrate the completion of the first phase of its China
production base.
</P>
<P>
Located in Xiamen in south China's Fujian Province, the base
occupies 430,000 square meters and is being built at a cost of 650
million US dollars. It is Kodak's largest and most advanced base
for film and printing-paper production in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Construction began in June 1998 and is scheduled to be
completed late next year.
</P>
<P>
Now, factories at the base have begun manufacturing and
exporting film and printing paper for amateur and professional use.
According to test results provided by Kodak, the quality of 35 mm
film made in China is tops among similar Kodak products made in
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Daniel A. Carp, president and CEO of Kodak, said at today's
ceremony that he feels proud of having established a solid
groundwork in China. China has become the third-largest market
for Kodak products, and the company intends to make further
achievements in the next century, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Kodak's total investment in China now exceeds 1.2 billion US
dollars.

<HEADLINE> China, US to Strengthen Energy Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Experts from China and the
United States today gathered in Jinan, capital of east China's
Shangdong Province, for a conference on Sino-US energy partnership
programs.
</P>
<P>
The conference is aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation
on the use of energy resources, especially on environmental
protection technologies, sources attending the conference said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the two countries will discuss a new clean-coal
technology known as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)
and other technologies related to environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
This was the first such meeting to discuss the energy
partnership exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaolu, a Chinese energy expert attending the conference,
said that by the end of last year, China had generated 1.167
trillion kilowatts-hour (kwh) of electricity and developed an
installed generating capacity of 270 million kilowatts (kw) this
year, ranking second in the world in both categories.
</P>
<P>
In the future, China will pay more attention to energy quality
rather than quantity, and strengthen cooperation with U.S. and
other developed countries on the use of electricity as a way of
protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China has IGCC projects planned for Sichuan,
Shandong and other provinces.
</P>
<P>
An official with the U.S. Energy Department told Xinhua that
China is the largest potential market for environmental protection
technology, adding that the United States welcomes China's public
sector and enterprises to participate more actively in the Sino-
American energy partnership program.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Arts Festival in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 Hong Kong Arts
Festival, the first Hong Kong art festival in the new millennium,
will present to audiences an international festival of the highest
artistic standard, Chairman of the Hong Kong Arts Festival Society
Ltd. Martin Barrow said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The festival, due to start from February 11, 2000 through March
12, offers a significant larger number of seats, totaling about
112,000, and 133 performances of 36 programs, Barrow said.
</P>
<P>
A wide range of world-known Chinese and foreign music pieces,
operas, dances will be performed during the festival.
</P>
<P>
The festival will officially open with the prestigious China
National Symphony Orchestra, underscoring the festival's continued
effort to showcase top Mainland artists in the festival.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in more than 12 years, the 2000 Festival
will feature two large-scale operas -- Janacek's Jenufa and Dvorak
's Rusalka performed by the 240-member strong opera, orchestra and
chorus of the Prague National Theater.
</P>
<P>
With the aim of promoting local talent internationally and
encouraging cultural exchange, the festival is launching the first
dance showcase featuring six local dancers and dance companies
such as DanceArt Hong Kong and Three Colors, Program Director of
the festival Grace Lang said.
</P>
<P>
Together with the staging of City Contemporary Dance Company's
Plaza X by Helen Lai, Walking With Wings by Edwin Lung, the
Birmingham Royal Ballet, the Ea Sola Company and Carmen by La
Cuadra de Sevilla, the dance showcase constitutes a Dance Festival
within this year's Festival, Lang said.
</P>
<P>
The Festival will stage performances reflecting the
contemporary total art concept, blurring the boundaries between
music and theater, music and dance, and dance and theater. With
the use of live music, the audience will experience the many facet
of sight and sound in one go, according to Lang.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the 250th anniversary of great musician J.S.
Bach's death, the Festival will also present all Bach concerts,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Lang summarized the characteristic of the Millennium festival
as having more focus and more opportunities for cultural exchange,
and being more economical in its operation, with its a budget just
under 60 million HK dollars (7.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1973, the Hong Kong Arts Festival has
undergone many changes and is now famous for its wide range of
high-quality international programs. It is now the largest
festival of its kind in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: PLA Macao Garrison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) Garrison of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) has been established under Deng Xiaoping's
concept of "one country, two systems," the Constitution, the Basic
Law of the Macao SAR, and a decree of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
This is the second contingent of PLA troops that has been sent
to station in a special administrative region, following the Hong
Kong SAR Garrison troops.
</P>
<P>
Under the Garrison Law of the Macao SAR, the Macao SAR garrison
will be granted the basic responsibility for the defense of the
territory, which include four elements: to defend and resist
foreign invasion and ensure the security of the Macao SAR, conduct
routine defensive activities, manage military facilities, and deal
with foreign military affairs.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the garrison can assist the Macao SAR government
in maintaining social security when the Macao SAR government has
appealed to and won approval from the central government.
</P>
<P>
The size of the garrison has been determined in accordance with
the needs of defense and under the principle of maintaining a
capable and moderate number of troops. This number does not exceed
1,000, and most of its soldiers come from the field army.
</P>
<P>
The garrison also includes a small number of navy and air force
officers to handle affairs related to their branches of service.
</P>
<P>
The garrison is equipped with weapons necessary for use in the
Macao SAR, mainly light arms.
</P>
<P>
The troops will abide by national laws as well as the laws of
the Macao SAR. Furthermore, all garrison expenses will be borne by
the central government.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Vows to Bring Down Cost of Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- After bringing down the prices
of rice and sugar, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said
Wednesday his next target is to deflate the cost of medicine as he
underscored the need to make life-saving products accessible to
the poor.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his administration has begun to take steps to pull
down the cost of medicine even as expensive health-related
services like dialysis procedures have already been made available
to poor patients.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Estrada said he had already discussed the
problem concerning the high cost of medicine with Secretary
Alfredo Romualdez of the Department of Health (DOF) as early as
three months ago so they can undertake measures to address such
concern.
</P>
<P>
"I will do my best to lower the cost of medicine. I was able to
pull down the cost of rice and sugar. The price of medicine is my
next target," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has lowered the selling price of rice and sugar by 2
pesos (5 U.S. cents) per kilo and 3 pesos (7.5 cents) per kilo
respectively to make these basic commodities affordable to poor
consumers.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that his administration will not stop until it has
lowered the prices of medicine at levels affordable to the people,
especially the poor, even at the risk of declaring war on
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
The president has a standing order to the DOH to pinpoint the
weak link in the supply chain of drugs and medicine in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said government support can be extended in the areas of
importation and manufacturing, marketing distribution and retail
trading.
</P>
<P>
Estrada further ordered the DOH to make accessible to the
public government hospital pharmacies that shall act as retail
outlets of low-priced medicines.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, drug producers are allegedly
overpricing medicines by as much as 500 to 1,000 percent, which
are beyond the reach of the majority of Filipinos.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Cautious in Predicting Leonid Meteor Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Leonid meteor shower larger
than last year's, or even a meteor storm, may occur this month,
but may not be seen in China, said experts at the Beijing
Astronomical Observatory (BAO) today.
</P>
<P>
A meteor shower, with more than 500 shooting stars an hour, may
appear around the constellation Leo on November 17 and 18, said
Zhao Gang, deputy-director of the BAO. "But Chinese star-gazers
will probably not be able to observe this wonderful astronomical
phenomenon if it occurs at noon Beijing time."
</P>
<P>
Some astronomers predict that the peak of this year's Leonid
shower will happen at 3:00 to 4:00 am Greenwich Mean Time on
November 18, which is 11:00 to 12:00 a.m., Beijing time. They said
shower may occur earlier or later than the predicted because it
cannot be forecast as precisely as an eclipse.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers had predicted that a Leonid meteor storm would take
place in November last year, and said China would be the best
place to observe it. But instead of a "storm," star-watchers in
China only saw a "drizzle" of meteors.
</P>
<P>
"If we are lucky this year, we will be able to see more than 1,
000 shooting stars an hour in the southeast sky in Beijing in the
early hours of November 18," said Zhao Fuyuan, a research
professor with the BAO.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the BAO is not going to organize any large-scale
activities for people to watch the meteors this year so people won
't be disappointed again.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- White House officials and House GOP leaders are working on a
compromise that would place some restrictions on U.S. support for
family planning abroad to try to break a deadlock that has held up
payment of the roughly 1 billion dollars in back dues the United
States owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
-- One of the few foreign policy issues congressional
Republicans and the Clinton administration seemed to agree on--
more aid for Colombia this year--has fallen victim to budget
bickering and White House fear of overloading its foreign aid
request.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Chancellor Schroder, speaking at a ceremony commemorating
the 10th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, made very
clear which Germans deserved special praise, saying, "The wall
fell from east to west, pushed down by brave and fearless East
Germans."
</P>
<P>
-- Russia sought to isolate Chechnya by banning foreign trade
with the breakaway republic and by suspending international
flights to the region. To enforce the ban on the importation of
foreign goods to Chechnya, Russia ordered a search of all ships
entering a Caspian Sea port.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- An EgyptAir data recorder was flown to Washington after a
robot submarine recovered it off Nantucket. If damage isn't too
great, the device may yield vital clues. It is believed to be a
model that tracked more of the 767's functions than most so-called
black boxes.
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli troops moved to dismantle tha West Bank settlement
of Havat Maon, one of several the Barak government targeted as
barriers to a peace deal with the palestinians. Settlers built
obstacles before the raid, but no violence was reported.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Ban Firms' Donations to Individual Politicians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi Wednesday unveiled a plan to ban corporate donations to
individual politicians from next year as stipulated in a 1995 law.
</P>
<P>
"The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has decided to act in
accordance with the spirit of the law," Obuchi said in a Diet (
parliament) session.
</P>
<P>
The LDP and its two coalition partners, the Liberal Party (LP)
and the New Komeito party, plan to jointly submit a bill during
the current parliament session to impose the ban, Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
If submitted, the bill is certain to clear parliament since the
ruling bloc enjoys a majority in both the House of Representatives
(lower house) and the House of Councilors (upper house).
</P>
<P>
Once the ban is in place, Japanese companies and organizations
will be allowed to make donations to political parties but not
directly to individual politicians.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi's announcement reverses an earlier LDP decision to allow
the donations to continue. That decision was made as many LDP
lawmakers complained that contributions from individuals -- which
in theory should replace the corporate money -- had failed to
increase over the past five years amid the economic slump and were
not enough to finance their political activities.
</P>
<P>
The LDP's original decision, however, drew criticism from both
the opposition camp and some lawmakers within the LDP and was
unpopular with the public. The New Komeito Party was also against
allowing the donations to continue.
</P>
<P>
Under the Political Funds Control Law, which took effect in
January 1995, it was agreed that corporate donations to individual
lawmakers would be banned after a five-year ending in January 2000
in return for government subsidies to political parties.
</P>
<P>
The ban was included in the law because of strong public
criticism that such donations were feeding a series of financial
scandals involving politicians.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Asks Seoul to Borrow More Money, Continue Interest Rate Consultation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has asked South
Korea to borrow additional 300 million U.S. dollars or more so
that it could continue interest policy consultation with the
nation, said the South Korea Ministry of Finance and Economy
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government has replied that it will not
borrow any more money from the bank unless the banks sets the
interest rate low at Libor plus 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
South Korea can borrow money overseas at Libor plus 1.3
percent because of some problems such as the South Korean won's
appreciation against the U.S. dollar due to increasing inflow of
dollars, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, which originally agreed with Seoul on an
interest rate of Libor plus 0.75, is negotiating with some board
member nations which proposed that the interest rate be at Libor
plus 4 percent, mentioning the equity with other nations like
Brazil, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which planned to borrow 10 billion U.S. dollars
from the bank, borrowed 7 billion dollars by May 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is also willing to supply long-term assistance
as an institution focusing on long-term projects like social
overhead capital as the International Monetary Fund, which focuses
on short-term funds, is to continue policy consultations with
South Korea and provide financial aid until the end of next year,
added the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Folic Acid Use Proves Effective in Preventing Birth Defects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The daily consumption of folic
acid has clearly been demonstrated to significantly reduce neural
tube birth defects, a Sino-American research group announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
The research project, which encouraged child-bearing women in
China to take 400 micrograms of folic acid a day in vitamin pill
form, showed that the risk of neural tube birth defects was
reduced by as much as 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
The evaluation was conducted by the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) of the United States and China's Beijing
Medical University, and the report will be published in the
November 11 issue of New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
In China, neural tube birth defects affect between 80,000 and
100,000 pregnancies a year. The most common of these defects is
spina bifida, the leading cause of childhood paralysis. Another is
anencephaly, which affects the brain and results in miscarriage,
stillbirth, or babies who live only a few days.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that among the women who took their daily
recommended amount of folic acid before and in the first trimester
of pregnancy, the risk of giving birth to babies with a neural
tube birth defect was reduced by 85 percent in north China and 41
percent in the south China.
</P>
<P>
"A woman can greatly improve the health of her unborn child by
reducing the risk of a neural tube birth defect by simply taking
folic acid before she becomes pregnant," said the report's leading
author, R.J. Berry, who added that the formation of the spine
where this birth defect occurs is complete within the first 28
days of pregnancy -- before many women know they are pregnant.
After this time passes, it is too late to prevent the damage.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Li Zhu, who also led the research among more than 240,000
child-bearing Chinese women, said he believes China can avoid 40,
000 to 50,000 birth defects a year thanks to this finding.
</P>
<P>
"This will be of great significance in improving the overall
quality of the population, while reducing infant mortality in
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has approved production of folic acid
supplement tablets, which have benefited women in nine provinces
and autonomous regions so far.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Test Drives Natural Gas-Powered Vehicle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday test drove the first locally made vehicle
powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) at the Presidential
Palace.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said in a news release that it is
another step towards the country's less dependence on foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
Estrada lauded the officials responsible for making the
CNG-powered vehicle which, he said, proves his administration's
continuing effort to search for alternative sources of energy.
</P>
<P>
He also said the vehicle would help ease the country's
pollution problem, especially in the urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The converted utility vehicle, which originally ran on diesel
fuel, successfully demonstrated the potential of using CNG as an
alternative to petroleum in the transport sector.
</P>
<P>
"It's very nice. With its potential, CNG could help reduce the
price of gasoline by 50 percent. We wouldn't rely so much on
gasoline," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we make more of this type of vehicles so that we can
convert our passenger jeepneys, and also our buses, and it's also
pollution free," he added.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle conversion, which is part of an overall project
being conducted by the government on the use of natural gas by the
transport industry, aims to address the country's pollution
problems and probe for the possible commercialization on the use
of CNG as fuel for vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas is presently available in the country after it was
discovered in 1989 in the southern province of Palawan.

KANAZAWA, Japan, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Asian champions China
beat the United States in straight sets 29-27, 25-23, 25-18 in the
women's World Cup volleyball tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The American team gave China hard times but at the end lost
with a small margin.
</P>
<P>
China had some problems in the formation of coach Hu Jin, who
took over the national squad after star coach Lang Ping quit early
this year, since Libero Li Yan was injured in a motorbike accident
and middleblocker Zhao Ruirui got injured during training.
</P>
<P>
The United States had a big chance to beat China this time but
lack of experience was the major problem for the formation of
coach Michael Haley.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, it was hard to get our rhythm," Hu said. "
But later on, when we played more relaxed, everything was getting
better."
</P>
<P>
Haley said: "Our team fought hard but made too many errors."
</P>
<P>
China's captain Sun Yue was voted the Most Impressive player of
the match while her teammate Wu Yongmei was the best scorer with
17 points.

BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Qian Qichen met
here today with a delegation from the board of directors of the
Law Society of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
led by Anthony W.K.Chow.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said the "one country, two systems" policy has
been truly implemented in the Hong Kong SAR since the territory
returned to the motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said it was a "good phenomenon" that exchanges and
cooperation between legal specialists in Hong Kong and the
mainland have been constantly expanded over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
As Hong Kong and mainland have two different legal systems, it
is normal that some new problems have emerged in exchanges between
the two sides, Qian said, stressing that "we have a common ground,
the Basic Law."
</P>
<P>
All problems can be resolved through strengthening exchanges
between the two sides, a timely summing up of our the experiences,
and strictly abiding by the Basic Law, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Qian also noted that the lawyers' organizations in Hong Kong
and the mainland are equals, and the two sides can strengthen
their exchanges and cooperation on the basis of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived here on November 7 and will return home
today.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Congo Peace Process Hits Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Government troops of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recently launched an
offensive against the rebel forces in the country, bringing the
hard-won Lusaka cease-fire agreement to the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
The clashes between the government forces and the rebel
Movement of Liberation of Congo (MLC) led by Jean-Pierre Bemba
broke out in Bokungu, a strategic town 1,000 kilometers northeast
of DRC capital Kinshasa on November 5.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, which has reportedly caused some 100 civilian
casualties, is said to be still going on in the area.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Laurent Kabila's government of breaking the cease-fire
and killing civilians, Bemba Saturday declared null and void the
peace accord reached in Zambian capital Lusaka four months ago.
</P>
<P>
Another rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy (Goma),
also threatened that it will break the cease-fire if the
international community did not condemn what it said was the
Kinshasa's violation of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Although Ugandan State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama
Mbabazi and Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge played down
the repudiation of a cease-fire pact by Bemba by saying that the
cease-fire will hold despite violations, it is crystal clear that
this is the biggest snag the cease- fire has ever confronted.
</P>
<P>
The DRC government last Saturday ordered the United Nations
monitors out of the country after announcing that rebels from
neighboring Angola were flooding into the country.
</P>
<P>
Only last week, Kabila's government ordered Rwanda to pull out
its troops from the DRC or risk being forcefully kicked out.
</P>
<P>
DRC government's reluctance to give safety guarantee to the
U.N. cease- fire monitors to visit areas under its control added
to the difficulty of the implementation of the Lusaka peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here observed that it is a monumental blunder for
Kabila and the rebels in the DRC to deliberately torpedo the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Without a negotiated settlement to the 15-month-long conflict,
the war in the third largest African country would drag on for a
long time, economically ruining all the countries involved.
</P>
<P>
The bombings in the DRC have drawn concern from both the region
and the international community as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The countries, which used to fight either on the rebels' side
or on that of the government, have expressed concern over the
latest development of situation in the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni met his Rwandan counterpart
Pasteur Bizimungu in western Uganda Monday to mend their bruised
bilateral ties and to reaffirm their commitment to the cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Museveni traveled to Tripoli, Libya on Tuesday evening and will
 officially discuss African issues with Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi later Wednesday, according to a press release issued by
the President's Office in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Commission, formed under the Lusaka
agreement, held its first meeting here last month at which all
representatives committed themselves to the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
All the countries involved in the armed conflicts in the DRC
are now reluctant to engage themselves in the war again.
</P>
<P>
But the latest violations of the cease-fire constitute the
fresh twists and turns of the volatile peace process in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Though not being able to crush the peace process at present
stage, the violations would surely dim the glimmering hope for
peace the cease-fire had brought to the region.

<HEADLINE> Cape Town to Introduce Cash-Card Parking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
legislative capital Cape Town is to convert to cash-card parking
using prepaid cards from December 1.
</P>
<P>
Parking meters will no longer accept coins from that date, the
Cape Town City Council announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One card will cost 40 rand (6.6 U.S. dollar). Of this, 17 rand
 for the card and 23 rand is prepaid parking money. Parking will
cost two rand for 30 minutes in the Cape Town city center.
</P>
<P>
Cards can be reloaded with pre-payments at most purchasing
points.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town traffic manager Mervin Merrington said the city
council had been losing around one million rand annually through
the vandalization of coin-operated parking meters; first in loss
of parking revenue and secondly in the cost of replacing damaged
meters.
</P>
<P>
Merrington said the termination of coin-operated meters would
remove cash and temptation from the streets and put an end to an
unacceptable drain on city funds.
</P>
<P>
"The cash-card will enable motorists to park in any Cape Town
metered parking bay and the need to carry cash for parking will be
eliminated as will the need or temptation to entrust an informal
parking attendant with cash," Merrington said.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Calls for Education of Falun Gong Practitioners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The People Daily is urging the
careful education and transformation of the majority of Falun Gong
practitioners in a bid to win a complete victory in the struggle
against the cult.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary to be published tomorrow, the leading newspaper
in China says that education "is needed in the struggle, is one of
the important goals of the ongoing struggle, and is a substantial
part of the Party's mass line."
</P>
<P>
Only by insisting on educating and transforming the majority of
Falun Gong practitioners can the small number of hard-core
elements in the cult be effectively isolated and beaten, the
commentary says, adding that isolating and beating the minority is
also aimed at uniting the majority.
</P>
<P>
The commentary asks the public to differentiate between the
various people involved in Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
Those who practiced Falun Gong in order to keep fit, without
any knowledge about the evil nature of the cult, are victims and
should not be treated with a bias, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
It explains that Falun Gong practitioners who quit the practice
after the government ban should not be regarded as cult members,
and they are welcome to participate in the campaign against the
cult.
</P>
<P>
The commentary calls Falun Gong a complicated issue that
involves a large number of people. As a result, it stresses, Falun
Gong should be handled with a firm attitude and stand, as well as
with great care.
</P>
<P>
The education of Falun Gong practitioners who are not cult
members should be carried out in a selective manner so as to avoid
a simple, rough solution, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Carefully carrying out the work of education and transformation
will achieve a complete isolation and strike the hardest possible
blow against a handful of stubbornly resisting elements, it says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that the current anti-Falun Gong
campaign has acquired a legal basis following the recent
resolution by the National People's Congress outlawing all cults
in the country, and a joint statement by the Supreme Court and
Procuratorate interpreting the use of law in dealing with cults.
</P>
<P>
The paper calls for a heavy hand in dealing with the few
organizers and planners and those who have worked behind the
scenes and have political motives. It invites the majority of
Falun Gong practitioners who have been educated and transformed to
join the people in criticizing the cult.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Religious Leaders Slam Falun Gong Cult (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of major Chinese
religious groups have been hailing the government ban on Falun
Gong and all agreed that cults must not be tolerated since they
imperil the society.
</P>
<P>
Dao Shuren, vice-chairman of the Buddhist Association of China,
called Falun Gong an evil cult from head to toe.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Falun Gong advocates worship of the cult
leader, brainwashes followers, makes black money, organizes
underground activities, and is severely harmful to the society.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jiyu, vice chairman of the Taoist Association of China,
echoed a recent People's Daily commentator's article, saying that
the hidden intention of Li Hongzhi, the leader of Falun Gong, is
to counter the government, the society, and the mankind.
</P>
<P>
All religious people in China are opposing Li and his Falun
Gong cult, the Taoist leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
The absurd "theory" of Falun Gong has features contrary to
science, mankind and the government, says Quexi, vice president of
the China Advanced Institute of Tibetan Buddhism. Li Hongzhi and
his aides are making every effort to manipulate Falun Gong
practitioners and turn the cult into a national organization.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan Buddhist leader termed Li Hongzhi's intentions
extremely bad.
</P>
<P>
All facts indicate that Falun Gong is a complete evil cult that
is advocating an evil theory, taking an evil road, and gathering
evil forces, noted Wan Yaobin, vice chairman of the Islamic
Association of China
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Li Hongzhi has fabricated Falun Gong by
stealing some concepts from several religions and Qi Gong, a kind
of deep-breathing exercise, which has posed an enormous threat to
the society. This has exposed Falun Gong as a cult, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Shi Zesheng, vice chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement
Committee of Protestant Churches of China, excoriated Falun Gong's
anti-government activities, including the siege around the
government and Communist Party of China headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Shi also blamed Falun Gong for the deaths of many of its
followers and their relatives.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Religious Leaders Slam Falun Gong Cult (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These Chinese religious leaders have ridiculed Falun Gong for
calling itself a religion, noting that a cult can never be a
religion, though it often steals religious terms while debasing
religion by terming itself the supreme religion.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong's illegal activities have riled the religious
leaders who have called on the government to take legal action to
protect normal religious activities and crack down on cults.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist leader Dao said that by exposing the nature of
Falun Gong as a cult, everyone will be able to recognize the harm
of the cult and the significance of the central leadership's
urgent efforts to deal with Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
It will also help implement the policy of the Communist Party
of China to ensure people's freedom in religious belief, protect
legal religions and crack down on illegal ones, and unite and
mobilize all the people to devote themselves to the economic drive
of the motherland, Dao said.
</P>
<P>
Falun Gong is something like a cancer, and only an operation
can relieve the patient, said Wan, the Islamic leader.
</P>
<P>
These religious leaders conclude that the government should
deal heavy blows to Falun Gong and other cults in a bid to
safeguard the people's interests, social stability, boost cultural
and ethic progress, and protect legal religious activities and the
rights of legal religious groups.
</P>
<P>
Liu Bainian, vice chairman of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic
Association, said local religious people deeply feel their duty to
safeguard social stability, and they should adhere to the
principle of "safeguarding the dignity of the law, the interests
of the people, unity among all ethnic groups, and the unification
of the motherland".

AMMAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will launch a nationwide
compulsory computer training program to eradicate computer
illiteracy among teachers of thousands of public schools of the

Over 4,000 teachers are expected to benefit when the training
courses officially start on November 14 to commemorate the
birthday of late King Hussein Ibn Talal, who died of cancer in

The late king had asked the government to install computers in
all state-run schools and get them connected to the Internet to
prepare Jordanian students for the age of computers and
information.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of education had selected 700 public schools
which already had computer labs to conduct the training program.
Over 1,000 teachers have already received training under the
program.
</P>
<P>
The program offers trainings in Internet connections, the
operation system Windows 98, as well as Word and Excel, currently
the most popular office softwares.

<P>
The program is aimed at eradicating computer illiteracy within
two years in the 4,700 public schools with 67,000 staff teachers.

LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has strongly attacked a
London-based non-government organization (NGO) for its suggestion
that Zambia should be suspended from the Commonwealth for failing

</P>
<P>
Zambian Foreign Minister Keli Walubita dismissed as baseless a
report by the NGO, saying that it has no information about his

sentiments could not be viewed as coming from the Commonwealth but
the NGO.

Zambia is very much ahead of many other countries in Africa in
the area of good governance and invites those doubting this to

The minister doubted that there would be any country to support

ISLAMABAD, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's trade deficit
during the first four months (July-October) of the current fiscal
year has reached 587 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Figures released Wednesday by the Commerce Ministry showed that
during the July-October period, Pakistan's exports recorded 2,616
million dollars and imports stood at 3,203 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade deficit in the same period of last fiscal year was 385
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sharif government had projected a trade deficit of 800 million
dollars in the budget for 1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
During the last few years, Pakistan's exports are hovering
around eight billion dollars due to inconsistent policies, lack of
credit and incentives, multiple taxes and high cost of input.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this financial year, Pakistan had
recorded 480 million dollars of trade deficit due to
non-performance of exports and it is believed this economic
scenario could expand swiftly if the new team of economic managers
fail to take appropriate measures.

outclassing their taller and heavier rivals to move on top of
Group C with their second straight win.
</P>
<P>
Thailand thrashed Nepal, 5-0, in the other game delayed by rain
due to a sudden heavy downpour as the Thais stayed in the running
with their first win in two outings while eliminating the Nepalese
who took their second loss.
</P>
<P>
In Bacolod on Tuesday, defending champion China turned a well-
balance attack into a 15-0 rout of Guam for its second consecutive
victory and grab the solo lead in Group B.
</P>
<P>
Seven Chinese players put their name on the scoreboard, led by
Wang Jian's four goals, in dealing the Guamanians their first loss
in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
South Korea kept its semifinal bid alive by crushing Kazakhstan
6-0, to rebound from a 2-5 setback to China last Sunday. Both
teams now tote 1-1 win-loss records.
</P>
<P>
"We weren't able to play as well as we wanted because of the
humid weather and the condition of the field," said Japanese coach
Tamotsu Suzuki, who nonetheless was pleased with the team's
performance overall.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating Japan's explosive attack, Uzbekistan played
conservative football from the start, packing its backing with as
many as six players at a time in a bid to hold down the score.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese made the most of their slight openings, with
Jumi Obe finally drilling the icebreaker in the 11th minute from
pointblank off a right corner kick, the ball rolling through a
phalanx of Uzbek defenders.
</P>
<P>
Asako Takakura added the second goal 10 minutes later as the
veteran of the first two Women's World Cups fashioned the game's
most spectacular shot.
</P>
<P>
Practically kneeling and the Uzbek defense set to pile on her
in a penalty box scramble, the 31-year-old midfielder completed a
180-degree turn and swept the goal past lunging goalkeeper Irina
Kutsilo from 10 feet.
</P>
<P>
Burly Uzbek forward Nargiza Abdurasulova made it 2-1 in the
32nd minute, scoring from the right side of the goalmouth despite
two tackling Japanese defenders.
</P>
<P>
Nami Otake, closely marked during the entire match, then cut
loose from her guard in front of the goal with a minute left in
the first half, looping the shot over Kutsilo's outstretched hands
from 15 feet to give Japan a 3-1 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Otake, who scored four goals in Japan's 9-0 demolition of
Thailand, added two goals in the second half for a hat-trick, the
last a 20-yard volley in the 62nd minute that completely
demoralized the opposition.
</P>
<P>
To compound the Uzbek's woes, striker Ekaterina Pak badly
twisted her left knee after a struggle within Japan's goal area
and will be sidelined for the rest of the tournament, including
their game against the Philippines on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thai striker Penprapai Prompuy scored two of her team's five
goals, which were all made in the first half as play was suspended
by 10 minutes as heavy rains fell over the Iloilo Stadium.

<HEADLINE> China's Offshore Oil Giant Prepares for Overseas Listing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua)-- The newly founded China
Offshore Oil Co. Ltd. (COOC) is busy preparing to list overseas
again after retreating from listing in October, according to the
company.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that COOC is restructuring its management system
in line with international practices, and making clear the rights
and responsibilities for its parent company, CNOOC.
</P>
<P>
The COOC was registered in Hong Kong in August with major
business focusing on offshore oil exploration, exploitation, and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
The company put off listing overseas in October because of the
unfavorable situation in the international stock market and the
drop in oil price.
</P>
<P>
The COOC produces 16 million tons of crude and 40 billion cubic
meters of gas annually, and the figures are expected to rise by an
annual average 16 percent in the next five years. The company's
verified oil reserves totaled 1.7 billion barrels, according to an
evaluation by a United States institute. Listing overseas will
attract more international funds and bring great opportunities to
China's offshore oil sector, said Wei Liucheng, president of CNOOC.
</P>
<P>
Foreign oil giants have shown great interest in investing in
China's offshore oil and gas exploration, he added.
</P>
<P>
China's offshore oil and gas reserves are estimated at 25
billion tons and 14 trillion cu m, respectively, and yet proven
reserves account for only five percent of the country's total
estimated resources, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that China is planning to develop oil and gas
blocks in the South China Sea, East China Sea, and Yellow Sea
along with foreign oil companies.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Election Commission to Fix Polling Date Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Election
Commission will meet on Friday to decide on the dates for
nomination and polling for the 10th general election, its chairman
Omar Hashim said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The commission would look for a suitable date for the election,
he told reporters when asked to comment on the statement by Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad that he hoped the election could be held
before the Muslim's fasting month scheduled to begin on December
9.
</P>
<P>
Nomination can be held after nine days from the date of the
dissolution of Parliament or a state assembly while the polling
date can be fixed seven days after nomination, at the earliest,
according to Malaysia's election regulations.
</P>
<P>
Under Malaysia's federal constitution, general election must be
held every five years and within 60 days of the dissolution of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
According to Omar, the 1998 Electoral Rolls with about 9.7
million voters verified on January 7 this year would be used for
the coming general election.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir Wednesday announced the dissolution of parliament
effective Thursday to pave the way for the next general election.
</P>
<P>
He decided to dissolve the parliament in order to enable the
general election, Mahathir said at a press conference in his new
office at Putrajaya, some 30 kilometers from here.
</P>
<P>
The Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz
Shah whom Mahathir met earlier Wednesday signed the notice of the
dissolution of parliament Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also announced that state governments have been
advised to dissolve the state legislative assemblies also
effective Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To a question what's the reason for him to make the
announcement today, Mahathir said I had said many times "I am
waiting for inspiration for the dissolution of parliament and it
happened the inspiration came to me yesterday."
</P>
<P>
To another question on his confidence of the ruling coalition
led by him to win the next general election, Mahathir said "I am
very confident of winning the two-third majority."
</P>
<P>
The dissolution of parliament put to rest months of speculation
and anxiety of a snap general election well ahead of the expiry of
the term of parliament in June next year.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Allow Foreign Companies to Issue Debt Instruments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand is
studying new regulations which will allow foreign companies to
issue debt instruments in the Thai market, Thailand News Agency
(TNA) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, low interest rates and plentiful
market liquidity have prompted several foreign companies
requesting permission to issue baht-denominated debentures, which
will offer lower funding costs than borrowing overseas.
</P>
<P>
Chettavee Charoenpitaks, assistant central bank governor, was
quoted as saying that a clear framework is needed to set some
regulations to prevent funds from being used improperly.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank fears that the baht raised
domestically could be transferred overseas, potentially impacting
on exchange rates and fueling speculative attacks on the currency.
</P>
<P>
Regulators are now debating what qualifications issuers must
have, what kind of debt instruments will be allowed and other
limitations.
</P>
<P>
Prasarn Trairatvorakul, deputy secretary-general of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, said the International Finance
Corporation, an investment arm of the World Bank, has already
applied for permission to issue baht-denominated debentures in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The corporation wants to raise domestic funds to finance local
investment, Prasarn said.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO to Implement Special Project in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Educational, Science and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is going
to implement a special project to promote basic education in
Tanzania, the Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The project, entitled Basic Education Capacity Building for
Local NGOs (non-governmental organizations) in Less Developed
Countries, will be implemented by the UNESCO Country Director's
Office in Tanzania, executed and coordinated by the Tanzania
Council for Social Development.
</P>
<P>
Program officer of the Tanzania Council for Social Development,
 Rajabu Kondo, said Tuesday that the project focuses on
strengthening institutional capability of the NGOs as social
partners in promoting basic education.
</P>
<P>
Kondo said the project will involve 25 NGOs in Tanzania which
will implement the project in stages, including holding
consultative workshops on NGOs and government institutions with
resources and skills on basic education.
</P>
<P>
Project activities will also include development and production
of training materials, field work, monitoring and evaluation.
</P>
<P>
The decision to launch the project came from the Jomtiem
Declaration which recognized the work the NGOs are doing in
delivering basic education in the society, said Kondo.
</P>
<P>
He said the project is in line with the goal of the
declaration, which aims to broaden partnership in support of
education for all through capacity building of those NGOs active
in basic education.
</P>
<P>
Some NGOs had weak institutional and organizational capacity,
which affected the implementation of basic education related
activities and programs.
</P>
<P>
The project will also be implemented in nine other African and
Asian countries - Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Benin, Mali, Burkina
Faso, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Urgent Measures To Curb Transmission of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese medical expert today
said efforts are needed to increase the fight against AIDS in
China. By the end of 1998, 13.9 million people have died of AIDS
around the world.
</P>
<P>
The world's AIDS patients and HIV carriers have reached 47.3
million. Among the 33.4 HIV carriers, some 95 percent reside in
developing countries, Xu Hua, deputy secretary general of the
China Association for HIV/AIDS and STDs Prevention, said at a
Forum organized by The All China Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is endangering the whole world," said Xu who specializes
in researching AIDS transmission and its control.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the World Health
Organization (WHO), those who contract AIDS increases at a rate of
16,000 new virus carriers a day. As head of the non-governmental
organization, Xu is highly valued by the Chinese government in
efforts to control the fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
China has established 96 local centers for monitoring AIDS
patients and HIV carriers.
</P>
<P>
China's Health Ministry announced recently that by the end of
September, 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities had
reported a total of 15,088 HIV cases, 477 of which are AIDS
related cases. 240 deaths have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Since the first AIDS case was reported in the United States in
1981, the deadly disease has spread throughout the world.
Statistics show that of the 33.4 million HIV carriers in the world,
about seven million are in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Queen Elizabeth Faces Protest Threat in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth
 was threatened by Afrikaners with a protest demanding an apology
for the Anglo-Boer war ahead of her formal welcome on a visit to
South Africa Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing Herstigte Nasionale Party appealed to Afrikaners
to demonstrate with placards and flags of the old Boer republics
Wednesday when the queen meets President Thabo Mbeki in Pretoria,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The party said in a statement published in the Citizen
newspaper that its leader Jaap Marais had written to the queen
asking her to apologize to Afrikaners for British war crimes
during the conflict a century ago.
</P>
<P>
The planned demonstration is a reaction to reports that the
queen will instead express regret over the deaths on all sides in
the war, in which Afrikaners -- the descendants of Dutch and
French settlers -- were subjugated to British rule.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the British High Commission in Pretoria said
the queen is expected to address the issue at a state banquet
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Like that of the South African government, our approach is
very much that while remembering the dead with sadness the focus
should be on reconciliation," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
However, the Herstigte Nasionale Party said that an expression
of regret would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing party questioned why Afrikaners could not be
accorded an apology in the same terms the queen used when
apologizing to New Zealand's Maoris in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Is it because the Brits (British) wish to tell the world that
they would apologize to all and sundry but not to the Afrikaners,
suggesting that the Afrikaners are unworthy of an apology?" the
party said.
</P>
<P>
General Constand Viljoen, former South African army chief and
leader of reconciliation from the queen, said that his main
objection to Britain's role in the war was not the deaths of
soldiers, but those of some 26,000 Afrikaner women and children
herded into concentration camps during the conflict which began
October 11, 1899 and lasted until 1902.

<HEADLINE> EAC Treaty Ready for Signing: Tanzanian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The general treaty for a
 tripartite East African Cooperation (EAC) is ready for signing on
November 30 by Tanzanian, Ugandan and Kenyan heads of state.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete said this at the National Assembly
(parliament) session in the central city of Dodoma Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for the formation of the EAC have been finalized,
the African newspaper Wednesday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gradual forging of the economic bloc into a monetary union and
later a political federation are aimed at avoiding dominance of
one state, as was the case in the East African Community which
collapsed in 1977, Kikwete said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the three member states have therefore agreed to
ratify some of the treaty conventions and protocols in a framework
manner depending on each country's capacity in specific fields of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The EAC will operate through the application of the principle
of asymmetry and by taking into consideration the fiscal
implication of the tariff elimination exercise on the economy of
each member state, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the bloc provides for gradual withdraw of both the
internal and external tariffs by member states within a duration
of four years after the signing.
</P>
<P>
During the four years, in order to develop internal capacity,
Tanzania will need to improve the infrastructure, increase
productivity and also lower the costs of electricity, water,
telephone and transportation, Kikwete stressed.
</P>
<P>
He called for industrialists to strive for high quality
products and proper utilization of the country's abundant natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister also disclosed that the Tanzanian
government is establishing a fully-fledged department in the
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Ministry to deal
with matters concerning the EAC.
</P>
<P>
The department will mainly work on economic cooperation issues,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Efforts toward revival of the east African organization started
in April 1997 when the three presidents okayed the start of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The bloc, with its secretariat in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha, is expected to have key organs like legislative assembly,
community court, sectoral units, and the Heads of State summit.

TOKYO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei
Kono vowed Wednesday that he would work actively toward resuming
stalled negotiations with the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) on normalizing bilateral diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the House of Representatives (lower house) Foreign
Affairs Committee, Kono said he would work to create "the
situation and conditions" for the normalization talks, Kyodo News
reported.

Japan announced last week the lifting of its ban on charter
flights to the DPRK as the first step in easing the sanctions
after Pyongyang promised not to fire any more missiles as long as
dialogue with Washington continues.

MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry
Tuesday denied reports that Russia might gradually transfer the

</P>
<P>
These reports "do not correspond to reality," said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has no plan to hand over the south Kurils to Japan.
The territorial issue can be resolved only if Russia's territorial
integrity and sovereignty remain unharmed," the ministry said,
adding that "this is Russia's principled position."

Earlier, State Duma Security Committee Chairman Viktor
Ilyukhin said that Russian President Boris Yeltsin might gradually

<HEADLINE> Cancer Recovery Club Celebrates 10th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- "5,000 members of Shanghai's
Cancer Recovery Club (SCRC) put on a performance titled "Ode to
Life", recently in Shanghai to celebrate the 10th anniversary of
SCRC.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in 1989, SCRC has set up 21 branches, six
recovery guidance services, a recovery school and a activity
center in the city.
</P>
<P>
Patients in the club help and encourage each other like friends
and unite together to fight against cancer.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yadi, young kindergarten teacher was diagnosed with cancer
of the tongue. She had difficulty in speaking and her face was
distorted because of numerous operations. SCRC encouraged her to
enter the recovery school and undergo a series of treatments. Now
she can speak again and has returned to her job.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, 32,000 people are diagnosed
with cancer each year in the city. Of these 32,000, 23,000 die of
the disease. However, among the 5,231 of registered SCRC members,
only 278 died last year. Forty-eight percent of SCRC members after
operations have prolonged their life by more than 5 years.
</P>
<P>
Along with recovery treatment, patients are engaged in
voluntary activities. A group made up of 500 volunteer patients
can often been seen helping each other in residential areas
quarters, and in other public spaces. Some patients have even set
up a fund to aid cancer patients who come from poor families.
</P>
<P>
SCRC has received attention from around the world. Delegations
from the US, Japan, Germany and other countries have visited SCRC
in the last ten years.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven similar organizations have been established around
China. 1.05 million people die from cancer each year.

MOSCOW, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels are considering
to withdraw their forces from the encircled Chechen cities to
Azerbaijan and Georgia and form a government in exile, said the
Russian military Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, the rebels have made four attempts to
break out of Gudermes, the second largest city of the breakaway
republic, which is encircled by the eastern grouping, but were
bombarded by federal artillery, with 10 rebels killed, said the
temporary press center for the federal forces' eastern grouping in
the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Despite the cloudy and snowy weather in Chechnya, Russian
federal planes flew over 30 missions against rebel formations in
the past 24 hours, reported the Interfax news agency, citing the
Russian forces headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 bombers and Su-25 assault planes have attacked rebel
bases near Bamut, Duba-Yurt and Chishki. Mi-24 helicopters have
also flown 18 combat missions, firing missiles on rebel positions
on the outskirts of Grozny, the military said.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary reports, federal aircraft destroyed
eight rebel strongholds, a telephone exchange, a command post and
seven vehicles, damaged a bridge, mined almost 20 kilometers of
road and created three blockages in the mountains.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Parliament to be Dissolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Wednesday announced the dissolution of parliament
effective Thursday to pave the way for the next general election.
</P>
<P>
He decided to dissolve the parliament in order to enable the
general election, Mahathir said at a press conference in his new
office at Putrajaya, some 30 kilometers from here.
</P>
<P>
The Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz
Shah whom Mahathir met earlier Wednesday signed the notice of the
dissolution of parliament Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also announced that state governments have been
advised to dissolve the state legislative assemblies also
effective Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the dates of nomination and polling will be decided by
the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir said the 10th general election will be held
before the Ramadan (Muslims' fasting month) so as to avoid
campaigning that can be sacrilegious to the Muslim fasting month
scheduled to commence on December 9.
</P>
<P>
To a question what's the reason for him to make the
announcement today, Mahathir said I had said many times "I am
waiting for inspiration for the dissolution of parliament and it
happened the inspiration came to me yesterday."
</P>
<P>
To another question on his confidence of the ruling coalition
led by him to win the next general election, Mahathir said "I am
very confident of winning the two-third majority."
</P>
<P>
The dissolution of parliament put to rest months of speculation
and anxiety of a snap general election well ahead of the expiry of
the term of parliament in June next year.
</P>
<P>
The speculation grew even more intense Tuesday night when
Mahathir canceled a long-scheduled trip to South Africa to attend
the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysia's federal constitution, general election
must be held every five years and within 60 days of the
dissolution of parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the last general election held in April 1995, the ruling
Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) coalition won 162 seats out
of the total 192.

BUCHAREST -- Romanian President Emil Constantinescu said here

policy to develop friendly and cooperative relations with China.

The two countries have enjoyed a "time-tested friendly

<HEADLINE> Zambia Raps Attempt to Suspend It from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has strongly attacked a
London-based non-government organization (NGO) for its suggestion
that Zambia should be suspended from the Commonwealth for failing
to uphold democratic governance.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Foreign Minister Keli Walubita dismissed as baseless a
report by the NGO, saying that it has no information about his
country and is merely acting by "remote control".
</P>
<P>
The minister said he has seen the report, and clearly the
sentiments could not be viewed as coming from the Commonwealth but
the NGO.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is very much ahead of many other countries in Africa in
the area of good governance and invites those doubting this to
come and see what is happening, the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper
Wednesday quoted Walubita as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister doubted that there would be any country to support
the idea at the Commonwealth Heads of State and Government meeting
to start Friday in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"If such a thing happens, Zambia will defend herself," he said.
</P>
<P>
The British Daily Telegraph newspaper reported Monday that four
 countries including Zambia could face expulsion from the
Commonwealth under proposals for tough new membership criteria
based on democracy and human rights.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Reform Debate Has Wrong Priority: World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has warned that
 Kenyans are involved in a reform debate with a wrong priority,
saying that the constitutional review cannot immediately solve
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional review process is "a long-haul affair and
has no immediate solutions for the Kenya's present economic
needs," World Bank Country Director Harold Wackman said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official advised Kenyan politicians not to waste
a great deal of time on the constitution review debate at the
expense of pressing economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Although it is true the constitution is a very important
document and the people must have a say in what kind of government
they want, that is not exactly what Kenyans need right now, the
East African Standard Wednesday quoted Wackman as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that reformists have reduced the debate to a scramble
for the central seat, with everyone asking who takes what seat, or
who should be on the Constitution of Kenya Review Commission.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is now waiting for proposals from Kenya
regarding expenditure-cutting after a major government reshuffle
in September this year with the number of ministries reducing from
27 to 15, Wackman said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Rejects NPA's Proposed Venue of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada flatly rejected Wednesday a reported demand by the rebel
New People's Army (NPA) to resume peace talks in areas claimed by
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
In a radio program, the president stressed that the NPA is in
no position to dictate the terms of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Why should they pick the venue? We're here in the Philippines.
And in the Philippines, the government and not them should be
followed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also vowed to unleash the full force of the law
on NPA rebels who abducted a police major in southern Luzon
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"We will not stop until we neutralize them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the government and the NPA terminated
on May 30 after the Philippine Senate ratified the Visiting Forces
Agreement (VFA) agreement between the Philippines and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The VFA paved way for the resumption of large-scale joint
military exercises in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, the NPAs allegedly said that they are
open to the resumption of peace talks, but supposedly want them
held in "neutral" areas -- such as those "held" by the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is one of the several armed groups now conducting
peace talks with the government. The government is also dealing
with the NPA but at the local level.

<HEADLINE> German Enterprises Confident in Investing in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- German enterprises are
confident in investing in Shanghai because of its investment
environment, said Ernst Behrens, president of Siemens (China).
</P>
<P>
During German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's recent visit to
China, Volkswagen decided to invest 3 billion Deutsche marks (1.6
billion U.S. dollars) in China in the next five years. Bayer has
decided to finance a factory in southern Shanghai with Shanghai
Chloralkali company. The factory will have an annual production
capacity of 100,000 tons of polycarbonate.
</P>
<P>
Siemens Shanghai Mobile Communications Ltd. plans to get a loan
of one billion yuan (120 million U.S. dollars) from the Bank of
China to double its sales volume this year and to achieve 7.3
billion yuan (880 million U.S. dollars) by 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Foreign Investment Working Committee,
Germany financed 25 projects in Shanghai involving contractual
investment of 226 million U.S. dollars in the first nine months of
this year, ranking third along with the Netherlands after Hong
Kong and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The German Krupp and Thyssen Company invested 1.25 billion U.S.
dollars in Shanghai's Pudong district to produce stainless steel
products. Volkswagen produced 235,000 Sanata cars in 1998, making
up half of China's total car output.
</P>
<P>
One-third of Siemen's 56 joint ventures in China are located in
Shanghai. The Siemens Shanghai Mobile Communications Ltd. now
produces 3 million mobile phones each year. It has become the
largest goods supplier in the Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Siemens Shanghai Communication Terminals, founded in 1995, now
produces 6 million telephones a year. Seventy percent of the
phones are sold to over 50 foreign countries and regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) - Under orders of Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, the Israel Defense Force (IDF) dismantled early Wednesday
morning the Maon Farm outpost set up by right-wing Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
IDF officers, male and women soldiers and medical corps, arrived
early in the morning at the outpost, southeast of the West Bank city
of Hebron, and evacuated the settlers from the site, the army said.
</P>
<P>
The eviction met some passive resistance from the settlers, but
nobody was hurt during the operation, the army added.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of settlers and right-wing activists from other parts of
Israel went to the site to show their support to the Maon Farm
settlers and stayed there overnight, but they did not intervene when
the settlers were being forced away.
</P>
<P>
The Maon Farm outpost was the last of the 12 hilltop encampments of
Jewish settlers ordered to be dismantled under an agreement reached
between Barak and settler leaders recently. The others have already
been evacuated by the settlers themselves.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return Tuesday night from Paris, France, Barak met with
Chief of General Staff Shaul Mofaz and Chief of Israeli General
Security Services Ami Ayalon to discuss the situation in Maon Farm.
</P>
<P>
Barak ordered the IDF to implement the government's decision,
saying that illegal settlements will not be allowed.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu On China's Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said
Wednesday that China has always maintained a positive attitude
towards its entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), but
should become a member as a developing nation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told visiting Danish Foreign Minister Niels Petersen at the
Great Hall of the People that China can enter the WTO only as a
developing country, and China's rights and obligations should be
given equal status.
</P>
<P>
Petersen, who arrived here on Sunday on a five-day official
visit, said that Denmark actively supports China's early entry
into the WTO and hopes negotiations with relevant countries in
this regard will be a success.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the bilateral relations, the Chinese premier said
that the Chinese government values very much developing relations
with Denmark and expressed the belief that the coming century will
see a greater and quicker growth of the bilateral ties with the
joint efforts of the two countries, for the two countries
established their diplomatic ties very early and their cooperation
is wide-ranging and there exists great potential for such
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Petersen agreed with Zhu, saying that next year will mark the
50th anniversary of the establishment of the diplomatic ties of
the two countries, Denmark will hold grand celebrations to mark
the occasion, and will promote the further growth of the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also briefed the Danish visitors on China's domestic
situation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Wants to Solve Aceh Problem Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
firstly collect information on referendum plan in Aceh province in
a bid to seek a peaceful and fair settlement to the decades-old
Aceh problem, a senior official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid has ordered State Minister for
Human Right Affairs Hasbalah M. Saad to visit Aceh and meet local
figures to collect information for government in its attempt to
give correct response to the province's problems, Coordinating
Minister for Political and Security Affairs Wiranto said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said after a meeting which attended by the president,
vice president, chairman of the People's Consultative Assembly
(MPR) and himself, that the government will also put in order
deployment of security personnel including the shift of troops and
additional police officers in the province.
</P>
<P>
The urgent meeting was held after the president turned home
Tuesday night following an eight-day visit to ASEAN countries
which brought him to Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos,
Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
More than one million Acehnese on Monday attended a meeting in
Banda Aceh, capital of Aceh province, demanding a referendum on
the right of the people of that province to self determination.
this was an impressive display of solidarity since the
independence group Free Aceh Movement unilaterally declared
independence on December 4, 1976.
</P>
<P>
But, President Wahid pointed out earlier that there is no way
that Aceh could break away from Indonesia, although a referendum
was a reasonable proposition. However, the president agreed to
investigate and bring to court those who violate the human rights
in the province under the rule of Soeharto regime in the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said the key words that have to be remembered in
solving the problem is that Aceh is still part of the Unitary
State of Indonesia, and that all problems should be settled
wisely.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MPR Chairman Amien Rais said that the demand filed
by the Acehnese for a referendum must not be ignored and that
therefore the government must immediately negotiate this matter
with the Acehnese.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed that most of the Aceh people still want
the province to remain part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Akbar Tandjung also said he disagreed with a
referendum plan for the troubled province of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
Referendum will only be a negative precedent for other
provinces. If the referendum took place, it would mean that
Indonesia is on the brink of disintegration, Tandjung said.
</P>
<P>
He said the House of Representatives (DPR) has put Aceh at its
top priority. A special meeting has been arranged. The meeting
will discuss the establishment of a DPR team for Aceh.
</P>
<P>
Aceh, the east most province of Indonesia with a population of
only about 4.3 million people, has a history of rebellion against
foreign rule. The Dutch only managed to wholly occupied the
territory in the 1930s, long after they had firmly established
themselves in the rest of the Indonesian archipelago.
</P>
<P>
When the Indonesian Republic proclaimed its independence from
the Dutch in 1945, Aceh emerged as a strong backer of the
Indonesian nationalist cause, supporting the new republic with
donations of money and materials. However, in the 1950s, a popular
insurgency movement against the Jakarta administration arose,
bringing new unrest to the territory for many years. Since then,
trouble has continued to brew, on and off.
</P>
<P>
The new government which was established at the end of October
headed by Wahid has determined to give top priority to the
settlement of the Aceh problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua)-- China welcomes foreign
cooperation in reforming its huge power sector and upgrading its
equipment, officials said at a Sino-Australian Power Seminar which
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
China's short-term goal for the reform of its power industry is
to push forward the corporatization process of the industry,
separate governmental regulation from corporate operation, build a
nationwide interconnected power grid and improve its distribution
system in both urban and rural areas, according to Jiao Yi'an,
chief operation officer of China's State Power Corporation (SP),
who spoke at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
China is now conducting pilot programs for developing
competitive generation markets in six provinces, and "around the
year 2010, the competitive mechanism may be introduced into the
supply business so that end-users are to be entitled to make
choices of service suppliers to a greater degree," he said.
</P>
<P>
SP is currently planning to build power stations using natural
gas, and the Australian side, rich in LNG resources and production
experience, is welcome to participate in the competition for the
project, Jiao said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Ambassador to China Richard Smith briefed the
Chinese audience on Australia's energy policy and Australia's
expertise and capabilities in power market reform, exploring the
opportunities for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the seminar was an Australian Electric Energy
Mission, consisting of senior representatives from power companies,
industry law firms and service providers, which came to China on
Tuesday. The mission will hold talks with Chinese experts and

URUMQI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Alataw Railway Station in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region had registered
three million tons of land-cargo transport by November 7.
</P>
<P>
This is the station's first time to handle over three million
tons in a year since it opened in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Alataw Pass, 90 kilometers long and 20 kilometers wide, is a
passage linking China with central and western Asia, and is known
as a "wind tunnel" because of its harsh weather.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the State Council, China's highest governing body,
approved Alataw Pass as an open port, and the railway in northern
Xinjiang is now an important part of the new Eurasian Continental
Bridge, beginning at Urumqi's West Station and connecting with a
railway in Kazakhstan at Alataw Pass.
</P>
<P>
Ranking second among the country's nine railway ports, the
freight volume here broke the one-million ton mark in 1995 and has

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ostrich Population Hits 50,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ostrich population
has gone up by about 10,000 birds to 50,000 during the current
season because of the strong external demand, the Herald daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have increased their ostrich population and their
presence on the export market owing to the buoyant demand for the
bird's meat and skin on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar against the greenback
has also made the ostrich sector more lucrative, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the ostriches are targeted for export,
bringing millions of dollars in foreign currency which has helped
to stabilize the local currency.
</P>
<P>
In the short to medium term, prospects for growth in the
ostrich farming sector are expected to remain bright, particularly
if producers manage to contain high input costs, such as labor,
transport, fuel and feeds, according to Zimbabwe Financial
Holdings, the country's leading commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
Further depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar is expected to
enhance the export revenue earned by ostrich producers, the bank
said.

<P>
CHANGSHA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- "English is an international
language," Long Jianping told her pupils at the Bell La'ershan
Primary School located in the impoverished La'ershan Prefecture in
western Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The school was funded by the Shanghai Bell Company in 1993
costing 380,000 yuan and is part of "Project Hope", an operation
which helps fund education in China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Miao ethnic Chinese students in the 5th and the 6th grades at
the school will have the same opportunity of learning English as
their counterparts in big cities where English teaching is so
popular that it is even taught in kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
Wu Huanzhou, the headmaster of the school, said that English
was offered to help more of its graduates get a higher education
outside of La'ershan, a mountainous area some 1,000 km away from
the provincial capital of Changsha. Classes are conducted in the
local dialect, standard Chinese and English.
</P>
<P>
The Miao is China's fourth largest ethnic group with a
population of more than 7 million. They have retained their own
language and traditional customs.
</P>
<P>
Long Jianping, who is also Miao, has become the first English
teacher in Miao primary schools. Due to financial constraints at
the school, Long prepares her own teaching materials.
</P>
<P>
"One has to be practical in teaching English to these students.
They need to grasp some basic skills such as the 26 letters of the
alphabet as well as a few standard greetings which will make
further learning much easier for them."
</P>
<P>
Long said that when she graduated from the primary school in
the 1980s, the school was only a shabby earth structure. Now there
stands a two-storey white building in the mountain which can
accommodate several hundreds of students.

HANGZHOU, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A wholesale flower market in
the eastern part of Hangzhou, a picturesque city and capital of
east China's Zhejiang Province, has become the biggest of its kind
in east China.
</P>
<P>
Set up two years ago, the market has expanded rapidly as a

</P>
<P>
Its sales in the first nine months of this year hit 110 million
yuan (about 13.25 U.S. dollars). The 1998 sales were 81 million
yuan ( about 9.75 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of flowers of some 500 kinds from various
parts of China and some foreign countries can be found in the
market, which draws huge crowds of flower businessmen and
customers everyday from across the country, a local florist said.
</P>
<P>
"Here you can buy flowers which you could not find in other
places and you can also bring flowers to the market which you
could not sell in other markets," said a flower trader from
Liuyang in central China's Hunan Province.

<HEADLINE> Former Falun Gong Practitioners Turn to Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 10 (Xinhua)-- Former practitioners of the
banned Falun Gong sect in Harbin, capital city of northeast China'
s Heilongjiang province, have now turned to science studies
instead of the Falun Doctrine.
</P>
<P>
Since the central government declared the Falun Gong sect
illegal more than three months ago, scores of former practitioners
have come to realize that they were duped by the Sect's founder,
Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
A suggestion that former practitioners should spend more
efforts on scientific studies received a warm response from other
former Falun Gong practitioners. A local policeman has made a
large office available for their classroom.
</P>
<P>
At the first class, 63 year-old Mrs. Yuan said that she started
to learn Falun Gong to cure her rheumatism. Much to her horror and
dismay, her rheutatism became worse a year later.
</P>
<P>
"Now, I see there is no doctrine or wheel of law that controls
the human body," she said, adding that she believes firmly in
science and will never be fooled again by the likes of Li Hongzhi.
</P>
<P>
The group of students will be offered courses in physiology,
ethics and mysteries of the universe, according to the students'
teacher, Wang Junsheng.

<HEADLINE> Income Gap in S. Korea Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The income gap between the
middle- and high-income brackets in South Korea has widened since
the financial crisis in late 1997, according to the South Korean
Institute of Finance Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The combined income of the middle-income bracket accounted for
48.7 percent of that of the high-income bracket in the first half
of this year, which was the lowest since the first half of 1985
when it was recorded at 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the ratio of middle-income to high-income had been
on the rise. The percentage, which stood at 50 percent in 1990,
rose to 52 percent in 1991, 53 percent in 1994, 53.3 percent in
1997, but it fell to 50 percent last year due to the financial
crisis caused by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Under the 10-grade income scale designed by the South Korean
National Statistics Office, those belonging to the eighth, ninth
and tenth are classified as the high-income bracket while those in
the fourth to seventh belong to the middle-income bracket.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ratio of the lowest-bracket income to that of
the high-income bracket dropped to 24.8 percent in the first six
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The institute attributed the growing income inequality to high-
income earners benefiting most from the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the worsening structure of the income gap
will not be corrected in foreseeable future.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Surge in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply in
Tokyo Wednesday on growing expectations for the Japanese
government's larger-than-expected economic stimulus package, with
the key Nikkei index marking the year's closing high.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange climbed 275.71 points, or 1.51
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 18,567.87.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark index's previous closing high for this year was
18,532.58, registered July 19.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, rose 21.53 points or 1.37 percent to 1,593.
93.
</P>
<P>
Share prices moved lower in the morning due to profit-taking
stirred by Tuesday's fall on Wall Street, traders said.
</P>
<P>
But they turned upward in the afternoon following a report that
the Japanese government's stimulus package, to be announced
Thursday, may total as much as 16 trillion yen (152.4 billion
dollars), exceeding the previously expected 15 trillion yen (142.9
billion dollars), they added.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section swelled to 703.30 million shares
from 639.16 million shares Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yasuda Trust and Banking was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Traders said only specific issues, such as information and
telecommunication-related issues, led overall share prices higher.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, export-oriented technology issues, which had
finished the morning session lower due to the U.S. dollar's fall
to the 104 yen range, turned upward in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers exceeded
gainers 767 to 461 despite the rises in the Nikkei and TOPIX, with
119 issues remaining unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ostrich Population Hits 50,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ostrich population
has gone up by about 10,000 birds to 50,000 during the current
season because of the strong external demand, the Herald daily
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have increased their ostrich population and their
presence on the export market owing to the buoyant demand for the
bird's meat and skin on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar against the greenback
has also made the ostrich sector more lucrative, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the ostriches are targeted for export,
bringing millions of dollars in foreign currency which has helped
to stabilize the local currency.
</P>
<P>
In the short to medium term, prospects for growth in the
ostrich farming sector are expected to remain bright, particularly
if producers manage to contain high input costs, such as labor,
transport, fuel and feeds, according to Zimbabwe Financial
Holdings, the country's leading commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
Further depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar is expected to
enhance the export revenue earned by ostrich producers, the bank
said.

In the interest of transparency, the government has agreed to a
request from the bereaved family to have external investigators

progress on the investigations into the murder of Wezi Kaunda by
gunmen on November 4," the Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Wednesday
quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Two of the suspected killers of Wezi have been arrested, one of
whom appeared in court on November 9.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the search of Wezi's suspected killers has been

personnel in an effort to corner the remaining suspects.
</P>
<P>
Wezi was shot last Wednesday night by unknown gunmen and died
at a hospital early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the gunmen opened fire at Kaunda's son

<HEADLINE> China to Build New Railway in Western Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to build a
new railway line in the western region in a bid to spur the
economic development of the area.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region told
Xinhua that the construction of the railway line, which starts
from Zhongwei County in Ningxia and ends in Taiyuan, the capital
of north China's Shanxi Province, has the support of the State
Council, China's highest governing body.
</P>
<P>
The 885-km railway line is estimated to cost 7.75 billion yuan
and is expected to be completed in 2005. It will run through
Ningxia, and Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces, benefiting 10 million
people in an area of 100,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Although less developed, the area has plentiful energy, tourism
and agricultural and animal husbandry resources. The railway line
will play an important role in promoting the economic and social
development of northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour to Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi, last
May, Chinese President Jiang Zemin called for accelerated
development of western China.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Receive World Bank Loans for Coal Industry Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will sign an
agreement with the Polish government on Thursday to grant a loan
of 300 million U.S. dollars to support the reform process of the
coal sector in the eastern European country.
</P>
<P>
Having agreed to the loan five months ago, the World Bank will
make 70 million dollars available to Poland before the end of this
year and deliver the rest 230 million in 2000, according to
reports of the Polish News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The loan, to be repaid within 15 years starting in 2003, will
be spent on restructuring of coal production, improving
management, environmental protection and supporting laid-off
miners.
</P>
<P>
According to Polish Economic Ministry sources, the World Bank
is willing to lend 1 billion dollars to support the country's coal
industry reform and an additional 700 million dollars from 2001 to
2003.
</P>
<P>
Poland has received 5 billion dollars from the World Bank since
1990.
</P>
<P>
The Polish government adopted in July 1998 a five-year plan to
reform its coal sector. Although achievements have been scored in
trimming employees and cutting down output, the industry remains
in the red. A loss of 800 million dollars is predicted for this
year, twice as much as the target.

WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of
Representatives Tuesday approved the budget for 11 federal
intelligence agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency (
CIA) and the National Security Agency (NSA).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has refused to announce the overall
budget number, but lawmakers said it was about 1 percent above the
1999 level estimated at 29 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the government disclosed that the intelligence budget
was 26.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill, which was passed by voice, authorized
intelligence activities for fiscal 2000 that include a new program
to target the financial assets of drug kingpins.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, the U.S. president will present a "most
wanted" list of leading international drug traffickers once a year.
</P>
<P>
Those on the list would be subject to having their U.S.-based
assets frozen. The traffickers, their families and their
associates would be denied visas to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is expected to pass the legislation before it
recesses for the winter.

<HEADLINE> U.S. On-line Shoppers to Triple in '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 9 (Xinhua) -- This year's holiday
shopping season in the United States will see a huge increase in
the volume of on-line shoppers and dollars spent on-line, said a
report released Tuesday by a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
According to a report based on a survey of 1,200 on-line
shoppers, the number of regular on-line holiday shoppers will
almost triple from 1998. Last year, 23 percent of the respondents
did at least 10 percent of their holiday shopping on-line. In 1999,
the number will be 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Ernst &AMP; Young, also found that
consumers will do more of their holiday shopping on-line.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, only four percent of on-line shoppers did at least 50
percent of their holiday shopping on-line. In 1999, the number may
jump to 19 percent of shoppers. Conversely, the number of on-line
consumers who have no plans to shop on-line during the holidays
dropped dramatically, from 49 percent to 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Considering the data as well as the dramatic increase in the
number of Internet sites and merchandise available, the consulting
firm projected on-line sales for the holiday of 12-15 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The survey revealed that favorite categories sold on-line
during the holidays will be computers and related products, books,
CDs, toys and videos.
</P>
<P>
Time constraints and frustration with in-store shopping are
driving shoppers to the Web for holiday shopping this year, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
Price was not a driving factor, nor were value-added services.
When asked why they like to do their holiday shopping on-line,
respondents selected: saving time, stores too crowded, more
convenient shopping hours, less driving, etc., said the survey.

<HEADLINE> BIMST-EC to Promote Intra-Regional Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Commerce and
Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed said Tuesday that members of the
BIMST-EC (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and
Thailand-Economic Corporation) have decided to find ways to
promote intra-regional cooperation among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Speaking as the chief guest at the inaugural session of the
preparatory meeting of the BIMST-EC economic forum here, Tofail
pointed out that almost all BIMST-EC countries in the past faced
constraints relating to financial resources for undertaking
projects.
</P>
<P>
"We will vigorously pursue private sector participation from
within and outside the BIMST-EC sources for investment in
projects," he was quoted as saying by newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tofail noted that with limited success in various areas, the
BIMST-EC nations were now planning to address hard-core economic
issues such as investment, rules of origin and zero tariffs.
"BIMST-EC might be considered as a bridge linking two blocs -- the
SAARC (the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) and
ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations)," he said.
</P>
<P>
The commerce minister said the first meeting of economic
ministers of BIMST-EC countries held in Bangkok on August 7, 1998,
identified six major areas for cooperation, including trade and
investment, technology, transportation and communication, energy,
tourism and fisheries. This might gradually expand to other areas
whenever it was felt necessary.

WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has asked to buy
Patriot missiles and advanced firing units worth 4.2 billion U.S.
dollars to enhance its defense capability, the Pentagon said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The proposed sale will enhance the Republic of Korea's
defensive capability against hostile neighbors, lessening the
burden on the United States," the Pentagon said in an announcement.
</P>
<P>
This was a clear indication that the United States wants to
strengthen its presence in the Korean peninsula to contain the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea by helping its ally
modernize the weapon system.
</P>
<P>
It would also be a major financial boost to the U.S. arms
industry.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would include the possible sale of 14 Patriot
Advance Capability 3 (PAC-3) firing units, 14 engagement radars
and 76 launching stations for the anti-missile missiles built by
Raytheon. It would also include 616 current Patriot missiles built
by the firm, Army officials said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Issue 4.2 Billion U.S. Dollars in Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will issue
government bonds worth five trillion won (4.2 billion U.S. dollars)
this year to prevent exchange rate fluctuations, said South Korean
authorities Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The won-dollar exchange rate has steadily declined since it
recorded 1,205 won against the U.S. dollar on October 25, and it
reached 1,182 won to the U.S. dollar Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A strong won makes South Korean products more expensive in
international markets, said the South Korean Ministry of Finance
and Economy.
</P>
<P>
The bond issue is also intended to reduce the rising supply of
dollars, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The flow of foreign direct investment has been growing as
jitters over the Daewoo Group's financial crisis abate and the
nation continues to register a large trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
However, observers say it is natural for the won to gain
against the dollar as more dollars flow into the nation amid
improving market conditions.
</P>
<P>
To balance the supply of and demand for dollars, the South
Korean government is also considering other measures such as
encouraging local banks to make provisions for losses from Daewoo'
s foreign currency-dominated debts and discouraging state-owned
firms from borrowing abroad.

<HEADLINE> More Canadians Complain About Work Stress, Statistics Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of young
and middle-aged Canadians complain that they are working too much,
Statistics Canada reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 21 percent of women over 15 complained about time stress
in 1998, compared with 16 percent in 1992. The proportion of men
rose to 16 percent from 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Time stressed men and women spent at least an average of 9.4
hours a day on total work activities in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The "struggle to juggle" in 1998 was most difficult for those
married parents aged 25-44 who were full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
About three million Canadians, or one-third of those in this
age bracket, considered themselves to be workaholics, Statistics
Canada said.
</P>
<P>
"Not surprisingly, time-stress levels were highest for married
men and women aged 25-44, who were employed full-time with
children at home," the official agency said.
</P>
<P>
"More than one in three of the women in this group (38 percent)
reported they were time-stressed -- the highest percentage of any
group," the agency added.

<HEADLINE> Rare Ancient Pottery Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Four pieces of a rare form of
pottery were recently unearthed in the suburbs of Xi'an, the
capital of northwestern Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The relics include two Buddhist figures, both 75 cm tall, and
two animals, each 55 cm tall, one with the face of the man and the
other with the face of the lion, which would have been placed
outside a grave to ward off evil spirits, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The design and glaze colors of the relics indicate they were
likely made in the early period of the Tang Dynasty (618-907),
they noted.
</P>
<P>
The newly-found pieces are not as colorful as the famous Tang
San Cai pottery, which is well-glazed with three colors, and are
covered with a very thin layer of ceramic glaze, which
demonstrates a crude technique, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese pottery dates back to the Neolithic Age (8000-2000 BC).
The earliest Chinese pottery was often red, brown, and grey.
</P>
<P>
The greatest advance came in the Tang Dynasty when potters made
further contributions to the production of painted porcelain. Tang
artists created beautiful simple monochrome porcelain finished in
tints of burgundy, blue, and celadon. They also produced the
famous figurines of people and horses in these three colors that
are widely admired in the modern world.

political solution to the ethnic crisis and the abolition of the
Executive Presidency, the release said.

country so as to face the challenges of globalization. It
accordingly calls on the organized working class and progressive

BERLIN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Germany has been advised not to
ignore a resurgence of Nazism following a recent ceremony marking
the 61st anniversary of Kristallnacht, or the "Night of Broken
Glass."
</P>
<P>

bitterness and reflection because of the persecution of the Jews.

"Germany should stand together to guard against the resurgence
of ultranationalism and racism," said Andreas Nachama, president

Mikhail Gorbachev, in Berlin for the ceremony for the breaching of
Berlin wall, attended the assembly.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Imports to Supplement China's Energy Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to
experiment with the use of imported natural gas, but will only use
it as a supplement to the national energy supply, according to a
chief economic official.
</P>
<P>
China's energy industry will be built upon a domestic supply of
fuel, stressed Zhang Guobao, deputy minister in charge of the
State Development Planning Commission (SDPC), in an address to the
Sino-IEA Conference on Natural Gas Industry held here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang was focusing on the prospects of China's natural gas
industry, and the government's policy in this area.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the nation's demand for natural gas will
have a big rise in the next century, and the proportion of natural
gas in China's total energy consumption will also increase.
</P>
<P>
China is formulating a plan on using natural gas and expanding
exploration projects. The government is researching pricing,
taxation and financing of the natural gas industry. Meanwhile, the
development of coal bed methane is getting more attention, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's policy to widen overseas cooperation in
the industry, and mentioned two projects --the imports of
liquefied natural gas in the southeast coast areas, and the trans-
national gas pipeline.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China, which holds abundant coal and water
resources, will emphasize the development of renewable energy such
as water, nuclear and clean coal, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongwu, director of the State Petroleum and Chemical
Industry Bureau (SPCIB), also spoke to the group. He said China's
proved natural gas is only about five percent of the estimated
reserve and there is great potential for further development.
China plans an output of 25 billion cubic meters of natural gas by
2000, and 80 billion cubic meters by 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that China has a natural gas reserve of 38
trillion cubic meters, with 29.9 trillion onshore and 8.1 trillion
inshore. Eighty percent of this reserve is in Sichuan, Chongqing,
Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang in west China and the
East Sea.
</P>
<P>
Gas pipelines in the nation total 12,000 km, and networks exist
in Sichuan province and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The conference, scheduled to close today, is jointly hosted by
SDPC, SPCIB and the International Energy Agency (IEA). IEA Deputy
Executive Director William Ramsay is also present.

<HEADLINE> Moldovan Government Voted Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Moldova's current cabinet has
resigned en masse after a no-confidence motion was passed in
parliament Tuesday, according to a report reaching here from
Moldova's Capital of Chisinau.
</P>
<P>
Of the 101 deputies in the parliament, 58 voted for the motion
against government, which was put forward last Friday by the
Moldovan Party of Communists (MPC), the only opposition party and
the largest in parliament, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the Moldovan constitution, the current government will
continue in a caretaker capacity until a new prime minister is
named by the president, probably within 10 days. But the
parliament must then vote to confirm the appointment.
</P>
<P>
The government has been undergoing a hard time with the
parliament since Prime Minister Ion Sturza, 39, came into power in
March. Last Thursday, it gave the parliament an ultimatum, asking
it to pass a factory privatization plan as well as a revised
budget bill of this fiscal year within 12 days. Otherwise, the
government will resign, said the report.
</P>
<P>
But the parliament rejected the government's proposal the next
day followed by a no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
The MPC, allied with the Christian Democratic Popular Front of
Moldova which has broken away from the current ruling union and
some independent deputies, is expected to form a new government,
which will be the eighth one since Moldova announced independence
in August, 1991, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Moldova said that the unstable domestic political
situation will harm the reform process and hinder the inflow of
foreign investment in this former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund has made a decision to
infinitely suspend its loans to Moldova after the country's
parliament turned down the privatization plan.

NANJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A theme park all about cars
will be built in the automobile industrial center of Yangzhou, a

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 9 (Xinhua)-- On the tenth anniversary of the
razing of the Berlin Wall, German leaders Tuesday called for
closer integration between east and west Germans, and east and
west Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the day at the Bundestag, the
Lower Chamber of the German Parliament, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said the toppling of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989,
provided Germany and Europe with "a second chance."
</P>
<P>
The collapse not only led to German reunification, but peace in
Europe, said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"Ten years after the destruction of the Berlin Wall, Europe may
not be divided any more, but there does exist a 'welfare gap'
between the European Union and its eastern neighbors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved much together. To our common goal of
achieving equal living standards in the east and west, there is
still a long way to go, but we know that we can achieve it jointly,
" said the chancellor.
</P>
<P>
German President Johannes Rau also urged all Germans in the
west and east to work together "for our common future."
</P>
<P>
Attending Tuesday's ceremony were former U.S. President George
Bush, former Soviet Union President Michail Gorbachev, and former
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

<HEADLINE> UN Forces Should Honor Commitments to Kosovo: Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He also urged the UN Security Council to guarantee a strict
observance of its resolutions relevant to Kosovo to assure the
security of all residents and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the remark in a declaration issued after his
meeting with Sergei Lavrov, Russia's Ambassador to the UN,
according to reports from the official Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said the NATO-led international force in Kosovo (KFOR
and the UN Interim Administration Mission (UNMIK) have been
grossly violating the relevant UN resolutions, which have led to
the worsening of terrorism, murder and genocide in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Bernard Kouchner, UN special representative for Kosovo, along
with other representatives from international organizations, took
an indulgent attitude to these crimes, he added, calling them "
accomplices of ethic Albanian criminals."
</P>
<P>
"This is a unique example since the founding of the United
Nations that mass crimes and ethnic cleansing are being conducted
under the auspices of the United Nations," Tanjug quoted Milosevic
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also said that all decisions against the spirit of UN
resolutions, in particular the decision to transform the
dismantled illegal Kosovo Liberation Army into Kosovo Corps,
should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav president pointed out that his country has honored
all its commitments to the UN resolutions and the UN forces should
also live up to their promises.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the Russian envoy said the international
community must strictly abide by the obligations contained in the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244.
</P>
<P>
KFOR has agreed to let the Yugoslav army and police return to
Kosovo in two or three months. However, the opportunity is not
ripe at the present time, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Lavrov arrived in Pristina on Sunday for a two-day visit
to the Yugoslavia's war-torn province. He has met with UNMIK chief
Bernard Kouchner and Commander of the KFOR peacekeeping force
General Klaus Reinhardt.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban's Deputy
Foreign Minister Mulla Abdul Jalil will hold talks with Pakistani
Foreign Ministry officials here Wednesday to seek Pakistan's help
ahead of imminent U.N. sanctions, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S.-sponsored resolution in the U.N. Security Council,
adopted unanimously last month, urged the Taliban to extradite the
alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden for trial by November 14.
</P>
<P>
Mulla Jalil, heading a Taliban delegation, is currently in
Pakistan for talks with officials of various ministries on a host
of issues.
</P>
<P>
This is the first high-level Taliban delegation visiting
Pakistan since the military takeover on October 12 in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Jalil is likely to meet Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar
and other senior officials at the Foreign Office to review
bilateral ties. The Taliban will seek Pakistan's help to deal with
the possible U.N. sanctions on Afghanistan, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have offered to hold talks with the United States
on the bin Laden issue but Washington has rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
There has been no significant change in Pakistan's Afghan
policy so far and Taliban supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar has
said political changes will not affect relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Sattar, the new foreign minister of Pakistan, Monday said
Pakistan will "study very carefully" the U.N. Security Council's
resolution that proposes sanctions on Afghanistan if the Taliban
fail to hand over bin Laden for trial by November 14.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Security Council resolutions have a binding force but
we will have to study them carefully and keep in view practice of
members of the United Nations," the foreign minister said at his
maiden news conference.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is among the three countries which recognize the
Taliban regime as the legal ruler of Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Australians Fight Pollution of Dog Droppings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A new weapon has been
developed to cope with dog droppings in cities in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Dog droppings pollute public spaces in many Australian cities
and constitute a chief complaint of residents and a chronic
trouble.
</P>
<P>
In the second biggest city of Melbourne, dogs deposit an
estimated 90 tons of excrement a day, roughly the same amount of
sewage generated by a town of 90,000 people, the Age reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Councils across Melbourne have had employed a combination of
fines and incentives to cope with the problem. Dog owners are
fined 0.32 to 32 U.S. dollars if they are caught not cleaning up
after their pet or with an unrestrained dog outside designated
areas. Intransigent owners are even threatened by droppings DNA
testing. However, the problem remains to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
The city of port Phillip of Melbourne will use Spanish dung
beetles as a fresh troop to attack the pollution and is to deploy
2,000 of the beetles early next year.
</P>
<P>
Australian native dung beetles are not up to the job and they
are reportedly only coping with more demure excretions.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish species were imported in the 1960s and have been
working in rural areas and the country for some time to resolve
cattle and sheep droppings.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Shifts More Factories Outside City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing
is moving more of its factories to new sites outside the city.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of relocation should help reduce pollution in
the city, according to Huang Qian, vice-director of the Program
and Investment Division of the Beijing Municipal Industrial Work
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Those who resist face harsh penalties from the municipal
government, the official was quoted as saying by today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The relocation of factories was aimed at freeing up to eight
million square meters of land in the city within five years. This
will bring the proportion of city land occupied by industry down
from 8.74 percent to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The latest official statistics show that Beijing has 783
factories within the fourth ring road, occupying a total of 28.34
million square meters of land.
</P>
<P>
The effect the relocation will have on pollution will be seen
in five years, particularly as factories will become more modern
and environmentally friendly.
</P>
<P>
"As far as industrial pollution is concerned, we expect to cut
smoke by 52 percent, air-borne dust by 73 percent, sulfur dioxide
emission by 51 percent, and the amount of chemical oxygen in
sewage by 68 percent," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Non-Oil Exports Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's non-oil exports
are expected to drop from 40.9 billion U.S. dollars last year to
only about 39 billion dollars this year, according to Director
General for Foreign Trade Djoko Moeljono.
</P>
<P>
"Noticing that the condition has not changed much, Indonesia's
non-oil exports this year may not improve," Djoko was quoted by
the Antara News Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, Indonesia's
non-oil exports from January to September this year reached only
28.5 billion dollars, down by 9.11 percent from 31.3 billion
dollars in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The non-oil exports in the period made up 81.3 percent of the
country's total exports, 2.78 percent lower than a year ago, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's non-oil exports in September, meanwhile, were
recorded at only 4.49 billion dollars in value, down by 2.34
percent from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
"A drop in the September export value has given a picture that
half of the export-oriented real sectors were unable to recover in
addition to having difficulty in the financing of exports," said
Sugito Suwito, chief of the Central Bureau of Statistics.

<HEADLINE> China Drafts Rules on Pesticide Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China is drafting rules and
considering other measures to regulate the pesticide market and
prevent poisoning among vegetable consumers.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture is establishing fast-track
inspection centers nationwide to check vegetables that might bring
pesticide contamination into marketplace, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the ministry, more than 10,000
consumers in China have been poisoned directly or indirectly by
pesticide-borne toxins, and several thousand had died from the
contamination.
</P>
<P>
To keep pesticides away from consumers, the nation must better
inspect its market-bound vegetables, said Li Benchang, an official
with the ministry's institute for the control of agrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
"The new rules will guide the supervision work," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
China's use of farm chemicals averages 250,000 tons a year.
They have saved 30 million tons of grain every year and stopped
pests or disease from claiming more than 400,000 tons of cotton
and eight million tons of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Most pesticides used for vegetables today meet standards
published by world health and food organizations, the official
noted.
</P>
<P>
Vegetables containing highly toxic ingredients will be banned,
and anyone who sells them will be punished, he said.

MANAGUA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan police
confiscated an arsenal of arms, which the owner admitted Tuesday
will be sold to Colombia's right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
Roger Ramirez, a Nicaraguan ex-police chief, confessed the fire
arms had been sold to two people belonging to paramilitary groups
in Colombia.

<P>
On Saturday evening, in a dwelling belonging to the father of
Ramirez, the police discovered 197 AK-47 rifles, two RPG-7 mortars,
two sub-machine guns, ammunition and RPG-7 rocket launchers among
other pieces.
</P>
<P>
The ex-police chief revealed that the arms were obtained after
the election defeat of the Sandanista Movement in 1990.
</P>
<P>
"The amount I was to receive for the arms was symbolic. I was
going to join the armed struggle in Colombia. I was to take
control of a battalion of the Colombian paramilitaries", said
Ramirez, who was police chief before 1993 in the Atlantico Sur
Autonomous Region (RAAS).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua)-- Beijing residents are invited
to discuss a draft rule protecting public security volunteers
beginning Tuesday through November 29.
</P>
<P>
The rule was drafted to better support and encourage justice-
motivated heroism within a legal system, to promote the perfection
of the system protecting and encouraging public-spirited people.
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents are invited to offer advice through letters,
phone calls, or e-mail. A group of municipal law makers and
government officials will work on all suggestions and add
reasonable and feasible ones to the draft rule which will be
submitted to the standing committee of the Beijing municipal
people's congress.
</P>
<P>
Beijing started to publicly commend public-spirited residents
in 1992. Nearly half of the people cited got injured or even
handicapped when they voluntarily helped others seeking justice,
according to a spokesman of the standing committee of Beijing
municipal people's congress.
</P>
<P>
Without laws to go by, awarding and protecting public security
volunteers were not standardized and therefore these heroic people
were not well protected in the way they deserved.
</P>
<P>
The draft rule will help solve difficulties confronted by
public security volunteers in their medical expenses and work and
living situations. The draft consists of five chapters and 25
articles.

<HEADLINE> U.S Says Unmoved by Taliban's Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Tuesday that it would not back away from imposing sanctions by a
warning from Afghanistan's Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has told the Taliban to hand over
Saudi-born Osama bin Laden, who Washington alleged had
masterminded bomb attacks at U.S. embassies in Africa, before
November 14, or it would impose sanctions on the country.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Taliban's supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, sent
a letter to "the people of the United States," warned of
"surprises" if Washington does not end "hostility" toward the
Taliban movement and the sanctions are carried out.
</P>
<P>
"If you do not take a step in this direction... once again you
will face earthquakes and storms from God's side, and then you
will be surprised... what is coming to you, and you will not be
able to do anything about it," Omar said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. wants to impose sanctions upon us, it must be
known that God is on the side of justice and no one can challenge
God," he said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department official confirmed it had received the
letter and said its "threatening tone is provocative."
</P>
<P>
"We ... will not be deflected from our common goal of
bringing Osama bin laden to justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. intelligence official believed the letter was "trying to
convey a somewhat ominous tone." "We always take these things
seriously," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Considers U.N. Vote as Great Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe
Perez Roque Tuesday said the result of a United Nations vote
celebrated on the same day was a great victory for the island over
a Cuban project to lift the U.S. embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, in the voting over the
resolution project, Cuba has, since 1992, received on an annual
basis in the U.N. General Assembly 155 votes in favor, while there
have been only two against (U.S. and Israel), and eight
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Roque said on the National Radio News that Cuba has "massive
backing from the international community for the Cuban resolution
for the lifting of the blockade maintained against the island by
the U.S. government for the last 40 years."
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that in spite of the fact that the United States
tried everything to guarantee that Cuba would not gain another
victory this year, the overwhelming part of the international
community came out against the policy of the genocidal blockade by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
He also indicated that the result of the vote constitutes a
crushing defeat for the United States, which must look on with
shame as the international community, once again backs the Cuban
resolution and rejects the political blockade.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Alarcan, president of the National Assembly of Popular
Power in Cuba, spoke Tuesday in the U.N. General Assembly, to
reiterate the position of the Cuban government on this issue.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Authorizes Extradition of Drug Trafficker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian Supreme
Court Tuesday authorized the extradition of Jaime Lara Nausa to
the United States for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
After the favorable decision of the high tribunal,
corresponding at present to Colombian President Andres Pastrana
came the formal authorization of the extradition of Lara Nausa.
</P>
<P>
Lara Nausa will become the first Colombian to be extradited to
the United States since the Colombian Congress reformed in
December 1997 the Constitution, thereby permitting the extradition
of Colombian nationals, previously prohibited since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Accused of being a member of the so-called Bogota Cartel, Lara
Nausa was captured last January. Earlier he was imprisoned in the
National Penitetiary of La Picota, in the Colombian capital, from
where he was transferred 15 days ago to the installations of the
Headquarters of the Judicial Police and Investigation.
</P>
<P>
The magistrate, Jorge Gomez, president of the Penal Tribunal of
the Supreme Court, announced that during the next few hours there
will be a press conference in which details of the verdict will be
made public.

NEW YORK, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell mostly
on profit-taking Tuesday before the Federal Reserve meets on the
monetary policy next week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 101.53 at
10,617.32. The blue chip index rose 137.41 points in the past four
sessions.

The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 19.04 at
3,124.93 following the seven consecutive records. The index rose
268.75 points in the past seven tradings.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell as investors pulled money out of the market to lock
in profits from the strong gains only a week before the Federal
Reserve meets in Washington on whether or not to raise the
interest rates for the third time this year to battle inflation.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft stocks continued to fall as investors remained

online retailer announced plans to sell home improvement goods,
computer software and a wider array of video games.

<HEADLINE> Duo Play Down FA Cup Axe Fear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- English soccer clubs Leeds
United and Manchester City have played down the talk that they
could be thrown out of the FA Cup because of their involvement
with BSkyB.
</P>
<P>
Claims that the two clubs could be in contravention of FA Cup
Rule 30 because Rupert Murdoch's corporation holds a 9.1% stake in
the Elland Road outfit and last week secured 9.9% of the shares at
City, have been dismissed amid fears of yet more disruption to the
world's most famous knock-out competition.
</P>
<P>
Football Association chiefs will seek clarification of the
situation but have stressed they do no anticipate a problem, and
officials from Leeds and Manchester City are confident that they
will not fall foul of the rule book.
</P>
<P>
Rule 30 states that no individual or organization can maintain
an influence in the financial, commercial or administrative
functions of two competing clubs.
</P>
<P>
Leeds secretary Ian Silvester said: "We can assure everyone
concerned there will be no conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
"BSkyB have no management control in the day-to-day running of
Leeds United Football Club. Their only interest is in the PLC."
</P>
<P>
Silvester's view was matched by that of Chris Bird, chief
operating officer at City.
</P>
<P>
"We have been in negotiations with BSkyB now for a couple of
months and the deal was finalized last month," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hendry Vows to Prove Fitness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Scotland captain Colin Hendry
has vowed to prove his fitness ahead of the Euro 2000 play-off
with England at Hampden Park this weekend.
</P>
<P>
There were fears the Rangers defender might be forced to
withdraw from the squad with a knee problem, but Hendry is
determined to play a part in at least part of the double header.
</P>
<P>
Scotland manager Craig Brown will monitor Hendry's progress
throughout the week with the player confident his shortage of
match practice will not count against him.
</P>
<P>
Brown plans to offer a further update after training at the
National Stadium, but speaking ahead of his squad's first session
ahead of the England clash he had encouraging news.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There has been no change since yesterday and I would
hope after the training session later we will be able to confirm
all three of our doubtful players are available."
</P>
<P>
Alongside Hendry there are concerns over his Ibrox colleague
Barry Ferguson, who has a rib problem, and Hearts' striker Gary
McSwegan, whose hamstring is failing to respond to treatment.
</P>
<P>
But the focus on Tuesday was on Derby-bound Hendry and he said:
"More than anything I'm battling against the course of nature, but
I'm still hopeful I'm going to make it.
</P>
<P>
"I know I cannot let my heart rule my head and I won't take a
risk if I don't feel right. Yet if I'm fit enough I'd like to
think I can do a job for my country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Owen to Partner Shearer, if Fit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- England soccer manager Kevin
Keegan has revealed that Michael Owen will partner Alan Shearer
against Scotland this weekend - if he can prove his match-fitness
in the build-up to the Euro 2000 play-off.
</P>
<P>
The England coach has never wavered from his publicly-expressed
conviction following the World Cup that Owen and Shearer would be
his first-choice strike partnership.
</P>
<P>
However, just as before England's three previous games, a huge
question mark still surrounds Owen's match-fitness - and that
could open the door for in-form understudy Andy Cole, while Kevin
Phillips also lurks in the wings.
</P>
<P>
The England boss, who will not publicly name his line-up until
just before Saturday's kick-off, must also decide between David
Seaman and Nigel Martyn in goal as well as whether to play wing-
backs or a back four.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "It's really a case of if Michael's fully fit then
there has to be a place in the England side for him because he
gives you something.
</P>
<P>
"You saw what happened against Belgium. Suddenly the defenders
went back another five or 10 yards because they're scared about
the pace he's got. That helps other players.
</P>
<P>
"But you can't ignore the things that have happened either. You
have to keep it in perspective.
</P>
<P>
"What's happened between the World Cup and now is that the lad
has been out for a while, he has missed a few games and he has
gone out again.
</P>
<P>
"If you talk about him being 100% by Saturday, then in himself,
yes I think he will be. He's a young lad and he's very fit.
</P>
<P>
"But if you're talking about being match-fit then that's where
your slight doubt comes in because he hasn't played that many
games," he said.

LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson said Tuesday that he believed a lasting peace was within
the grasp of the politicians in the province.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process is at a crucial stage. I believe now that we
have it in our grasp to map out the series of steps and changes
capable of achieving an unbreakable peace," he said in a speech in

</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to the efforts of main rival leaders, David
Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Gerry Adams of Sinn
Fein, which is the Irish Republican Army's political wing, saying
they and other party leaders had shown "the courage to see the
others' point of view in the interests of peace.".

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.S. Internet
visionaries and scholars, backed by major online companies and
foundations, announced Tuesday the creation of a think tank to
study the Internet and society.
</P>
<P>
With a budget of 3 million U.S. dollars for the first year, the
Internet Policy Institute (IPT) will employ well-known experts and
scholars to research subjects ranging from the role of the
Internet in privacy to the Internet's impact on taxation and
health care, said the new think tank in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet is surrounded by noise, hype, rumors, marketing,
IPOs, and the hopes of starry-eyed start-ups," the statement
quoted Jim Barksdale, former Netscape CEO and co-chairman of the
institute, as saying, "but there is very little hard data on which
policymakers can base critical decisions that will determine the
future of the new medium and how it affects society."
</P>
<P>
The IPT's first research project will examine the Net's impact
on the growth rate of productivity, its influence on specific
industries, its market barriers and the implications of antitrust
and regulatory policy.
</P>
<P>
Its first publication will be intended to brief the next U.S.
president about the Internet and "its transformative impact on
society."
</P>
<P>
Despite its corporate backing, the institute contends that it
won't be a mouthpiece for the high-tech industry.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Adopt New Currency to Promote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The National Assembly of Angola
(ANA) Tuesday approved a new currency, Kwanza (KZ), as a
substitution for the present currency Readjusted Kwanza (KZR), to
facilitate commercial transactions.
</P>
<P>
The current market exchange rate of the KZR is one dollar for
5.4 million KZR, with the highest face value of the notes being
five million, equivalent to less than one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
With an aim to resolve the problem of "counting zeros before
paying," experts in the National Bank of Angola (BNA) are
currently discussing on how to "cut zeros" by reforming the
monetary system, Governor of the BNA Aguinaldo Jaime said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jaime, the reform will do way with six zeros from
the KZR notes for creating the new Kwanza, with the five million
KZR note equivalent to five KZ and one million KZR note equivalent
to one KZ.
</P>
<P>
New monetary units, such as 100 KZ note, 50 KZ note,10 KZ note,
five KZ note and one KZ note as well as the coins of five KZ, two
KZ, 0.5 KZ and 0. 1 KZ, will also be created for replacing the KZR
notes, which went into effect in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The use of the new currency KZ is believed to be more
convenient for the accountants of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The reform work shall be done gradually, Jaime said, adding
that the government will not confiscate or expropriate the current
notes from the citizens because the two systems of currencies will
be in parallel circulation until May 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The governor emphasized that the introduction of the new
currency is not aimed to stabilize the country's economy but to
help the country out of an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Since June 3 this year when Angola started the system of
floating rate, the KZR has devaluated from the official price of
1:710,000 in exchange for U.S. dollar on June 2 to 5.4 million KZR
for one U.S. dollar on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In order to help the fast-devaluating KZR, BNA chose to
intervene in the exchange market on September 14 by selling a
massive volume of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
However, the Angolan government gave up the efforts on June 3
and cancelled the fixed rate of exchange. But the policy was
compromised by the impasse in the battle-field and the
deteriorating economic situation.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Resolved to Combat Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government Tuesday
warned it would no longer tolerate acts of lawlessness, brigandage
and criminality being perpetrated in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Vice President Atiku Abubakar said after a meeting of the
National Council of States on national security that the country's
law enforcement agents have been put on alert following the spate
of violent clashes, particularly in the southwest and the Niger
Delta plagued by violent ethnic clashes and protests.
</P>
<P>
The warning came a day after reports that seven policemen,
abducted earlier in the week by Ijaw youths in Odi town in the
southeastern part of the country, have been killed.
</P>
<P>
The killings were reportedly in retaliation for the killing of
Ijaws in recent clashes in Ajegunle, a suburb of the country's
commercial capital Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Atiku said the killing of policemen, the second of its kind
this month by Ijaw youths in the area, went beyond rationality and

lives and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Branding such people as terrorists and agents of
destabilization, Atiku said that the government, which came into
office after the May 29 inauguration, has the capacity to deal
decisively with troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
"Democracy does not diminish the capacity of the government to
deal decisively with hoodlums, arsonists and terrorists," he said
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people in the delta to desist from their campaign
of violence to enable the government to implement its development
programs for the area.

<HEADLINE> German Judicial Expert Criticizes Krenz Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A German law expert Tuesday spoke
out against the human slaughtering verdict by a court in Leipzig
against Egon Krenz, the last leader of former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
The conviction Monday is "irritating and judicially false,"
said Uwe Wesel, law professor at the Free University Berlin.
</P>
<P>
At an interview published in Tuesday's Koelne Stadt Anzeige
newspaper, Prof. Wesel called the judicial proceedings against
Krenz and other East German leaders "the justice of the winner."
</P>
<P>
Krenz was sentenced to six-and-a-half years' imprisonment by
the Federal Court in Leipzig.
</P>
<P>
Judges said Krenz, then politburo member of the Socialist Unity
Party of Germany, ordered soldiers to shoot people trying to
escape to the West across the Berlin Wall during 1985 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
Also verdicted were Guenter Schabowski and Guenther Kleiber,
both politburo members of the party in then East Germany. The two
will face three years' imprisonment each.
</P>
<P>
"Have they really done anything that led to the shooting? The
answer is no," Wesel told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"It has long been a general measure for soldiers to deploy
weapons to protect the border of a country. The soldiers would
have shot those people dead even without any mandate," said the
professor.
</P>
<P>
"Under the Reunification Treaty, their behavior must be judged
both by our federal law and by the law of former East Germany, but
our judges have not paid any attention to the latter at all," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure there would have been completely another verdict if
the case had been judged by any international court," said Wesel.
</P>
<P>
Krenz's lawyers also said the persecution reflected the West's
triumph in the Cold War. The acts of another country, the then
East Germany, could not be judged by today's German law, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Krenz and other defendants said they would appealed to the
European Court.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Announces Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus, who guided the
agency through the turbulence of the Asian currency crisis,
announced Tuesday that he will step down early next year.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus had two years left in his third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
"Personal reasons of which I did not even want to hear,
particularly as we were in the midst of the Asian crisis lead me
to this decision -- a decision I would have never thought would be
so hard to take," Camdessus said in a statement he read to
hundreds of IMF employees hastily assembled at IMF headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said he planned to leave in mid-February after the
agency's 24-member executive board has selected a successor.
</P>
<P>
By tradition, the IMF has been headed by a European while its
sister lending agency, the World Bank, is headed by an American.
</P>
<P>
"This is, I think, the right time... it is hard for me to tell
you this," Camdessus said. "The world economic outlook allows us
to anticipate favorable trends for the world economy so I see it
as my duty now to suggest that you take advantage of these
favorable circumstances to select my replacement."
</P>
<P>
Camdessus' early departure from the job of managing director,
which he has held for 13 years, longer than any other official in
the history of the multinational lending agency, had been rumored
for some time.
</P>
<P>
A former head of the Bank of France, Camdessus, 66, began his
first term as IMF managing director in January 1987. He was
reappointed to a second term in 1996 and to an unprecedented third
five-year term in January 1997. That term would have not have
ended until 2002.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, on Capitol Hill for a
hearing on Social Security, praised Camdessus for the job he had
done during a turbulent time in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"Michel Camdessus has done an outstanding job as the IMF's
longest-serving managing director," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
Among names that have been mentioned as possible successors to
Camdessus are the current head of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude
Trichet; Italian Treasury Director General Mario Draghi; Andrew
Crockett of Britain, who is head of the Bank of International
Settlements in Switzerland; Mervyn King, deputy governor of the
Bank of England; and Horst Koehler, head of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Carbon Emissions to Continue Rising Through 2020 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Although the growth in
carbon dioxide emissions from energy use in the United States
slowed in 1998, continuing growth in energy demand is projected to
lead to rising emissions through 2020, the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its Annual Energy Outlook 2000, the EIA said that U.S.
carbon emissions are projected to increase 33 percent over 1999
levels by 2010 and 47 percent by 2020, reaching 1,979 million
metric tons in 2020, compared with 1,345 million tons in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The projections assume current laws and regulations and so do
not include any new policies or programs that might be undertaken
to reduce emissions. Through 2020, growing energy demand is mostly
satisfied by fossil fuels, as nuclear electricity generation
declines and the use of renewable energy sources grows slowly.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached in Kyoto of Japan in December 1997,
the United States and most of other industrial countries promised
to reduce their carbon dioxide and other greenhouse-gas emissions
during the coming decade to about 5 percent below 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
Although world oil prices have risen significantly in 1999,
price increases are expected to moderate in the longer-term
period, the EIA report said. In 2020, the world oil price reaches
22.04 U.S. dollars per barrel (1998 dollars), compared to 12.10
dollars per barrel in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Technology improvements in the production of oil are expected
to moderate further price increase even as world oil demand grows,
the EIA said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of declining domestic crude oil production and
rising oil demand, net oil imports continue to increase, providing
64 percent of U.S. oil consumption in 2020, up from 52 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas wellhead prices are projected to increase at an
average rate of 1.7 percent a year through 2020, from 1.96 dollars
per thousand cubic feet in 1998 to 2.81 dollars in 2020.
Technological improvements in exploration and production moderate
the growth in prices as demand, particularly for electricity
generation, increase rapidly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Panel Rejects Anti-Dumping Duty on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. International Trade
Commission (ITC), an independent panel, rejected Tuesday an
anti-dumping duty on imports of Canadian cattle, ruling against
U.S. producers who claimed they are being harmed by the
competition.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department had decided earlier that Canadian
cattle were being sold into the United States at below cost, and
U.S. packers and importers starting paying this summer into an
escrow account to cover a potential tariff of nearly 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tariff could not take effect without a determination by the
ITC that the American industry was being hurt. In a 5-1 vote, the
commission said U.S. producers were "neither materially injured
nor threatened with material injury" by the Canadian imports.
</P>
<P>
The Ranchers-Cattlemen Legal Action Foundation, a producer
group, had initially filed dumping cases against both Canada and
Mexico. The commission dismissed the case against Mexico in
January but allowed the case against Canada to go forward.
</P>
<P>
Canadian cattle accounted for 3.7 percent of the 19.7 billion
kilograms of beef that Americans consumed in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Britain Expects Draft Iraq Text at U.N. Next Week: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain expects a proposed text
for a draft Security Council resolution on conditions for easing
sanctions against Iraq to emerge by early next week from talks at
the United Nations, a report here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We're getting much closer to a composite text... which builds
on work we did, and (adds) contributions from other members," a
Reuters report quoted an official in the Foreign Office as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said diplomats from the United States, Britain,
France, Russia and China, which are the permanent Security Council
members with veto power, would discuss Iraq later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It won't be a full text (under discussion). Sections and
concepts will be discussed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Specific questions over what actions Iraq needed to take to
trigger a suspension of sanctions, and how broad that suspension
would be, might not be spelled out in the draft text and could be
left for further discussions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"No one would say now this is perfect. There are bits which
still have differences of view. Genuine negotiations are needed,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed measures would provide for the suspension
of some of the existing restrictions on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Leading European Shares Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Europe's leading shares ended
firmer Tuesday as strength in oil, telecom and drug stocks helped
markets stave off the worst effects of a steep early decline on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 ended up 0.96 percent at 6,435.5, a gain of
61.2 points, after earlier surging to a 14-week high of 6,483.1.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices rallied 23 cents a barrel, to 23.51 U.S. dollars in
London, spurred by fresh evidence of dwindling stockpiles and
hints that the OPEC cartel plans to extend its production curbs
beyond a March 2000 deadline.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco, the index's most heavily weighted component,
accounting for 8.2 percent of its valuation, climbed 5.3 percent,
while the second biggest stock, Vodafone AirTouch, rose 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
Drug firms were helped by merger speculation. SmithKline
Beecham jumped 22p to 890p while Glaxo Wellcome was up 8p at
1893p.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE Eruotop 300 finished just over half a percent higher,
at 1,376.38.
</P>
<P>
German shares ended higher, buoyed by the strong performance of
Deutsche Telekom and rumors of mergers in the German banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's Xetra Dax gained 0.83 percent, or 46.79 points, to
5,694.73, bolstered by brisk buying of index heavyweight Deutsche
Telekom after it said it planned to retain majority stakes in nine
regional cable businesses.
</P>
<P>
Leading French shares closed higher, helped by positive
corporate news and investors switching out of low-yielding bonds.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip CAC-40 closed up 2.79 points, or 0.06 percent at
4,997.56, after hitting a session high of 5057.61.

<P>
The World Food Program (WFP) is moving thousands of metric tons
of aid to the territory by land, sea and air. In addition to
supply rice and other items to inhabitants there, the WFP is
