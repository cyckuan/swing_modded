HERNANDEZ SUBJECT OF CONDUCT INQUIRY

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles City Councilman Mike Hernandez
confirmed on Friday that a panel of attorneys and former judges
will review an allegation that he sexually harassed a former aide.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, still on probation after pleading no contest to
cocaine possession last year, denied the charge. He declined to
discuss details of the case, saying it is a personnel matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything improper happened and I want to let the
(review) process take place,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators who searched Hernandez's City Hall office
shortly after his arrest on drug charges found sexually explicit
videotapes and other material.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel Department head William Fujioka, whose office received
the sexual harassment complaint, refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council voted in 1996 to create a Special Committee on
Investigative Oversight to review any allegations of misconduct
against elected city officials and department heads and decide
whether an outside firm should be hired to conduct a formal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted Wednesday to activate the panel by approving a
list of people who might serve on the reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was created after women staffers for City Councilman
Nate Holden charged they had nowhere to go, short of the courts, to
press allegations of sexual harassment against Holden.
</P>
<P>
   Holden still faces a possible trial in one of the lawsuits by a
former aide, and the city has spent more than $1 million already to
defend the councilman.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the special panel was to resolve issues earlier
before they turn into costly litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The panel will be made up of two retired judges, two law school
professors and a member of the American Arbitration Association.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group that had launched a recall drive against
Hernandez after his arrest last year failed to collect enough
signatures by this week's deadline to qualify the recall for the
ballot.

AIR BAGS NEW AUTO TARGET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The evacuation of an apartment complex Friday
because of an unexploded, stolen air bag reveals what police say is
a thriving, illegal trade in these car safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   In L.A.'s San Fernando Valley, investigators suspect there is at
least one roving gang of thieves that specializes in taking orders
from body shops and then going out to steal them.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, an estimated $50 million worth of air bags are
stolen every year, accounting for 10 percent of all auto theft
claims in 1997, double that of just the year before, insurance
industry officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a replacement for the car stereo theft of the
'80s and early '90s,'' said Julie Rochman, spokeswoman for the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, based in Arlington, Va.
``The air bags the thieves are going after are worth more than any
other item in the passenger compartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a crash, a new air bag can cost $1,000, but police
said unscrupulous body shops buy stolen ones for $150 apiece and
then charge $1,500, including the installation.
</P>
<P>
   And removing an explosively armed air bag, particularly if it is
done in a hurry, can leave a car in bad shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``When air bags are stolen, they damage the steering wheel, the
dash or cut the wiring harness,'' said Frank Tomota, a service
consultant at West Valley Toyota in Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance premiums are not expected to rise because officials
said the growing cost of air bag thefts is offset by an overall
decline in auto thefts.
</P>
<P>
   The real losers are the motorists because with every theft, they
must pay the deductible amount, arrange for the repairs and risk
driving without an air bag.
</P>
<P>
   The air bag that was found unexploded in Van Nuys on Friday is
among the 12 or so that police said are stolen every month in the
Valley. Detectives came upon it by happenstance while making an
arrest at the Royal Garden Apartments at 14625 Rayen St. About 24
people were evacuated because the air bags contain an explosive
charge that can launch its 25-pound metal casing some 80 feet,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Details about the arrest were not immediately available, but
police said they believe the air bag had been stolen, and that they
were trying to track down the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Often a group of thieves hits three or four cars on a street or
parking lot and then steals from a neighbor a week or two later,
said Detective Bob Graybill of the LAPD's auto-theft task force in
Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves almost always are filling an order from an auto body
shop whose owner is trying to cut costs to maximize the payout from
the insurance company, he said. This can include splicing, instead
of replacing, the wiring harness attached to the air bag, or in
some cases not installing an air bag at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car looks good and the customer is very happy -- and until
he gets involved in a crash again and finds out if the air bag
works or not, nobody's going to know these are used air bags the
guy jury-rigged in there,'' Graybill said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police are attacking the problem through stepped-up
inspections of auto shops to ensure owners are licensed and have
receipts for uninstalled air bags.
</P>
<P>
   By a conservative estimate, 50,000 air bags were stolen in the
United States in 1996, roughly triple that of 1993, said Ed
Sparkman, a senior manager of vehicle support at the National
Insurance Crime Bureau in Palos Hills, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   That equates to a $50 million loss to the insurance industry,
assuming the average replacement cost for an air bag is $1,000, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual rate of these thefts is believed to be much higher
since these statistics did not account for the commercial auto
market and because theft of air bags from rental cars, often by the
person renting the car, is booming, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The industry and law enforcement are now mulling over ways to
combat air bag theft by using a national registry of serial
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Auto parts stores sell anti-theft devices for drivers' air bags,
which attach to the steering wheel or special bolts that make it
more difficult for a thief to remove the safety device.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a growing problem,'' said Dave Unnewehr, a
research manager with the American Insurance Association in
Washington, D.C.

DEADLY AVALANCHE TRIGGERED BY CLIMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE and KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGMIRE _ Tired but elated after scaling Mount Rainier, guide
Tyler Forman was crossing a treacherous ice face when he stumbled,
setting in a motion a deadly avalanche that swept nine of his
companions down the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's avalanche was ``triggered by my foot,'' bemoaned
Forman, still numb from the mishap that cost the life of a client
and injured eight others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My world's been turned upside down: my foot slipped, the snow
was wet enough, and that's what triggered the slide.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby climbers spotted the fast-moving snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We yelled, and they looked up, but they couldn't move fast
enough,'' Jeff Fisher, 38, of Burnsville, Minn., said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard people screaming `help,' screaming that they were
cold, screaming that they were going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, it was like tumbling bodies and they just kept
going.''
</P>
<P>
   The likely cause of the worst accident of the climbing season
was confirmed by Chief National Park Ranger John Krambrink, adding
the findings were ``preliminary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure looks like a team may have set off the avalanche,''
Krambrink said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Nestler, an avid outdoorsman with limited alpine
climbing experience, was carried by the heavy, wet snow more than
100 feet. He was battered from the fall. Worse, he dangled from a
climbing rope for hours while icy snowmelt dripped on him from
above.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old engineer from Connecticut died of exposure
before he could be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Eight others received less severe injuries ranging from
abrasions to broken bones to hypothermia. All were treated and
released from local hospitals by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers, guides and rescuers agreed that the toll could have
climbed much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we lost an individual climber, it could have been
so much worse,'' said 28-year-old park ranger Michael Gauthier.
``Everybody acted with amazing swiftness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier was one of the first on the scene. He had been enjoying
a day off at the mountain's summit when his radio crackled at 2:11
p.m. with word of the avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier strapped on his snowboard and raced down the mountain.
Twenty-six minutes and 3,000 feet later, he was at the site about
11,000 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Nestler, who died on the mountain, was among a group of 16
students on a five-day climbing seminar lead by seven guides.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Nestler's death, there was little finger pointing Friday
among park officials and experienced mountaineers, who understand
the risks of a sport played out in the thin mountain air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountaineering has inherent risks,'' said Lou Whittaker, the
legendary climber whose company, Rainier Mountaineering Inc., was
hired to guide the student climbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the lure of mountaineering _ the risks. How
can you justify it? The mountaineer can justify it, but it is
difficult on others,'' Whittaker said at a news conference Friday
at Paradise, at the peak's 5,400-foot level.
</P>
<P>
   Krambrink, chief ranger, added: ``We know we will continue to
have accidents unless we ban people from the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened on the mountain was mostly luck _ good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   The climbers had sunny, warm weather. But that followed bad
weather. In the 24 hours before the avalanche, an inch of rain fell
at Paradise, said Garth Ferber of the Northwest Weather and
Avalanche Center. It fell as snow in the higher elevations.
</P>
<P>
   The sun warmed the snow, making it unstable. ``People look out
and see that the weather is good. But what they have to consider is
what has occurred in the recent past,'' Ferber said.
</P>
<P>
   The group of Rainier Mountaineering climbers had reached
Disappointment Cleaver _ a rock outcropping that separates two
glaciers _ around 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers often advise first-time climbers to be off the most
dangerous parts of the mountain by early afternoon. On a warm day,
the snow on the higher elevations of the mountain gets soft and
conditions can become more hazardous.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's temperatures may have soared to as high as 80 degrees
above the 10,000-foot level, Krambrink said.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker, however, dismissed timing as a crucial issue. There
is no hard and fast rule for when to be on a particular part of the
mountain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche occurred when most accidents happen on the
mountain _ as climbers descend. Typically, they are tired, and
having successfully reached the top, they may also have let their
guard down, said Gus Bush, operations chairman for Tacoma Mountain
Rescue, a volunteer group that helped in Thursday's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   But Ephram Ulmer who was on the mountain Thursday with another
of Whittaker's groups, saw no carelessness. ``I respected the
mountain when I went out,'' said Ulmer, 51, of Columbia, S.C. ``And
there is no one in any of groups that did not.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the climbers managed to scramble away from the onrushing
show. Others were not so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw people go right by me. The avalanche was just a few feet
from hitting us,'' said another member of the class, Mark Hunter,
39, of Westport, Conn. ``I heard yelling, and we thought we might
not make it.'' Hunter said he still has not decided whether he'll
return to climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Guide Ruth Mahre, 25, of White Pass, was at the upper end of one
of the ropes. Below her, Nestler dangled. She secured the rope from
which four climbers clung to Disappointment Cleaver:
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody moved it was all over for all of us. ... I wasn't
the heroine, I was just lucky,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know you're flying off rocks, and the snow is shoving
you down the mountain and you can't get an anchor and people are
pulling you down, you don't think you'll live,'' Mahre said.
</P>
<P>
   But now some good luck was coming the climbers' way. The rope
that held Mahre, Nestler and others was holding, even though the
slide had frayed it.
</P>
<P>
   From about 800 feet above, another climber saw the slide and
pulled out her cellular telephone to alert the rangers. It was 2:11
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five years ago, you wouldn't have had cellphones, and
one of the victims would have had to climb down to Camp Muir for
help,'' said Gombu Nawang, who has climbed the mountain dozens of
times.
</P>
<P>
   In another stroke of good fortune, rescuers already were on the
mountain to help a climber who had broken a leg in a slide on Kautz
Glacier early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The weather remained clear as they worked to secure ropes.
Helicopters could get in, but none of the injured had yet to be
rescued.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the window of good weather had vanished, the rescue
had begun. Climbers were pulled up or rescuers helped them up by
descending on other ropes, Gauthier said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers saw Nestler go in and out of consciousness. By 7 p.m.,
the exposure and the freezing water that had dripped on him for
hours had taken his life.
</P>
<P>
   The injured came off Rainier on Thursday night. Those who
escaped the avalanche got to Camp Muir before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Lori Cowen, one of the climbers who witnessed the slide, said
she was still shaking. ``My biggest fear about this trip was an
avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back up but not for a while. You think, `Is it worth
the risk?' But I love the mountains. It's more dangerous to drive
on the freeway than to climb Mount Rainier.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who were injured hurried down the mountain Friday,
arriving at Paradise tanned but physically and emotionally spent.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, other climbers _ these eager and rested _ were preparing
for their chance to climb Rainier. About 10,000 people try to scale
the mountain each year.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bills of Highland, Utah, was preparing to climb Rainier.
Much of it is so easy, he said, it's like hiking. It makes you
forget how dangerous it can be, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, Bills, 43, was bringing a cellular telephone
with him to reassure his wife that he was okay.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche did not affect disabled climber Pete Rieke of
Pasco, who is using a hand-cranked snow vehicle to climb Rainier.
His party was camping at the mountain's 13,000-foot level Friday
and planning to resume the ascent at about 10 p.m., when
sun-softened snow begins to firm up again.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was another sunny day, even prettier than Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even on pretty days the best climbers are at risk in an
avalanche, said climbing school owner Whittacre, citing the 1979
death in a Rainier slide of veteran mountaineer Willi Unsoeld, one
of the first Americans to climb Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rainier has a lot of secrets,'' he said. ``We're always
learning, but it is indifferent. We love it but it doesn't
necessarily love us.''

HOPE FADES FOR MAN MISSING IN BLAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN PETTERSON and OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAYSVILLE, Kan. _ Hopes for the survival of the last missing
victim of a grain-elevator explosion faded Friday, the fifth day of
rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who had remained upbeat all week found it tough to
avoid the specter of a grim conclusion to the round-the-clock
search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is really against us now,'' Ken Cox, division chief of
the Sedgwick County Fire Department, said Friday evening. ``It's
hard for us to be as optimistic as we were before.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat was against rescuers too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really affected our speed,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers had to limit their activity in a tunnel to less
than an hour at a time. Temperatures near 100 degrees, and the
workers' heavy, protective clothing, made conditions dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   And as rescuers grimly noted, those oppressive conditions would
threaten any worker still alive and trapped in the facility.
Medical personnel regularly checked blood pressures and heart rates
of rescuers to make sure they were within acceptable limits.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 p.m., two rescue crews were working toward each other in
the tunnel, and were within 30 feet. They could see one another
through the debris.
</P>
<P>
   After shoring up holes in the ceiling, Cox said, the rescuers
begin removing the grain in the remaining, unexplored area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have the void places we expected to be in there,''
Cox said, suggesting there was less chance that the missing man
might have been able to find a pocket of air to help keep him
alive.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, authorities were weighing the risk to the
rescuers' safety against the chance of finding the missing worker
alive.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the remains of three other workers have been pulled
from the tunnel beneath the DeBruce Grain elevator, southwest of
Wichita. An explosion, believed to have been caused by grain dust,
made a shambles of the huge storage complex.
</P>
<P>
   With the two workers who were found dead immediately after the
explosion, the death toll now is five. Five other explosion victims
have been hospitalized. One is in fair condition, two are critical
and two are serious.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Duarte and Jose P. Ortiz died instantly. Services for Ortiz
are scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Victor Castaneda and Raymondo Diaz-Vela were
identified this week after they were removed from the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   One other body was found in the tunnel but had not been
identified Friday. Rescuers did not release the name of the man
thought to still be in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Still unaccounted for are Noel Najera and Howard Goin.
</P>
<P>
   As the week dragged on, fewer family members maintained their
quiet vigil at Oatville Elementary School, about 1 miles from the
blast site.
</P>
<P>
   And optimism at the school became harder to find.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross coordinator Mike Wemmer, who has spent time with the
families at the school, said he could see the change. The mood in
the school started out somber, broken occasionally by hopeful news,
he said. That hope later faded.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no sign the rescuers were ready to quit. On Friday
afternoon, a staffer with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
team stopped by a Wal-Mart store to load up on 20 boxes of menthol
and cherry throat lozenges to relieve dryness caused by the grain
dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty caustic stuff after a few days,'' said Jim
Gruenberg, a member of the agency team.
</P>
<P>
   And they weren't ready to let go of the chance that the last
worker could be alive in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there's always hope,'' said rescue worker Bret Davis
shortly after he climbed out of the stifling tunnel and ended his
12-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   Another worker, Dennis Clark, said if he could send a message to
the family of the missing man it would be ``not to give up hope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to recover a victim,'' he said. ``We have
no way of knowing if this person is alive or dead. If they are
alive, we certainly want to get them out and get them taken care
of.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take whatever comes. If we find a deceased
victim, that's what we have to deal with.''

GORE MAKES FOURTH SEATTLE VISIT IN 18 MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY and LARRY LANGE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore delivered a barrel of political
tributes and bounty of favorable economic statistics Friday night
during a very political visit designed to boost the reelection of
Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president ventured onto a controversial subject only
once with a call to defeat Initiative 200 on the November ballot, a
measure that would eliminate the state's affirmative action
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's diversity can be our edge in a global economy ...
Initiative 200 here in the state of Washington puts all that at
risk,'' Gore told about 300 people at a Democratic reception.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit was his fourth to Seattle in 18 months. It followed
closely the pattern of a visit in December, with an event at a
public school followed by the day's true business _ political
fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was sealed off from the press. He answered no
questions and did not talk about such controversies as the Justice
Department suit against Microsoft or President Clinton's upcoming
trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Clinton, who never loses a chance to work rope lines or
greet bystanders, Gore was driven without pause from one
invitation-only event to another.
</P>
<P>
   One incident marred Gore's smooth passage to a town meeting on
education issues at Hazel Valley Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran Seattle motorcycle officer, Allen Carr, was injured in
an accident. Gore's motorcade did not stop, but the vice
president's ambulance did provide quick treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit an oil patch and just wiped out: He suffered a broken
arm, a broken leg and a broken rib. He's talking and I hope he'll
be fine,'' said Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, who had his van pull out
of the motorcade to talk to the injured officer.
</P>
<P>
   At the elementary school, Gore touted a program championed by
Murray _ legislation intended to increase the number of public
school teachers by 100,000 nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to bring the ratio of
student-to-teachers down so each teacher can spend more time with
students,'' Gore declared.
</P>
<P>
   Gore moved around in the sweltering gymnasium, asking the
grammar school students why it is important to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Timothy Marshall. I like books because you can make
fine movies from the words,'' one student told Gore.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of more than 60 people, most of them neighborhood
residents, gathered across the street to watch Gore enter and leave
the school. The crowd was peaceful and relaxed, mostly curious.
</P>
<P>
   Two local members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue
brought several large signs. The largest showed an aborted fetus,
others carried various anti-abortion slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Several who watched Gore's performance inside the gym said the
vice president seemed livelier than they imagined. They said he
struck a chord discussing education and getting pupils to talk
about the school's special ``Success for All'' reading program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like him,'' said Kerry Pierce, mother of two children at the
school. ``I think he's gotten some life in the last couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Wheeler of Olympia, who works in a state literacy program,
said she was surprised to see a more animated Gore than the one
she'd heard about. ``I think he's very good-looking and I loved how
he handled the kids. I was rather surprised ... he does have a
reputation for being maybe a little stilted.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of those who emerged from the talk said they'll likely
vote for Gore if he's a presidential candidate in two years,
believing his commitment to education, more teachers and smaller
class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally am better off now than before (Gore and Clinton)
took office,'' said Dennis Pierce, Kerry's husband. ``I think he
would carry it on.''
</P>
<P>
   The better-off message was carried by Gore to appearances at a
$200-a-person reception and $2,500-a-person Westin Hotel dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was playing the role of presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He lampooned Republicans, saying: ``The other party is in such
dissaray that the right hand doesn't know what the far right hand
is doing.'' He touted creation of 350,000 jobs in Washington since
the administration took office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Gore effused over Gary Locke as ``the single most effective
governor in the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also celebrated Washington, saying he ``long ago fell in
love'' with this region's mountains and oceans and Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The administration boosted its environmental record earlier
yesterday, as Clinton extended by 10 years a ban on oil drilling
off most of the American coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Local conservation and wildlife groups had hoped that Gore would
use his visit yesterday to announce a policy requiring the use of
escort tugs for laden oil tankers operating in the Strait of Juan
de Fuca.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is expected to endorse the tug escort
requirement, but Gore was mum on the subject last night. Instead,
Gore spoke of the environment in nonspecific terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party stands for a balanced approach that will
protect the environment and grow the economy,'' he said. ``Don't
ever tell me those two goals are incompatible.''

PREPARING FOR WORST, GIULIANI IS TO BUILD BLASTPROOF SHELTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs for inserts)  (lh) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having tamed squeegee men and cabbies, murderers and
muggers, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is now bracing for a whole other
order of urban treachery and cataclysm by building a $15.1 million
emergency control center for his administration _ bulletproofed,
hardened to withstand bombs and hurricanes and equipped with food
and beds for at least 30 members of his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The ambitious project, which will sprawl over 46,000 square feet
of one of the smaller buildings of the World Trade Center complex,
will be big enough to accommodate at least 50 different city, state
and federal agencies and will allow them to coordinate response to
disasters from the smallest sewer explosion to the largest nerve
gas attack.
</P>
<P>
   Among its amenities will be back-up generators in case of power
failures, a storage tank with enough water to last at least a week
and technology that will include a secure ``red'' phone for the
mayor and video-conferencing capabilities so that he can talk and
see the president of the United States if necessary. Construction
is to begin soon, and city officials said it would take several
months to complete the center, plans of which were approved by the
City Planning Commission in December and obtained Friday by The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   On the 23rd floor of the building, the center will be across the
street from the famous Twin Towers, the target of a terrorist truck
bombing in 1993 that left six dead, wounded more than 1,000 and
shattered the notion that U.S. cities were immune to such attacks.
But city officials said the location was ideal since the building
lacked a basement and was already well fortified because it houses
the New York bureau of the United States Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the facility is ``not a bunker'' meant merely as a
safety haven for the mayor, Jerome Hauer, head of the city's Office
of Emergency Management, asserted that New York City's emergency
response system had become a model for other cities and that the
planned center was a natural next step in keeping that lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something the city has needed for a long time, a
state-of-the-art center with a sophisticated communications system
that is survivable so the city can continue to function,'' he said.
``If there is a citywide blackout, a hurricane, a blizzard, this is
the facility that will allow us to keep working, to make sure that
people are not in jeopardy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Colleen Roche, a press secretary to Giuliani, said that
financing for the command center would come out of the fiscal 1999
capital budget. But the news of the center's construction troubled
many in city government, especially City Council members like
Sheldon Leffler, chairman of the Public Safety Committee, who said
they found out about the project only after being contacted by a
reporter. Some said the existing command center on the eighth floor
of police headquarters had functioned admirably during storms,
blackouts and a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche denied that the financing was done in secret. ``It's
clearly laid out in the budget for anyone to inspect and review,''
she said. ``I would point out that there are some members of the
Council who claim to have not known that they voted for a tax
increase either.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Kathryn Freed, whose district will house the new
center, questioned whether the investment was prudent when the
mayor has threatened to cut financing for centers for the elderly,
city hospitals and services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the mayor is screaming and yelling about pork
in city government and trying to cut city services that keep
libraries and day care centers open, it seems bizarre to me that
the city would be putting nearly $16 million into a rented space
that the city doesn't even own,'' Ms. Freed said. ``Making a $16
million improvement to another guy's building? I sure hope this is
a 99-year lease.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that the $1.4 million annual lease on the
space ran for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The facility will be built at 7 World Trade Center, a 47-story
building chosen both for its proximity to City Hall and One Police
Plaza and because of its sturdy nature, Hauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on condition of anonymity, law-enforcement officials
said that the new center would be bulletproof, able to withstand
the shock of some bomb blasts and have a ventilation system that
could be closed in the event of a biological or gas attack. They
said telecommunications in the center would also be able to
withstand the blow of a nuclear assault.
</P>
<P>
   Hauer confirmed that the center would also withstand
150-mile-an-hour hurricane winds and function during extreme
flooding. In case of disaster, he said, more than 100 top
representatives from government, law-enforcement and utilities will
be organized in modules, connected by high-tech computer systems
and almost invincible telecommunications lines and guided through
video-screens, computer mapping and a global positioning system
that can pinpoint the proximity of disaster to every sewer line,
water main and subway tunnel in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The center would have a place to cook and enough beds to allow
at least 25 residents to sleep, including top city officials and
members of Giuliani's family, said a city official, speaking on
condition of anonymity. Hauer said there would be enough food for
at least seven days and enough fuel to power the facility through a
four-day blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor would have a bit of privacy as well because the center
will be built with a separate area where he can meet with select
commissioners, a room with a pullout couch for him to sleep and a
shower separate from the others. While the furniture would be
ergonomically designed and the lighting selected to prevent
headaches, Hauer said that the center was more austere than it
might sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very cautious about what we were spending,'' he said.
``We wanted to be comfortable because this is a stressful
environment, but nothing is opulent.'' And while there would be
room for the mayor's family to visit, Hauer said the mayor's bed
would be a couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a citywide blackout, we want to make sure that it
is easy for people to work and that includes making it easy for
them to eat and use the bathroom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it would only be in alert mode during crises, Hauer
defended the price of the facility by saying that when the city was
running smoothly it would be used to host training seminars and
conferences for emergency response.
</P>
<P>
   But the plans are far more elaborate and expensive than those of
other major cities. Philadelphia saved money by placing a similar
center in an existing fire building, which has its own water well,
and spent only a few hundred thousand dollars on communications
equipment and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which has had to contend with disasters ranging
from mud slides, forest fires and earthquakes to riots, converted a
4,000-square-foot bomb shelter built as part of the civil defense
program in the 1960s for $1 million in 1980. Since then, the city
has updated the computer and communications equipment for $2
million, according to Dean Levenworth, a city spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the mayor's Office of Emergency Management is at 100
Church St., where it shares space with two other mayoral agencies.
The Emergency Operations Center, which is staffed in all
emergencies, rests a few blocks away in Police Headquarters, in a
cavernous room lined with giant overhead television monitors and
city maps.

GIULIANI'S PRESS AIDE TO STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Colleen Roche, the press secretary to Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, announced Friday that she planned to resign but would
remain for several months while she finds another job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the most rewarding, challenging and important
job that I've ever done,'' Ms. Roche said, ``and a very difficult
job to leave. I'm doing it to spend more time at home with my
family, my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche joined the administration in 1995 as a deputy press
secretary, and was appointed to the top job two months later.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche is responsible for the mayor's daily dealings with the
press, a tense job that during Giuliani's administration has often
involved presenting unpopular positions, deflecting unwanted
attention and helping to prepare quick responses to politically
charged questions.
</P>
<P>
   She runs the mayor's daily news conference, interrupting
reporters to say, ``Next topic!'' or ``Two more questions!''
</P>
<P>
   Her days at City Hall often begin at 7 a.m., and end late at
night when she stops by the press room to say good night to any
reporter who might remain.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roche, 40, had been the spokeswoman for the district
attorney of Manhattan, Robert Morgenthau. She said she hopes to
remain in public relations, only in the corporate sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wildest dream would be to do something involving sports,''
she said.

HEALTH CASE AT STATE HOSPITAL SPURS CONTEMPT QUERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pima County's presiding judge on Friday ordered a special
prosecutor to determine if state health officials should be charged
with contempt of court for refusing to accept patients sent by the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael Brown's order came after two Pima County
defendants were turned away from the Arizona State Hospital, which
is supposed to restore them to mental competency so they can stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The health department last week announced that it had no more
room for ``restoration-to-competency'' patients and wouldn't accept
any more because of overcrowding and dangerous conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The health department says it will have a plan by Wednesday to
deal with the overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   The department will use the ``Alamo'' building, which had been
reserved for its new sexual-predator programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo plan initially had been rejected because the building
was supposed to be used only for sexual predators and because it is
far away from the hospital's other units, Dr. James Allen, director
of Arizona Department of Health Services, wrote to Brown this week.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the best option in terms of time and disruption to
patients, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told the court we are working on this as quickly as we
can,'' said Brad Christensen, public information officer for the
health department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about a matter of days here, not weeks or
months.''
</P>
<P>
   When the state announced last week that it had no more room at
the hospital, there were 66 patients in two units licensed for 48
patients. There are now 56, Christensen said.
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Brown says that state law requires that criminal
defendants be committed to the State Hospital if they need
residential treatment and are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and Jack Silver, the hospital superintendent, refused to
comply with the statute and honor valid court orders, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   In Maricopa County, one defendant who should have gone to the
State Hospital was held at the county jail for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But jail officials say they don't have the space or the staff to
take restoration patients on a regular basis. Presiding Superior
Court Judge Robert Myers said Maricopa County would wait until at
least Wednesday to see if the state comes through on its plan.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said the courts, the health department and the Governor's
Office would discuss long-term solutions next week.
</P>
<P>
   The health department has been roundly criticized for not
talking with judges beforehand about the closure. Hospital
officials knew for months that the units were getting overcrowded
and didn't do anything about it, judges said.
</P>
<P>
   One solution may be for the state to pay the counties to house
the patients, Allen told Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The interim move to set up the Alamo unit will cost about
$250,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a stopgap solution and there has to be a
permanent solution. We might need some help from the Legislature.
We have an open-ended mandate but not an open-ended budget.'' &QL;

ANGELS SHUT DOWN RANGERS, 5-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Perhaps one at-bat best captured the essence
of last night's events at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers first baseman Will Clark strode to the plate with two
outs and runners at first and third base in the seventh inning.
Anaheim Angels left-hander Greg Cadaret, who in his career had
surrendered four hits in as many at-bats to Clark, induced an
inning-ending ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Another threat denied.
</P>
<P>
   That would be commonplace during the first-place Rangers' 5-1
loss to the Angels, who moved within 1 1/2 games of the American
League West's best.
</P>
<P>
   Also commonplace: The inability of right-hander John Burkett to
keep the ball in play.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (4-6) surrendered three home runs, including a two-run
shot to right fielder Garret Anderson with two outs during the
Angels' three-run seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it before and I'll say it again: Two-out base hits
are what win and lose games,'' said Clark, who went 0-for-3 with
runners in scoring position. ``Anderson hit his two-run homer with
two outs. We didn't get our two-out base hits, and that's the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position. Five
of those at-bats occurred with two outs. That can be attributed to
the fact that the Rangers' leadoff hitter in each inning reached
safely only once.
</P>
<P>
   Angels right-hander Omar Olivares (4-2) made it a difficult
evening for the Rangers, who entered this game leading the league
with a .326 batting average with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares surrendered six hits and issued five walks during his 6
2/3 innings, but the right-hander utilized a hard, sinking fastball
and an effective changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of opportunities early, but it seemed like it was
always with two outs,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``He
didn't give us many pitches to hit, and I think we got ourselves
out a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer provided the Rangers their lone run
with a two-out, first-inning home run on a 2-1 changeup from
Olivares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omar did a hell of a job,'' said Joe Maddon, the Angels'
interim manager while Terry Collins serves his eight-game
suspension for the June 2 bench-clearing brawl with the Kansas City
Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers mounted their final threat during the seventh
inning. Olivares issued consecutive one-out walks to second baseman
Luis Alicea and Greer, and Alicea advanced to third on a ground
ball by right fielder Juan Gonzalez. That brought Clark to the
plate, and Maddon summoned Cadaret from the bullpen despite Clark's
past success against the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cadaret has been hot,'' Maddon said. ``He's been throwing the
ball extremely well. I'm a numbers guy, but sometimes you have to
go against the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret retired Clark and the next six hitters, including three
on strikes, for his first major-league save since Aug. 7, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers fell to 8-10 during their past 18 games, and their
lead over the Angels has slipped from six to 1 1/2 games during
that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' Clark said of the remaining three games to
be played in this series, ``but it's not like it's life and
death.''

JAZZ SURPRISES BULLS, 83-81
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Postpone the coronation. Suddenly we've got a
competition.
</P>
<P>
   With the table set last night for the Chicago Bulls' sixth
championship and Michael Jordan's fond farewell, Karl Malone and
the Utah Jazz crashed the party with a stunning, dramatic, 83-81
victory before a shocked crowd at United Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the hunt, still kicking,'' Jazz point guard
John Stockton said. ``Now we can go back home, where we've fought
so hard to be all season.''
</P>
<P>
   The win, made possible via surprising production from Utah's
Antoine Carr (12 points) and a dismal night from Chicago's Scottie
Pippen (2-of-16 shooting), pushes the best-of-seven Finals back to
Salt Lake City for Game 6 tomorrow night. The Jazz, which got a
breakout, 39-point performance from Malone, trails 3-2 but has the
final two games, if necessary, at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five games have been decided in the final 40 seconds
by five points or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went riding with Todd the state trooper and we went out and
weighed some 18-wheelers at the weigh station,'' said Malone, who
hit 17 of 27 shots after a below-par first four games. ``You guys
can laugh if you want, but I got totally out of the city, totally
away from basketball, and it cleared my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   No team has rallied from a 3-1 deficit to win the Finals, but
the Jazz has a chance because the Mailman finally delivered.
Malone, who averaged 20 points before last night, was so dominant
with turnaround jumpers and drives to the paint from the post that
the Jazz didn't have to use the pick-and-roll play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those nights for him,'' Bulls coach Phil Jackson
said. ``Everything he shot went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Nursing a four-point lead in waning seconds, Malone fouled
Chicago's Toni Kukoc on a 3-point attempt. But Kukoc, who scored 30
points on remarkable 11-of-13 shooting, missed the third free throw
to leave Utah leading by two. Carr, who started the second half
after not playing much at all in the series, knocked down two free
throws with 10.4 seconds left for an 82-78 lead. After Kukoc
drilled another 3-pointer and Jeff Hornacek hit one of two free
throws, Chicago had a final shot to win or tie. But with 0.8
seconds left, Michael Jordan took an inbound pass and lofted a
desperation 3-pointer that failed to hit the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most exciting thing in sports to see who will fight,
and tonight we fought,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. ``Our backs
are still to the wall, but we've earned a chance to play at home
again, and that's all we can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Utah's victory is a major travel inconvenience or a
permanent roadblock to Chicago's shot at history remains to be
seen, but for certain the Jazz was successful in scrapping a
planned celebration at Grant Park in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be hard. Nobody wanted to make this trip,''
Pippen said. ``We had our chance, but now we've got to win one on
their home court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan scored 28 points, but made only one of seven shots in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would have loved to have won it here, it would have been a
great scenario,'' Jordan said. ``But when we get on that plane,
we've got to be very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 76-71, Jordan missed two shots and Pippen missed a tip.
After grabbing the rebound, Carr hit a crucial 18-foot jumper that
just beat the shot clock and pushed the lead to seven. A Kukoc
3-pointer and two free throws by Jordan edged Chicago within two,
but Malone drilled an 18-foot baseline jumper over Rodman to make
it 80-76 with 53 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   During the timeout, a commercial urging Chicagoans to
``Celebrate with Dignity'' was met with almost deaf silence.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Finals finally began with easily the
series' most intense 12 minutes. Trading two double-technical fouls
with the Bulls, the Jazz pounded the ball to Malone on the low left
block with positive results. He abused Luc Longley and began to
find a rhythm against Dennis Rodman with 17 points as Utah rode its
slow, physical style to a 59-55 lead in the fourth quarter. After a
lousy 30-point first half, the Jazz produced their highest-scoring
quarter of the series with 29 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scratched out a 36-30 lead after the lowest-scoring
first half in Finals history. The ugly 24 minutes, featuring 28
combined baskets and 24 turnovers, broke the mark of 69 set by
Syracuse and Fort Wayne in 1955. At one point in the second
quarter, they combined for bad passes or violations on seven
consecutive possessions. After Malone dunked to tie the game at 26,
he elbowed Rodman for a technical foul that sparked a 6-0 Bulls
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had its chance to build a lead early, but somehow
trailed 18-16 after the first quarter. Tight and tentative, Bulls
other than Kukoc missed their first 12 shots and didn't produce a
basket in the first 10 minutes. Utah, however, missed wide-open
jumpers, failed to convert two fast-break opportunities and
committed five late turnovers. Kukoc's 13 points kept the Bulls
within one, and Jordan's first jumper with 12 seconds left gave
them a two-point lead.

MALONE PUTS CELEBRATION OF DYNASTY ON ICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Hold the career retrospective. Along with the
Champagne, ``Michael: An Appreciation,'' must wait another day.
</P>
<P>
   After a torturous week in the city of the Bulls, John Stockton
and Karl Malone spoiled the dynasty's party Friday night at the
United Center and finally get to go home to a hero's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   They and the Utah Jazz staved off Michael Jordan in Game 5 of
the National Basketball Association finals, an 83-81 victory that
forces the Chicago Bulls to return to Salt Lake City and play in
front of the league's most hostile crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 is Sunday night at the Delta Center, and while Utah
trails the four-of-seven-game series by three games to two, it is a
nice rowdy place to finish the season. Game 7, if necessary, is
scheduled for Wednesday in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   With bubbly on ice and amid the pageantry befitting what would
be their sixth title in eight seasons, the Bulls took a 36-30 lead
at halftime and appeared on the cusp of a blowout. But Stockton
(six points, 12 assists) and Malone (39 points, nine rebounds)
finally showed the resolve that had been lacking in their three
straight losses to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc scored 30 points. Jordan ended with 28 points.
Scottie Pippen had six points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. Kukoc
had 17 points by halftime, hitting all seven of his shots and
helping the Bulls overcome a lackluster start. Malone was Utah's
only weapon early, but in the second half the Jazz regrouped and
decided to play its best 24 minutes of the series. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Malone's jumper made the score 80-76 with 53.3 seconds left.
Jordan had a chance to send the home crowd into a state of delirium
with eight-tenths of a second left, but his high-arching 3-pointer
off one foot at the buzzer hit nothing but air. The Jazz bench went
wild, piling onto the court like kids let out for recess.
</P>
<P>
   In the most dominant big-game performance in 13 years, Malone
made 17 of 27 shots. Stockton had 12 assists and made sure he got
the ball to his All-Star teammate when Malone asked.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was good, but certainly not great. He hit only 9-of-26
shots from the field in 45 minutes and often was trapped in midair
with nowhere to go in the second half. Kukoc led Chicago with 30
points on 11-of-13 shooting, while Pippen struggled mightily from
the field (2-of-16).
</P>
<P>
   The game did not end until the buzzer, thanks to a clutch
3-pointer from Kukoc with 5.5 seconds left. Stockton quickly found
Jeff Hornacek downcourt to take four seconds off the clock before
he was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   But Hornacek made only 1-of-2 free throws, giving Chicago one
last shot with 1.1 seconds left. After both teams took timeouts,
the Bulls took the floor, but Jordan was unable to hit the
3-pointer before the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Carr had seemed to put the game away for the Jazz with a
jumper from the top of the key with 1:56 remaining, a shot that
made it 78-71.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls cut the lead to two with 1 minute 13 seconds left
on two Jordan free throws. Kukoc had nailed a 3-pointer with 1:47
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton was masterful, threading passes between defenders and
orchestrating the halfcourt set as he had not since Game 1. When he
was not working a two-man game with Malone on the left side, he was
ducking underneath Pippen and Jordan along the baseline and finding
Carr for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was no less impressive, scoring on a scoop layup with
3:50 left that gave the Jazz a seven-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kerr, who broke a million Utah hearts in Game 6 last
season with a clutch jumper in the final seconds, opened up all the
old wounds. He buried two 3-pointers to keep the Bulls within
striking distance early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Steve Kerr dropped in a 3-pointer to begin the
fourth quarter, slicing Utah's lead to one point, the Jazz would
not relent. Stockton drove the lane and distributed pretty passes.
Malone kept nailing everything he put up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With 8 minutes 53 seconds left, the Bulls were in trouble.
Jordan had been thwarted on one end as he went to the basket, Bryon
Russell had just rattled in a dunk off a nice pass from Stockton,
and Utah led 68-60.
</P>
<P>
   After absorbing his share of criticism all week, Malone began to
carry the Jazz on his shoulders as he had all season. He made five
consecutive medium-range jump shots. Over Dennis Rodman. Over Luc
Longley. For once, it did not matter who was guarding him.
</P>
<P>
   He had 30 points after three quarters, and the Jazz had a 59-55
lead entering the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Malone opened the second half by showing patience and tenacity
for one of the few times in the series. Inserting Antoine Carr into
the lineup to begin the second half did not hurt Jerry Sloan's
Jazz, either.
</P>
<P>
   Carr got underneath Jordan's skin by putting a forearm into his
chest on several forays to the basket. It was enough to make Jordan
begin mouthing profanities at the veteran forward as they ran
downcourt on one possession.
</P>
<P>
   If Utah was finally showing emotion, it was also triggering
Jordan's temper. Given his history of creating artificial
motivation to pull his team along, that might not be considered
smart basketball. But the Jazz had to try something.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan's club was awful in the first half. Malone and his meek
teammates missed point-blank shots, blocked each other out for
rebounds, committed 13 turnovers and basically looked as if they
felt there was no shame in losing to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that is how the last four games proceeded before the
second half. The Jazz played as if it did not want to upset anyone,
other than Sloan.
</P>
<P>
   Utah never showed the confidence that led the team to a
four-game sweep of the Lakers in the Western Conference finals.

MALONE REPAIRS TARNISHED IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Karl Malone hammered and banged away Friday night in a
frenzied attempt to repair a legacy in the making. His legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was desperate to alter an image that was surfacing in the
National Basketball Association finals when Game 5 arrived at the
United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although his career has sparkled with achievements, he was being
seen as a superstar overwhelmed by the moment, and psychologically
overmatched by the one counterpart he has never been able to equal,
Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   He exited with the knowledge that he put the questions about his
passion and heart and mentality to rest for a night. He scored 39
points in the 83-81 victory by the Jazz to put off the celebration
plans of the Bulls. Down 3-2 in the four-of-seven-game series, the
Jazz will go home for Game 6 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's sudden impact left the Bulls to double-team him,
leaving Antoine Carr open on the perimeter to hit crucial jumpers
down the stretch. If Malone wasn't going to score, someone else
was.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was his turn, Malone turned and faced a
foul-troubled Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Then he lofted a high jumper over Rodman's glowing head with
53.3 seconds left in the game to give the Jazz an 80-76 lead over
the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   So often in the series against the Bulls, Malone appeared frozen
in the fourth quarter of each game. He had been frustrated by
Rodman, and hesitant in the face of double-teams.
</P>
<P>
   To see Malone take on Game 5, with his reputation and his team's
life in this series on the line, was to view a man breaking out of
his bulky shell.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, he was taking jumpers over Luc Longley, who had been
ineffective in stopping Malone. Before the game, Malone was making
54 percent of his shots over Longley.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rodman who was the bane of his existence. He had held
Malone to 32 percent, and had virtually shut him down in the fourth
quarter. Malone's passive ways against Rodman changed drastically.
He was staring Rodman down as he launched fade-aways over him.
</P>
<P>
   The truest show of Malone's rebirth occurred in the third
quarter. Malone, who had been called for a technical for elbowing
Rodman earlier, lowered his shoulder and drew a foul on Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rodman's fourth. Malone hit two free throws with 2
minutes left in the third, and gave the Jazz a 54-50 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was doing his best to change the tone of this series. And
repair the perception of Malone as a big-game failure. Malone
stepped into the pro world as a backwoods unknown from a school
appreciated more for its women's program, Louisiana Tech. So his
craving for recognition began more than a decade ago. Although he
has found comfort living in the mountains and protection playing in
small-market Utah, Malone has longed for the kind of attention and
respect the glamour stars in the NBA receive.
</P>
<P>
   This I'll-show-'em yearning, this chip-on-the-shoulder attitude
has served him well the last 13 years. He has made sure everyone
knows his name. But in the face of this series, when he really
needed that underdog's edge to push him to the ultimate proof of
greatness _ an NBA title _ Malone may have done himself in by
entering the NBA finals as a favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had the home-court advantage. Malone and his partner,
John Stockton, had the confidence and fearlessness of cliff divers.
Many were picking them to beat the Bulls. With his second chance in
two years, Malone was expected to overcome the mystique of Jordan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Jazz lost Game 2, gave up home-court advantage, and then
evaporated under the might of the Bulls with a 42-point loss in
Game 3. The moment Game 4 went by with only three fourth-quarter
shot attempts from Malone, this former MVP had shrunk beneath the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 was a chance to be the underdog again. No one thought the
Jazz had a chance to steal the celebration from beneath the Bulls.
Just a day before Game 5, Malone did not seem to believe it either.
The weight of his task seemed to be wearing on Malone, when he
began to talk freely about the what-ifs of his situation. What if
Malone, who will be 35 in July, walks out of the finals and does
not get another chance? After all, the Lakers are bound to grow up
at any moment. What if the window is closing?
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been saying that for how many years now? Six, seven?
Five, for sure,'' Malone said. ``I'm stubborn enough that I don't
believe that stuff. I think you all age us enough, and we still go
out and play. We are supposed to be older and have lost a step. I
don't buy any of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, playing this game for as long as we have and not to
have a ring, those things happen. I don't know if failure is the
right word. I don't think you measure success in your career by not
winning a ring. I'm not going to sit here and tell you there won't
be an empty spot if it happens, because there will. But we're not
conceding anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone was expected to run right over Rodman and bait him into
foul trouble. Malone was expected to lead the Jazz with such force,
the Bulls were expected to be on the brink of elimination before
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said, since I've been in the league, if you put a
star other than Michael Jordan out there, most superstars cannot
come through in the clutch,'' Rodman said. ``I would rather foul
Karl Malone than Michael Jordan down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the way Malone wanted to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 was an attempt to change that perception.

SORRY, FANS, BUT NBA IS ABOUT TO SPOIL THE PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What a perfect time to laud the miracle of a man named
Michael Jordan, whose will and skill have driven the Bulls toward
six NBA titles in a single decade and given Chicago dibs on a
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that topic must be shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, please turn your attention to the only real meaning of
sports in the '90s: Free agency. Labor wars. Who's going to get
their hands on the biggest piece of the money pie.
</P>
<P>
   And, by the way, have a nice summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the oodles-of-money world of the NBA, the time has come again
to fight over who gets paid. It is time for a power play _ one that
will again expose the mega-riches of a sports industry against the
inevitable backdrop of suspicion and greed.
</P>
<P>
   (Please refer to the 1994 baseball labor war.)
</P>
<P>
   In front of me is a list of NBA players who will be free agents
as of July 1, the day owners are likely to commence a lockout. It's
a long list, dotted with the likes of Scottie Pippen, Jayson
Williams, Stephon Marbury, Damon Stoudamire, Ike Austin and Antonio
McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this list tops out at an eye-popping 187 players. Ten
of the 30 NBA franchises _ Sonics, Rockets, Bulls, Spurs, Suns,
Magic, Pistons, Sixers, Timberwolves and Hawks _ have more than
two-thirds of their rosters up for free-agency.
</P>
<P>
   So remember: Buy those season tickets soon, folks.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost impossible to believe that a league so stable and
so glamorous is infected with so much uncertainty. But this is the
reason why certain NBA players are manipulating a public-relations
campaign that damns owners for being so cheap and wishy-washy: Why
spoil the party?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfair to the fans and it's unfair to the game,''
Jordan said about the upcoming NBA labor battle.
</P>
<P>
   Owners say they are paying players 57 percent of revenues. This
translates into $167 million more than the 48 percent minimum that
owners had expected to pay when a deal was signed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, owners have proposed phasing out the ``Larry Bird
exception,'' which allows teams to exceed the salary cap to retain
their own free agents. Because of this exception, Jordan was paid
in excess of $30 million by the Bulls this season.
</P>
<P>
   The players have rejected this proposal, and Jordan and other
top stars are threatening a boycott of the World Championships this
summer, should a lockout occur.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Jordan deserved every penny of his $30-plus million,
since the Bulls, NBA and NBC each can thank Jordan for their
incredible wealth and popularity.
</P>
<P>
   However, to state the obvious, Jordan is mind-bogglingly unique.
He is so far more valuable to his team, league and network than any
other NBA star that Jordan is in no way a representative spokesman
for his fellow NBA laborers.
</P>
<P>
   What big-ticket NBA players like Jordan, and to a lesser extent
Patrick Ewing, refuse to acknowledge is that the impact of the
existing collective-bargaining agreement is crushing the league.
</P>
<P>
   While every player should have a right to determine his ``fair
market value,'' the inevitable outcome is that the market overpays
and it can't erect a ceiling to help stem costs.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, ticket prices skyrocket while NBA club payrolls
become an uneasy mix of haves and have-nots. For every Kevin
Garnett making $20 million a year, there's a Rex Chapman making
$350,000.
</P>
<P>
   It also is forcing teams into making drastic personnel decisions
whose ramifications easily could bring down the house. Take the
Washington Wizards, please.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, while all these NBA players talk about how
bad they want to win a ring, they are more determined in their
quest for ``fair market value.'' It is this primary business
operative that is most responsible for your franchise's inability
to retain top stars and thus contend for a title.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, you need a nucleus of two or three $100-million
players to be a championship-caliber team. The problem is, which
NBA club can consistently solve this personnel/payroll puzzle?
</P>
<P>
   It's quaint to think about dynasties. However, at what cost are
such things kept alive? In Chicago, Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf
paid upwards of $80 million to put that history-making team on the
floor this season.
</P>
<P>
   Was it worth it? Yes, because the Michael Jordan Bulls are
once-in-history unique. Reinsdorf made back his millions and more.
</P>
<P>
   The same is not true in Denver or Toronto or Vancouver or
Washington, D.C., or Minnesota, where a bright young franchise now
must decide who else to give $100 million to, Tom Gugliotta or
Marbury, without mortgaging its future into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Jordan NBA future could look bright if every NBA
all-star could be convinced that the difference between Sir Air and
them is about $28 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   We're all for the NBA stars getting their fair share. And if
what Jordan insinuates is true, that owners are making more in
licensing than they're sharing with players, then that needs to be
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   But for everyone out here in the stands and TV land who's
ultimately paying the NBA's bills, the sky can't be the limit.

   Mailman finally &QL; 
delivers the goods
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ The champagne was on ice. The confetti was hoisted up
into the rafters. The ropes were laid out to cordon off the court
for the trophy presentation. The windows of the shops were all
boarded up. The police were on standby.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Chicago was ready to celebrate. But the Bulls
weren't ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   So the Last Dance turned into a Jazz session.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone playing blue notes. John Stockton providing rhythm.
Antoine Carr on improvisational riffs.
</P>
<P>
   With a gritty, bound and determined 83-81 victory Friday night,
the Jazz took a page out of Charles Barkley's book, circa 1993, and
saved the city. And in the process might have saved the reputation
of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was confidence to Utah's game. Finally, there was
execution. Finally, there was backbone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our backs were to the wall,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said.
``When you're in that position, that's the most interesting thing
in all of sports, to see who will come out and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of fight and drive that Utah had been expected
to bring to the Finals rematch with the Bulls. This was the
fourth-quarter execution that had stamped the Jazz's 62-win regular
season and march through the playoffs until this series began.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, this was the Mailman, making special deliveries,
going postal, seeing that neither rain nor sleet nor gloom of night
could keep him from his appointed round.
</P>
<P>
   After disappearing in the fourth quarter of each of the first
four games, Malone erupted for 39 points, nine rebounds and five
assists. This was the Malone who was on a rampage in the previous
round against the Lakers, hitting his jumper from the outside with
ease and wheeling into the lane to make the Bulls pay consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when we're good, that's exactly what we do, ride
him,'' Stockton said. ``Karl is the one who has gotten us here, and
when we're playing at the top of our game, it's usually the same
old story.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up at crunch time
</P>
<P>
   But it was a far different story from the past three games when
Malone scored a grand total of only three points in all those
fourth quarters. This time, he stepped up and hit the big baskets.
This time, he didn't shrink from the spotlight but reveled in it.
</P>
<P>
   Malone listened to the criticism that has rained down on him
since the series began, and he soaked it all in. He read all of the
newspapers, and he filed away all of the words that had been
written.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he finished practice Thursday with his teammates and got
away from all the swirl and hubbub of the Finals by taking a ride
in a squad car with an Illinois state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all of you guys (media) are out there laughing at me
and the way I am,'' Malone said. ``But I don't care. I wanted to
get completely away from basketball and not think about everything
for a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got together with my friend Ty, and we went riding way
outside the city to a weigh station. We weighed some trucks. You
guys laugh, and that's what I did. I know he's going to be the most
famous state trooper in Illinois after this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what other people do on their off days, but I
wanted to change up and do something different. I've always wanted
to be, in my little world, a state trooper, so I got to ride with
one. You can laugh all the hell you want. It was a fun day for me,
and I enjoyed it. So, thank you, Ty. I wish I could take you to
Utah with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's taking the Bulls and all of the trappings of the
Chicago dynasty with him.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be denied
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz did it by beating the Bulls on the boards, slapping a
handcuffing defense on Michael Jordan (9-for-26) and Scottie Pippen
(2-for-16) and making all of the big plays.
</P>
<P>
   Malone scored eight points in the fourth quarter. Carr came off
the bench to add another eight in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bulls cut the lead to 78-76 on two Jordan free throws
with 1:13 to go, Malone came right back and stabbed in an
18-footer.
</P>
<P>
   When it was 80-78, Carr stepped up to the foul line and made a
pair with 10.4 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   And when Toni Kukoc hit the last of his 30 points on a 3-point
bomb with 5.5 seconds to go, Stockton made a clever move on the
baseline, eluded a would-be foul by the Bulls and lofted a pass to
Jeff Hornacek.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, there was drama. Hornacek made just one of two free
throws. The Bulls had a chance. Jordan took the inbounds pass. He
turned, fired. It was an airball.
</P>
<P>
   The confetti stayed up. The champagne stayed chilled. The city
stayed in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz stayed alive.

Malone comes up huge 
to keep alive Utah hopes
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ It was supposed to be the last dance for the Chicago
Bulls. But the Utah Jazz cut in.
</P>
<P>
   Any talk of retirements, breakups and the Bulls' final resting
place in basketball history was put on hold after Karl Malone
willed the Jazz to an 83-81 victory over the Bulls in Game 5 of the
NBA Finals on Friday night at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   Malone had 39 points and surprise of the night Antoine Carr had
12 points, including eight in the fourth quarter, as the Jazz cut
Chicago's lead to 3-2 in the best-of-seven series that switches to
Utah on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's win kept alive the streak of no home team sweeping the
three middle games of the Finals since they went to the 2-3-2
format.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yes, we (still) have our backs against the wall,'' Jazz
coach Jerry Sloan said. ``But at least we regained the home-court
advantage that we worked 82 games to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls were, and still are, shooting for their sixth NBA
championship in the past eight seasons. But for one night, talk of
Michael Jordan's retirement, Scottie Pippen's free agency and coach
Phil Jackson's status was drowned out by the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one loss,'' Jordan said. ``You can't let it eat at you to
where it becomes two losses. I said this is the toughest game to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   And was it a big letdown? Did Jordan have to cancel today's tee
time?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't have a tee time,'' he said. ``I anticipated
drinking so much tonight that I didn't think I'd make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan had one last chance to pull out a dramatic win for the
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   After Utah's Jeff Hornacek missed the first of two free throws,
the Bulls were down 83-81 with 1.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 1.1 seconds, I knew I was going to get the ball and nobody
knew what was going to happen,'' Jordan said. ``Everybody was
expecting a big shot. For 1.1 seconds, everybody was holding their
breath. You have a chance to determine happiness and sadness.
That's what you live for. I love those moments.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't love this one. When Jordan took the inbounds pass and
heaved a fallaway 3-pointer ahead of the buzzer, the Jazz exhaled
happily as the shot was way off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we blew an opportunity,'' Jordan said. ``But we've had
this happen before. Our job is to get past this.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no question the Jazz salvaged considerable dignity with
the tenacious, heart-healthy play it exhibited. Malone was
virtually unstoppable as he posted up for midrange jumpers, and
Carr was an unexpected boon for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said coming into this series that our guards would have
their hands full and we (big players) had to help them out,''
Malone said. ``Antoine was a big presence for us, and I think down
the stretch he was the difference. He hit a lot of big buckets for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   As did Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the criticism he (Malone) has received in these playoffs,
he put a lot of that to rest with this game,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said the strong play of Malone might also have helped the
Jazz get a level playing field regarding the officiating. Utah shot
18 free throws to Chicago's 20, a huge difference from Game 4, when
Chicago went to the line 40 times to 21 for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Karl Malone was sensational,'' Sloan said. ``And I
thought our guys stood their ground a little more in this game, and
I think when you stand up for yourself, you get a little more
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Jazz played with composure down the stretch, something
it lacked in the late going in close losses in Games 2 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   The finish was a vintage end to a hard-played, though
sometimes-ragged NBA playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Up 76-71, the Jazz just knew there was a final Bulls push
coming. Even after Carr nailed another jumper to build the lead to
seven, Toni Kukoc, who had 30 points, hit a 3-pointer with 1:47 to
go. After Shandon Anderson missed for Utah, Jordan was fouled and
made two free throws with 1:13 showing.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Utah's lead was down to 78-76. But Malone answered
smartly, rising over Dennis Rodman for an 18-footer with 53.3
seconds left to make it a four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   After that, it was a matter of making one stop against the
Bulls. And the Jazz got lucky. Kukoc was left free for a 3-pointer
after Jordan drew the double team. But Kukoc's shot was off.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Jazz couldn't score, it whittled valuable
seconds off the clock. Then, Malone made what could have been a
costly mistake when he fouled Kukoc on another 3-point try. Had the
shot gone in, Kukoc could have had a chance for a game-tying
four-point play.
</P>
<P>
   But the shot missed, and Kukoc made only two of the three free
throws, leaving Chicago down 80-78.
</P>
<P>
   Carr was fouled with 10.4 seconds to go, and his free throws
kept the pressure on the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But Kukoc hit a 3-pointer with 5.5 seconds left, and when
Hornacek missed one of his free throws with 1.1 showing, the Bulls
had one last chance, down 83-81. But Jordan's 3-pointer couldn't
create history.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had relied on Malone's 17 points in the third quarter
to go ahead by four points heading into the fourth period. Utah
also had gotten solid efforts from Carr and Hornacek.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Bryon Russell came alive. After a poor showing in the
previous three games, Russell hit a 3-pointer and got a slam to
rattle in, out and then in again with 9:01 to go, which put the
Jazz up 68-60.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls were struggling mightily, with Pippen leading the way.
A Most Valuable Player candidate in this series after four games,
he probably shot those those ideas down when he was 2-for-15 after
missing his first two attemps in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan missed with 8:40 to go, the Jazz had a chance to go
up by 10, but Malone's 16-footer was off. And while Malone was
yapping that he was fouled on the play, the Bulls quickly pushed
the ball downcourt for a Steve Kerr 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls got within three points three times, the last at 72-69
before Carr took a feed from Malone for a 16-footer and, after an
offensive foul on Pippen, Malone scooped in a bucket over Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago cut it back to a five-point game when Jordan was fouled
and hit two free throws with 3:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was about as artistic as a 4-year-old's
finger-painting effort _ only a parent could love it.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bulls fans couldn't be all that proud of the game that
might have been Jordan's last in the home arena. It took nearly the
entire first quarter before Jordan got his first basket. He scored
with 12 seconds left in the opening period, which put the Bulls up
18-16.
</P>
<P>
   That would turn out to be the higher scoring of the opening two
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   After the teams exchanged baskets to open the second quarter,
neither scored for the next 4:20. There were 15 possessions during
that stretch, and 10 ended in a turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Utah threw away the ball six times in that span, and it seemed
like a bad sign for the Jazz that Chicago went so long without a
point yet Malone and Co. could not capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Jordan began to heat up, scoring 10 consecutive points.
</P>
<P>
   When Pippen and Kukoc scored back-to-back baskets in the final
minute of the half, the Bulls had their biggest lead to that point,
36-28. Utah got a running bank shot from Anderson with 1.9 seconds
left to nose up to 30 points for the half, but the Jazz wasn't
displaying the sort of execution that would be necessary to send
the series back to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was Kukoc's show. He hit all seven of his shots
and had 17 points and four rebounds. The only blotches on his
ledger were two missed free throws.
</P>
<P>
   If the Jazz could take some consolation out of the opening 24
minutes, it was that it had kept itself in position to make the
Bulls sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The intensity level, tilted to the Bulls' side in Games 3 and 4,
suddenly became hotly contested. Malone came out in the third
quarter with obviously upgraded desire and toughness. He had 12
points in the first 8:11 of the period.
</P>
<P>
   More impressive was the job the Jazz did on defense. Chicago
shot 1-for-5 and had three turnovers during a stretch in which the
Jazz outscored the Bulls 9-1 to take a 47-43 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz kept the lead for the rest of the third quarter,
stretching it to 59-52 until Kukoc nailed a 3-pointer with 13
seconds left to make it a four-point game going into the final 12
minutes. &QL;

   Pippen's bricks help Jazz rebuild hope
</P>
<P>
   Jackson not pleased about 3-point attack
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CHICAGO _ Michael Jordan had Space Jam. Karl Malone starred in
Rockwell, an obscure western in which he played a sheriff, riding
the range while dealing out his brand of frontier justice.
</P>
<P>
   And Friday night, Scottie Pippen auditioned for his big movie
role, the lead in The Invisible Man.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who was vying with Jordan for Most Valuable Player
honors after the first four games of the NBA Finals, was missing in
action in Game 5 at the United Center, one reason the Utah Jazz was
able to walk off the floor with an 83-81 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The win pulls Utah within 3-2 in the best-of-seven series, with
the next two games in Salt Lake City, starting Sunday with Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, who averaged 20 points in the first four games, scored
just six points Friday, making only two of his 16 points and
missing all seven of his 3-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie had a night to forget from the field,'' said Chicago
coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The odd part of Pippen's shooting night is that he was guarded
by Utah's Jeff Hornacek, who stands four inches shorter than the
6-8 Chicago forward. Jazz coach Jerry Sloan made the switch to put
6-7 Bryon Russell on Jordan defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen took Hornacek into the post, where he got what looked
like easy shots _ but most rolled off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of opportunities,'' Pippen said. ``I can't say
that my shots weren't there. I tried to be more aggressive and take
the ball to the basket early on, but they (the Jazz defenders) were
getting away with a lot of fouls, trips _ whatever you want to call
them _ on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we sort of pulled away from that (physical) play and
started shooting a lot of jump shots. Nothing fell for me tonight.
I have to be much more aggressive and look to attack the basket in
the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to put the ball in the basket down low, Pippen floated
out to the 3-point line. After draining five 3-pointers in Game 4,
he couldn't find the mark on any of his seven attempts Friday, a
number that seemed to irk Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got enchanted with the 3-point line a little bit,''
Jackson said. ``I think 20 attempts (making seven) is a little much
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had hoped to nail down the championship in front of
the home fans, especially with all the speculation about management
breaking up the team.
</P>
<P>
   Local television stations were running public-service
announcements telling Chicago citizen to ``celebrate with
dignity,'' referring to riots that followed championship-clinching
home victories in the past that featured fires and brick throwing.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Pippen who launched all the bricks Friday, the main
reason the series is heading back to Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be very hard,'' Pippen said. ``I know no one
wanted to make this trip, especially the players. I'm sure you guys
(the media) didn't want to make this trip, at least you guys who
aren't from Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to do it. It's very disappointing on our part that
we have to do it. We wanted the season to end tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had 11 assists and 11 rebounds before fouling out with a
second remaining. But in a game in which the Bulls needed his
scoring, Pippen couldn't find the basket, save for a layup with 48
seconds left in the first half and a tip-in of a Jordan miss with
7:05 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a lot of distractions that took our focus away
from what we had to do tonight,'' Pippen said. ``We just didn't
come out with the same kind of intensity that we had in the last
couple of games. Tonight was a very important game for us. We
needed everything to work for us out there, but we just weren't the
aggressors out there.''

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S AS MUCH PIPPEN'S FIGHT AS JORDAN'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A year ago on a Friday night with a familiar feel,
Scottie Pippen stole the ball, secured title No. 5 and was
acknowledged by Michael Jordan in a poignant most valuable player
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said that he would keep the trophy, give Pippen the car,
and that the world should know Little Brother was all grown up, a
long way from riding the little red wagon on the Jordan gravy
train. Suddenly the question that arose Friday night was if Pippen
could actually be judged chief conductor of another Bulls'
championship run, MVP of the series, cast in the exalted position
of giving Jordan the wheels while keeping the hardware for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Pippen would say so sorry, and take the trophy and
the car and drive off as a free agent to Phoenix, as the sun set on
the Bulls' globally renowned dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be very good for my free-agency resume,'' Pippen
teased.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke too fast, shot too short and the city of Chicago
celebrated too soon. The only player who performed like an MVP
Friday night was Karl Malone. The Jazz beat the sluggish Bulls,
83-81, and got out of town alive. The next question the Bulls have
to answer is whether they know the way back to Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Malone partly atoned for Games 1 through 4 with 39 points.
Pippen shot a nightmarish 2-for-16, leaving Jordan too heavy a
burden. This time it was Jordan who sagged in the fourth quarter.
Malone, who said he wasn't interested in motivational speeches, let
his medium-range jump shot do the talking. A series that had looked
like Sinatra and Springsteen versus Simon and Garfunkel goes on,
with no one singing Where have you gone, Mailman Malone?
</P>
<P>
   If the series through four games had done anything, it was to
crystallize which noncenter ranks directly behind Jordan in terms
of impact, night in, night out. According to various opinions,
Pippen through four games was deserving of the MVP, in particular
for coming between Stockton and Malone, everywhere but in those
joint interviews that underscored their unwillingness or inability
to stand alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie's who I would vote for,'' said Bill Wennington, a lone
Bull with the gumption not to mouth party lines about tough choices
and co-winners. ``I think he's done a tremendous job disrupting the
Utah offense, and that's been the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Stockton and Malone _ original Dream Teamers, future Hall of
Famers _ had measured up like Muggsy Bogues, not only to Jordan but
also to Pippen. What does that say? Certainly not that these proud
if strangely dispassionate veterans have fooled us with screens,
rolls, smoke and mirrors, but that it's taken much more than having
the greatest player ever for the Bulls to dominate this decade.
It's taken Pippen, the unique multipurpose player of his time and
maybe all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be the best defensive player ever,'' Malone took the
time to admit.
</P>
<P>
   What's amazing is how many people this week related to Pippen's
potency as if he were some wonder drug new to the market. He has
said and done his share of dumb things through the years, but if
you went back to study the Bulls' first five titles, you would find
Pippen's long arms reaching into many a crucial moment to block a
shot, cause a turnover in the passing lane, or stretching like clay
to lay the ball up to the rim.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of pure performance, never has such a deserving second
star been so lost in a teammate's luminescence, which makes sense
because never has there been such hysteria over an athlete as there
has been with Jordan. This is the root of Pippen's long-standing
melancholy, Toni Kukoc being nothing more than a convenient
scapegoat. Big Brother Mike got too much and Little Brother Scottie
too little, and every now and then the pouting Pippen just had to
threaten to run away from home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with free agency beckoning, Pippen has suddenly achieved an
even playing field, even if he is nowhere close to Jordan's equal
in popularity. Jordan, for his part, doesn't call Pippen Little
Brother anymore. He called him ``my twin'' earlier this week. What
Jordan really believes _ he did scream at Pippen for the ball near
the end of Game 1 _ may be another story, but this is how it is now
for public consumption, for the sake of luring Pippen back because
Jordan still wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any intention of coming back here,'' Pippen said
the other day, not 24 hours after saying he might.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he said he wouldn't be going back to Salt Lake
either. He and the Bulls leave Saturday.

MLICKI, YOUNG SPARK DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave Mlicki came to Los Angeles homeless, unhappy
and confused. But after finding an apartment and comfort on the
Dodger Stadium mound, the former New Yorker is feeling in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki combined an impressive eight-inning performance in his
Dodger Stadium debut with a surprising game-winning homer by Eric
Young in the eighth inning to give the Dodgers a 2-1 victory over
the Colorado Rockies in front of 39,163 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki came to the Dodgers following a four-player trade with
the New York Mets on June 4 that included Hideo Nomo, and he
entered the game with a 1-4 record. But on this night, he allowed
just one run on five hits over eight innings while walking none and
striking out four for his first win as a Dodger. Besides pitching
his second complete game _ the first was on May 5 against Arizona _
tonight was the only time that he had lasted at least eight innings
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also gave the Dodgers three consecutive wins, tying
their longest streak of the season set May 21-23 and April 24-26.
It is also the first time they are two games over .500 since May 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a weird feeling, but it takes a couple days to
settle in,'' said Mlicki, who didn't walk a batter for the first
time in a start this season. ``I hope this is something I can build
on. It is still early and I have a lot of starts left, but
hopefully I can keep contributing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was great. I just went out there, went at them,
showed my stuff and we had some fun. That is what we did tonight.
That is the first time I had fun in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 1-1 with one out in the eighth inning,
Young walked to the plate with his last at-bat still lingering in
his mind. The Dodgers actually had Mlicki at second base with no
outs in the sixth and Young followed with a messed-up bunt that
resulted in a pop-out to the catcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers ended up loading the bases, but no one scored to
keep the game tied.
</P>
<P>
   Young came to the plate with just one home run on the season in
the eighth, April 26 against the Chicago Cubs. But he left with two
as he hit a solo game-winning blast off a 1-0 fastball from
Colorado's Darryl Kile over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't recall ever hitting a game-winning homer,'' said
Young, the leadoff hitter who is more known for stealing bases.
``I'm not going to hit too many of those. I know I can hit home
runs. But I was probably as surprised as anyone in stadium when I
hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile (5-9), who pushed his losing streak to six games, actually
had a no-hitter going through 41/3 innings. But the $5.6-million,
whose had only 13 runs in his past six starts, pitcher gave up his
first hit on a towering 430-foot homer by Raul Mondesi in the fifth
to tie the game at 1-1. Mondesi's homer was his 15th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my job to make that (one-run lead) stand up and I didn't
do it,'' said Kile, who stuck out seven and allowed five hits in
eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Mlicki was considered to have the best arm in the
New York Mets' organization. But during his time in the Big Apple,
he was a disappointment as he compiled a record of 24-29 after
joining the club in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki came to the Dodgers with jet lag and confusion on how he
should be pitching. Although the Dodgers won his first start 10-6
at Seattle on June 6, the newcomer allowed eight hits and five
earned runs in just three innings and was unsuccessful with
off-speed and breaking pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, pitching coach Goose Gregson has tried to get Mlicki
to concentrate on first-pitch strikes, be more aggressive with his
fastball, throw strikes at his knees and trust his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After the first inning on this night, Mlicki not only seemed to
take heed of those words, he reverted to the pitching style that
made the Mets fond of him at one time.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Mlicki allowed a leadoff double to Neifi
Perez. A sacrifice and two outs later, Perez gave the Rockies a 1-0
lead on a RBI-single by Larry Walker.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, Mlicki recovered to allow only three hits in the
next seven innings. Only Kile, who led off the sixth with a single,
was able to reach third base after the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the potential to be a very good fifth-day starter
here,'' Gregson said. ``Here's a guy that has four pitches, decent
command on all of them and movement on his fastball. The potential
is there to be an excellent starter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers used Antonio Osuna and Scott Radinsky in the ninth
before Greg McMichael, also acquired in the Nomo trade, struck out

   CLINTON-OCEANS (Monterey, Calif.) _ Clinton, navigating a narrow
course between environmentalists and oil companies, announced on
Friday a 10-year extension on the current moratorium on oil
drilling off virtually all American coastlines. Clinton also placed
several existing marine sanctuaries permanently off-limits to oil
exploration. The moratorium does not, however, protect any new
areas not already covered by the drilling ban first imposed by
President Bush in 1990. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-JUDGE-DELAY (Washington) _ Judge Sonia Sotomayor seemed
like a trouble-free choice when President Clinton first nominated
her to an appeals court post a year ago. But Republican senators
have been blocking Judge Sotomayor's elevation to the appeals court
for a highly unusual reason; to make her less likely to be picked
by Clinton for the Supreme Court, senior Republican congressional
aides said in interviews. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ Prosecutors looking into President
Clinton's relationship with a former White House intern are
investigating contacts between one of his senior aides and
potential witnesses shortly after the investigation began,
according to lawyers who have read a sealed legal opinion
describing the contacts. By James Bennet. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>
   ASTRO-GLENN (Washington) _ When he rockets up in October for a
nine-day ride at the age of 77, Glenn, who 36 years ago became the
first American to orbit the earth, will once more be a space
pioneer, running a myriad of geriatric medical experiments on
himself as the oldest space traveler ever. But as a retrofitted
astronaut the Democrat from Ohio will also be ending his Senate
career in a bang and a rush that he tacitly acknowledges with a
sparkle-eyed smile. By Francis X. Clines. (With photo.)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NY-BUNKER (New York) _ Having tamed squeegee men and cabbies,
murderers and muggers, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has quietly been
bracing for all manner of human treachery and cataclysms, building
a $15.1 million emergency control center for his administration _
bullet-proofed, hardened to withstand bombs and hurricanes, and
equipped with food and beds for at least 30 members of his inner
circle. By Kit R. Roane. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-MOMS (Jonesboro, Ark.) _ As more mothers of young
children run for office, they are finding that the issue of
motherhood cuts both ways with voters. By Melinda Henneberger.
</P>
<P>
   MASS-CHILD-ABUSE (Cambridge, Mass.) _ A judge ordered a new
trial for the woman who was convicted more than 10 years ago of
abusing children at her family's Fells Acres Day Care Center. In a
decision that could have implications for hundreds of child abuse
cases around the nation, Superior Court Judge Isaac Borenstein said
that the child abuse trial of Cheryl Amirault LeFave was tainted by
flawed interviews of children. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   NY-PARK-LAWN (New York) _ The Central Park Conservancy, the
private group now responsible for day-to-day management of the
park, is determined to protect the investment in the Great Lawn _
everything from 250 computer-controlled, pop-up sprinklers to more
than 2,000 new trees and shrubs to the centerpiece, 1 million
square feet of amazingly weedless grass. So it has created a new
position with a broad mandate and a grandiose title: Keeper of the
Great Lawn. By Douglas Martin. (With photo.)

   CHINA-TECHNOLOGY (Washington) _ Powerful evidence has emerged
that China has been using U.S. technology for military purposes,
taking advantage of the Bush and Clinton administrations' decisions
to encourage high technology sales in Asia. By Jeff Gerth.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIPLO (London) _ Reinforcing the NATO alliance's threat
of military action to stop the violence in Kosovo, the United
States, Russia and six other major industrial democracies meeting
in London on Friday demanded an immediate stop to Serb attacks on
ethnic Albanian civilians in the province. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN (New Delhi) _ An Indian proposal for talks with
Pakistan later this month on ways of lessening tensions in the
Indian subcontinent was quickly rejected by Pakistan on Friday, but
the exchange appeared to have moved both governments closer to
direct negotiations over the crisis set off by the nuclear tests
that both conducted last month. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-GUERRERO (El Charco, Mexico) _ The stucco walls of the
two-room schoolhouse are gouged with hundreds of bullet holes and
stained with patterns of dried blood: a handprint that slides
downward, a broad wash that spills into a thick puddle on the
floor. These are what remains of a three-hour shootout on Sunday
morning at the hilltop school between army troops and armed
fighters whom the authorities have identified as members of a
clandestine rebel group, the Popular Revolutionary Army. By Julia
Preston. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   BOLIVIA-COCA (Lauca Ene, Bolivia) _ Like congressmen all over
the world, Evo Morales hugs babies and makes fist-thumping
speeches. But that's where the similarities end. As Morales
returned to his district recently, he was not at all embarrassed to
be photographed caressing the coca bushes that grow on his
property. At age 38, Morales is the spokesman for six of the seven
coca grower unions in Bolivia, and he is the single most powerful
politician standing in the way of efforts by the United Nations and
the U.S. and Bolivian governments to fight the Bolivian cocaine
trade. By Clifford Krauss. (With map.)
</P>
<P>
   MOSCOW-ILLEGAL-LABOR (Moscow) _ By some estimates, there are as
many as a million foreign workers in and around Moscow _ many from
Ukraine, Moldova and other parts of the former Soviet Union _ who
come here offering their labor at virtually any price. Some are
paid as little as $100 a month, some three times as much. Some get
paid virtually nothing _ once the cost of housing and food have
been deducted. By Celestine Bohlen. (With photo.)

   JAPAN-ECON (Tokyo) _ Removing any lingering doubts that Japan is
in a full-blown recession, the Finance Ministry said that the
economy contracted at a 5.3 percent annual rate in the year's first
quarter. By Sheryl WuDunn. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   GM-STRIKE (Detroit) _ By Friday, about 50,500 workers had been
laid off at 13 assembly plants and 59 parts plants in the United
States, Mexico, and Canada because of a shortage of parts from the
stamping plant. That is in addition to the nearly 9,200 workers on
strike at both plants. By Keith Bradsher.
</P>
<P>
   BRANDED-DRUGS (Undated) _ With too many players in too many
parts of the business, companies that primarily sell generic drugs
often find themselves lost in the crowd, able to stand out on
pharmacy shelves only by cutting prices. More and more, though,
they are replacing the identically drab scientific labels on their
products with brand names of their own, raising prices in step with
a higher profile. By David J. Morrow. (With graphic and photo.)
</P>
<P>
   MERGER-CONFLICTS (New York) _ In the cozy world of corporate
finance, bankers and lawyers are finding themselves straddling both
sides of merger negotiations these days in what some critics say is
a risky move for companies and their shareholders. By Laura M.
Holson.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ The stock market continued to cascade
Friday, falling sharply for the fourth consecutive session on
renewed concerns about Asia's economic woes, before a rally late in
the day pushed prices higher. By David Barboza.

MOYER PITCHES THREE-HITTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ After the Mariners scored two runs in the
first inning Friday night, Jamie Moyer was in no mood to give any
of the early lead away.
</P>
<P>
   And even when his supporting cast added runs on solo home runs
by Glenallen Hill and Alex Rodriguez, the Mariners' hard-luck lefty
kept throwing zeroes at the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Nine in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most impressive outings by a starting pitcher this
season, Moyer pitched a complete-game three-hitter in the Mariners'
5-0 victory before 11,533 fans at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen never stirred,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   No need to.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a mini-jam in the second inning, when Oakland used an
error and single to put two runners on base with none out, Moyer
never encountered serious trouble along the way to his fourth win
and second solo shutout of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was a key moment in the game, he said, ``Not
really.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was nice pitching out there,'' first baseman David Segui
said. ``It was good to get him those two runs early, because the
way he was pitching, you knew it would be enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rodriguez: ``When Jamie gets in a groove like that, the
game just flows and it's fun playing behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   Segui knocked in the first run and scored the second as the M's
handed Oakland starter Tom Candiotti his eighth loss, although he
also pitched well enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti retired Joey Cora and Rodriguez in the first inning,
but walked Ken Griffey Jr. Segui unloaded what everyone thought was
a two-run homer to right-center.
</P>
<P>
   But the ball caromed off the top of the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, preparing himself for an easy-going trek around the
bases, turned on the jets when he noticed the ball come back into
the park and raced home with the game's first run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior had to run harder than he wanted and so did I,'' Segui
said.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez delivered a run-scoring single to left field past
shortstop Miguel Tejada, who attempted a backhanded stab instead of
getting in front of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer had an easy first inning.
</P>
<P>
   And a not-so-easy second, starting with third baseman Russ
Davis' 16th error of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis uncorked a wild throw to first base after fielding Kevin
Mitchell's broken-bat grounder and Matt Stairs followed the error
with a single to left, putting the tying runs on base with none
out.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer didn't blink, retiring Mike Blowers on a foul pop, Jason
Giambi on a fly out to left and Tejada on a force play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like typical Jamie Moyer,'' said Blowers, who played
for the Mariners last season. ``He changed speeds, threw strikes
and moved the ball around.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's familiarity with Candiotti paid off.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out in the first inning, Hill hit his 11th homer
of the season in the fourth, giving Moyer a 3-0 lead. Hill entered
the game with a .414 (12-for-29) career average and four homers
against the knuckleball specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had good success against him and other knuckleball
pitchers and I don't know why,'' Hill said. ``He had a good one
(Friday night).''
</P>
<P>
   Hill tagged his fifth career homer off Candiotti in the fourth
inning and helped Moyer out two innings later when he made a diving
catch to rob Rickey Henderson of a leadoff hit.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer appreciated the support, both with the bats and gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Four of his six losses came in games the Mariners were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candiotti pitched well and that's a good lineup over there,''
Moyer said of the A's. ``The keys are keeping the top and bottom of
their lineup off the bases.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what he did. And more.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the second-inning single by Stairs, Moyer allowed a
two-out double to Ben Grieve in the sixth and leadoff double to
Tejada in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Oakland runners reached third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners scored twice in the seventh inning, the first on
Rodriguez's 23rd homer of the season, to give Moyer a five-run
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez now has as many home runs this season as he did all of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even count last year,'' said Rodriguez, who was hurt
for much of the season.

MALONE-LED JAZZ POSTPONE BULLS' PARTY, SEND NBA FINALS BACK TO
UTAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ With an opportunity to end the NBA Finals and possibly
toast one of the greatest sports dynasties ever, the Chicago Bulls
stumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's 83-81 victory in Game 5 was more than a mere roadblock in
the Bulls' title quest. Not only is the series headed back to Salt
Lake City for Game 6 on Sunday, but the Jazz go home knowing they
just spoiled one big night in the Windy City.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone was most defiant to the script that had the Bulls
claiming a sixth NBA championship in this decade. He scored a
game-high 39 points and finally came up big in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   From start to finish, Malone played aggressively and provided
clutch plays. It was clearly his most dominant performance of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Jazz lost the title to the Bulls in six games.
Utah trails this best-of-seven series 3-2, but this time, the Jazz
own home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Game 7, it will be played at the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no easy cakewalk trying to win in Utah,'' Chicago's
Michael Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   At least in Utah, the Bulls won't have to worry about the
Illinois State Patrol officer who helped clear Malone's mind.
Malone spent most of Thursday riding in a state patrol car with a
friend, trying to escape the negative press about his poor showings
in the first four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize all the stuff that's been said. And I was able to
get away and get completely away from basketball,'' said Malone,
who made 17 of 27 shots. ``Thursday, I got totally out of the city.
After practice I left with a friend _ went and rode with him and
had a great time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds corny to you guys,'' Malone said. ``But I
don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz certainly rode Malone past the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was terrific. He made some big shots and in the (key) part
of the ballgame, too,'' Jazz point guard John Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's All-Star forward scored 25 points in the second half _ 17
in the third quarter and eight in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who is known for taking over games, watched Malone step
into the starring role this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got into a great rhythm,'' Jordan said. ``Dennis (Rodman),
Luc (Longley) ... no one could stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We made up our minds to get him the basketball,'' Utah coach
Jerry Sloan said, adding that he thought his team fought and stood
up to the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to stand up. When you stand up in this business you get
more respect,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Game 1, the Jazz got the Bulls'
attention in the closing minutes with big plays. Utah had
floundered in crunch time of the three previous games. But from the
two-minute mark until the final buzzer Friday, the Jazz battled.
</P>
<P>
   Utah never unraveled _ even when its seven-point lead dwindled
to 80-78 with 18.9 seconds left. Antoine Carr just calmly stroked
two free throws for a four-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, though, kept threatening. Toni Kukoc fired right back
with a 3-pointer that got the Bulls within 82-81. Then, Jeff
Hornacek split a pair of free throws to give Utah a two-point lead
with 1.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Chicago still had a chance to win the game with a
miracle shot, it was clear Utah would not be denied. Jordan heaved
a 3-pointer at the buzzer that didn't hit the rim.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz held the Bulls to 39-percent shooting. Utah hit 50
percent of its shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't the aggressor out there tonight. We were back
on our heels,'' Bulls forward Scottie Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz had their biggest scoring period of the series with 29
points in the third. Before Friday night's game, Utah had scored
less than 20 points in 11 of the 16 quarters played in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still had stretches that nobody's very happy with, but I
don't think anybody's worried about it,'' Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
   For as much as the Bulls have been praised for their defensive
stance in this series, they will work on getting better offense for
Game 6. With the exception of Kukoc _ who scored 30 points on
11-of-13 shooting _ the Bulls were harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan finished with 28 points but missed 15 of his 26 shots.
Pippen spoiled his series MVP bid with a 2-for-16 night despite
collecting 11 rebounds and 11 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine. We know it was just a matter of things happening
down the stretch,'' Chicago coach Phil Jackson said. `` ... I
thought it was a matter of sequences. It's not a big thing with us
losing one close game.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the Jazz see it, all they have to do is make sure the
Bulls lose another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to prove. We just have to continue to believe
in each other,'' Malone said.

GOING, GOING, GONE  
 MCGWIRE'S GRAND SLAM IGNITES CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was some question as to whether a ball hit to right field
by the Diamondbacks' Andy Fox left Bank One Ballpark in the first
inning of Friday night's game against the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The hit was ruled a home run, although Fox hustled around the
bases and slid head first across the plate just to make sure.
</P>
<P>
   When Cardinals first baseman Mark McGwire came to the plate in
the third inning, there was no need for him to sprint or get his
uniform dirty.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question as to whether the ball he hit to left
field off right-hander Andy Benes left the ballpark. The STATE,
maybe . . .
</P>
<P>
   McGwire made the slow jog around the bases, trailing the three
men who were on base ahead of him. The 438-foot shot was his 31st
homer of the season, his second grand slam of the season and 11th
of his career, and highlighted an eight-run inning as the Cardinals
pounded the Diamondbacks, 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton added a three-run homer off Benes in the
third inning to help the Cardinals raise their record to 31-34.
Arizona, which lost its second straight, fell to 21-46.
</P>
<P>
   After charging up the 11th sellout crowd of the season with some
gargantuan shots during batting practice, McGwire struck out on a
Benes fastball to end the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Benes) went right at me in the first at-bat,'' McGwire
said. ``It was the first time I ever faced him and I never
visualized him before.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes, who beat his former Cardinals teammates in St. Louis on
April 16, struck out two more in the second and looked to be on his
way to a strong performance.
</P>
<P>
   But he gave up the tying run on an RBI double by Tom Lampkin in
the third, then loaded the bases to set up the second duel with
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-0 pitch moved over the plate, McGwire swung his powerful
arms, made contact and quickly dropped his bat. He knew. So did
everyone else. Sayonara.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was on deck, I didn't realize the bases were loaded
because I was visualizing how he was throwing,'' McGwire said. ``It
was a fastball out over the plate and I was able to extend on it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire now has 80 RBIs, tying him for the major-league lead
with the Texas Rangers' Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter stuck with Benes, and it
proved to be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   After getting Brian Jordan on a groundout, Benes gave up a
single to Willie McGee and a double to John Mabry before Clayton
connected for his three-run homer to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Benes (4-7) came out for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the
third after throwing 73 pitches. It was his shortest stint as a
member of the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed I didn't give the team an opportunity to
win,'' Benes said. ``I've given up a lot of runs before, but this
is the worst I've ever had. I've never given up eight runs in an
inning before. I made bad pitches and they took advantage of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Showalter: ``He had good stuff early, just like in Oakland
(a 10-5 loss on Saturday), but he just couldn't get through the
inning. He threw 50 pitches in that inning and I didn't want to
jeopardize his health (by leaving him in longer).''
</P>
<P>
   Of McGwire's slam, Showalter said, ``Mark is great for the game
of baseball. Anybody who looks at it any other way is pretty
shallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Willie Banks entered the game and shut out the
Cardinals for three innings. Right-hander Felix Rodriguez pitched a
scoreless seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks came to life in their half of the seventh
against right-hander Todd Stottlemyre (7-5), the Cardinals'
starter. They cut the lead to 8-4 on a run-scoring single by David
Dellucci, a fielder's choice grounder by Jay Bell and a run-scoring
single by Kelly Stinnett.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis picked up an insurance run in the eighth when Clayton
walked, moved to second on a passed ball by Stinnett (the
Diamondbacks' first passed ball of the season) and later scored on
a sacrifice fly by Delino DeShields. &QL;

DE LA HOYA BECOMES MUCH MORE THAN BOXER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO _ Ali had Frazier. Sugar Ray Leonard had Roberto Duran
and Thomas Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya?
</P>
<P>
   He has it all.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs dangerous rivals?
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has parlayed movie-star looks, an Olympic gold medal,
camera-friendly charisma, innate salesmanship and a disarming smile
into success previously unknown in a sport where the big winners
pay a punishing price.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya hasn't had to pay. For him, there are none of the
scars that other fighters have always worn like a combat veteran
with a Purple Heart. For them, there is victory in survival. But De
La Hoya already has won a lot more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The proof is in his amazing impact on El Paso and Juarez,
Mexico, during the days before he defends his World Boxing Council
welterweight title tonight against a little-known Frenchman,
Patrick Charpentier.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the fight. It's just the last stop in one long parade
with one example after another of De La Hoya's huge popularity,
despite lingering doubts about him as a fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, look, I'm not expecting Armageddon here,'' said Bob Arum,
the promoter for the heavily favored De La Hoya (27-0, 22
knockouts), who was 147 pounds Friday at the official weigh-in.
Charpentier (27-4-1, 22 KOs) tipped the scale at 146, one less than
the welterweight limit.
</P>
<P>
   No, Arum is only expecting the largest outdoor crowd for a
boxing match in the United States in 43 years. About 45,000 tickets
had been sold by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With 50,000 to 60,000 customers expected by opening bell (7 p.m.
on Home Box Office), the Sun Bowl crowd would be the biggest in the
United States since 1955, when Rocky Marciano beat Archie Moore in
front of 61,500 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning difference is that De La Hoya vs. Charpentier is
hardly Marciano vs. Moore. This is more like iceberg vs. Titanic.
It's a colossal mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the crowds are here just to see De La Hoya, who will pocket
$4 million to Charpentier's $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fans flew in from Phoenix. They drove down from Albuquerque.
They walked over the bridges that cross the Rio Grande from Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just by having the event here has me motivated,'' said De La
Hoya, who has been inactive since a victory Dec. 6 over Wilfredo
Rivera. ``All the people, all the fans. It's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's status as a Latin sex symbol is the key. He may _
or may not _ be the world's best fighter, pound for pound. But
heartbeat for heartbeat, he has no challengers.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 shrieking girls greeted him a couple of days ago
when he stepped off his jet at a private El Paso airport. They
chanted, ``Oscar, Oscar.'' Some carried his picture in one hand as
though it were a religious item. Others reached through a
chain-link fence in an attempt to touch him. They threw underwear
at him. De La Hoya autographed at least one brassiere. No word yet
on whether he'll endorse a Victoria's Secret line.
</P>
<P>
   All those young women aren't there to see that face get bloodied
and bruised. And for now, De La Hoya doesn't appear to be in a
headlong rush toward that dangerous possibility.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest threats are International Boxing Federation
champion Felix Trinidad (32-0) of Puerto Rico, World Boxing
Association champ Ike Quartey (34-0-1) of Ghana and emerging
contender Jose Luis Lopez (40-3-2) of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said he has talked to Trinidad about a fight in May. Money,
he said, has been discussed. From $7 million to $8 million would go
to each fighter, with De La Hoya getting a larger share of the gate
and television receipts.
</P>
<P>
   It's all very intriguing. The young Trinidad looms as a bout in
which De La Hoya, 25, could define himself as a truly great
fighter. A rematch Sept. 18 against an aging Julio Cesar Chavez,
badly beaten in the first bout, does not hold that promise.
</P>
<P>
   But why, oh why, tamper with success? De La Hoya earned $36
million to $38 million for five fights last year. ``Fortune''
magazine lists him as the world's third-highest-paid athlete in
1997 behind Michael Jordan and Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an agenda, a schedule,'' according to De La Hoya, who
said he eventually will meet Trinidad and possibly Quartey. ``There
is no rush.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to. Just look around. &QL;

MCGWIRE'S THE REAL DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After another game or two, Michael Jordan no longer will claim
the title of ``Greatest Show in Sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Ronaldo fans, once-every-four-years kind of sports don't
count.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Chicago Bulls beat the Utah Jazz in the NBA Finals, or
even if they don't, the rest of the spring, the summer and the fall
belong to Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night at Bank One Ballpark, McGwire again demonstrated
his Jordanesque magic. He entertains. He amazes. Most important, he
delivers. It isn't much of a leap to ``I want to be like Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony La Russa, who was McGwire's manager in Oakland and now in
St. Louis, called his first baseman ``the most incredible thing in
sports,'' being sure to pay homage to the likes of Jordan, Evander
Holyfield and, yes, Renaldo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's at that level,'' La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire put on another spectacular display during batting
practice before the Cardinals played the Diamondbacks, actually
sending a ball through one of the open advertising panels in
left-center field and out of the ballpark. That was cool. No one
had ever done that before. And La Russa, remarkably, said McGwire
``didn't have a great BP today.'' Regardless, it still didn't
count.
</P>
<P>
   What did count happened in the top of the third inning, when
McGwire stepped in against Andy Benes with the bases loaded, one
out and the score tied at one. An electric buzz of expectancy
surged through the crowd, which cheered when Benes struck McGwire
out in the first inning. The greatest home-run hitter alive (and
maybe, perhaps, ever) was coming up in the one situation in which a
home-run hitter can do the most damage.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Benes said he respects McGwire but doesn't fear
him, and welcomed the opportunity to challenge him. It worked in
the first inning. It didn't work again.
</P>
<P>
   Benes challenged McGwire with a fastball down the middle, and
McGwire _ like Jordan does at precisely the right moment _
delivered, sending the 1-0 pitch to a hasty exit into the
left-field seats for his 31st home run and second grand slam of the
season. It provided half the Cards' eight-run third inning and led
to a 9-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   With 65 games played and 97 remaining, McGwire has reached the
halfway point in pursuit of breaking Roger Maris' record of 61 home
runs, although he is reluctant to admit he is chasing anything
except excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until somebody gets to 50 homers by September, then it's worth
talking about,'' he said. ``But now, there's a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   As is customary, McGwire acted as if nothing was unusual about
the blast, other than it came off a pitcher he never had faced
before. That partly explained the first-inning strikeout. It also
partly explained the home run (not to forget, too, McGwire's
rigorous training and ungodly strength), because McGwire said he
was able to ``visualize'' Benes after facing him.
</P>
<P>
   And it helps when Brian Jordan, not Brent Mayne (the guy
Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter walked Barry Bonds with the
bases loaded to get to) is hitting behind you. Jordan is hitting
.340. McGwire leads the majors in walks, but he might never see a
strike if not for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either they've got to pitch to him or me,'' Jordan said.
``Teams know I can beat them, too. They're challenging him, and
they're paying for it.'' &QL;

VIDEO'S DASH FOR CRASH  
 DRIVERS SPLIT OVER APPEAL OF MAYHEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two stock car drivers dive side by side into Turn 1, each
determined to claim the same piece of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Unless one softens up on the throttle, there will be hell to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   No one budges.
</P>
<P>
   A second later, the machines trade paint, causing one to slide
into an uncontrollable twirl. The spinning car suffers a snapped
brake line and bursts into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who is eyeballing a replay of the crash on
television, leans forward in his living room chair and blurts,
``That's me!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of crash-and-smash video, where catchy
commercials featuring countless nasty wrecks are the staples of
motor racing junkies hooked on mechanical mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, some of the video's most fervent fans are the
sport's main players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a whole library full of them,'' NASCAR Winston Cup
driver Ken Schrader says. ``In most of them, it looks like they
(the drivers) are able to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon suffered no injuries in the crash he saw during a
commercial for one of the videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened at North Wilkesboro,'' Gordon says. ``I've seen a
few of my wrecks when I still was racing midgets and sprints. I
don't mind watching them if I know no one was seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them really amaze you. Like those airplane crashes.
I'm interested, but I've never bought them.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't put Winston Cup driver Derrike Cope in that category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't pay attention to that stuff,'' Cope says. ``I'm
one of those guys that won't read what's written and I try not to
watch too much on TV. I very seldom even watch races over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup driver Dale Jarrett agrees with Cope, even if he
knows a driver was able to walk away from the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why people want to see that,'' Jarrett
says. ``I'm glad the drivers walked away, but it's still not
something I want to see or even think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people make a living by putting pieces like that
together, but it would be nice if they made more pieces about the
good things that go on in the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup driver Bobby Hamilton, however, can envision a lot
worse things for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people make money doing a lot worse things,'' Hamilton
says. ``I think its pretty cool to sit around, drink a beer and
watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Hewitt, who made his Indy-car debut in last month's
Indianapolis 500, believes there's a market for such videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think half the fans that come to races come to see
the big crashes and fights,'' says Hewitt, who adds that he doesn't
see anything wrong with the videos. ``They love it. They're here
for the blood and guts. It's kind of like the World Wrestling
Federation to them. I don't think they want to see anyone get hurt,
but when they see a crash, it seems to pump them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see a good race and a crash, it's perfect. But you
can't hold it against them. They pay big bucks to come to the
races. Crashing thrills people. It's unfortunate, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Open-wheel driver Dan Drinan, who nearly died six years ago in a
horrific crash in a U.S. Auto Club midget race at Springfield,
Ill., dislikes the videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it when people sensationalize tragedies,'' says
Drinan, who attended Scottsdale Chaparral High school but now lives
in Indianapolis. ``In my crash, I had a finger chopped off, it tore
my arms up, my elbow was dislocated and my face was all messed up.
I lived through that horrendous crash, but I was lucky. Stuff like
this hits too close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I really don't think the majority of fans come to see
crashes. I think it's the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian France, NASCAR Vice President for Marketing and
Communications, strongly agrees. France, however, also agrees that
there are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest moments in NASCAR's 50-year history aren't about
crashes,'' France says in reference to NASCAR's 50-year anniversary
celebration. ``They're about things like memorable finishes in the
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we recognize that fans are fascinated by dramatic crashes
from time to time. But it's not what our sport is about. We like to
focus on the competition between the drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, sometimes, the competition can lead to a fiery end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see wrecks a little more often than the average person, so
it's not that big a deal for us,'' Gordon says. ``But if someone
gets hurt real bad, it's not something you enjoy watching over and
over again on a video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody enjoys that.'' &QL;

PADRES POUNCE ON GIANTS' ERRORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY SCHULMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ A 3-0 deficit means squat, because the team plays so
well at home, and gets such a charge out of its fans, it can pounce
on an opponents' slightest mistake and steal a game that seems
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar, Giants fans?
</P>
<P>
   The same formula that lifted San Francisco to the top of the
National League West got San Diego there as well. The Padres were
22-7 at home going into Friday night's first-place showdown, and
now they are 23-7 because they gave no quarter after the Giants
committed two late-inning misplays.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Rich Aurilia's first error of the season helped San
Diego tie the game 3-3 in the seventh, and a throwing error by
reliever Steve Reed in the eighth paved the way for a seven-run
bloodbath against Reed and Jim Poole that resulted in a 10-3 Padres
laugher.
</P>
<P>
   A fireworks-night crowd of 60,789, the largest in San Diego
baseball history and the biggest in the majors this year, reveled
as the Padres overcame homers by Rey Sanchez and Barry Bonds to
regain sole possession of first place by a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good game for a while,'' manager Dusty Baker said.
``In a big game like this, the team that usually makes mistakes is
the team that loses. Usually, we don't make mistakes like this. It
was very uncharacteristic. Hopefully we'll play better tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours before the game, Baker closed the clubhouse doors and
conducted what he called a ``light meeting'' with his position
players to remind them that with cleanup hitter Jeff Kent out for
at least two weeks, everyone would have to do the ``little things''
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small things become more prevalent than before. When you
take away your No.2 run producer, you've got to make it up in other
areas, like defense, pitching, baserunning and fundamentals, things
like relays and reading signs,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, with the Giants clinging to a 3-2 lead, Quilvio
Veras led off the seventh with a bouncer that pitcher Rich
Rodriguez deflected toward Aurilia, who threw awkwardly and bounced
the ball past Charlie Hayes at first base. Veras motored to second.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez struck out Steve Finley, and new pitcher Reed got Greg
Vaughn to fly out to left, But Ken Caminiti lined a two-out double
to right, and Veras came home to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was still pitching when Chris Gomez started the eighth with
a single to right. Mandy Romero knocked a terrible bunt back to
Reed, who had plenty of time to nail Gomez at second. Instead, he
fired the ball into center field. The big inning was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was totally my fault,'' Reed said. ``It was frustrating
in a big game like that. I just stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole relieved Reed _ Rich Rodriguez, the other left-handed
reliever, had already been used _ and Veras quickly put the Padres
ahead 4-3 with a single to right. Finley popped up, but Vaughn
doubled home a run to make it 5-3. Wally Joyner singled home two
more, and Ruben Rivera completed the rout with a long three-run
homer to left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say I haven't felt anywhere near that bad this
year,'' Poole said. ``I picked a lousy night for it. The whole
night, out of the 30 pitches I heaved up there, only two or three
went where I wanted them to go. My body felt cranky, and I couldn't
react a darn.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a night that began so impressively for the Giants, with
Kirk Rueter striking out five Padres looking, with Sanchez hitting
his eighth career homer in 2,097 big-league at-bats, and Bonds
hitting the 26th of his career in this ballpark, ended in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Giants left the park with the same tire
marks down their backs that their opponents often wear when they
leave San Francisco. Practically everything went San Diego's way.
Even Tony Gwynn, who was supposed to be out the whole series with a
calf injury, contributed a sacrifice fly when Padres manager Bruce
Bochy surprisingly sent him to bat in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of heart on this team,'' Vaughn said, mimicking
a quote heard often in the other locker room. ``It was nice to come
back like that. We're just trying to get some space between us and
them.'' &QL;

CART, IRL STILL FAR APART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was late afternoon. The infield media room at Indianapolis
Motor Speedway nearly was deserted except for a few reporters, who
had Tony George surrounded two days before last month's 82nd
Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony, do you foresee a Championship Auto Racing Teams and Indy
Racing League reconciliation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony, do city fathers blame you for empty hotel rooms because
of the CART vs. IRL split?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony, do you anticipate CART drivers one day again converging
at Indy in May to do battle against IRL drivers in a one-day
shootout?''
</P>
<P>
   Yada, yada, yada.
</P>
<P>
   While fans and sponsors likely would embrace a CART-IRL merger,
chances of such a partnership are about as remote as peace in the
Middle East. Or so it seems.
</P>
<P>
   George, president of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, created the
IRL three years ago because he believed the sport was heading in
the wrong direction and wanted to establish an affordable series
that rewarded young American drivers with Indy-car opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as CART continues to expand its racing borders to
venues outside the United States, the IRL remains committed to an
all-oval series.
</P>
<P>
   Even if CART teams desired to make Indy 500 qualifying attempts,
several roadblocks _ primarily thin wallets _ make it virtually
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two sanctioning bodies operate under different
chassis and engine formulas, CART owners would have to purchase
separate equipment at a huge cost.
</P>
<P>
   And the last time I looked, Bill Gates wasn't listed as a CART
car owner.
</P>
<P>
   So get used to it, folks. Although rumors along pit road
indicate CART driver Al Unser Jr. may wind up on next year's Indy
500 starting grid, there are no clear signs the factions are about
to sign a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tries to characterize this as the IRL trying to keep
drivers away,'' George said. ``Drivers really don't have a lot to
say or do about the situation. I'm sure they miss being here. Some
probably don't know what it's like being here because they've never
been here. So they don't miss it. I know there are a couple who
very much want to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   George is wrong. Ask any CART driver, and under the right
circumstances, they'd all love to make plans in May at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   But as George insinuated, CART drivers get their paychecks from
CART owners, and we all know what that means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I think everyone will come to appreciate the IRL
for what it represents, and that is the opportunity to come and
compete at a reasonable level and be a part of putting on a good
show,'' George said.
</P>
<P>
   No one can argue last weekend's race at Texas Motor Speedway
didn't deserve high marks on the thrill-o-meter. It was an exciting
race, breathtaking at times.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers provided enough side-by-side racing to satisfy even
stock-car fans.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's wonderful to see talents such as Billy Boat and
J.J. Yeley receive opportunities they likely would not have
received without the IRL, it's the opinion of many that the Indy
500 has taken a huge whack in the prestige department.
</P>
<P>
   And I agree. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Schedule expanding &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rumors that a NASCAR Winston Cup race at Homestead (Fla.)
Motorsports Complex will be added to next year's schedule escalated
into a newspaper report earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a possibility of growing or shrinking, but it's
still too early to address 1999,'' NASCAR Vice President for
Competition Mike Helton said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   OK, now I've got a rumor I want to start.
</P>
<P>
   How about a second race at PIR within three to five years? It
would be a night race, possibly held in May or June.
</P>
<P>
   International Speedway Corp., which owns PIR, just renewed its
contract with The Nashville Network for three years at a huge
increase. And ISC would like to add 25,000 additional seats within
five years, which would increase seating capacity to nearly
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A long shot? Perhaps. But who would have believed 15 years ago
that PIR would one day become part of the Winston Cup schedule? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sing, sing &QL; 
 &QL; 
Country music heartthrob Randy Travis will sing the national anthem
at the NASCAR Winston Cup Dura-Lube 500 on Oct. 25 at Phoenix
International Raceway. &QL;

JAZZ SQUELCH BULLS' CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STEELE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There was supposed to be champagne in the home team's
locker room. Instead, a half-hour after Game 5 of the NBA Finals at
the United Center on Friday night, there was nothing but discarded
tape and assorted refuse. In the Jazz locker room, there were bags
packed and stacked near the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz were going home, not to lick their wounds and count
their regrets, but to play ball and keep competing for the NBA
championship. The Bulls were headed not into a night of anarchy on
the streets of Chicago, but back to the Delta Center to try again
to take their sixth crown of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   It almost went according to the Bulls' plan; it wasn't until
Michael Jordan missed a 3-point heave at the buzzer that the Bulls
succumbed to the Jazz 83-81 and saw their lead in the series fall
to 3-2. The heroes were not Jordan or Scottie Pippen or Dennis
Rodman, but Karl Malone (finally) and Antoine Carr (surprisingly).
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls still have two chances to wrap up the title, but if
both are needed, both will be in Salt Lake City, starting tomorrow.
``We'll get on the plane (today),'' said Jordan, who scored 28
points, ``and I hope that everybody has forgotten about this game.
Sure, we blew our opportunity, but this has happened to us
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In the exact same circumstance in 1993, they lost Game 5 to the
Suns and then won the title in Game 6 in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But, Jordan added, ``I think the heart and determination and
desire was there, but our bodies weren't. We didn't move. Sometimes
the body doesn't react to what the mind is trying to tell you.
Tonight was one of those nights.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz moved just fine, especially Malone, who scored 39
points, 25 in a second half his team dominated. Five days after
setting records for futility in a 96-54 thrashing, they ran off 53
second-half points against a previously-impenetrable Bulls'
defense, highlighting a comeback from a 36-30 halftime deficit that
was spurred by 14 Jazz turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what an individual guy does on this team,'' Malone
said, ``we're going to win it or lose it together, and that's our
motto. We have nothing to prove (against the Bulls). We just have
to continue to believe in each other as a team. When we make up our
minds as a team, as a group, to play defense, execute our plays and
rebound, we're a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   The group turned it up more than it had at any other time in
this series. Malone had been invisible in the fourth quarter in the
four previous games, but dropped in eight in the final period
Friday night _ none bigger than a turnaround jumper from the left
side with 53.3 seconds left that gave his team an 80-76 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That basket, as did so many others, came against Rodman, who was
completely ineffective, with three rebounds and five fouls in 24
minutes. Luc Longley did even less _ he was unable to present any
kind of a challenge to Malone and was held scoreless until 10
minutes remained, despite several early easy chances from in close.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Carr, meanwhile, started the second half at
center when coach Jerry Sloan went to his last possible option as a
fifth starter (Greg Ostertag, Greg Foster and Adam Keefe having
failed miserably before). Asked what inspired him to go with the
little-used Carr, Sloan deadpanned, ``First of all, he was able to
catch the basketball.'' He did far more than that, going 5-for-5 in
the second half and scoring 12 points, eight in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Kukoc was brilliant for the Bulls, with a playoff
career-high 30 points _ including 13 of the Bulls' first 14 points,
as Jordan and Pippen were out of sync. Pippen never got into sync:
After two days of being hyped for Finals Most Valuable Player,
Pippen went until the final seconds of the first half before
scoring his first basket and finished with six points on 2-for-16
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite everything Malone and Carr did, and everything Pippen
and Rodman didn't do, the Bulls had one last chance to pop the
corks.
</P>
<P>
   A 78-71 Jazz lead with 1:56 left was sliced to 82-81 with 5.5
seconds left, on the second of two late Kukoc 3-pointers. The
Jazz's Jeff Hornacek, a career 89 percent free-throw shooter in the
playoffs, managed to make just one of two with 1.1 seconds left _
and it was the second, which allowed the Bulls to call timeout and
inbound the ball at midcourt. After a deflection reduced the clock
to eight-tenths of a second, Jordan took the inbound pass and got a
good look from 26 feet, but left his jumper short.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, John Stockton said of the Jazz, ``We're still in the hunt.
Still alive, still kicking.''

AT LAST, JAZZ TAKES A SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You wondered when they were going to take it personally. When
they were going to get angry. When they were going to get tough.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 quarters, it finally happened.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the open debate as to which Bulls superstar would
win the MVP. Or the lady who received an autograph from Greg
Ostertag only to say, ``You're going to lose anyway.'' Or the slew
of derisive prank calls reaching them at their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 quarters, it finally happened. And the Jazz has a
chance to make this a series after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the hunt, we're still kicking,'' John Stockton
said. ``And we're going home.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, this was the injured pride of Karl Malone
swelling into uncontrollable rage, a man who finally joined a
series in progress. A man who shed two creatures clinging two his
back _ King Kong and Rodzilla _ and finally carried his team to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   With his entire legacy turning to mush, with a nation ignoring
his chiseled frame and focusing on his soft cranium, Malone
responded the way an MVP does. He rained in jumpers, he pounded
away inside, he treated Dennis Rodman like a chew toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the criticism he received in this series,'' Michael
Jordan said, ``he put some things to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, and Malone found inspiration in the strangest place. On
Thursday, Malone went riding with an Illinois state trooper. Just
sat in a squad car and cruised the highways. Stopped at a weigh
station and watched trucks pull up on a cargo scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it sounds corny to you guys,'' Malone said. ``I don't
care what you guys do on your off day, but I wanted to change up
and do something different. I always wanted to be, in my little
world, a state trooper . . . So I got to ride with one. You can
laugh all the hell you want to, it was a fun day for me.''
</P>
<P>
   After a ragged first half that resembled a pickup game among
CEOs, Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan made two key adjustments. He started
Antoine Carr in the second half and received 12 points in 21
minutes. More importantly, it thwarted the Bulls' swarming defense
that had forced 13 turnovers in the first 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And in a moment of clarity, Sloan and the Jazz finally decided
to focus on Malone in the post, feeding him the ball on nearly
every possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to win ballgames with the Jazz, you go to Karl
Malone,'' Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
   As they did against the Suns in 1993, the Bulls lost a wonderful
opportunity to close out the series at home. They had not lost a
home game in the Finals since the night Charles Barkley saved the
city from riots, and they had vowed not to lose focus. But Scottie
Pippen had a horrible shooting night, Jordan never got rolling, and
Luc Longley continued to kill his team with a lack of production.
Oh, and Bulls Coach Phil Jackson placed part of the blame on
gridlock that made the commute downtown a mere two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad night, a bad day at the office,'' Jordan said.
``But I'm looking forward to getting the same room with a piano.
And I'd love to fly to Utah and toss the ball the moment we land.''
</P>
<P>
   For a brief second _ or 0.8 to be exact _ it appeared the
basketball gods were going to intervene and provide Jordan with the
ultimate moment. And really, who didn't expect his wild shot at the
end to find nothing but net?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen, and maybe it's an omen. After four games in which
the Jazz acted like ballerinas, shooting 10 free throws a game
fewer than its opponents, a passive bunch finally got tough. And
for all the wild mood swings, this is no different than two teams
that have defended their home court for five contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stand up in this business, usually you get a little
more respect,'' Sloan said. ``To me, it's the most exciting thing
in sports. To see who will fight.'' &QL;

   General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union stumbled
into another showdown, as a spreading strike by auto parts workers
in Flint, Mich., forced the temporary closing of dozens of GM
assembly plants and parts factories.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of workers struck over GM's efforts to move production
to other factories inside and outside the country where costs are
lower.
</P>
<P>
   The auto maker had infuriated the union by removing parts-making
equipment from a Flint factory over the Memorial Day weekend, but
negotiators began making progress after GM agreed on Thursday to
return the equipment. Remaining are a series of financial issues,
on which it will be easier to split the difference in the coming
days or weeks.

   No one wants full-scale war over Kosovo. ``It is not our desire
to use force,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed. At

Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in response to persistent

damages, marking the first time a jury in a tobacco case as ordered
such a penalty.

   Moscow Aims at Tax Evasion
</P>
<P>
   Getting a handle on Russia's economic activity is notoriously
difficult because businesses routinely under-report their
production to minimize taxes. The government of Boris Yeltsin took
a first step toward improving official economic estimates by
arresting the country's top statisticians and accusing them of
manipulating data to help Russian companies avoid taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, which told the government it
needed to slash its budget deficit and overhaul its tax system to
qualify for billions of dollars in extra loans, says Russia's
economic production is roughly 20 percent greater than official
estimates.

   Honda and Ford Fined Millions
</P>
<P>
   The air has gotten cleaner even as the number of cars has
skyrocketed, partly because new autos have sophisticated computers
that monitor engine functions. But Honda and Ford's vehicles were a
little TOO sophisticated, the government said.
</P>
<P>
   The automakers agreed to pay millions of dollars in civil fines
for selling cars that were designed to pass emissions tests but run
dirtier on the road, according to federal prosecutors. Both
companies denied wrongdoing.

   Tuberculosis DNA Is Decoded  &QL;

<P>
   For a really scary disease, forget Ebola and other plagues.
Tuberculosis, contained at present by antibiotics, may not be kept
at bay for long. The bacterium, which is easily inhaled, already
infects much of the world's population and kills three million
people a year in the less developed world.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at the Sanger Center in England, in a tour de
force that took two years, have deciphered the 4.4 million letters
of the bacterium's genetic code, revealing every genetic weapon in
the organism's armory. Designers of drugs and vaccines can now
choose among the microbe's 4,000 genes for suitable targets.

   Heart Drug Is Withdrawn  &QL;

   When Food and Drug Administration officials approved the heart
drug Posicor last June, they knew it could be lethal when mixed
with certain other drugs. But the danger was worse than they
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   By last week, the FDA had tallied 26 medications that are toxic
in combination with Posicor, forcing Roche Laboratories of Nutley,
N.J., to recall the drug from pharmacy shelves in 38 countries.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the third time in the past decade, FDA officials
said, that they have taken an approved drug off the market.

   Washington paid homage to the President of South Korea, Kim
Dae-jung, who is in the United States seeking investment for his
beleaguered economy and lobbying for an easing of international
sanctions on North Korea. President Clinton welcomed Kim with a
private Oval Office meeting and a sumptuous state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton likened the frail, 74-year-old Kim, a longtime dissident
imprisoned, exiled and sentenced to die by the former South Korean
authorities, to Lech Walesa and Nelson Mandela. But Clinton did not
accede to Kim's request to lift U.S. economic sanctions on
communist North Korea.

   Intel Cited in Antitrust Suit  &QL;

<P>
   In an unusual antitrust case, the Federal Trade Commission filed
suit against Intel Corp., accusing the company of withholding
information about its chips that three computer makers considered
crucial to developing their own products based on Intel
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust laws are designed to prevent monopolists from using
predatory tactics to destroy rivals; in this case, however, Intel

saying the plan did not violate the First Amendment's separation of
church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling gave a boost to the growing school-choice movement,
which seeks to send children in failing public schools to private
ones, most of which have religious affiliations. The aim is to
inject competition into education as a means of forcing
improvement.

<P>
   The Navy had originally planned to discharge McVeigh without

Defense Department had violated its ``don't ask, don't tell'' rule
in investigating McVeigh's sexual orientation, the Navy agreed to
provide him with full benefits and pay his legal fees.

   Abraham Lincoln, Deadbeat
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans last week excoriated their fellow Americans as
a bunch of deadbeats casually running up debts and then
disingenuously pleading bankruptcy to wipe their slates clean.
</P>
<P>
   A record 1.4 million people declared bankruptcy last year _
evidence, lawmakers said, that a tighter law and more personal
responsibility were in order.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans did not mention that one of their party's most
prominent members was a self-declared ``insolvent debtor'' who
would surely have filed for bankruptcy had the current laws been
available to him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1832 a young man named Abraham Lincoln bought a small general
store in New Salem, Ill., with a partner. On credit, they acquired
the inventory of other nearby stores.
</P>
<P>
   The economy was booming, but the two prairie entrepreneurs could
not make a go of it and began sliding into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln sold his share, but when his partner died he became
liable for $1,000 in debts, according to Gerald Prokopowicz, a
scholar at the Lincoln Museum in Fort Wayne, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors hauled Lincoln into court, and the sheriff seized his
only assets _ his survey equipment and his horse. The store, in
Lincoln's phrase, ``winked out.''
</P>
<P>
   As a budding state legislator in 1835, Lincoln introduced a bill
to provide relief for insolvent debtors. But it didn't pass, and
Honest Abe was still repaying his debts ``well into the 1840s,''
said Kim Bauer, curator at the Illinois State Historical Library.
</P>
<P>
   It was so onerous that Lincoln called it ``my national debt.''

   A Hairdresser Strikes Oil
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the march of progress goes past some incongruous
places, like the Alabama ditch where space agency engineers
gathered to pump dirty water through a barrel partly filled with
human hair.
</P>
<P>
   And while inventions may come in a flash from above, sometimes
they grow out of odd observations about everyday stuff. Such was
the case with Phil McCrory, the hairdresser whose salon floor
provided the hair in the NASA barrel, which was being tested as a
potentially quicker and cheaper way to clean up oil spills.
</P>
<P>
   It was television footage of the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 that
started McCrory thinking about oil, particularly a shot of an otter
rolling in a slick. ``That's when the light went off,'' McCrory
said. The otter's fur was soaking up lots of oil _ would human hair
do the same?
</P>
<P>
   To find out, he stuffed a pair of his wife's pantyhose with as
much hair as it would hold _ three or four pounds _ poured a gallon
of used motor oil into the water in his son's wading pool and
dropped his ``test otter'' in. ``In two minutes the water was
crystal clear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the hair on the floor of McCrory's Huntsville salon came
from workers at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center, who put him in
touch with Maurice Hale, a technology transfer expert.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the tiny cuticles that cover a shaft of human hair
give the surface tension of oil, which is repelled by water,
something to cling to.
</P>
<P>
   McCrory's dream is to stuff hair collected from salons all over
the country into small reusable mesh pillows that can be quickly
deployed to soak up oil spills. Sounds like a cutting-edge
solution.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ They strike without warning, bringing terror to
an apartment in Algeria, a Chinese shop in Indonesia, a squalid
refugee encampment in Africa or a Balkan farming village under
siege. They are shadowy men with causes so blinding and hatreds so
deep that they have transformed modern warfare into orgies of
primordial savagery _ raping, brutalizing, humiliating, slashing
and hacking women and girls to death.
</P>
<P>
   More civilians than soldiers are being maimed and killed in the
wars of nationalism and ethnicity that are the hallmark of the
century's end, wars fought in neighborhoods rather than
battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the
new style of warfare is often aimed specifically at women and is
defined by a view of premeditated, organized sexual assault as a
tactic in terrorizing and humiliating a civilian population. In
some cases the violators express a motive that seems to have more
in common with the tactics of ancient marauding hordes than with
the 20th century _ achieving forced pregnancy and thus poisoning
the womb of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   International attention first focused on the use of rape as a
tactic of warfare in Bosnia, where a U.N. commission and human
rights groups found that ethnic Serb paramilitary groups had
systematically tolerated or encouraged the raping of Bosnian Muslim
women as part of the effort to drive Muslims from their homes and
villages between 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rape was also employed by Hutu troops against Tutsi women in the
genocidal campaign Hutu leaders conducted in Rwanda in 1994. Last
year, women who have identified with secular culture in Algeria
accused desperate rebels fighting in the name of Islamic revolution
of kidnapping them and making them sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, reports are surfacing that suggest members of the
security forces may have been among the men who raped ethnic
Chinese women during rioting last month.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Balkans, Serbs are again emptying towns of a rival
ethnic group _ this time Albanians in Kosovo _ and human rights and
women's groups are monitoring the growing violence for the
possibility that rape will again be one of the techniques.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is the essentially random rape that traditionally
follows conquest, intolerable though that is; it is different even
from forcing conquered women to be prostitutes for the victors, as
Japan did in Korea during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that in all four recent cases, sexual
degradation and intimidation _ often public _ seem to have been
used as a strategy of ethnic or religious conflict itself.
</P>
<P>
   This use of rape as a premeditated act of warfare is challenging
anew the efforts by nations of the world to organize effectively to
prevent and punish crimes against humanity, a monumental task that
moves into new territory tomorrow with the opening of a treaty
conference in Rome to create the world's first international
criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the systematic use of sexual assault in
ethnic wars in the Balkans and Rwanda, the court is expected to
rank rape as an internationally recognized war crime for the first
time in history, alongside violence against noncombatants,
mistreatment of prisoners, torture and other unusual punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Widney Brown, an advocate with the women's rights division of
Human Rights Watch, echoed other experts when she said that rape
``has probably been an issue in every major conflict, but what
happened in Bosnia, particularly with the creation of the rape
camps, really brought it to light.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, where soldiers of every faction were accused of
rape, the discovery of areas where Serbian soldiers confined
Bosnian Muslim women to be raped shocked many. ``In Yugoslavia rape
was a part of ethnic cleansing, because the message that you got
was if you stayed, the men would be murdered and the women would be
raped,'' Ms. Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was followed very quickly by what happened in Rwanda,
where we have similar widespread allegations of rape and
mutilation,'' she added. ``In fact, part of the preliminary
campaign that created the atmosphere that allowed the genocide to
happen was the demonization of Tutsi women as oversexualized
creatures who were seductresses. It's not surprising that during
the conflict they were subjected to rape, and a lot of sexual
mutilation. Mutilation is another way of saying, `We don't perceive
of this person as a human being.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For about five years now, ad hoc tribunals have been hearing
allegations of war crimes, first in the Balkans and later in
Rwanda, and these tribunals have already decided to consider rape a
war crime in those conflicts. Since they have been serving as
small-scale models for the permanent international court that is
just being formed, that court is expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tribunals were literally forced to pay attention to a
series of petitions and pressures from women's organizations
demanding that rape be recognized,'' said Felice Gaer, an expert on
human rights and international organizations for the American
Jewish Committee. Ms. Gaer said that ultimately the support of
Justice Richard Goldstone, the first war crimes prosecutor for the
Balkans and Rwanda, succeeded in elevating sex crimes to the level
of genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first step taken by nations trying to tackle
collectively this new scourge of war. But women are drawing up a
longer list of gender-related crimes in wartime, and promise a
battle to have them recognized by the International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Franzblau, who tracks the sexual exploitation of women for
Equality Now, a New York-based organization that aids women in poor
nations and immigrant women here, said rape is so widespread now
because it is so effective in ethnic wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has such devastating effects on communities, particularly
in traditional societies or very religious communities where the
virginity and the fidelity of women can be central to the makeup of
that society,'' he said. Rape is a psychological grenade thrown
into the middle of daily life to provoke maximum terror. ``That's
why you see a fair number of these rapes committed in front of
family members of the girls or women involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that the fast pace of international
communications today may be a factor in the rapid recurrence of the
use of rape as a tactic of war in such widely separate parts of the
world. But if that is true, it is also evident that rapid
international communication has played a role in stirring
international outrage about the tactic.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, there have been significant changes among
the vulnerable women themselves. Women who were the victims of
sexual abuse in the name of ethnic purity, nationalism and
sometimes religious zeal have begun to speak out, often aided by
human rights organizations and women's crisis centers. For many,
this has been a revolutionary change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of women just committed suicide in the past,'' said
Charlotte Bunch executive director of the Center for Women's Global
Leadership at Rutgers. ``That's one very clear thing that's
beginning to emerge now. In this decade, the outrage that women
have been able to raise about the issue means that people are
reporting it. But the truth is that there is also a backlash about
women speaking out. There may be some moments before we reach a
point where there is enough outrage to get the phenomenon under
control.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon takes human form in a number of recent accounts
reported by journalists. Take the story of Nawal Fathi, who was
captured by militants in Algeria in 1996, made into a sex slave and
raped by a score of men before being rescued by government troops.
A psychiatrist who treated her said that despite a year of medical
treatment, Ms. Fathi committed suicide at the age of 24 last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, aid workers were quoted last week as saying that
hundreds of ethnic Chinese women had been sexually assaulted during
the looting of Chinese neighborhoods, apparently by organized gangs
that may have had links to security forces. ``Some of the attackers
said, `You must be raped because you are Chinese and non-Muslim,'
'' one woman recalled. Again, a number of women have killed
themselves rather than live in shame.
</P>
<P>
   Although militants in Algeria and roving gangs of rapists in
Indonesia are Muslims, the phenomenon is probably not related to
religion, though radical religious views may provide justification
to an elemental misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban movement in Afghanistan, for example, has repressed
women but its holy warriors have not abused them sexually, as their
predecessors in the Mujahedeen armies were frequently accused of
doing, Afghan women say.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholics butchered other Roman Catholics in Rwanda and
Burundi. Sex slaves are also a hallmark of the vaguely evangelical
Lord's Resistance Army in Uganda. Burmese troops in Myanmar, a
Buddhist country, are accused in a new report from the human-rights
group Earthrights of using rape as a weapon against women from 20
or more ethnic minorities or student groups that oppose the
military regime.
</P>
<P>
   Because women displaced by ethnic warfare or other forms of mass
violence are often not safe even in refugee camps _ or arrive there
pregnant through rape _ United Nations relief agencies and some
private groups have begun to offer gynecological services and the
``morning after'' pill, which prevents conception.
</P>
<P>
   Although this practice has been sharply criticized by
anti-abortion groups in the United States, the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, and others have continued
to provide help to abused women.
</P>
<P>
   At Equality Now, Franzblau said the kind of sexual abuse that
took place in Bosnia, where Serb rapes of Muslim women were
numerous and intense personal hatred was directed at neighbors, not
some distant stranger at an enemy gun emplacement, makes the impact
much worse and stokes the fires for the next round of strife.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why it is going to be very difficult to reconcile these
communities,'' he said. ``How can you move families back to homes
where a mother or daughter or sister was raped by a next-door
neighbor?''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ They strike without warning, bringing terror to
an apartment in Algeria, a Chinese shop in Indonesia, a squalid
refugee encampment in Africa or a Balkan farming village under
siege. They are shadowy men with causes so blinding and hatreds so
deep that they have transformed modern warfare into orgies of
primordial savagery _ raping, brutalizing, humiliating, slashing
and hacking women and girls to death.
</P>
<P>
   More civilians than soldiers are being maimed and killed in the
wars of nationalism and ethnicity that are the hallmark of the
century's end, wars fought in neighborhoods rather than
battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the
new style of warfare is often aimed specifically at women and is
defined by a view of premeditated, organized sexual assault as a
tactic in terrorizing and humiliating a civilian population. In
some cases the violators express a motive that seems to have more
in common with the tactics of ancient marauding hordes than with
the 20th century _ achieving forced pregnancy and thus poisoning
the womb of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   International attention first focused on the use of rape as a
tactic of warfare in Bosnia, where a U.N. commission and human
rights groups found that ethnic Serb paramilitary groups had
systematically tolerated or encouraged the raping of Bosnian Muslim
women as part of the effort to drive Muslims from their homes and
villages between 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rape was also employed by Hutu troops against Tutsi women in the
genocidal campaign Hutu leaders conducted in Rwanda in 1994. Last
year, women who have identified with secular culture in Algeria
accused desperate rebels fighting in the name of Islamic revolution
of kidnapping them and making them sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, reports are surfacing that suggest members of the
security forces may have been among the men who raped ethnic
Chinese women during rioting last month.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Balkans, Serbs are again emptying towns of a rival
ethnic group _ this time Albanians in Kosovo _ and human rights and
women's groups are monitoring the growing violence for the
possibility that rape will again be one of the techniques.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is the essentially random rape that traditionally
follows conquest, intolerable though that is; it is different even
from forcing conquered women to be prostitutes for the victors, as
Japan did in Korea during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that in all four recent cases, sexual
degradation and intimidation _ often public _ seem to have been
used as a strategy of ethnic or religious conflict itself.
</P>
<P>
   This use of rape as a premeditated act of warfare is challenging
anew the efforts by nations of the world to organize effectively to
prevent and punish crimes against humanity, a monumental task that
moves into new territory tomorrow with the opening of a treaty
conference in Rome to create the world's first international
criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the systematic use of sexual assault in
ethnic wars in the Balkans and Rwanda, the court is expected to
rank rape as an internationally recognized war crime for the first
time in history, alongside violence against noncombatants,
mistreatment of prisoners, torture and other unusual punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Widney Brown, an advocate with the women's rights division of
Human Rights Watch, echoed other experts when she said that rape
``has probably been an issue in every major conflict, but what
happened in Bosnia, particularly with the creation of the rape
camps, really brought it to light.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, where soldiers of every faction were accused of
rape, the discovery of areas where Serbian soldiers confined
Bosnian Muslim women to be raped shocked many. ``In Yugoslavia rape
was a part of ethnic cleansing, because the message that you got
was if you stayed, the men would be murdered and the women would be
raped,'' Ms. Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was followed very quickly by what happened in Rwanda,
where we have similar widespread allegations of rape and
mutilation,'' she added. ``In fact, part of the preliminary
campaign that created the atmosphere that allowed the genocide to
happen was the demonization of Tutsi women as oversexualized
creatures who were seductresses. It's not surprising that during
the conflict they were subjected to rape, and a lot of sexual
mutilation. Mutilation is another way of saying, `We don't perceive
of this person as a human being.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For about five years now, ad hoc tribunals have been hearing
allegations of war crimes, first in the Balkans and later in
Rwanda, and these tribunals have already decided to consider rape a
war crime in those conflicts. Since they have been serving as
small-scale models for the permanent international court that is
just being formed, that court is expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tribunals were literally forced to pay attention to a
series of petitions and pressures from women's organizations
demanding that rape be recognized,'' said Felice Gaer, an expert on
human rights and international organizations for the American
Jewish Committee. Ms. Gaer said that ultimately the support of
Justice Richard Goldstone, the first war crimes prosecutor for the
Balkans and Rwanda, succeeded in elevating sex crimes to the level
of genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first step taken by nations trying to tackle
collectively this new scourge of war. But women are drawing up a
longer list of gender-related crimes in wartime, and promise a
battle to have them recognized by the International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Franzblau, who tracks the sexual exploitation of women for
Equality Now, a New York-based organization that aids women in poor
nations and immigrant women here, said rape is so widespread now
because it is so effective in ethnic wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has such devastating effects on communities, particularly
in traditional societies or very religious communities where the
virginity and the fidelity of women can be central to the makeup of
that society,'' he said. Rape is a psychological grenade thrown
into the middle of daily life to provoke maximum terror. ``That's
why you see a fair number of these rapes committed in front of
family members of the girls or women involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that the fast pace of international
communications today may be a factor in the rapid recurrence of the
use of rape as a tactic of war in such widely separate parts of the
world. But if that is true, it is also evident that rapid
international communication has played a role in stirring
international outrage about the tactic.

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ There was something more than faintly
American about the first speech of Nigeria's new military head of
state, following the sudden death Monday of the country's
iron-fisted president, Gen. Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   Much as a new president of the remaining superpower might, upon
taking office after the unexpected death of a U.S. leader, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar hammered away at the theme of unshaken
adherence to his country's ``international commitments.'' He sought
to comfort allies and serve notice of Nigeria's resolve to
potential foes.
</P>
<P>
   And as could be expected upon the death of a U.S. president,
Abacha's death unleashed a flood of eulogies praising his immense
qualities as a statesman. Fittingly, after the death of the leader
of a great country, no fewer than seven African heads of state
rushed to pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   From Senegal to Gabon, the late general's peers spoke glowingly
of a man devoted ``body and soul to his country,'' or solemnly
regretted the passing of one of ``Africa's most illustrious sons.''
</P>
<P>
   None even hinted that Nigeria is arguably in worse shape
economically than at any time since independence from Britain in
1960, that there have never been more political prisoners, that
high-level corruption had never been so brazen, or that outside
Africa, Abacha was often dismissed as just another despot
plundering an unfortunate citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   In his own his country, where Abacha was loathed far more than
admired, many Nigerians undoubtedly scratched their heads in
puzzlement over this seeming hypocrisy. But the point that those
who disapproved were missing is that for much of Africa, any
political transition in the continent's most populous, most
complicated and arguably most fractious country _ especially one as
unexpected as Abacha's sudden death by reported heart attack _ is a
cause for major concern far beyond Nigeria's own borders.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa and Egypt may have more powerful armies, but no
African country is more involved in the security arrangements of
its surrounding region than Nigeria. South Africa may have a higher
level of industrialization, and tiny oil states like Libya and
Gabon much higher per capita incomes, but no African country's
economic health is more vital to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Oil-rich Nigeria can submerge its neighbors in its economic woes
or float them when it is flush. Beyond that, as the world's
seventh-largest oil producer and the United States' biggest trading
partner on the continent, it is perhaps the only African country
whose sudden disappearance from the map would cause more than a
moment's ripple in international markets.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has often spoken of
the United States as the world's one ``essential nation.'' But in
West Africa, such is the weight of Nigeria, with its 105 million
people, large military forces and hyperactive foreign policy that
many would quibble with America's self-designation.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, the democratically elected
president of Sierra Leone, a country 1,000 miles to the west of
Nigeria, who was overthrown in a coup 13 months ago by a
combination of renegade soldiers and rural rebels who invaded the
capital, Freetown, looting and burning all in their path.
</P>
<P>
   Washington quickly sent the Marines to evacuate Western
residents, saving them from the mayhem but doing nothing to relieve
the country's distress. The United Nations, likewise, took no
action. The only country that proved willing and able to help put
out the flames was Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha sent warships to blockade the rebels, starving their
economy, and airplanes to bomb the insurrectionists' positions.
When all of that didn't suffice, he mounted an intervention by
land, losing dozens of soldiers but succeeding in the goal of
restoring order _ and, by the way, Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's president showed his gratitude by suspending his
attendance at the annual Organization of African Unity summit in
Ouagadougou to fly to Nigeria within hours of the news of Abacha's
death; there he expressed condolences and, one imagines, sought
security assurances from the new team in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is going to be no change in the foreign policy of
Nigeria, because like no one else, at the center of Nigerian policy
stands Africa, and that will never change,'' the bluff commander of
Nigerian forces in Sierra Leone, Brig. Gen. Maxwell Khobe, said in
an interview. ``When there is trouble in our region, we will be
there, because to go absent would mean letting the fire spread.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all of Nigeria's can-do interventionism in Sierra Leone,
and a previous successful, if drawn out, peace-keeping effort in
Liberia, the warm words for Abacha and his nation were motivated
not only by gratitude for Nigeria's contributions to regional
security.
</P>
<P>
   Just as central in the minds of other regional leaders as they
mourned the dictator's passing was the possibility of Nigeria's
disintegration amid an anti-military uprising, revived regional
tensions and ethnic hatreds. Seen from this angle, Nigeria more
resembled another recent superpower, the crumbling and potentially
dangerous Soviet Union, than it did a triumphant United States.
</P>
<P>
   Few African countries have experienced anything like the
devastation of the Nigerian civil war at the close of the 1960s,
which began with a secession bid by the oil-rich southeast. And, as
that conflict showed clearly, no other country on the continent has
anything like the ability to inundate its neighbors with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha may deserve some of the posthumous accolades being given
to him by his fellows as a great statesman, pan-Africanist or
nationalist, but no leader before him left power with his country
in a more degraded and potentially explosive state. Indeed, before
an officially declared week of mourning was half over, angry
protesters, readily citing the recent example of ``people's power''
in Indonesia, were facing off with soldiers in the streets of
Nigeria's capital, Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Ghana's president, Jerry Rawlings, a former soldier who himself
twice took power in coups after uprisings and was only later
elected as a civilian, was one of the few African statesmen to
speak candidly last week about the downside of Abacha's legacy: a
fractured and volatile nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a prayer for Nigeria,'' Rawlings said in an
interview with the BBC, minutes after learning of Abacha's death.
``For the commanders and the politicians not to do anything that
could cause the disintegration of Nigeria, which would take us all
downhill.''

dangerous Soviet Union, than it did a triumphant United States.
</P>
<P>
   Few African countries have experienced anything like the
devastation of the Nigerian civil war at the close of the 1960s,
which began with a secession bid by the oil-rich southeast. And, as
that conflict showed clearly, no other country on the continent has
anything like the ability to inundate its neighbors with refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Abacha may deserve some of the posthumous accolades being given
to him by his fellows as a great statesman, pan-Africanist or
nationalist, but no leader before him left power with his country
in a more degraded and potentially explosive state. Indeed, before
an officially declared week of mourning was half over, angry
protesters, readily citing the recent example of ``people's power''
in Indonesia, were facing off with soldiers in the streets of
Nigeria's capital, Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Ghana's president, Jerry Rawlings, a former soldier who himself
twice took power in coups after uprisings and was only later
elected as a civilian, was one of the few African statesmen to
speak candidly last week about the downside of Abacha's legacy: a
fractured and volatile nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a prayer for Nigeria,'' Rawlings said in an
interview with the BBC, minutes after learning of Abacha's death.
``For the commanders and the politicians not to do anything that
could cause the disintegration of Nigeria, which would take us all
downhill.''

<P>
   More than two years before Election Day, polls say a Republican
front-runner in the 2000 presidential race has already emerged. He
is a one-term governor who has never run for national office but
has, according to one recent poll, already overtaken Vice President
Al Gore, the popular Democrat who has been running for the White
House for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just any governor. This is George W. Bush, the
governor of Texas, not to be confused with his father, George
Herbert Walker Bush, the former president who also lives in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies a problem that is confounding pollsters as they
consider the campaign ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush's political abilities notwithstanding, there is
growing evidence that these early polls _ which also show Bush
dominating a primary field of experienced Republican candidates _
prove little more than that the public has yet to distinguish
between the former president and the current governor. Many of the
people who tell pollsters they favor Bush are actually thinking of
the father. There really is no other explanation for why, two and a
half years before the election, a figure so new to national life
would have catapulted to the front of the presidential field,
pollsters say.
</P>
<P>
   This is no small matter. Polls are a driving influence in
presidential politics, and probably never more so than during this
formative period before the real campaign. The public may pay only
passing attention to the embryonic race now, but polls establishing
Bush as the front-runner pay a dividend in the form of financial
donations and early endorsements, as contributors and politicians
try to be first in line behind the eventual winner.
</P>
<P>
   And polls shape news. A poll by the Gallup Organization and USA
Today showing Gore losing to Bush (50 percent to 46 percent)
produced an article last month headlined, ``Poll Gives Bush Edge
Over Gore for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which has given Bush _ the governor _ a decided advantage
over rivals who can't claim a president as a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number is inflated to such an extent that it's likely to
freeze the field, and keep other candidates from lining up
supporters,'' said Mark Halperin, the political director of ABC
News. ``Because no one else is even close to him, it feeds on
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to take away from the younger Bush's assets as
a candidate. He is young, 51 (his father turned 74 on Friday) and
vibrant, a powerful presence, a strong speaker with popular
positions on major issues; he also comes from a state that has
produced its share of national political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican leaders, people who really can tell George W.
from George H.W., consider him the front-runner on merit. From that
perspective, the happenstance of Bush's last name only hastened the
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the public, though, things are a muddle, and
that worries some pollsters. ``We've had to make an adjustment in
our polling,'' said Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster. ``In our
NBC-Wall Street Journal polling, we often refer to him as either
George W. Bush of Texas, or governor-of-Texas-George-Bush, as a way
of saying to the voters, `No, you're not voting for the old man,
you're voting for the son.' It is a clear adjustment. We're trying
to get as accurate a gauge as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup poll identifies Bush as ``Texas Gov. George W.
Bush,'' while the Harris Poll refers to him as Bush Jr., the
governor of Texas. The chairman of the Harris Poll, Humphrey
Taylor, argued that was enough. He said his polling showed growing
support for Bush and that such a trend shows that voters are
familiar with him. (He was the choice of 7 percent of Republican
respondents in January 1997, and 13 percent this past February).
</P>
<P>
   But the practice of giving Bush a title in polls raises another
problem: It confers a hint of prestige that other candidates
identified only by name do not have. Lamar Alexander, for example,
is the former governor of Tennessee, but pollsters never call him
``Governor Alexander.'' Thus, pollsters worry, a technique used to
blunt one advantage that Bush enjoys with voters might simply give
him another.
</P>
<P>
   There is already hard evidence that at this early stage of the
campaign voters do not know the difference between two career
politicians from Texas who look and sound like, well, father and
son.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times poll conducted from May 19 to May 21 asked
respondents their opinion of ``several members of the Bush family,
starting with the former president.'' Former President Bush is held
in high esteem: 73 percent of the registered voters in the poll had
an opinion of George Bush, and 66 percent of them regarded him
favorably.
</P>
<P>
   The question then moved to Barbara Bush before settling on the
son, who was identified both as ``George W. Bush'' and ``Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.'' In this sequence of questioning, more than 70
percent of respondents had no opinion, positive or negative, of
Bush the governor. That is in line with what pollsters expect for
someone who has never run for president before, and it calls
seriously into question the accuracy of other polls that show him
leading the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster William McInturff said his firm identified
Bush as the governor of Texas in some experimental polling earlier
this year. But if he works on the 2000 race, he said, he would
adjust his procedures for a more accurate measurement of the
governor's standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were doing this for real,'' McInturff said, ``and there
was real money at stake, we would ask people after they pick him,
`Can you tell me a little bit about what you know about him?''' so
you could see what percent are talking about the former
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican voters are more likely to know the difference between
the two Bushes, and Bush's opponents will certainly do all they can
to help voters distinguish the governor from his father once the
race begins in earnest. But there is also a cynical view of the
uses of confusion: that voters who are confused with pollsters now
will remain confused when it comes time to vote.
</P>
<P>
   From that perspective, the polls today are entirely correct even
if the voters are entirely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a long time to sort this one out,'' said
Stephen Hess, the presidential scholar. ``There's no way you can do
it with showing each respondent a picture of George Herbert Walker
Bush and a picture of George W. Bush and saying which one are you
for?''
</P>
<P>
   Hess sighed. ``I don't know what they can do. We're just going
to have to live with this one.''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ If you want to know what is wrong with the movie
business, just ask Lionel Chetwynd. Chetwynd has written the
scripts for more than a dozen successful movies and says he has
been frustrated in his efforts to take his career a step higher.
The problem is not quality, he argued _ his films like ``The
Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz'' and ``Kissinger and Nixon'' have
won widespread praise.
</P>
<P>
   No, he insisted, the barrier is his politics: Chetwynd is a
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has a reputation _ though much disputed _ as one of
the country's staunchest bastions of liberalism, led by the likes
of Barbra Streisand, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, all
friends of President Clinton (who was scheduled to be here Saturday
for a fund-raiser). The real problem, Chetwynd said, is not simply
what the Hollywood establishment believes but the fact that it
shuns those who dare to think differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no longer a blacklist in this business,'' claimed
Chetwynd, who helped found a conservative group here called the
Wednesday Morning Club and has long insisted that there is a
liberal bias. ``There's something else, and it's called a white
list. It's the people who get the best jobs. And it's very hard to
get on the white list if you're conservative. Being a conservative
here is taken to mean, `I'm not a good person.' Conservatism is
dealt with as a disease, as a pathology.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's political leanings were highlighted last week by the
election of Charlton Heston, the 73-year-old Academy Award winner,
as president of the highly conservative National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Heston said that at the top of his agenda as head of the NRA
would be a campaign of outing the huge number of gun owners in
Hollywood. This public naming would be his way of letting them know
that it was OK to express what he regards as their true,
conservative views, openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puzzles me, the number of major, major stars who are gun
users and won't say anything,'' Heston said in an interview.
``They're scared it will hurt their careers, but what can they
lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Those views are rejected by many people here. Though liberals
have long flourished in Hollywood, despite the redbaiting of the
blacklist era, so have conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stars _ Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Mel
Gibson among them _ are known for holding nonliberal views, and
they enjoy stellar careers. And none other than Rupert Murdoch, a
man of deeply conservative convictions, controls 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   When members of the entertainment industry have gone into public
life, they have more often than not been, like Heston, from the
right. George Murphy, Ronald Reagan and Sonny Bono were all
Republicans. Louis B. Mayer and many other legends of Hollywood
were known for their strong conservative views and anti-union
biases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back 30 years, at that time the studios were very
conservative,'' said Lew Wasserman, the former chairman of MCA and
for decades the industry's most influential figure in Washington.
``The liberals only came out after Kennedy came into office, but
I'll bet if you did a secret poll, Hollywood would look identical
to the rest of the country politically. It's never been a
monolithic community, and the only people who suffered were people
who didn't have what it took to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is now dominated by huge, pragmatic companies: Time
Warner, General Electric, Walt Disney Co. and others. These
companies give generously to Democrats and Republicans because they
engage in many businesses in many parts of the world; they often
need government help on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, money flowing from Hollywood to Washington has
become more evenly distributed between the two parties. The Center
for Responsive Politics said Hollywood's political action
committees donated $1.54 million to Republican candidates and $1.04
million to Democrats in campaigns in 1995 and 1996. That marked the
first time Republicans received more than Democrats. Since then,
audiences here have greeted numerous Republicans, including House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, Reps. Henry Hyde and John Kasich, Sens.
Trent Lott and Arlen Specter and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple, in this town, the name of the game is making
money,'' said Pat Kingsley, a top publicist and former Democratic
fund-raiser. ``The bottom line for everybody is, `What can make my
movie a success.' People ask about box office, not litmus tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Rob Reiner, known for his liberalism, is negotiating
with Bruce Willis to appear in ``The Story of Us,'' without any
apparent concerns about Willis' right-leaning views. Even Chetwynd
conceded that dollars and cents come first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to understand about Hollywood's liberalism is it
stops at the studio gates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gelbart, who co-wrote the play ``A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum,'' and wrote the screenplay for the movie
``Barbarians at the Gate,'' said that despite the conventional
wisdom, many entertainment leaders have long held to conservative
views, even though it has been convenient for some people to
describe the industry otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the traditional function of the right, to make it
look as though Hollywood has been taken over by the left,'' Gelbart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of
America, the industry's Washington trade group, summed up the
attitude here. ``This business is pretty focused,'' he said. ``The
question is, can this idea or this actor tell a story so well that
people are going to pay to put their butts in a seat and watch it?
The idea that there's a test is a canard.''

   CHINA-AIRPOLLUTION (Beijing) _ The severity of China's air
pollution, now openly acknowledged by the government, has propelled
environmental issues onto the agenda of the Chinese-American summit
meeting that is to take place later this month. Chinese officials
say they are eager to have Washington's technical help in the
battle for cleaner air. By Elisabeth Rosenthal. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   CLIMATE-TALKS (Bonn, Germany) _ Six months ago in Kyoto, Japan,
delegates from around the world agreed for the first time to make
specific, legally binding reductions in industrialized countries'
emissions of heat-trapping gases believed to affect Earth's
climate. Now negotiators grappling with the details of putting the
first cuts into effect are finding the task as difficult as that of
hammering out the original accord. By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-PRESS-LAWS (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Turkey has some of the
most restrictive press laws of any country professing democracy.
Journalists who challenge long-established taboos risk falling
afoul of the anti-terror law, which bans propaganda for Kurdish
guerrillas or other groups that are considered threats to the
nation. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   KASHMIR-CONTROVERSY (Chakothi, Kashmir) _ For the flashpoint of
a potential nuclear war, the fields in this Jhelum River valley
present a tranquil, bucolic scene. Water buffalo tug at crude
plows. Shoots of rice are beginning to sprout from watery,
mud-walled rectangles. But in the mountains jutting above, up the
steep dirt switchbacks, is the ``Line of Confrontation,'' a
550-mile chain of sandbagged trenches and concrete bunkers where
the Pakistani Army is dug in. Across the valley are almost
identical Indian fortifications. By John Kifner. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-AMWAY (Warsaw) _ A documentary that takes a caustic look
at the Polish operations of the American direct-sales company Amway
has set off an unusually strenuous debate here about press freedom.
By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-PEACE (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Like an increasing
number of Protestant and Catholic people here, Penny Purdy says she
is beginning to feel, with some vestigial caution, that after 30
bloody years, peace may well have arrived to stay in Northern
Ireland. By James F. Clarity.

   BENEFITS-GAP _ Since the 1970s, the gap in wages between skilled
and unskilled workers has widened sharply. But new research shows
the inequality doesn't stop there. Discrepancies in job benefits
and the quality of work life have also grown, pointing to a bigger
chasm than previously recognized. By Peter Passell.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-KILLINGS-TREND (Moses Lake, Wash.) _ While precise
answers may be elusive, the recent killing sprees in schools share
a remarkable number of common traits. The first of the rural,
multiple-victim student shootings, here in Moses Lake, looks in
many respects like a road map of what was to come. From this case
and interviews with police officers, prosecutors, psychologists and
parents of the attackers _ as well as the boys' own words _ several
patterns emerge. By Timothy Egan.
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS-MORMONS (Salt Lake City) _ Over the last week, members
of two of the most determinedly missionary faiths in the United
States, the Southern Baptist Convention and the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, have been coming face to face in what
has been a courteous if somewhat wary encounter. That it has been
happening here, on ground that the 19th-century Mormon leader
Brigham Young declared a modern-day Zion, is the work of the
Southern Baptists. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   NY-CHINESE-THEATER (New York) _ For decades, Chinese immigrants
flocked to Chinatown's eight or so Chinese-language movie theaters
because the movies delivered about the only entertainment around
and because the theaters afforded a sense of community and comfort.
But soon, New York City's last Chinese-language theater, the Music
Palace, will take its final bow, its faded three-story structure to
be demolished and replaced by a gleaming office building. By David
W. Chen.
</P>
<P>
   ILL-HAMAS-SUSPECT (Bridgeview, Ill.) _ The house on Thomas
Street in this suburb 15 miles southwest of Chicago has a red rose
bush growing under the front window, fishing rods leaning against
the door and two boys in Bulls T-shirts shooting baskets in the
drive. But, according to federal authorities, these stock images of
middle-American life are deceiving: this is the home of a man who
has operated secretly as a high-ranking member of the Islamic
terrorist organization Hamas, they say. By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-BILINGUAL-FOE (Palo Alto, Calif.) _ Ron Unz, the man who
beat bilingual education in the nation's most populous state, is no
slick demagogue or smooth revolutionary. By Frank Bruni. (With
photo.)
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-SALAMANDER (Austin, Texas) _ Last year, Austin
environmentalists declared a major victory when, after a five-year
battle, the Interior Department agreed to add the Barton Springs
salamander to the list of endangered species. But now that victory
is looking hollow.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENT-MEDIATION (Washington) _ Seeking to curb the sharp
rise in litigation over environmental disputes, Congress has
created the first federally financed institute to encourage
mediation as an alternative to trial.
</P>

   INDIA-PAKISTAN-WHEAT (Washington) _ Under pressure from farmers,
the government is poised to re-allow the sale of wheat to India and
Pakistan despite economic sanctions by the United States against
those countries for their recent nuclear tests. By Katharine Q.
Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-HOSPITAL-FRAUD _ A congressional effort to adopt a law
making it more difficult for prosecutors to bring cases against
hospitals under a federal fraud statute has lost support and no
longer has the votes to pass, sponsors of the legislation say. By
Kurt Eichenwald.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-TOBACCO (Washington)_ The anti-smoking bill now before
the Senate has strayed far afield. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   RACE-CATEGORIES (Washington) _ After years of study, the Clinton
administration decided last October that people could, for the
first time, identify themselves as members of more than one racial
group when they fill out federal forms. That was the easy part. By

the country's staunchest bastions of liberalism, led by the likes
of Barbra Streisand, Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg, all
friends of President Clinton (who was scheduled to be here Saturday
for a fund-raiser). The real problem, Chetwynd said, is not simply
what the Hollywood establishment believes but the fact that it
shuns those who dare to think differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no longer a blacklist in this business,'' claimed
Chetwynd, who helped found a conservative group here called the
Wednesday Morning Club and has long insisted that there is a
liberal bias. ``There's something else, and it's called a white
list. It's the people who get the best jobs. And it's very hard to
get on the white list if you're conservative. Being a conservative
here is taken to mean, `I'm not a good person.' Conservatism is
dealt with as a disease, as a pathology.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's political leanings were highlighted last week by the
election of Charlton Heston, the 73-year-old Academy Award winner,
as president of the highly conservative National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Heston said that at the top of his agenda as head of the NRA
would be a campaign of outing the huge number of gun owners in
Hollywood. This public naming would be his way of letting them know
that it was OK to express what he regards as their true,
conservative views, openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puzzles me, the number of major, major stars who are gun
users and won't say anything,'' Heston said in an interview.
``They're scared it will hurt their careers, but what can they
lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Those views are rejected by many people here. Though liberals
have long flourished in Hollywood, despite the redbaiting of the
blacklist era, so have conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stars _ Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis and Mel
Gibson among them _ are known for holding nonliberal views, and
they enjoy stellar careers. And none other than Rupert Murdoch, a
man of deeply conservative convictions, controls 20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   When members of the entertainment industry have gone into public
life, they have more often than not been, like Heston, from the
right. George Murphy, Ronald Reagan and Sonny Bono were all
Republicans. Louis B. Mayer and many other legends of Hollywood
were known for their strong conservative views and anti-union
biases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go back 30 years, at that time the studios were very
conservative,'' said Lew Wasserman, the former chairman of MCA and
for decades the industry's most influential figure in Washington.
``The liberals only came out after Kennedy came into office, but
I'll bet if you did a secret poll, Hollywood would look identical
to the rest of the country politically. It's never been a
monolithic community, and the only people who suffered were people
who didn't have what it took to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is now dominated by huge, pragmatic companies: Time
Warner, General Electric, Walt Disney Co. and others. These
companies give generously to Democrats and Republicans because they
engage in many businesses in many parts of the world; they often
need government help on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, money flowing from Hollywood to Washington has
become more evenly distributed between the two parties. The Center
for Responsive Politics said Hollywood's political action
committees donated $1.54 million to Republican candidates and $1.04
million to Democrats in campaigns in 1995 and 1996. That marked the
first time Republicans received more than Democrats. Since then,
audiences here have greeted numerous Republicans, including House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, Reps. Henry Hyde and John Kasich, Sens.
Trent Lott and Arlen Specter and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple, in this town, the name of the game is making
money,'' said Pat Kingsley, a top publicist and former Democratic
fund-raiser. ``The bottom line for everybody is, `What can make my
movie a success.' People ask about box office, not litmus tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Rob Reiner, known for his liberalism, is negotiating
with Bruce Willis to appear in ``The Story of Us,'' without any
apparent concerns about Willis' right-leaning views. Even Chetwynd
conceded that dollars and cents come first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing to understand about Hollywood's liberalism is it
stops at the studio gates,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gelbart, who co-wrote the play ``A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum,'' and wrote the screenplay for the movie
``Barbarians at the Gate,'' said that despite the conventional
wisdom, many entertainment leaders have long held to conservative
views, even though it has been convenient for some people to
describe the industry otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the traditional function of the right, to make it
look as though Hollywood has been taken over by the left,'' Gelbart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of
America, the industry's Washington trade group, summed up the
attitude here. ``This business is pretty focused,'' he said. ``The
question is, can this idea or this actor tell a story so well that
people are going to pay to put their butts in a seat and watch it?
The idea that there's a test is a canard.''

<P>
   CHINA-AIRPOLLUTION (Beijing) _ The severity of China's air
pollution, now openly acknowledged by the government, has propelled
environmental issues onto the agenda of the Chinese-American summit
meeting that is to take place later this month. Chinese officials
say they are eager to have Washington's technical help in the
battle for cleaner air. By Elisabeth Rosenthal. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   CLIMATE-TALKS (Bonn, Germany) _ Six months ago in Kyoto, Japan,
delegates from around the world agreed for the first time to make
specific, legally binding reductions in industrialized countries'
emissions of heat-trapping gases believed to affect Earth's
climate. Now negotiators grappling with the details of putting the
first cuts into effect are finding the task as difficult as that of
hammering out the original accord. By William K. Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-PRESS-LAWS (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Turkey has some of the
most restrictive press laws of any country professing democracy.
Journalists who challenge long-established taboos risk falling
afoul of the anti-terror law, which bans propaganda for Kurdish
guerrillas or other groups that are considered threats to the
nation. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   KASHMIR-CONTROVERSY (Chakothi, Kashmir) _ For the flashpoint of
a potential nuclear war, the fields in this Jhelum River valley
present a tranquil, bucolic scene. Water buffalo tug at crude
plows. Shoots of rice are beginning to sprout from watery,
mud-walled rectangles. But in the mountains jutting above, up the
steep dirt switchbacks, is the ``Line of Confrontation,'' a
550-mile chain of sandbagged trenches and concrete bunkers where
the Pakistani Army is dug in. Across the valley are almost
identical Indian fortifications. By John Kifner. (With graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-AMWAY (Warsaw) _ A documentary that takes a caustic look
at the Polish operations of the American direct-sales company Amway
has set off an unusually strenuous debate here about press freedom.
By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-PEACE (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Like an increasing
number of Protestant and Catholic people here, Penny Purdy says she
is beginning to feel, with some vestigial caution, that after 30
bloody years, peace may well have arrived to stay in Northern
Ireland. By James F. Clarity.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL: &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BENEFITS-GAP _ Since the 1970s, the gap in wages between skilled
and unskilled workers has widened sharply. But new research shows
the inequality doesn't stop there. Discrepancies in job benefits
and the quality of work life have also grown, pointing to a bigger
chasm than previously recognized. By Peter Passell.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-KILLINGS-TREND (Moses Lake, Wash.) _ While precise
answers may be elusive, the recent killing sprees in schools share
a remarkable number of common traits. The first of the rural,
multiple-victim student shootings, here in Moses Lake, looks in
many respects like a road map of what was to come. From this case
and interviews with police officers, prosecutors, psychologists and
parents of the attackers _ as well as the boys' own words _ several
patterns emerge. By Timothy Egan.
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS-MORMONS (Salt Lake City) _ Over the last week, members
of two of the most determinedly missionary faiths in the United
States, the Southern Baptist Convention and the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints, have been coming face to face in what
has been a courteous if somewhat wary encounter. That it has been
happening here, on ground that the 19th-century Mormon leader
Brigham Young declared a modern-day Zion, is the work of the
Southern Baptists. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   NY-CHINESE-THEATER (New York) _ For decades, Chinese immigrants
flocked to Chinatown's eight or so Chinese-language movie theaters
because the movies delivered about the only entertainment around
and because the theaters afforded a sense of community and comfort.
But soon, New York City's last Chinese-language theater, the Music
Palace, will take its final bow, its faded three-story structure to
be demolished and replaced by a gleaming office building. By David
W. Chen.
</P>
<P>
   ILL-HAMAS-SUSPECT (Bridgeview, Ill.) _ The house on Thomas
Street in this suburb 15 miles southwest of Chicago has a red rose
bush growing under the front window, fishing rods leaning against
the door and two boys in Bulls T-shirts shooting baskets in the
drive. But, according to federal authorities, these stock images of
middle-American life are deceiving: this is the home of a man who
has operated secretly as a high-ranking member of the Islamic
terrorist organization Hamas, they say. By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-BILINGUAL-FOE (Palo Alto, Calif.) _ Ron Unz, the man who
beat bilingual education in the nation's most populous state, is no
slick demagogue or smooth revolutionary. By Frank Bruni. (With
photo.)
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-SALAMANDER (Austin, Texas) _ Last year, Austin
environmentalists declared a major victory when, after a five-year
battle, the Interior Department agreed to add the Barton Springs
salamander to the list of endangered species. But now that victory
is looking hollow.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENT-MEDIATION (Washington) _ Seeking to curb the sharp
rise in litigation over environmental disputes, Congress has
created the first federally financed institute to encourage
mediation as an alternative to trial.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON: &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN-WHEAT (Washington) _ Under pressure from farmers,
the government is poised to re-allow the sale of wheat to India and
Pakistan despite economic sanctions by the United States against
those countries for their recent nuclear tests. By Katharine Q.
Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-HOSPITAL-FRAUD _ A congressional effort to adopt a law
making it more difficult for prosecutors to bring cases against
hospitals under a federal fraud statute has lost support and no
longer has the votes to pass, sponsors of the legislation say. By
Kurt Eichenwald.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-TOBACCO (Washington)_ The anti-smoking bill now before
the Senate has strayed far afield. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   RACE-CATEGORIES (Washington) _ After years of study, the Clinton
administration decided last October that people could, for the
first time, identify themselves as members of more than one racial
group when they fill out federal forms. That was the easy part. By
Steven A. Holmes.

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ The Chinese have an old saying, describing
donkey dung, that pokes fun at their culture's obsession with
appearances: ``Shiny on the outside, smelly within.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking good is important, in other words, even when a situation
is imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's visit to China, scheduled to begin June 25,
is likely to be about appearances more than anything else. No real
diplomatic breakthrough looks possible, since the United States and
China remain far apart on key issues like Taiwan and human rights.
With the Clinton administration extra sensitive to recent
accusations that it sold out national security for business
interests, no big commercial deals are likely to be showcased
either.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with China's leaders, who care about appearances
above all. Even without substance, the first visit by a U.S.
president since the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
in Tiananmen Square is tremendously important to Communist Party
bosses in Beijing, largely for the way it symbolizes approval of
their rule.
</P>
<P>
   Playing host to the president of the United States, and doing it
well, shores up the legitimacy of Chinese leaders before their own
people.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, some of China's critics in Washington have
called on Clinton to avoid, at the very least, participating in a
welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square _ the traditional red-carpet
welcome that Beijing insists upon. Many members of Congress argue
that China should be punished for its abysmal record on human
rights and arms proliferation. In response, Clinton made the case
last week that sticking to a policy of cooperation and engagement
with China offers more reward than risk.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides of this debate gloss over the larger and far more
important reality: contacts between the two countries are now
primarily characterized by a deeply enmeshed commercial
relationship _ not to mention an array of educational and cultural
exchanges _ that leaves the two governments to play a steadily
smaller and less significant role.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, President Richard M. Nixon's visit to China was
critically important to any Chinese or U.S. citizen who wanted to
do business or even travel between the two countries. In 1998,
whether or not Clinton goes to China will have little noticeable
effect on the billions of dollars of goods now traded in each
direction, or on the hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Americans
who travel between the two countries to work, study and teach. To
them, Clinton's visit represents little more than an affirmation of
an economic reality that is streaking far ahead of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The countless Chinese consumers who sip Coca-Cola and wear
Motorola pagers reflect the commercial ties between China and the
United States that are here to stay, no matter what Congress or the
White House has to say.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States were to revoke China's normal or
``most favored nation'' trading status _ a step no administration
has taken since it was first granted in 1980 _ the only effect
would be higher U.S. tariffs on some Chinese exports, while U.S.
sales within China would no doubt continue to roar ahead. Smile
</P>
<P>
   With this economic reality as the backdrop, and with Clinton's
visit concerned with gloss over substance, he and his Chinese hosts
next week will likely concentrate on camera angles.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal, for Chinese leaders, is a seamless cascade of
televised images showing Clinton in one picturesque Chinese setting
after another, alternately wowed by the majesty of the Great Wall
and charmed by the humble kindness of villagers _ and, most
important, standing shoulder to shoulder with President Jiang
Zemin, as they look out on the world as equals.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmare, in the Chinese view, would be an unexpected
disruption of Clinton's trip by political dissidents. That could be
interpreted by the Chinese people as an embarrassing sign that
their leaders are not in control.
</P>
<P>
   Such a nightmare actually occurred when Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev visited China in May 1989. Student demonstrations
engulfed Beijing in the weeks before his arrival, and protests
spread to cities throughout the nation during his five-day visit.
It wasn't until weeks later that the democratic clamorings were
brutally subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Both dissidents and the authorities are mindful of the Gorbachev
experience. Dissidents in China know that when a major foreign
leader comes to town, the authorities are loath to crack heads in
public, making it a good time to get out a message. And the
authorities know they know. So China's security services are now
working overtime to snuff out any flicker of dissidence well before
Clinton's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Such repression and the overall importance that China's leaders
attach to the Clinton visit are measures of how insecure they are,
not only regarding their own authority, but also regarding China's
place in the world. China plays an odd role on the world stage,
wielding veto power at the United Nations in a way that the West
generally views as responsible, even as Beijing is having a hard
time shedding its reputation as a rogue inclined to irresponsibly
traffic in arms and missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   China's ambiguous international stature may reflect a deeper
conflict in its sense of itself. Despite the nation's size and
growing economic power, its leaders mix an ancient sense of
superiority with a more modern realization that China is inferior
to most of the world in terms of wealth and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit is indeed largely symbolic. But looking good is
important when the situation is imperfect.

COMMENTARY: GETTING THE `GET' OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The last thing William Ginsburg was heard babbling
excitedly about, before they led him away, was that he was going on
vacation with Diane Sawyer to her home in Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill's five minutes are up. The giddy ride is over. The cozy
lunches with Cokie Roberts in her ABC office. The power lunches at
chic Manhattan restaurants with Barbara Walters and Mike Wallace.
The coffee and danish and galas at Time magazine with Walter
Isaacson. The basketball games and dinners and CNN limos with Wolf
Blitzer. All those heady moments of seduction, like the time the
bow-tied lawyer got a call on his cell phone from Ms. Sawyer,
wanting to sweet-talk him about getting Monica for ``Prime Time
Live,'' while he was already lunching at the Four Seasons with
Wallace of ``60 Minutes.'' (Taking the phone, Wallace playfully
instructed his glamorous ABC rival, ``Diane, please don't bother us
during lunch.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg is no longer the Cerberus at the gate of the Big
Enchilada, the Monica Lewinsky Interview. If Monica keeps confiding
_ as I'm told she has on at least one occasion _ that she thinks
that she and her true love, the president, may still have a future
together, the interview will surely rank as the ``get'' of the
century, dwarfing such past gets as Tonya Harding and Heidi Fleiss.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists were hesitant to point out what a clown Ginsburg
was, and what a bizarre dad Bernard Lewinsky was, because the two
men held the key to the Monica Interview. The press patiently put
up with Ginsburg's ballooning ego, hoping he'd deliver an exclusive
with the Purported Presidential Lollipop. And the California lawyer
egged on his panting pursuers, dangling the first print interview
to one, the first prime time interview to another, the first news
magazine interview to a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ginsburg was so high maintenance, it was astounding,'' said
one top editor. ``He would come by to talk and stay for hours. He
would call the next week and rant and rave about how horribly he
was being treated.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Ginsburg has been banished back to Malpracticeland, and
the media big shots are left ripping up their $2 tickets on a
losing nag.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image that comes to mind is one from the unenlightened
era,'' said Jeff Greenfield of CNN. ``A guy takes a girl out and
doesn't get anywhere and whines: `You know what this cost me? Six
dinners at the Ritz, and drinks, and she ordered the shrimp
cocktail, and we had to take a taxi, a bus wasn't good enough. And
for what?' For five months, journalists have been putting William
Ginsburg on their expense tabs and listening to him talk all night
about his most exciting medical malpractice cases. And for what?''
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer is philosophical. ``I joke that I'd like to get my money
back from all the times taking him out to dinner,'' he said. ``But
look, Bill Ginsburg has been very good to all of us in TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The fickle media horde has moved on to Plato Cacheris and Jacob
Stein, Ms. Lewinsky's new gatekeepers. The swarm is camped in front
of Cacheris' law office downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Now Plato and Jake, as the two veteran Washington lawyers are
known, are getting the wheedling calls and pleading notes and
fawning invitations. ``Everybody calls and says, `Please, please,'
and they say, `Ha! Ha!''' Cokie Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's playing every angle, taking advantage of any
connection. Ms. Walters dealt with Cacheris when she did an
interview with his client, Fawn Hall. Blitzer got to know Cacheris
when he did an interview with another of his scandalous clients,
Aldrich Ames.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where notoriety and fame have converged, where
celebrity trumps accomplishment, Ginsburg's failure should be no
impediment to joy. He's likely to rise from the ashes any minute.
Perhaps Marcia Clark will take pity and let him sub for her when
she's subbing for Geraldo. Or perhaps he'll play host with Joseph
Cammarata on a Court TV show called ``Lawyers Jilted by Bimbos.''
</P>
<P>
   As everyone was ripping Ginsburg's private number from their
Rolodexes, one of his old New Friends took pity. ``I called his
answering machine,'' said Barbara Walters. ``I didn't want the poor
guy to feel: `Goodbye. I've dumped you.' I just said, `I wish you
good things.'''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ For 20 years, local officials carefully measured this
city's air pollution levels and equally carefully hid the results _
fearing that the truth might tarnish the capital's image or lead to
social unrest. This continued even as Beijing's famously blue sky
turned ever more gray and its surrounding hills disappeared behind
an acrid mist.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed a small miracle when, on Feb. 28, Beijing joined 38
other Chinese cities that have started to issue weekly air quality
reports in the last year. In newspapers and on television, they
parade a sometimes eclectic mix of statistics _ from levels of
nitrous oxides produced by car exhausts to the concentration of
tiny particles from coal burning in the air. And Chinese citizens
for the first time have hard information on the air they breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Despite technical flaws, the tangled mass of data has confirmed
what many Western scientists have suspected and at times measured:
that the air in China's cities is among the most polluted in the
world, and contains the highest levels of pollutants harmful to
human health. Recent research suggests that bad air in China causes
178,000 premature deaths each year.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of the pollution, now openly acknowledged by the
government, has propelled environmental issues onto the agenda of
the Chinese-American summit meeting that is to take place later
this month. Chinese officials say they are eager to have
Washington's technical help in the battle for cleaner air.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, the government's candor has created a new
political dynamic between the government and its people, feeding an
environmental consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air is bad _ you can read it in the newspapers,'' said
Zhang Jiyan, from her roadside bathing-suit stand in downtown
Beijing. ``Look, you can't even see tall buildings a few streets
from here.''
</P>
<P>
   People who six months ago might have peered out the window and
seen fog, or wu, now realize that it is pollution, or wuran. And
their anger in turn has encouraged local governments to develop
more ambitious, if not always realistic, programs to clean up the
air _ for example, requiring a number of car owners to install
catalytic converters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Releasing the numbers is a revolutionary concept for the
people and the government,'' said Lu Xinyuan, director of the
management division at the State Environmental Protection Agency.
``We were worried that the people would complain that air pollution
is too serious. Instead, the consciousness of people has been
raised. And they feel the government trusts them with the facts, so
we are gaining points by doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest another motive behind the sudden desire to bare
all: The weekly barrage of frightening statistics has generated
popular support for otherwise unpalatable government moves, like
shutting down inefficient state-owned enterprises, with the
inevitable loss of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they being so open about this?'' asked one Western
diplomat. ``It's because it dovetails with their economic agenda.
This way when the factory gets closed, the people want it to be
closed, even though the real reason it has to be closed is not for
pollution but for economics.''
</P>
<P>
   These days in Beijing, everyone is complaining about the air.
Since the weekly air quality reports began three months ago, the
city's air has ranked 4 on its 1-to-5 pollution scale (5 being the
worst) every week but two, said Yu Xiaoxuan, deputy director of the
Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Level-4 pollution can have serious health effects on people with
heart or lung problems, and could make others feel uncomfortable as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Many Beijing residents suspect that the truth is even worse _
after all, theirs is a leadership that until a few years ago shaved
degrees from summer temperatures in news reports in the name of
morale. Elderly people who used to exercise outside in the early
morning _ when pollution is usually worst _ are postponing their
exercises until later in the day, and ``fresh air'' weekend package
tours to the countryside have become popular.
</P>
<P>
   At the Beijing Children's Research Clinic, mothers carrying
hacking children and newly prescribed medicine are quick to
complain. Two-year-old Long Fei ``often gets sick with colds and
infections,'' said his mother, who identified herself only as Lin.
``You see it on TV. The air is not good, that's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Bank, five of the world's 10 most
polluted cities are in China, and despite some recent successful
efforts to combat the problem, pollutant levels are two to five
times the World Health Organization guidelines for safe exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is still among the world's most polluted countries,''
said Qu Geping, chairman of the National People's Congress' Natural
Resources and Environmental Protection Committee. ``Among 600
cities, 70 to 80 percent can't even meet our own air standards.''
</P>
<P>
   For years now, Qu has campaigned for greater openness in this
field, prodding China's cities to abide by a generally ignored 1987
law that required them to release data about their air. But last
year the State Council stepped up the pressure, and starting with
Nanjing in May 1997, dozens of cities have now complied.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many experts worry about the reliability of the reports,
according to Todd Johnson, an environmental economist at the World
Bank, since local environmental bureaus are often understaffed,
relying on old equipment and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also find the reports sometimes incomplete or confusing.
A number of cities, including Beijing, report only some of the vast
number of statistics they measure. And many report air quality
according to an ``air pollution index,'' with scores derived from a
formula that combines harmful and innocuous pollutants in such a
complex manner that even specialists have trouble interpreting its
significance.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Wang Lihua, a professor of environmental health at Beijing
Medical University, and her former student Xiping Xu, now at the
Harvard School of Public Health, have been studying pollution in
Beijing for more than 15 years. They say they do not entirely
understand how Beijing determines daily rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't always trust the data,'' Xu said. ``But in the end,
whether the number is 100 or 150 is not so important _ we know it's
very high. And this is a very good step to publish the information,
to let people gain knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious pollutant in most Chinese cities is tiny
airborne particles, measured as total suspended particles, produced
primarily by the burning of coal and, increasingly, car exhausts.
Mexico City's notoriously bad air contains different types of
pollutants, mostly small chemical compounds that are not thought to
be as dangerous to health.
</P>
<P>
   In China, coal also produces sulfur dioxide, the source of acid
rain. Cars add nitrous oxides.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of suspended particles, ``Chinese cities are among the
worst in the world _ that's just a fact,'' said Johnson, the World
Bank official. ``Because they are so dependent on coal, I can't
think of any city in the world that's as bad as the worst cities in
China.''
</P>
<P>
   No country is more dependent on coal. In China, which has only
limited access to oil and natural gas, coal powers huge factories,
fuels restaurant stoves and heats homes. In Beijing, where coal
produces 80 percent of energy, mountains of it fill courtyards,
especially in winter, and bicycles towing carts piled with coal
briquettes are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, there are 1.3 million cars registered in Beijing
today, compared with 200,000 a decade ago. And the average Chinese
car produces 10 to 15 times the exhaust of its American
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers have begun to document the toll that air
pollution is taking on human health here.
</P>
<P>
   In studies, Xu of Harvard and colleagues in China have found
that urban air pollution contributes to increased deaths from lung
and heart disease as well as to premature births and low birth
weight. They have also found that breathing Beijing's air depresses
lung function in otherwise healthy individuals and that on polluted
days, the number of hospital visits for coughs, shortness of breath
and wheezing skyrockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a city like Beijing, you've got 20,000 excess deaths at the
end of the year,'' Johnson said. (Beijing's population is 12
million.) ``You throw in a few badly polluted days and the old
person dies a few months earlier than otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The asthma rate has reached 5 percent in some areas around
factories. In tiny green exam rooms at the Beijing Children's
Hospital, respiratory specialists now see 60 wheezing, coughing
children a day.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hu Yiji, the hospital's director, said he believed
secondhand cigarette smoke was the biggest culprit, but
acknowledged pollution as a problem. ``With all the air pollution
reports lately many parents are very concerned,'' he said. ``We
tell parents if they smoke, to quit. And then we advise them to
take the kids to the suburbs when they can.''
</P>
<P>
   The central government recently announced plans to spend 1.2
percent of the GNP on pollution control and is desperately seeking
an alternative to coal. It is pumping natural gas to Beijing from
Shaanxi Province. It is negotiating with Russia to import gas. It
also has plans to close down urban factories and convert coal into
electricity near the coal mines to keep the pollution out of the
cities.
</P>
<P>
   At best, these changes could reduce reliance on coal to about 65
percent in 2000, from 75 percent this year. But they could have a
big impact on urban air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Cars have proved an easier problem to tackle. As of Jan. 1,
Beijing has banned the sale of leaded gas, and as of next year all
new cars must have catalytic converters. Police recently started
spot checks of tailpipe emissions, and fewer than 40 percent of
cars tested on the first day passed. Polluting owners have their
licenses revoked and are instructed to install catalytic
converters, at a cost of about $100.
</P>
<P>
   Yu, the environmental official, said that the city intended to
retire most taxis, which cannot meet standards even with the device
added.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has long required yearly emission checks, but enforcing
such laws is difficult. In a poor country like China, there is
persistent tension between wanting cleaner air and not having the
money to pay for it.

COMMENTARY: HIDDEN AGENDAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The governor of Wisconsin, Tommy Thompson, is expected to sign a
bill on Tuesday that would permit the state to take into custody
pregnant women who exhibit a serious and habitual ``lack of
self-control'' in the use of alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Women would be subject to the law from the moment of
fertilization. The law would not contain criminal sanctions, but
would allow the authorities to order a woman into treatment,
including ``inpatient treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Joanne Huelsman, a Republican and one of the original
sponsors of the legislation, had intended for it to apply only in
cases where a fetus had become viable. But a spokesman said last
week, ``Frankly, our colleagues disagreed.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is explicit on this point. It says, ``The Bill defines
`unborn child' as a human being from the time of fertilization to
the time of birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the agenda. The passage of laws purporting to
protect fetuses by declaring them ``persons'' is an accelerating
national trend. Thompson is also expected to sign a ``fetal
homicide'' bill on Tuesday. It provides for severe criminal
penalties for anyone who damages or destroys a fetus _ for example,
in an attack on a pregnant woman or an accident caused by a drunk
driver.
</P>
<P>
   The fetal homicide bill specifically excludes abortion. But the
underlying goal of the fetal protection movement is to have the
fetus defined as a person in as many venues as possible, thus, in
the long run, undermining a woman's right to have an abortion. If a
developing fetus becomes legally identical to a person, with all
the rights of a person, then a woman's right to an abortion
necessarily collapses. Abortion under those circumstances would
logically become, under the law, murder.
</P>
<P>
   Already the rights and bodily integrity of women are being
eroded in ways that are alarming. Under the Wisconsin legislation,
a legal guardian could be appointed to represent the interests of
the fetus of a woman taken into custody for abusing drugs or
alcohol. Thus, an adversarial situation is established. The woman
suddenly finds herself at war with her own body.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if that woman wanted to have an abortion? What
kind of tricky legal and ethical tightropes would the guardian of
the fetus then have to walk?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing in that statute that prohibits an order
preventing her from having an abortion,'' said Lynn Paltrow, a New
York lawyer who has represented public health groups in Wisconsin.
``Once the fetus, or the embryo, or pre-embryo _ because it's from
the moment of fertilization _ is identified as at risk, a guardian
ad litem can be appointed and can insist that everything a pregnant
woman does be supervised by a court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is the woman being punished, in the sense that her
life now comes under state scrutiny from the moment of
fertilization, but she is no longer allowed, like every other adult
citizen, to make her own medical decisions about prenatal care,
abortion or what kind of drug or alcohol treatment is best for
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws to protect fetuses inevitably are proposed in the most
humane and high-minded language, which makes it difficult to oppose
them. Who wouldn't want to guard against the terrible effects of
fetal alcohol syndrome, or the birth of children addicted to drugs?
And who would deny that some pregnant women behave in ways that are
irresponsible and dangerous?
</P>
<P>
   But laws that are hostile to women, that are designed to punish
them and thrust them into perverse conflicts with their own bodies,
are light years away from the best solutions. Alcoholism and drug
addiction are illnesses. But the fetal protection movement has not
been accompanied by any serious effort to provide women with the
alcohol and drug treatment that they need _ or even, for that
matter, adequate prenatal care. That is not part of the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   When South Carolina began locking up pregnant addicts for
criminal child abuse, there was no residential treatment for
pregnant addicts in the entire state. Wisconsin still has long
waiting lists of pregnant women seeking addiction services.
</P>
<P>
   Simply passing a law is easy, like popping a pill. But it is no
more effective than a pill in dealing with serious and complex
public health problems. If that were in fact the goal.

   Study after study has shown that the gains from post-1970s
economic growth have eluded unskilled workers. The median wage of
those with only a high school diploma fell by 6 percent, adjusted
for inflation, from 1980 to 1996, while the earnings of college
graduates rose by 12 percent. Though there have been indications in
recent months that a scarcity of workers in the surging American
economy has begun raising wages for those on the low end, the gain
has been modest so far and not enough to counter the decades-long
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, wages alone provide an incomplete picture of a worker's
standing. Though economists have long recognized the need to
incorporate working conditions and fringe benefits in any
comprehensive analysis, they have been stymied by a lack of
detailed data.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Brooks Pierce, an economist at the U.S. Department of
Labor, used confidential data regularly collected by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics from businesses to measure trends in total
compensation. The results are striking: While specialists had long
assumed that benefits acted as a leveling influence, particularly
because of government-required benefits like Social Security and
unemployment insurance, the opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, people in the top one-tenth of the work force made
$24.80 an hour, 3.95 times the $6.28 an hour for workers in the
bottom one-tenth. By 1996, the wage gap had widened, with the
high-end workers averaging $25.74 an hour, or 4.72 times the $5.46
an hour of those at the bottom. Wages for the purposes of Pierce's
study are all expressed in 1997 dollars to account for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The decline among unskilled workers is hardly surprising given
the increasing demands of an information-driven economy. But to
understand it requires a look at total compensation, which places a
value on benefits like health insurance, vacation time and pension
plans.
</P>
<P>
   By Pierce's calculation, the total compensation in 1982 of
workers in the top 10 percent _ $35.16 a hour _ was 4.56 times that
of workers in the bottom 10 percent _ $7.72 an hour. Fourteen years
later, the ratio had increased to 5.56 to 1, with highly paid
workers having gained $1.73 an hour and low-end workers having lost
93 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits led to a greater discrepancy in earnings between high-
and low-wage workers in both 1982 and 1996. Moreover, they were
responsible for one-tenth of the increasing disparity between the
working elite and the working poor over the 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits have long been perceived as a great equalizer. In
percentage terms, after all, a bare-bones $3,000 medical insurance
package adds more to the compensation of a worker making $20,000
than a full-frills $10,000 package for an executive earning
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, according to Pierce, is that a growing number of
workers at the bottom of the pay scale have lost access to key
employer-provided benefits.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of workers received paid holidays and
vacations in 1996, but less than 10 percent of those in the bottom
tenth received paid leave of any kind. Similarly, about 70 percent
of workers have pension plans, while less than 10 percent of those
in the bottom can count on any employer-financed retirement
benefits. Access to health insurance follows a similar pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Employers generally cannot deny benefits to lower-wage workers
without putting the tax-exempt status of those benefits at risk. So
how is this disparity in benefits possible?
</P>
<P>
   Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University whose own
research on medical benefits confirms Pierce's findings, points to
loopholes that allow companies to deny benefits to workers just
starting out and to workers not classified as full time.
``Employers are figuring out all sort of ways to discriminate
between employees they wish to keep and those who come and go,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would come as news to Mary Mendez, a 40-year-old
single mother who sorts apples in a packing plant in Wenatchee,
Wash., for $7.71 an hour. Her employer takes such a strict view
toward paid absences that she was docked for the hours she missed
while recovering from a minor accident at the plant. And while the
company does offer health insurance in an industry where fringes
are rare, she must contribute $21 a month to cover her child.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, employers have turned to temporary and contract
workers, whose pay packages do not include time off and other
benefits. United Parcel Service even endured a strike in which a
big issue was the company's desire to use more part-time workers to
hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even bigger surprise than the lack of benefits is how
little people with especially demanding or unpleasant jobs are
compensated for difficult working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Job hazards, everything from working in extreme temperatures to
working a dangerous, lonely night shift at a highway convenience
store, would seem to command higher wages than similar work under
less taxing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lillie Reed says her job as an aide in a nursing home in
Stamford, Conn., is dirty, sometimes dangerous _ and getting
harder.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, each nursing assistant cared for seven
patients. Today, it could be as many 16 on weekends. ``The people
coming to the home are older, sicker and angrier,'' she adds.
``It's really tough lifting them, dressing them and keeping them
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   By looking at arguably the best measure of job conditions, the
risk of injury, a new study by Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at
the University of Texas, found that workers on the low end of the
wage scale were falling ever further behind.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, workers in the top quarter of wage earners lost 38
percent more days to on-the-job injuries than workers in the bottom
quarter, Hamermesh found. By 1995, the pattern had reversed.
High-wage earners lost 32 percent less days than low-wage earners.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that only workers at the top end of the
wage scale are interested in their own health and safety. One
possible explanation for the failure to reduce injuries among low
earners, suggests Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton
University, is the declining power of labor unions. While employers
may know how dangerous a job is and how much it would cost to make
it safer, individual workers rarely do. A union may be able to even
the playing field by tracking health and safety issues and
negotiating improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation, favored by Hamermesh, is that all unskilled
workers _ union and nonunion _ have lost much ground over the last
two decades as skilled workers added so much more to corporate
productivity. ``Overall, workplace safety hasn't changed much,''
Hamermesh said. ``High-paid blue-collar workers with hazardous jobs
have simply become low-paid blue-collar workers in hazardous
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In sheer number, construction workers are probably the group
most affected. Asbestos workers in New York City are a good
illustration. In the late 1980s, the union wage for removing
asbestos insulation from old buildings was $31 an hour. But in the
1990s, an influx of largely Polish immigrants eager for even
hazardous jobs led to a rise in nonunion removal companies and a
collapse in wages for both groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contractors had no trouble getting workers for $12 to $15 an
hour _ and workers willing to do the job without respirators,''
said Pawel Kedzior, the business manager for Local 78 of the
Asbestos, Lead and Hazardous Waste Laborers.
</P>
<P>
   The local has made a comeback under new leadership, recruiting
1,200 Polish and 500 Hispanic members. But the current union wage
of $19.90 an hour for asbestos removal _ sometimes with little
effort to protect workers from asbestos detritus _ is the
contemporary reality of the market for unskilled labor.
</P>
<P>
   After making some assumptions about the value of job safety,
Hamermesh found that the increased risk of injury between
high-paying and low-paying work had significantly compounded wage
inequality. By his calculation, the change in injury rates
magnifies the growth in the wage gap by as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To many advocates for the poor, such evidence underscores the
importance of enforcing health and safety regulations and of
encouraging employers to provide benefits to low-wage earners.
Economists do not disagree, but they say that the relatively low
productivity of unskilled workers is the root of the problem and
warn that it is not so easily solved.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in amenities and benefits for these people would
almost certainly lead to downward pressure on wages or increased
unemployment. ``There's no obvious way around it,'' said Krueger of
Princeton. ``At the end of the day, mandated improvements in
working conditions would most likely be paid for by wage cuts.''

<P>
   The conspiracy theorists have it all wrong. The U.S. government
is not run by Freemasons. Or by the pope. Or by Jewish bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The American people are entitled to the truth: the government is
run by Southern Baptists, a denomination recently in the news for
boycotting Disney, proselytizing Jews and, just last week,
declaring that wives should submit to their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The country's highest elected officials are Southern Baptists:
President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, Senate President Pro Tem Strom Thurmond, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   If some disaster were to befall the president, the first three
officials eligible to succeed him would be you-know-what, which is
a remarkable shift from the era when the prototypical Washington
politician was, like former President George Bush, an Episcopalian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're no longer out in the cold,'' said Richard Land,
president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious
Liberty Commission. ``We're on the inside now. We don't have to
explain to Bill Clinton and Al Gore how important Southern Baptists
are to the political life of this nation. We had to explain it to
George Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominance of Southern Baptists in top leadership is in many
ways testimony to the sway of the South in national elections these
days. If Minnesota and Wisconsin dominated American politics,
Lutherans might be running the country. A majority of the South's
population is Baptist, and of the various Baptist groups and
denominations (which include American Baptists, Free Will Baptists
and the predominantly black National Baptists), the Southern
Baptist Convention has grown into the nation's largest Protestant
denomination, with nearly 16 million members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Southern states, the big church in the middle of town IS
the Southern Baptist church,'' said Arthur E. Farnsley, research
director at The Polis Center at Indiana University-Purdue
University at Indianapolis, who wrote ``Southern Baptist Politics''
(Penn State Press, 1994). ``It is mainstream culture there.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four decades, the religious affiliations of
members of Congress have shifted, according to James T. Duke, a
professor of sociology at Brigham Young University. The number of
senators and representatives who are members of liberal and
moderate Protestant denominations like Presbyterians, Episcopalians
and Methodists has fallen to 249 in the 1995-1997 years from 335 in
1960. Yet the number of conservative to fundamentalist Protestants,
including Southern Baptist and Assembly of God churches, has
remained steady, rising minimally from 71 in 1960 to 77 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So who has taken the seats vacated by the liberal and moderate
Protestants? Duke found that they are now occupied by those who,
only 50 years ago, were Washington outsiders: Catholics, Jews and
Mormons. In the 86th Congress in 1960, there were 102 Catholics, 12
Jews and 7 Mormons. By the 104th Congress in 1995, there were 147
Catholics, 32 Jews and 14 Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   So the current slate of ``Big Six'' Southern Baptist politicians
may be more coincidence than destiny. And their religious
affiliation probably has little impact on public policy, for
Southern Baptists see eye to eye about as often as Clinton and
Thurmond do. Such independence of thought is thoroughly Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, Baptists have held the position that people
should be free in their consciences, and that ultimately you are
accountable to God directly,'' said Larry Ingram, professor of
sociology at the University of Tennessee at Martin, who has written
about Southern Baptists. ``You're not accountable to the church.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 20-year struggle, conservatives have saturated the
leadership of the Southern Baptist Convention, producing
eyebrow-raising, newsmaking decisions. At their meeting last week
in Salt Lake City, they voted to amend their statement of faith to
say that a wife should ``submit herself graciously'' to her
husband. Last year, they announced a boycott of Disney because they
believe that it condones homosexuality. Two years ago, they voted
to appoint a missionary to evangelize Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptists are known for what many would call a liberal
tradition of championing religious freedom. Roger Williams was,
briefly, a Baptist when he founded the Rhode Island colony as a
haven for persecuted Christians. As the Baptists spread south, they
preached their belief in religious freedom and pushed the
Continental Congress to guarantee the separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of this libertarian impulse, Baptists have a
history of breaking away from their breakaway groups. Debates over
slavery, liberalism and fundamentalism have divided them in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the conservatives have solidified their takeover of the
Southern Baptist Convention, the moderates have formed the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. About 1,600 churches are
redirecting their denominational contributions to the Cooperative
Baptist Fellowship, though most have not renounced their
affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention. Yet the
fellowship is one indicator of diversity among Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be a member of a Southern Baptist church that ordains
women to the ministry, that is open and affirming of gay and
lesbian people, that is way left-wing peacenik,'' said Nancy
Ammerman, a sociologist of religion at Hartford Seminary. ``They
are there, not very many of them, and most of them are way
alienated from the current denomination's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   At Washington cocktail parties, said James Dunn, executive
director of the Baptist Joint Committee, people are often shocked
to learn that he is a Southern Baptist. ``I tell them I'm a Bill
Moyers-Barbara Jordan-Jimmy Carter kind of Baptist,'' he said.
``You can see it dawn in their faces. Those are three Baptists _
and all Southern Baptists _ whose faith and religious involvement
is not only not an embarrassment but is central in their lives to
who they are, and what they have contributed.''

   They do not have the academic cachet of a Harvard, nor will they
forever be identified with winning one for the Gipper like Notre
Dame. But many unsung schools, including those with tongue-curling
names like Quinnipiac College, have discovered a sly way to get
themselves better known.
</P>
<P>
   They poll.
</P>
<P>
   What do New Yorkers think about the Yankees leaving the Bronx?
Quinnipiac, in Hamden, Conn., found that by an 81-to-7 margin, they
want the Yankees to stay put. Which president do Americans most
admire? Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., revealed that John F.
Kennedy edges out Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac, Marist, Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y.,
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Va., the University
of Southern Maine in Portland and scores of others have discovered
that polling people for views on political candidates, abortion or
more whimsical topics is helping them stand out in the muddle of
5,500 colleges scrambling for applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Cultivating that niche performs an academic function, of course,
by training students to gather and analyze the raw numbers needed
in careers like journalism, political science and marketing. But
polls also get a college's name in newspapers and on television.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Meringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public
Opinion, recalls that when he began polling in 1978 people would
confuse his college with the Yankee ballplayer who holds the season
record for home runs. ``Now we don't have to spell Marist and we
don't have to spell Poughkeepsie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 100 colleges that poll or do in-depth
surveys, said Sheldon Gawiser, president of the National Council on
Public Polls. Older polls, like those conducted by the National
Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the
Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, have
long gathered data for government agencies, foundations and social
scientists exploring patterns of drug abuse, race relations and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Other polls are more local and may be closely allied with state
governments, providing legislators with opinion data and calling
the quarter, half and stretch positions of local political horse
races.
</P>
<P>
   While all these colleges acknowledge that publicity is a nice
byproduct, school officials cite academic motives for getting
involved with polling. ``I was teaching a class in political
parties and voting behavior and a student suggested that maybe we
should do a poll,'' Meringoff said. ``We organized 100 students to
conduct an exit poll of Dutchess County and we accurately predicted
the county executive's race.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattanville started its poll to engage students with the
surrounding community, said president Richard Berman. But the
school did not mind that a poll might regain some of the fame
Manhattanville enjoyed when it was known as the alma mater of Rose
and Ethel Kennedy. So last year it sampled Westchester voters about
the race for county executive and this year moved on to races for
governor and U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be crazy to say it hasn't increased visibility,'' Berman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of inexpensive powerful computers in the 1980s and
the increasing reliability of telephone interviews have made
polling relatively inexpensive, said Janice Ballou, director of
polling at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University
in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   And for colleges, students often provide a ready source of cheap
labor. Quinnipiac employs 120 students at $6.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac, a 70-year-old private college specializing in
business, health and communications, started polls seven years ago
covering politics in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. But the
school has lately branched out into more attention-getting topics,
finding recently that New Yorkers support school uniforms by a
69-to-25 margin.
</P>
<P>
   One thing pollsters cannot say with precision is how many
students apply because they first heard about Quinnipiac or Marist
through a published poll. ``I haven't seen a poll on the impact of
polls on the ability to attract students,'' Gawiser said.

<P>
   CHAKOTHI, Kashmir _ For the flashpoint of a potential nuclear
war, the fields in this Jhelum River valley present a tranquil,
bucolic scene. Water buffalo tug at crude plows. Shoots of rice are
beginning to sprout from watery, mud-walled rectangles.
</P>
<P>
   But in the mountains jutting above, up the steep dirt
switchbacks, is the ``Line of Confrontation,'' a 550-mile chain of
sandbagged trenches and concrete bunkers where the Pakistani army
is dug in. Across the valley are almost identical Indian
fortifications.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that the fighting ground to a halt the first time
India and Pakistan went to war over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very tough terrain,'' said Brig. Haider Khan, pointing
from his bunker to an Indian strong point atop a cone-shaped
mountain. ``Good for the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The armies have been here for 50 years _ ``eyeball to eyeball,''
the Pakistanis like to say _ and the soldiers on both sides do not
seem to think anything will change soon. A conventional attack by
either side _ the Indians have superior forces _ would be
difficult. The advent of nuclear weapons, the Pakistanis in
particular insist, will be a deterrent, not a goad.
</P>
<P>
   For Pakistan, the subcontinent's nuclear arms race and the
attendant hand-wringing by the great powers has brought an
unexpected boon: Kashmir, a cause long-forgotten by the world and a
cause most likely lost, has suddenly moved to the top of the
international agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble dates to the departure of the British in 1947, when
the 600 princely states chose to affiliate with Muslim Pakistan or
predominantly Hindu India. Kashmir's population was overwhelmingly
Muslim but its maharajah was a Hindu, Hari Singh, described by
historians as weak and vacillating and prone to the indulgences
common to his fabulously wealthy class.
</P>
<P>
   While he dithered, Pathan tribesmen, encouraged by leaders in
Pakistan, raided Kashmir, and the maharajah appealed for help from
India. An airlift brought in Indian troops, who have remained
since, much to the anger of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kashmir _ that is the problem, that is the critical issue for
Pakistan,'' Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, a retired army chief of staff,
said. ``It is on that issue that we have fought three wars. We are
in a perpetual state of confrontation there; our armies are face to
face. This nuclear issue is a result of that conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The mountains, valleys and lakes here in the Himalayas are among
the most beautiful on earth. The region was particularly beloved,
it might be noted, both by Mohammed Ali Jinnah, leader of the
Muslim League and the father of Pakistan, and Jawaharlal Nehru,
India's first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It is not always so quiet here. Earlier this year, Muslim
militants massacred more than a score of Hindus in a village in the
Indian-controlled part of Kashmir. Apparently in retaliation, a
similar number of Muslims were killed in a raid on a village on the
Pakistani side by what were widely believed to be Indian commandos
in civilian disguise. In late May a woman was killed by a burst of
Indian gunfire on a crowded bus near the village of Sathrian.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadically, one side or the other will open fire with heavy
weapons or even artillery, sometimes to deter or cover
infiltrators. There was a long stretch of nearly constant shelling
last year, from Aug. 23 to Oct. 3, Khan said _ ``a tremendous
increase, unprecedented'' _ until calls over a hotline brought an
informal cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, he said, four people were killed and 41 wounded last
year in his brigade's sector, while the division as a whole had 12
killed and 93 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our response to such shooting,'' the officer said, ``is we
select that post and then we punish it. We hit it and we hit it. I
am not mincing any words, we hit it hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indian only understands one language _ retaliation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When two buses of foreign journalists on an army-guided tour
pulled into this village, the men of the village were lined up
along the main street, a dozen or so clutching chunks of spent
ordnance, ready to have their picture taken. Some appeared to have
gone through this exercise so frequently that they had tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we have to prove it, that we have been shot at?''
Mohammed Nazir, who was brandishing the finned stump of a
120-millimeter mortar, grumbled to Khan. ``You have brought them
here again and again to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two men pulled a pair of skeptical journalists aside and walked
them over the muddy fields to a house where a .30-caliber round was
still embedded in a small crater in the stucco. Hajji Alizman, the
homeowner, who came here as a child refugee with his parents in
1947, produced a handful of spent bullets he had found in his yard,
two with streaks of red paint still on the tips, indicating they
were tracers, usually spaced every fifth round in a machine gun's
ammunition belt.
</P>
<P>
   But the houses do not show the destruction from repeated
pounding by heavy shelling evident in, say, Lebanon or the former
Yugoslav republics. Indeed, the buildings appeared to be relatively
new, with good metal roofs. At considerable expense, the Pakistani
government has run electricity, a rarity in rural Pakistan, into
virtually every building in what officials said was an effort to
encourage people to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the real action here, in a part of the world where
Britain and Russia once played the Great Game, is a kind of proxy
war, where the shadowy intelligence operatives on both sides give
covert aid to dissidents in the fractious country across the
border.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front began a rebellion
against Indian rule. Its goal was an independent country, not
affiliation with Pakistan, and its membership, while Muslim, was
largely secular in outlook. By about 1995, the Indian authorities
had crushed the movement in what human-rights agencies have
documented as a campaign of imprisonment, torture and death.
</P>
<P>
   Lately Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency, which
operates outside the military command and was the conduit for
hundreds of millions of dollars of U.S. and Saudi aid and weapons
to the Afghan mujahedeen in their war with Soviet occupiers, has
entered the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The agency sponsors guerrilla bands, including Islamic veterans
from Afghanistan and Pathan tribesmen from the Northwest Frontier
and beyond. Many of these, unlike the original Kashmiri rebels, are
Islamic fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pakistani military, the continued strife in Kashmir has
a tactical advantage: It ties down large numbers of Indian troops _
the Pakistanis put the number at over 500,000, including
paramilitary police officers and border forces _ keeping them from
becoming a conventional threat elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of passion over the issue is clear. Beg, the retired
soldier, quickly warms to the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is where the conspiracy started,'' he said, ``where the
British, by sinister design, allowed the opportunity for a Hindu
rajah to play the Indian tune.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Ron Unz, the man who beat bilingual
education in the nation's most populous state, is no slick
demagogue or smooth revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, he looks and lives like a harried graduate student,
dressed in faded and fraying clothing, fueled by fast food and
canned chili, fatigued by late nights in the glow of a computer
screen.
</P>
<P>
   But by successfully promoting a statewide initiative that, if it
withstands legal challenges, will essentially wipe out bilingual
education in California, Unz emerged last week as a new force and a
new kind of figure in California politics, the ardent ideologue who
circumvents the telegenic requirements and messy compromises of a
traditional candidacy by working his will through a voter
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Jane Harman and Al Checchi,'' Unz said, referring to
two candidates who lost their bids for the Democratic nomination
for governor on June 2, when his initiative passed. Exquisitely
groomed and exhaustively coached, they were slaves to focus groups,
he said, and have little to show for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months from now, will anyone really remember what either
of them said in the campaign?'' Unz asked. ``For a politician, you
spend a lot of time and a lot of money and you probably lose. With
the initiative process, you can have a lot more direct impact, and
if you can get your thing on the ballot, there's a good chance
you'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   That was true in California long before Unz and Proposition 227,
supported by 61 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
   But seldom if ever has a referendum in this initiative-mad state
been so entwined with a single individual and seldom if ever has
that individual been someone who seemed poised to use the same
blunt instrument to effect other changes.
</P>
<P>
   As Unz ate egg rolls in a Chinese restaurant here and cast a
sidelong glance in the direction of Burger King, where he prefers
to take his meals, he made no bones about it: He is likely to be
back with another initiative, and maybe even another after that. He
mentioned tax policy, then grew deliberately vague.
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, such words are chilling. They say that the
initiative process promotes often extreme ideas, unmitigated by the
compromises and consensus building that occur in a legislative
body, then asks uninformed voters for a simple yes or no.
</P>
<P>
   And they say that the process provides a ready window of
political opportunity for anyone who can afford to hire workers to
gather the necessary signatures _ about 430,000 in the case of
Proposition 227 _ to put a referendum on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   That amount of money, anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million, is a
small fraction of the $40 million that Checchi, for example, poured
into his failed bid for governor. It is a sum available to a number
of individuals in such a populous and wealthy state, political
analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
   Although advertising an initiative can raise the financial toll,
Unz, who owns a software company in the Silicon Valley, said he
spent less than $300,000 on commercials and paid promotions for
Proposition 227. He relied mostly on free coverage from news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Unz said the bill for the initiative was about $1.2
million, of which he contributed $700,000. The initiative was
certainly a more cost-effective strategy for change than his
unsuccessful challenge of Gov. Pete Wilson for the Republican
nomination for governor four years ago, when he mined his personal
wealth for more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, Ron Unz used much less money to qualify an
initiative, and he will be a player for a long time in California
politics,'' said Jim Shultz, executive director of the Democracy
Center in San Francisco, a nonprofit advocacy-training group, and
an expert on the history of initiatives in California.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz and other political observers noted that Unz, perhaps
more than any architect of a successful initiative before him,
demonstrated the enormous potential impact that a single individual
can have by tapping a sensitive nerve among voters. Conventional
politicians, restrained by the legislative process and the
influence of advocacy groups, had not raised the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Unz did not have to soften or muddy his vision to get people to
consider it, simply putting it before them in an uncomplicated
triumph of will and wealth. ``He didn't have to wade into the
muck,'' said Dan Schnur, a Republican political analyst in
California. ``It's a lot easier to be ideologically pure in an
initiative campaign than in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, Schnur said, ``There is a potential for a lot
more of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   If Unz is any indication, they do not need any special charisma.
Although he seems earnest and affable, he also comes across as
somewhat goofy and disconnected, caught up in his own frenetic
thought processes, his eyes fixed on some indeterminate point in
space as his words tumble out in run-on paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   His voice has slightly nasal, cultured tones, and he laughs in
open-mouthed gulps.
</P>
<P>
   Unz did not have a particularly strong personal connection to
the issue of bilingual education. He is unmarried and childless and
had never set foot in a bilingual classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Although his maternal grandparents spoke Yiddish when they came
to Los Angeles from the former Soviet Union, his single mother
raised him speaking English. Bilingual education was not prevalent
when he attended Los Angeles public schools.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard University, he had double majors in theoretical
physics and ancient history. But his passion for ideas ranged far
and wide.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Reyburn, who lived in a dormitory room that adjoined Unz's,
said that Unz's conservative ideology put him at odds with many of
his peers, and he relished engaging them in debate and trumping
them with his easy command of information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron loves to be able to state his opinions on things,''
Reyburn said. ``And he's a very competitive person underneath it
all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After graduate courses in theoretical physics at Cambridge
University in England and Stanford University in Palo Alto, Unz
moved to New York City to work as a software developer, at one
point sending out resumes that listed his IQ as 214, more than
twice the average person's. In 1988, he started Wall Street
Analytics, which provides software programs for analyzing mortgage
securities. Five years later, he moved the company to Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   He also began pumping time and money into conservative
organizations. His surprise entry into the 1994 governor's race,
however, came in protest of an idea supported by many conservatives
and by Wilson: Proposition 187, which called for the denial of
public services to illegal immigrants. Unz said he saw that
initiative, which was passed by voters but is tied up in legal
obstacles, as needlessly divisive.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents have branded Proposition 227 in similar terms.
The initiative calls for students with limited skills in English to
be given about a year of intensive instruction in the language,
then be placed in classes where all subjects are taught in English.
</P>
<P>
   But Unz and even some of his detractors said he was driven by a
pure conviction that bilingual education, as a method of
acclimating children into English, defied both logic and test
scores, which showed poor achievement by many students in the
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Unz confessed that he was also excited by the prospect of waging
ideological battle, and he did much of the work on his own, with a
paid support staff that consisted of two people.
</P>
<P>
   But Unz was careful to get several prominent Hispanic educators
to attach their names to his cause, and political analysts said
that by framing his case in educational terms that did not seem to
fan the flames of racial conflict, he may have won over moderate
voters who would have felt uncomfortable about siding with any
referendum that smacked of bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Unz said he succeeded because the current system was terribly
flawed and voters needed only to be enlightened. Unz, who attends
conferences on public policy as a form of recreation, was happy to
be the one to take on that task.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be able to fix broken things, and there are a lot
of broken things in California,'' he said. ``I certainly fixed
bilingual education. I fixed it but good.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSES LAKE, Wash. _ Well before the school shootings in Oregon
and the South prompted a search to the depths of the national soul,
a 14-year-old honors student named Barry Loukaitis walked into his
algebra class in this hard little farm town and shot his teacher in
the back and two students in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Guns and violent videos were always around the boy's house. He
learned how to fire weapons from his father. And he picked up a
pose from the Oliver Stone movie ``Natural Born Killers,'' telling
a friend it would be ``pretty cool'' to go on a killing spree just
like the two lead characters in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black and armed with three of the family firearms,
Barry entered Frontier Middle School in this desert town 180 miles
east of Seattle on Feb. 2, 1996, and turned his guns loose on
fellow ninth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sure beats algebra, doesn't it,'' Barry said, according
to court records, as he stood over a dying boy who was choking on
his own blood. He was tackled by a teacher and hauled off to jail,
where he promptly took a nap.
</P>
<P>
   A sign soon appeared on a nearby school, bearing a single word:
Why? Of late, that question has been asked around the United
States, following a spate of multiple-victim school shootings over
the last nine months that have left 15 people dead and 42 wounded.
People wonder whether something aberrant and terrifying _ like a
lethal virus, some have called it _ is in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   While precise answers may be elusive, the recent killing sprees
share a remarkable number of common traits. The first of the rural,
multiple-victim student shootings, here in Moses Lake, looks in
many respects like a road map of what was to come. From this case
and interviews with police officers, prosecutors, psychologists and
parents of the attackers _ as well as the boys' own words _ several
patterns emerge:
</P>
<P>
   _ Each case involved a child who felt inferior or picked on,
with a grudge against some student or teacher. The attackers
complained of being fat or near-sighted, short or unloved _ the
ordinary problems of adolescence, at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, most of the assailants were suicidal, and of
above-average intelligence, according to mental-health experts who
have examined most of the children arrested for the shootings.
Their killings are now viewed by some criminologists and other
experts as a way to end a tortured life with a blaze of terror.
</P>
<P>
   _ The killers were able to easily acquire high-powered guns, and
in many cases, their parents helped the children get them, either
directly or through negligence. Guns with rapid-fire capability,
usually semiautomatic rifles that can spray a burst of bullets in a
matter of seconds, were used in the incidents with the most
victims. Single-fire, bolt-action guns or revolvers would not have
caused nearly as much damage in human life, the police say.
</P>
<P>
   _ To varying degrees, each of the attackers seemed to have been
obsessed by violent pop culture. A 14-year-old in West Paducah,
Ky., was influenced by a movie in which a character's classmates
are shot during a dream sequence, according to detectives. Violent
rap lyrics may have influenced one of the boys in the Jonesboro,
Ark., case, his mother says. In particular, a song about a stealth
killing eerily matches what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The killer who has confessed in Pearl, Miss., says he was a fan
of violent fantasy video games and the nihilistic rock 'n' roll
lyrics of Marilyn Manson, as was the boy charged in the
Springfield, Ore., shootings last month. The Springfield youth was
so enmeshed in violent television and Internet sites that his
parents recently unplugged the cable television and took away his
computer, a close family friend said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The student killers gave ample warning signs, often in
detailed writings at school, of dramatic, violent outbursts to
come. The boy in Moses Lake wrote a poem about murder, saying,
``I'm at my point of no return.'' Similar jottings were left by the
boys in the South, and in Springfield. In virtually all of the
cases, adults never took the threats and warning signs seriously.
Or they simply overlooked them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the overall pattern, it's a pretty serious
wake-up call,'' said Dr. Ronald Stephens, executive director of the
National School Safety Center, which monitors school violence from
its headquarters in Westlake Village, Calif. ``We are seeing an
increasing number of violent, callous, remorseless juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's behind it,'' Stephens said, ``seems to be a combination
of issues that range from the availability of weapons to the
culture our kids immerse themselves in to the fact that many
youngsters simply have no sense of the finality of death.''
</P>
<P>
   People argue, in the age-old debate, that the killers are simply
bad human beings or that their actions can be linked to a corrosive
family environment _ nature vs. nurture. Certainly, the recent
shootings give plenty of new material for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of the young killers place blame on the surfeit of guns,
the influence of junk culture and children stressed to a snapping
point. But they also look at themselves, their broken marriages,
their lives of stress and hurry, and wonder how all that affected
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about Barry at all,'' said JoAnn Phillips, the
mother of Barry Loukaitis in Moses Lake, in court testimony last
year in her son's case. A few weeks before the shooting, she had
told her son that she planned to divorce her husband and that she
herself was suicidal, but she was oblivious to how this would
affect her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are responsible for our kids, but you tell me, where did I
go wrong?'' Gretchen Woodward said in a interview recently in which
she discussed her son, Mitchell Johnson, the seventh-grader
accused, along with Andrew Golden, of killing five and wounding 10
in Jonesboro last March. ``I think there's a lot more pressure on
our kids today than there was when we were growing up.''

</P>
<P>
   The Killings
</P>
<P>
   Urban Trend Takes Rural Turn
</P>
<P>
   Children have long killed children in the United States. The
peak was the 1992-93 school year, when nearly 50 people were killed
in school-related violence, according to the School Safety Center.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those killings were in urban schools, and prompted a
federal law banning guns from schools, security measures like metal
detectors, and efforts to control the influence of gangs. What is
different now is that the shootings are largely rural, have
multiple victims and, within the warped logic of homicide, seem to
make no sense; many of the victims have been shot at random.
</P>
<P>
   In looking at the 221 deaths at American schoolyards over the
last six years, what leaps out is how the shootings changed
dramatically in the last two years _ not the number, but the type.
</P>
<P>
   Most earlier deaths were gang related, or they were stabbings,
or they involved money or a fight over a girlfriend. (Boys are
almost always the killers.) Then came the Moses Lake shooting in
1996. Barry Loukaitis, who confessed to the shootings and was found
guilty as an adult in trial last fall, did have a target in mind
when he walked into the afternoon algebra class _ a popular boy who
had teased him. He shot the boy dead.
</P>
<P>
   But then he fired away at two other students, people against
whom he said he had no grudge. He shot the teacher, Leona Caires,
in the back. She died with an eraser still in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in a tape-recorded session with police why he shot
the others, Barry said: ``I don't know. I guess reflex took over.''
</P>
<P>
   After Moses Lake, shootings of a somewhat similar nature
followed. In February 1997 in Bethel, Alaska, a boy armed with a
12-gauge shotgun that had been kept unlocked around the home killed
a popular athlete, fired shots at random and then tracked and
killed the principal. Like Barry, the 16-year-old Alaskan killer
thought it would be ``cool,'' prosecutors said, to shoot up the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved what he did,'' said Renee Erb, who prosecuted the
youth, Evan Ramsey. ``This was his moment of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, the killings seemed to come with
numbing sameness. All but one of the victims apparently were chosen
at random in the shootings outside a high school in Pearl, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aiming at anyone else,'' said Luke Woodham, convicted
last week in the shootings, in a tape-recorded confession played at
his trial in Hattiesburg, Miss. ``It was like I was there, and I
wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   In West Paducah, Ky., three girls were killed and five other
students wounded in a shooting with no apparent motive. ``It was
kind of like I was in a dream,'' the accused attacker, 14-year-old
Michael Carneal, told his principal.
</P>
<P>
   In March, an 11-year-old steeped in gun culture and a
13-year-old with a troubled past opened fire, in what seemed like a
military assault, at students who filed out of Westside Middle
School in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   And finally in Springfield last month _ where a boy with a love
of guns is accused of mowing down as many students as possible in
the crowded school cafeteria, using a semiautomatic rifle taken
from his father _ the victims were anyone who happened to be in the
way, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   People ask why this is now happening in white, rural areas, said
Dr. Alan Unis, a University of Washington psychiatrist who did an
examination of the Moses Lake assailant for the court. ``It's
happening everywhere,'' he said. ``One of the things we're seeing
in the population at large is that all the mood disorders are
happening earlier and earlier. The incidence of depression and
suicide has gone way up among young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Suicide rates for the young have increased over the last four
decades and have leveled off near their all-time highs. More than
1.5 million Americans under age 15 are seriously depressed, the
National Institute of Mental Health says. The number may be twice
as high, in the view of the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attackers in the recent cases had shown signs of
clinical depression or other psychological problems. But schools,
strapped for mental health counselors, are less likely to pick up
on such behavior or to have the available help, principals at the
schools where the shootings happened said.
</P>
<P>
   The Guns
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Children and Easy Access
</P>
<P>
   A depressed, insecure child is one thing, and quite common. But
that same boy with a gun can be a lethal threat. In all of the
recent shootings, acquiring guns was easier than buying beer, or
even gas. And these children armed themselves with small arsenals,
as if preparing for battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Moses Lake assailant used to play at home with his family
guns as if they were toys, friends testified in court. In his
confession, Barry Loukaitis said he took two of his father's guns
from an unlocked cabinet, and a third one _ a .25-caliber
semiautomatic pistol _ from a family car.
</P>
<P>
   The gun used in the Alaska school shootings was kept unlocked at
the foot of the stairs in a foster home where Evan Ramsey was
living, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings in West Paducah, Jonesboro and Springfield were
similar in that semiautomatic weapons _ capable of firing off
dozens of rounds in under a minute _ were used to kill children.
Weapons of less rapid-fire capability would likely have reduced the
death tolls, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jonesboro and Springfield, the parents of the accused
assailants followed the general advice of the National Rifle
Association and taught their children, at an early age, how to use
guns properly. The story of how Andrew Golden, accused in the
Jonesboro shooting, was given a gun by Santa Claus at age 6, and
was an expert marksman in the Practical Pistol Shooters Club a few
years later has been widely reported.
</P>
<P>
   But less well-known is how the other accused Jonesboro killer
came by his knowledge of guns. Mitchell Johnson's mother, Mrs.
Woodward, said in an interview that she taught her boy how to shoot
a shotgun, and then he took a three-week course.
</P>
<P>
   When the boys were arrested after hitting 15 human targets at
Westside Middle School, police found nine guns in their possession.
Most of them had been taken from the home of Andrew's grandfather,
Doug Golden, a conservation officer who says he usually kept his
guns unlocked in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Kipland Kinkel, the boy accused of the
Springfield shootings, were not gun enthusiasts, but their son was,
according to interviews with family friends. The parents agonized
over the boy's gun obsession, finally giving in and buying him a
weapon. The father and son took courses in marksmanship and safety,
and the guns were kept under lock and key.
</P>
<P>
   But given Kip Kinkel's moods and temper, the parents had debated
over whether to get him a single-loading bolt-action weapon or
something with more rapid-fire capability. They settled on the more
powerful gun, a .22-caliber semiautomatic Ruger rifle. It was a
fatal mistake, according to some people who are studying the recent
shootings. It was that rifle that Kip used to fire off 50 rounds at
Thurston High School.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid had them by the throat,'' said Dr. Bill Reisman, who
profiles deviant youth behavior for law-enforcement officials and
recently gave a closed-door briefing to community leaders from
cities where the school shootings occurred. ``They were terrified
of his interest in guns, but they went out and bought him guns.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kinkel family friend, Tom Jacobson, who played tennis every
other week with the boy's father, said the parents were looking for
a way to control and connect with their volatile child. The
parents, Bill and Faith Kinkel, were both killed by their son,
prosecutors in Oregon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were devoted parents in a tight-knit family,'' Jacobson
said in an interview. ``Bill had tried everything with Kip. I think
he just ran out of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Culture
</P>
<P>
   Too Influenced by Music and Film?
</P>
<P>
   Just as easy to get as guns were videos or cassettes in which
murder is a central theme, and often glorified. Jurors in the trial
of Barry Loukaitis were shown a Pearl Jam video, ``Jeremy,'' about
a youth who fantasizes about using violence against classmates who
taunt him. That video, along with ``Natural Born Killers,'' a movie
about a pair who kill their parents and then go on nationwide
shooting spree, were among Barry's favorites, his friends
testified.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the boys accused in the Jonesboro attack,
Mitchell Johnson, was a big fan of gangsta rap. Friends and
relatives say a favorite song was one by Bone Thugs-n-Harmony,
called, ``Crept and We Came,'' about killings.
</P>
<P>
   The boy also played Mortal Kombat, a popular video game that
involves graphic killing of opponents, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many cultural forces predisposing kids to violent
behavior,'' said the Rev. Chris Perry, a youth minister for
Mitchell Johnson at Central Baptist Church, who has talked to the
boy three times since the shootings. ``There is a profound cultural
influence, like gravity, pulling kids into a world where violence
is a perfectly normal way to handle our emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell also loved gospel music, the preacher said, and he
sang for elderly people at nursing homes. Millions of children
listen to violent-themed rap music, play Mortal Kombat and witness
killings on television, and do not become murderers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Loukaitis was obviously influenced by `Natural Born
Killers,''' said John Knodell, who prosecuted the Moses Lake
assailant. ``But there are hundreds of thousands of kids who watch
these things and don't blow away their schoolmates.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrist in the Loukaitis case, Unis, also is reluctant
to blame violent cultural influences. But he and other experts say
there is a syndrome at work in which a child who sees a shootout on
the news may be inspired to try something similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media or violent videos do not by themselves make the
event happen,'' said Ms. Erb, the prosecutor in Alaska. ``But it
shows them a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Signs
</P>
<P>
   Cries for Help Often Overlooked
</P>
<P>
   The boys accused of shooting classmates are inevitably portrayed
as average children. But a look inside their bedrooms or their
journals, or a discussion with their friends shows they left ample
clues of trouble to come.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carneal was known as a slight boy who played baritone
sax in the school band in West Paducah, the son of an elder in the
local Lutheran church. After the killings, his principal, Bill
Bond, looked at some of his notebook writings and found a child who
felt weak and powerless, with an angry desire to lash out at the
world.
</P>
<P>
   About a week before the shooting, Michael warned several
classmates that ``something big was going to happen'' and they
should get out of the way, detectives said. At least three of the
boys accused in other cases did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaskan assailant warned specific students the night before
the killings to go up on a second-floor balcony. ``These kids
didn't tell anyone,'' said the prosecutor, Ms. Erb. ``Instead, they
got right up there the next day to get their view of the
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ninth-grade English class, Barry Loukaitis wrote a poem
about murder that ended this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at his body on the floor,
</P>
<P>
   Killing a bastard that deserves to die,
</P>
<P>
   Ain't nothing like it in the world,
</P>
<P>
   But he sure did bleed a lot''
</P>
<P>
   Kip Kinkel read a journal entry aloud in his English class about
killing fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attackers were also suicidal, writing notes before
the killings that assumed they would die.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Woodham's journal writings from Mississippi were
particularly graphic. He left a last will and testament, leaving
music cassettes to the older boy who is said by police to have
influenced him. ``I do this to show society, `Push us and we will
push back,''' he wrote. ``I suffered all my life. No one ever truly
loved me. No one ever truly cared about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reisman said parents and teachers should be alarmed by such
writings. Animal abuse, arson and a sudden interest in death and
darkness are red flags, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Often the assailants live in the shadow of successful older
siblings, Reisman added. But the most common element is deep
depression, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll all have depression, in the state in which they do
these things,'' Reisman said. ``When they're cornered, the first
thing they say is `Kill me.' It's suicide by cop.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They used to come for the stilted Cantonese dialogue
and overwrought action sequences. Gnawing on dried squid or
watermelon seeds in the dark, they lived vicariously for two hours
and forgot their own arduous lives.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Chinese immigrants flocked to Chinatown's eight or
so Chinese-language movie theaters because the movies delivered
about the only entertainment around and because the theaters
afforded a sense of community and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   But soon, New York City's last Chinese-language theater, the
Music Palace, will take its final bow, its faded three-story
structure to be demolished and replaced by a gleaming office
building.
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of videotapes is partly to blame, along
with Chinese cable television programs and other options for
staying in touch with the homeland. But the theater's passing is
also a small milestone in the story of the Chinese in America, a
shift toward the mainstream that recalls the experience of
Italians, Jews, Puerto Ricans and other newcomers who once had
thriving theaters, too.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the disheveled, graffiti-scarred mien of the Music
Palace, on the Bowery at the corner of Hester Street, suggests an
institution that is well past its prime. Inside, the movies beam
out of a 50-year-old projector, playing to 700 lonely seats that
are tattered, creaky and the color of red bean paste.
</P>
<P>
   Only 20 people showed up for a recent double feature: ``The
Group,'' a contrived action-comedy about six orphans who rob an
armored car to give money to starving Somali children, and ``Raped
by an Angel 2: The Uniform Fan,'' a contrived erotic thriller about
a dentist who performs more than oral surgery on unsuspecting
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years ago, the seats would be full, and we would
stand in the back,'' said Josephine Ho, 48, who sat alone in Row N,
munching on a sandwich. ``Now, it's usually empty, and that's too
bad. I'm going to regret it when this one closes.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many newcomers, immigrants from China once relied on movies
in their native tongue as a bridge between old country and new. As
the immigrants became more familiar with their adopted country,
their adopted country became more comfortable with them. And
eventually, the specialty theaters lost much of their relevance.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of these immigrant groups, these movie houses were a
way to touch back home, to get caught up and lost in the old
fantasies,'' said Charlie Chin, a historian and former community
education director of the Museum of the Chinese of the Americas in
New York. ``But as things became possible for these groups to enter
the mainstream, there was less and less need for these services.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, Chinese theaters have dwindled from more than
two dozen in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and other cities
to only three or four now.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Music Palace is the last breath of a tradition
that began at the end of the 19th century with live-performance
theaters in Chinatown serving up variety shows and Chinese opera.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1930s, some theaters also accommodated community events
and screenings of movies from Hong Kong. They thrilled Chinatown's
mostly bachelor society, and quickly became a part of one's day-off
routine: buying groceries, visiting the offices of the family
association, eating with friends, watching a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was it,'' Chin said. ``There was nothing else to do,
nowhere else to go. Remember, until the 1960s, in many places,
you'd be looked at with curiosity or suspicion if you went to an
area that was considered off-limits to non-whites.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chinese culture became more integrated into mainstream
American culture, a small but loyal contingent of fans from other
quarters also patronized the movies, which had subtitles in English
and Chinese (for non-Cantonese speakers). These included black
Muslims who appreciated movies with non-white heroes and Caucasian
martial-arts students.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1970s, the theaters began to lose some luster, their
reputations besmirched by gang-related violence. Other options
emerged, from singing in karaoke bars to gambling in Atlantic City
to absorbing news and entertainment from Chinese-language programs
on cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The theaters were further squeezed by videotapes, which were not
only cheaper but also offered a greater variety of movies.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the movie houses disappeared. The Pagoda was
demolished in 1992 and replaced by the Glory China Tower office
building. The Sun Sing, which closed in 1993, is still vacant. The
Rosemary closed in 1996; it is now a Buddhist shrine.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the same story elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco used to have at least five theaters that showed
Chinese movies exclusively; now, there is one, the World Theater.
In the late '70s and early '80s, Chinese movies were distributed to
theaters in Chicago, Boston, Honolulu, San Jose, Calif.,
Philadelphia, Houston, Phoenix, Denver, Oakland, Calif., and
Seattle, among other places, said Shu-wei Luan, manager of the
Garfield Theater in Alhambra, Calif. All have since closed.

   At Ms. Luan's theater, each screening used to play to more than
100 people, mostly from Hong Kong or southern China. But with more
immigrants coming from Taiwan and China, where Mandarin
predominates, the demand for Cantonese-language movies has dropped
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few Chinese theaters in Vancouver, British
Columbia, and Toronto, thanks to a recent influx of immigrants from
Hong Kong. But in general, the sunset of the theaters reads like a
modern remake of the rise, and fall, of other immigrant theaters in
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, Italian immigrants flocked to theaters in
Little Italy to watch silent movies that featured someone reading
the subtitles aloud to the audience, said Robert Sklar, a professor
of cinema studies at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1920s, though, the silent movies outlived their
usefulness as the number of Italian immigrants settling in the city
declined sharply and those who were already here began to fan out
across the region. Yiddish and Spanish-language movies followed a
similar arc.

   So it has gone with the Music Palace, which is housed in what
was once a pair of 1890s-vintage commercial buildings, one of them
designed by the esteemed firm of McKim, Mead and White. These days,
the theater still has a bit of ossified charm: A double feature
costs only $6, and the bathrooms are tucked behind the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But the theater is often an echo chamber. An average of only 170
people a day pass through its doors, compared with the
standing-room-only crowds of more than 700 _ per movie _ through
the 1980s, said Oscar Watt, managing director of Gordon's Films
International, which operates the theater for a Hong Kong-based
subsidiary of Shaw Brothers Ltd., a major movie company in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are breaking even, but that's not good enough to be in
business,'' he said. ``It's really sad to see that a big Chinese
community like New York won't have a movie house.''
</P>
<P>
   Watt says that it could be a year before the theater closes. But
T.C. Ho, an architect who has been commissioned by the owners to
design a new building, says that the end could come as soon as this
summer. Already, Ho has sketched a six-story, glass-and-brick
building that would house a supermarket on the first two floors.
</P>
<P>
   Most moviegoers seem resigned that the Music Palace will
eventually fold. But shortly before a recent screening of ``Anna
Magdalena,'' a contrived melodrama about unrequited love, Johann
Sebastian Bach and flying ghosts, one moviegoer, David Lee, said he
hoped the theater would survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to maintain Chinese culture and
language,'' said Lee, who immigrated to America 10 years ago from
Hunan Province in China.
</P>
<P>
   He settled into his seat, his Chinese newspaper and snacks in
hand. He was one of eight people in the theater. Each had come
alone, and each was waiting for the movies to begin, one more time.

<P>
   Yoko Ono is one and so was John Lennon. Alan Cumming, the
Scottish star of Broadway's ``Cabaret'' and a Tony award winner, is
one too. Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban pitching ace for the Yankees
known as El Duque (the Duke), became one just recently.
</P>
<P>
   All are or were ``aliens with extraordinary ability.'' Despite
its sound of braggadocio, the phrase is not a description of an
especially poised visitor from another planet but a government
classification of a distinguished, and human, immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be famous, either. Abdou Rahman Mangara, from
Gambia, is an acclaimed griot, or storyteller. Neal Hicks, from
England, has helped uncover human-rights abuses in the Middle East
and North Africa. And Wu Lu Zhong _ a Chinese artist detained after
the smugglers' ship he was on, the Golden Venture, ran aground _
dazzled his American jailers with tiny sculptures made of toilet
paper, prison towels and tea.
</P>
<P>
   The designation is intended to entice the world's best to the
United States. Thomas May, the major league administrator for the
New York Yankees who handled El Duque's case, wasn't just referring
to baseball when he said, ``You can't be a minor leaguer and get
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, federal law describes such aliens as having
``extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business
or athletics,'' which can be demonstrated by ``sustained national
or international acclaim.''
</P>
<P>
   An employer or the alien can apply for the status. It is a paper
process; no personal interview is required and none is granted.
Despite winning three gold medals in the 1972 Olympics, Olga Korbut
had to submit a dossier six inches thick of awards and
recommendations substantiating her gymnastic ability, according to
her lawyer, Daryl Buffenstein. She got in.
</P>
<P>
   With its frank elitism, the ``extraordinary aliens'' designation
has drawn support from even those who seek to limit immigration.
``These are the kind of people we want,'' said Dan Stein, executive
director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. But
others grumble that the hoi polloi can get short shrift. In
December, the government whisked Hernandez and another Cuban
ballplayer to the United States but left five other Cubans,
stranded in the same boat, in Bahamian waters to deal with the
Bahamian government.
</P>
<P>
   There are more extraordinary aliens than ever. In 1996, the
latest year for which data are available, 2,060 aliens were
designated extraordinary, up from an annual average of about 1,200
in the previous three years. They were granted the biggest prize of
all in the immigration sweepstakes, a green card, which confers
permanent residence, a step away from citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Still more immigrants won visas that typically expire after
three years or less. The visa for El Duque, for example, expires at
the end of the baseball season, as do those of five other Yankee
players, including Japan's Hideki Irabu and Australia's Graeme
Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other immigrants, who can wait years for approval of
permanent visas, immigrants who get visas through employers get
theirs much faster, in months or weeks or, in the case of El Duque,
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Most applications for visas require evidence that no citizen or
permanent resident can be found to fill the job in question. This
leads to months of review by short-staffed agencies, said Theodore
Ruthizer, who teaches immigration law at Columbia University. The
``extraordinary alien'' designation bypasses the bureaucracy by
arguing, in effect, that not only are there few in the country who
do the job, few in the world can, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extraordinary alien'' is also bureaucratese for ``we don't
know what to do with you.'' The law gives special immigration
privileges to professors, executives and various other categories,
but what to make of Mangara, the griot, or Hicks, the rights
researcher?
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' work visa was about to expire last year when his lawyer,
John Assadi, tried the ``extraordinary'' route. Hicks has helped
lead such campaigns as a 1994 investigation of the suspicious death
of an anti-government lawyer in the custody of Egyptian police.
``Extraordinary sounds a bit flattering, a bit excessive, but we
were really just looking for creative ways to allow me to stay,''
Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Mangara, the griot, was in a similar bind. ``I can speak 23
languages,'' he said. ``I know the stories of 9,999 families. I can
sing for a half hour. I can sing all night until dawn. In West
Africa, griots are king. Still, I have to wait for the government
to believe me.'' He was declared extraordinary last year.

CARR CHANGES ROLE FROM SUB TO SAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Utah's Antoine Carr stood before a flood of camera
lights in a pair of sunglasses that had wide camouflage-coated
plastic rims. And yet, Friday night was the first time Carr had
been visible in the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   The camouflage was gone the moment Coach Jerry Sloan tapped him
on the shoulder as he walked onto the floor for the second half. He
was going to put him on the floor to start the third quarter. And
for the first time in this series, Sloan was going to put Karl
Malone's sub on the floor with the superstar.
</P>
<P>
   After averaging 9.8 minutes a game in this National Basketball
Association championship series, Carr stepped in at center and
played in concert with Malone to lead the Jazz to a life-saving
83-81 victory in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was going in,'' Carr said. ``Coach told me,
and I was like, `Hey, if we're going to go out, we're going to go
out fighting.' I was ready to get out there and bang someone and
hopefully make some shots.''
</P>
<P>
   When a very hot Malone was double-teamed underneath, it was Carr
who popped outside and hit jumper after jumper. After 21 minutes,
Carr ended the game with 5-6 shooting and 12 points, eight of which
were in the fourth quarter. So it was clear: the Jazz had a center
who wasn't missing routine shots and allowing passes to go off his
thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been the missing link they needed,'' said Scottie
Pippen, who was often caught leaving Carr open when he flashed to
Malone. ``He made me pay when I doubled. He was 5 of 6, and you
can't ask for anything else. They found something they've been
looking for. He was the difference in the game tonight, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr's impact was most obvious down the stretch. He popped a
20-foot jumper with 1:56 left in the game to give the Jazz a
7-point lead. After the Bulls closed in and turned the pressure on
the Jazz, Carr came through again by making two free throws with
10.4 seconds left to put the Jazz ahead, 82-78. This is the kind of
clutch play the Jazz had been waiting for from a bench that had
been unusually quiet since Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   So Sloan shook things up. After staying the course by rotating
Greg Ostertag and Greg Foster and Adam Keefe in at center, it was
time for a change. If anything, Sloan needed a big man who wouldn't
lose the basketball under pressure. So he put in his 14-year
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1, he was able to catch a basketball,'' Sloan said. ``He
was able to do something with it. And the way we were playing Karl,
we needed to have somebody step up to that. When we tried to drive
to the basket in the first half, we had the ball knocked out of our
hands. We couldn't come up with anything. Antoine made some
excellent plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The more the player his teammates call the Big Dog played, the
fewer mistakes there were for the Jazz. He was a calm hand to count
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my teammates call me butterfingers, but some of them
call me the good-hands man,'' Carr said with a smile. ``I just
wanted to get in there and do my Dog thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr had not had this opportunity before in this series. Often,
Sloan had opted to try and beat the Bulls underneath the basket
with his big men. Carr is an outside shooter. Most of the time,
Carr's appearances had been only cameo spots as Malone's
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do it without the minutes,'' Carr said. ``He gave me
a chance to do my thing. I'm thankful to Coach Sloan for that. I
love playing with Karl. Whether I'm on the floor with him or not, I
just try to do what we need to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone was especially grateful. The more he burned the Bulls,
and shot over the foul-troubled Dennis Rodman, the more attention
Chicago was focusing on him. Carr gave Malone a break from having
to do it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said coming into this game that our guards had their hands
full,'' said Malone, who had 39 points. ``As the big guys, we have
to help them out. I think later in the fourth quarter, I think
Antoine's presence was huge. He made a lot of big buckets for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The camouflage had been lifted off Carr. He walked out of the
United Center knowing he had helped pull the plug on the
celebration the Bulls had planned for that evening, as the series
is shifting back to Utah for Game 6 on Sunday night and, possibly,
a Game 7 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the partying-type team,'' Carr said. ``Even if we
were to win this thing, I don't think you'd see us up partying all
night. That's not us. I think we are what we are. Tonight, we were
the Jazz of old.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the history of bad decisions, the Shoreham Nuclear Power
Station stands out, a single project that has polarized the
politics of New York's Long Island for a generation, boosted
electric rates high enough to repel industry for miles around,
uselessly monopolized the talents of hundreds of engineers and
thousands of skilled craftsmen for more than a decade and sucked
more than $5.5 billion out of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Shoreham even doomed its builder, Long Island Lighting Co., in a
business where failure was long considered impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But as LILCO went out of existence last month after 87 years,
and its chairman, Dr. William Catacosinos, walked off with a
severance benefit of $42 million, it became clear that Shoreham was
such a huge mistake that no one had to take the blame.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the entire calamity had been caused by a force of
nature that could not have been foreseen or avoided. And managers
like Catacosinos, who were paid extraordinary salaries in return
for their presumed expertise, operated at a level where personal
responsibility turned out to be irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Surely in the course of more than two dozen announcements about
construction delays and rising costs either a LILCO executive or
the public service commissioners could have asked whether the
company _ building a plant four times larger than the biggest
similar plant then operating _ was ready to plunge into the nuclear
era. But the Public Service Commission raised barely an eyebrow
before the very end.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you hold them responsible in 1998?'' said Richard
Kessel, an early Shoreham opponent and now the chairman of the Long
Island Power Authority, a public entity that has taken over partial
ownership of the LILCO system. The commissioners left long ago,
Kessel said. And it's a shame, he added, that they can't be hauled
out of retirement and forced to eat their words. Or sent a bill for
$5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the LILCO managers most identified with Shoreham,
including the chairman, Charles R. Pierce, were themselves shown
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos, who had been a director for six years and had a
doctorate in economics, was installed as chairman. At the time, he
said he wanted to ``give something back'' to the community.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, turnover at the Public Service Commission was gradual
and regular, unaffected by the debacle on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   When Catacosinos became chairman, LILCO had estimated the cost
of Shoreham at about $4 billion. It seemed likely then _ and has
turned out to be true _ that the hardware and fuel for a
conventional plant that would produce equivalent power would have
cost a few hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But Catacosinos fought to the end, firing up the reactor to run
at low power, a step that strengthened his hand in negotiations
with the state for a buyout of the plant. Once the plant was
operating, even at low power, it had a demonstrated value. If the
state wanted to shut it down, then an argument could be made that
the state _ or LILCO customers _ should pay. Ultimately, the state
decided the reactor should be dismantled because it would be
impossible to evacuate the area during an accident.
</P>
<P>
   And the start-up raised the cost of abandoning the plant by $100
million, because even brief low-power operation created substantial
radiation. All told, while Catacosinos was chairman, the price of
the project went up another $1.5 billion or so.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders lost their dividends and most of their capital
investment, unless they held on through the whole ordeal. Many of
them, especially LILCO employees saving up for retirement, did not.
</P>
<P>
   With about a million LILCO electric customers, the price comes
to more than $2,000 for each man, woman and child on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened to all that money? It went from customers to
steamfitters and electricians, as wages, and to people who had
loaned money to LILCO, as interest. Late in the game, some of it
went to the truck drivers who carted off the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the money came out of the workers' pockets. In 1984
LILCO announced a 5 percent pay cut for most of them, triggering a
six-week strike, the only one in the company's history.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Parshley, a former utility analyst at Lehman Brothers and a
longtime specialist in nuclear companies, keeps a collection of
lucite plaques given to the bond underwriters for the plant. He
pulled them off a shelf last week when asked who else had
benefited.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of Wall Street firms did well handling the bonds that
raised billions for construction, he said. And they profited again
by handling the sale of LILCO's transmission and distribution
assets to LIPA, the newly formed power authority, as well as the
merger of LILCO generating plant and gas system with the parent
company of Brooklyn Union Gas.
</P>
<P>
   The new company is called Marketspan, and Catacosinos heads it.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how badly utilities blunder, they are so big and so
important that they never actually go away; they just assume new
names and forms.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan has a 15-year contract to use LILCO's generating
stations to supply power to LIPA, and an 8-year contract to deliver
that power over LILCO's old transmission and distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough road,'' said Ellen Balzarini, a spokeswoman
for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local 1049,
which represents the people who climb the poles and tend the
turbines. They now work for Marketspan and are pleased that they
did not lose any jobs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 2,800 of them now, including contractor
employees, down from 3,600 workers 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, to view the succession of bad
decisions unfairly in hindsight. ``It was an oil-dependent company,
really the only one in the country of any size,'' said Edward J.
Tirello, a stock analyst now at BT Alex Brown. ``Natural gas was
hard to find, and if you believed the scenario at that time, of
$100-a-barrel oil, that made the plant OK. The problem is everyone
fast-forwards to now.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil has been under $20 a barrel for most of the last few years,
and OPEC no longer seems like such a threat.
</P>
<P>
   And a repetition seems unlikely. Utilities do not make
construction mistakes like Shoreham now because they barely build
power plants at all; now most are put up by entrepreneurs, who
favor small plants that can be built quickly. They do not have to
make long-term guesses about demand.
</P>
<P>
   This is small comfort on Long Island. Irving Like, a lawyer from
Babylon who organized the first opposition to LILCO's nuclear
plans, said that around the country electricity prices are falling
because of deregulation and competition. LIPA's exclusive contract
with Marketspan would delay the benefits of competition on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is some good news.
</P>
<P>
   Rates should fall by 20 percent because dividends will no longer
be paid and because financing will be done through tax-free bonds,
said Kessel, LILCO's old nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``It's a frustration. If there are people out
there who somehow want justice, they're not going to get it. The
people who created this mess are long since gone.''

IN TEXAS, ENVIRONMENTAL VICTORY THREATENS SWIMMING HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last year, Austin environmentalists declared a
major victory when, after a five-year battle, the Interior
Department agreed to add the Barton Springs salamander to the list
of endangered species. But now that victory is looking hollow.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge Sam Sparks of U.S. District Court here is
scheduled to rule on a lawsuit filed under the Endangered Species
Act that could force the City of Austin to close Barton Springs,
its popular spring-fed pool, to protect the salamander.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which is not the work of the environmentalists,
asserts that the city's pool-cleaning methods are harming the
federally protected Barton Springs salamander, which is found only
at the pool and at two adjacent springs.
</P>
<P>
   The judge will rule on an injunction that could prohibit city
workers from cleaning the 1,100-foot-long pool, a move that the
city says would force it to close the swimming hole, two miles
southwest of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   For Austinites, the chilly pool is a kind of holy grail. Every
year, a quarter-million people plunge into its 68-degree waters, a
temperature that remains constant, keeping many people swimming in
the pool the year around.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has many environmentalists in Austin up in arms.
Among their complaints, the environmentalists say that Robert
Kleeman, the lawyer who filed the lawsuit, has a history of
representing developers.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that Kleeman has also worked as the general
counsel for Take Back Texas, a conservative property rights group
that has opposed endangered species protection programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bunch, the general counsel for the Save Our Springs
Alliance, an environmental group, said Kleeman was ``not motivated
by protection for the salamander.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly the opposite,'' Bunch said. He contended that the
suit was designed to ``divert attention away from the real
problem,'' which he said was development in the pool's
354-square-mile watershed.
</P>
<P>
   Kleeman said he could not understand why the environmentalists
had not rallied to his cause. ``From 11 to 25 salamanders are
harmed or killed each time the pool is cleaned,'' he said. ``I
don't hear anybody else saying that's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleeman denied that there were other reasons behind his lawsuit.
``People are going to spin it to avoid the real issue,'' he said,
``which is how the city has dealt with the Endangered Species
Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleeman said that the federal Fish and Wildlife Service had not
given the city a proper permit under the Endangered Species Act for
cleaning the pool and, therefore, the city had acted unlawfully.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing on June 3, federal officials denied that the
cleanings had hurt the salamander, and they said the city had been
working under a short-term permit that allowed city and federal
scientists to study how the pool-cleaning process affected the
Barton Springs salamander. They also said the city would very
likely be given a long-term permit to clean the pool in two or
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and lawsuits held little meaning for Josh Rivera, 14,
and Tido Juarez, 12, who were catching crawfish at the pool on a
recent hot afternoon. The boys have spent every day of their summer
vacation at Barton Springs and both were bewildered at the
possibility that the pool could close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why close something that's exciting for the kids?'' asked
Tido. &QL;

CREATING A COSMIC MAP WORTHY OF DR. SEUSS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cosmologists intent on understanding the origin of the universe
are faced with an insurmountable problem: there is no way to do a
controlled experiment. They can speculate all they like about how
the cosmos unfolded from the great explosion called the big bang,
but they can't directly test their ideas by growing universes in a
laboratory, nurturing them under different conditions and seeing
which ones live or die.
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary biologists are faced with a similar problem _ they
can't rewind the tape of history and study the various ways life
could have marched forth from the primordial soup. But they are
blessed with a powerful fallback. They can study a variety of
creatures and, through the process of induction, piece together a
persuasive story.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no such thing as a cosmological anatomist, jumping
from universe to universe gathering data on how different ones
behave. With no real universes to study other than their own,
cosmologists have turned to the next best thing. They build
computer simulations of the original fireball and watch it explode.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at the American Astronomical Society meeting in San
Diego, Dr. August Evrard of the University of Michigan described
the biggest simulation yet: the entire visible universe, 10 billion
light years across, captured in a Cray computer at the Max Planck
Society's computing center in Garching, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Artificial life (simulating living creatures) and artificial
intelligence (simulating minds) have been joined by artificial
cosmology, the art of creating a universe in a box.
</P>
<P>
   With money coming from many sources here and abroad, Evrard
said, it was hard to put a dollar figure on the project. ``Whatever
the exact numbers are,'' he added, ``I'm confident that the
taxpayers in all countries involved will feel they got the whole
universe for a pretty fair price _ especially when compared to the
cost of building observatories.''
</P>
<P>
   In a mere three days, 10 billion years of cosmic history can be
replayed inside the supercomputer, tended by an international team
called the Virgo Consortium. What results are colorful computer
images showing how the matter in the universe may have been
distributed at various times in its life. Each of these snapshots
occupies 28 billion bytes of memory and can be compressed to a mere
16 billion bytes, small enough to fit on a few hard drives. One can
almost imagine tiny galaxies, solar systems and planets with
creatures clinging to them, like Dr. Seuss' Whos of Whoville,
faintly calling: ``We are here! We are here!''
</P>
<P>
   If only the grain were so fine. The artificial cosmos is more
like the rough simulations of the Earth people have mounted on
stands in their offices and dens. By giving the globe a spin in the
wrong direction, one can play God and make the sun rise in the
west. Though one can see continents and countries and a few of the
largest cities and mountains, there are no buildings, people or
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The smallest things in the new man-made universe are rather
coarse lumps of matter called particles, each representing 10
galaxies. Anything more detailed is washed away. No matter how hard
you squint, you aren't going to find the Earth, the Sun, or even
the Milky Way. The idea is to concentrate on the big picture, by
studying how tiny ripples in the embryonic universe could have been
amplified into the sprawling structures that appear today.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an earthling, digitized and projected into the
artificial world, wouldn't see a thing _ not even starlight. For
reasons of economy, all that was actually simulated was the
invisible dark matter, currently believed to make up as much as 90
percent of creation. In the grand scheme of things, we creatures of
luminous matter, the very inventors of the simulation, were deemed
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But as computer power and memory size increase, the universe
will inevitably be captured with a finer mesh, becoming more
detailed and inclusive. One can imagine increasing the resolving
power until each separate galaxy snaps into focus. Make the
simulation finer still and the swirls and arms would emerge. Then
the individual stars would come out. Solar systems would congeal
from the stellar dust.
</P>
<P>
   Why stop at the planetary level? Cosmologist Frank Tipler has
proposed, to the consternation of most of his colleagues, that life
and intelligence are a necessary ingredient in the shaping of the
universe. A true simulation would thus have to include simulated
creatures _ artificial life.
</P>
<P>
   So let the simulated atoms cooked up in the simulated stars form
molecules and cells and plants and animals. If their nervous
systems evolve enough excess brain power, the inhabitants will need
something deep to think about. At some point they might start
wondering about the world around them, and start building
artificial spaceships and probes. They might even mimic creation on
their own simulated computers.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, computer scientist Edward Fredkin came up
with the entertaining notion that our own universe is a simulation
running on some kind of giant computer. Why not have within it the
simulation of another universe, and within that the simulation of
another, and on and on _ a cybernetic house of cards? Pull the plug
on one universe and all those it is supporting come crashing down.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists like to tell the story about the little old lady
interrupting a lecture by the great thinker, who is earnestly
describing the scientific view of the cosmos. In some versions it's
Bertrand Russell, in others Albert Einstein. ``You've got it all
wrong, sonny,'' the woman says. ``The Earth is sitting on the back
of a giant turtle.''
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, amused, answers, ``Oh, and what is that turtle
standing on?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another turtle,'' she says. And before he can interrupt with
the obvious objection, she adds: ``Don't waste your time asking.
It's turtles all the way down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with models of the universe _ it's so
tempting to mistake them for the real thing.

YOU ARE GETTING VERY CONFUSED: PSYCHOLOGISTS' SPLIT DECISIONS

 (NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by

Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

   You take it all with a grain of salt when you read your daily
horoscope or the advice columns. But advice dispensed on the couch
by a trained psychologist should carry more weight, right? Sure,
but watch it: Even therapists with the best credentials can be all
over the map.
</P>
<P>
   That's clear from a new book, ``Escaping the Advice Trap''
(Andrews McMeel), by Wendy M. Williams and Stephen J. Ceci,
psychologists at Cornell University. Drawing on 59 difficult cases,
they gave pertinent details to at least two psychologists with
doctorates and asked what they thought. Sometimes the answers were
similar, but other times they diverged wildly _ indicating that all
advice is subjective, determined by values and culture, even when
dispensed by experts.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean $100-an-hour therapists are no better than
tabloid astrologers or talk-radio gurus. But in the end, the
authors say, people at major turning points in their lives need to
seek advice from several sources, including more than one
psychotherapist, just as they would seek a second opinion on a
serious medical matter. Ultimately, the authors say, you have to
become your own expert on yourself. Consider the conflicting advice
excerpted below.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TRISH HALL
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM: My husband allows his 7-year-old daughter from his
previous marriage to sleep in our bed whenever she has a bad dream.
Lately, this has turned out to be every night that she stays at our
house. I believe this is a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 1: Kick Her Out
</P>
<P>
   From Barry Fallon, senior lecturer on psychology, University of
Melbourne:
</P>
<P>
   It is just inappropriate for a 7-year-old daughter to be sharing
the marital bed on a regular basis. It is not normal and will not
simply pass. You have two problems to address; one concerns your
husband and the other your stepdaughter. If the daughter is really
having bad dreams whenever she stays in your house, you need to
establish what is causing this to occur. If she is using ``bad
dreams'' as an excuse to get into bed with you and her father, this
needs to be dealt with and stopped. The stopping of it has to come
from her father. Discuss with him why he is so ready to accept her
in the marital bed. Are there other things not right with the
relationship between you and him? Is he being used by his daughter
to assuage his guilt for not being with her?
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 2: Let Her Sleep
</P>
<P>
   From Douglas P. Peters, psychology professor, University of
North Dakota:
</P>
<P>
   You should be more tolerant of your husband's dilemma: He has
divorced the mother of his child and now has the task of retaining
his daughter's love and affection, despite potential attempts by
his ex-wife to alienate him from his daughter. . . . In some
cultures across the world it is considered completely normal for
children to share their parents' bed. The daughter's behavior is
probably the result of insecurity and feelings of being excluded by
her father's new relationship. . . . You made the decision to marry
a divorced man with a child. Now his problem is your problem. . . .
Try to approach the problem from the perspective of making the
daughter more secure and you will undoubtedly find that over a
couple of months she will no longer wish to share your bed.
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM: I have met the most wonderful woman after years of
thinking that I would never marry again. The problem is that she
feels it is important that I support her when she disciplines my
two children. I cringe when she does this, as I feel she is
overstepping her role in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 1: Discipline the Kids
</P>
<P>
   From Ross Vasta, psychology professor, State University of New
York:
</P>
<P>
   First of all, stop cringing. It is perfectly reasonable for your
new wife to expect your children to view her as a parent, which
includes some responsibility for their discipline. Second, a
problem exists here only if you and she have markedly different
philosophies on child-rearing. If you do, you might take this
opportunity to re-evaluate your family rule structure. . . . In
short, view your new wife as an ally rather than an alien, and many
of your concerns will disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 2: Discipline Her
</P>
<P>
   From Jay Belsky, professor, Pennsylvania State University
department of human development: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However much you are attracted to and attached to this woman,
you cannot lose sight of your obligations as a parent to your
children. If your friend's parenting makes you cringe, you would be
negligent to do nothing. . . . Make it clear that you want her to
become a parent figure to your children, but that parenting works
best when a couple functions as a team. This means sharing ideas
and if necessary compromising rather than having things all your
way. . . . But make it a point to talk about your concerns, and
hers, out of earshot of the children.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM: We are a large, close-knit group of siblings whose
father just died. The youngest, my sister, lives 3,000 miles away
and is 8 months pregnant. Our doctor told us about the many
potentially negative effects of stress in the last trimester of
pregnancy. . . . Do we tell my sister that her father has just
died, knowing (a) that she will be unable to attend the funeral
(airlines and her pediatrician will not allow her to fly); (b) that
such news could have negative effects on the fetus, and (c) that as
the youngest child who was very close to her father, she may feel
intense anger at having been excluded?
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 1: Keep Her in the Dark
</P>
<P>
   From Peters:
</P>
<P>
   I strongly favor delaying telling your sister until after she
delivers her baby. . . . Your sister's baby has a right to be born
as healthy as possible, and this takes precedence over all other
considerations. None of us would condone a pregnant woman taking
drugs that would have an adverse impact on this unborn child's
life, and none of us ought to overlook this unborn child's right to
be born free from preventable stress-related complications.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 2: Tell Her
</P>
<P>
   From Gerald P. Koocher, Ph.D., associate professor of
psychiatry, Harvard Medical School:
</P>
<P>
   If you value the closeness of your family and respect your
sister, don't exclude her at this critical time. There are lots of
things that might cause emotional stress to a pregnant woman. Most
of them are not under anyone's control. Wouldn't it be better to
draw her into a supportive circle of family? Imagine how she would
feel if she inadvertently heard the news from some source outside
the family. . . . She should also be invited to become actively
involved in the funeral activities. She may not be able to attend,
but she can certainly be in touch with the family by telephone. She
can be invited to put thoughts on paper so they can be shared with
mourners. The funeral or memorial service could be captured on
videotape, allowing her to experience it if she wishes.
</P>
<P>
   PROBLEM: I am a 30-year-old man who has been dating a
32-year-old woman for three years. I care for this woman very much,
but she is from a working-class family, whereas I am from an
upper-middle-class family. She is uneducated, she does not speak
grammatically, and in general she does not show the signs of a
solid education so valued in my family. Last week this woman's
father gave us an ultimatum: Either we get married by Christmas or
she must break up with me. The trouble is, I do not feel ready for
marriage! But I do not want to lose her either, and I have to make
a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 1: Dump Her
</P>
<P>
   From Melanie Anson, instructor, Citrus Community College,
California:
</P>
<P>
   After three years one should be ready to make a rational and
emotional decision to be with a person in a marriage or mutually
agreeable partnership. This man is not really interested in being
with this woman except for convenience, because her grammatical
errors and socioeconomic level still visibly disturb him. Thus, it
is only fair to her to let her go free. Her father is right.
</P>
<P>
   Answer No. 2: Dump Her Father
</P>
<P>
   From David F. Ross, assistant psychology professor, University
of Tennessee:
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if she is formally educated _ that should be
irrelevant to the decision to continue in the relationship. . . . I
think this young couple should tell the father to go to hell. . . .
If she doesn't have the guts to stand up to her father, I think
this man should leave her because she isn't right for him. I hate
families who meddle in the lives of their grown children.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 14, moved Saturday in the `a' category.
</P>
<P>
   RAPE-REVIEW _ They strike without warning, bringing terror to an
Algerian apartment, a Chinese shophouse in Indonesia, a squalid
refugee encampment in Africa or a Balkans farming village under
siege. They are shadowy men with a cause so blinding and a hatred
so deep that they have transformed modern warfare into orgies of
primordial savagery _ raping, brutalizing, humiliating, slashing
and hacking women and girls to death. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-REVIEW _ More than two years before Election Day, polls say
a Republican front-runner in the 2000 presidential race has already
emerged. He is a one-term governor, George W. Bush, who has never
run for national office but has, according to one recent poll,
already overtaken Vice President Al Gore, the popular Democrat who
has been running for the White House for 20 years. By Adam
Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-CONSERVATIVES-REVIEW _ If you want to know what is
wrong with the movie business, just ask Lionel Chetwynd. Chetwynd
has written the scripts for more than a dozen successful movies and
says he has been frustrated in his efforts to take his career a
step higher. The problem is not quality, he argued _ his films like
``The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz'' and ``Kissinger and Nixon''
have won widespread praise. No, he insisted, the barrier is his
beliefs: Chetwynd is a conservative. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-REVIEW _ Nigeria's new general-in-charge, Gen.
Abdulsalam Abubakar, in his first speech since the sudden death on
Monday of iron-fisted Gen. Sani Abacha, hammered away at the theme
of unshaken adherence to his country's ``international
commitments'' as he sought to comfort allies and serve notice of
his country's resolve to potential foes. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-CHINA-REVIEW _ President Clinton's visit to China,
scheduled to begin June 25, is likely to be about appearances more
than anything else. No real diplomatic breakthrough looks possible,
since the United States and China remain far apart on key issues
like Taiwan and human rights. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   BAPTISTS-REVIEW _ The conspiracy theorists have it all wrong.
The U.S. government is not run by Freemasons. Or by the pope or
Jewish bankers. The American people are entitled to the truth: the
government is run by Southern Baptists, who were recently in the
news for boycotting Disney, proselytizing Jews and, just last week,
declaring that wives should submit to their husbands. By Laurie
Goodstein.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-POLLS-REVIEW _ They do not have the academic cachet of a
Harvard, nor will they forever be identified with winning one for
the Gipper like Notre Dame. But many unsung schools, including
those with tongue-curling names like Quinnipiac College, have
discovered a sly way to get themselves better known. They poll. By
Joseph Berger.
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSE-REVIEW _ Cosmologists intent on understanding the
origin of the universe are faced with an insurmountable problem:
there is no way to do a controlled experiment. By George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   TALENTED-IMMIGRANTS-REVIEW _ Yoko Ono is one and so was John
Lennon. Alan Cumming, the Scottish star of Broadway's ``Cabaret''
and a Tony award winner, is one, too. Orlando Hernandez, the
Cuban-born pitching ace for the Yankees known as ``El Duque,''
became one just recently. All are or were ``aliens with
extraordinary ability.'' Despite its sound of chest-out,
fists-on-the-hip braggadocio, the phrase is not a description of an
especially poised visitor from another planet, but a government
classification of a distinguished, and human, immigrant. By Anthony
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   NUCLEAR-STATION-REVIEW _ In the history of bad decisions, the
Shoreham Nuclear Power Station stands out, a single project that
has polarized the politics of Long Island, N.Y., for a generation,
boosted electric rates high enough to repel industry for miles
around, uselessly monopolized the talents of hundreds of engineers
and thousands of skilled craftsmen for more than a decade and
sucked more than $5.5 billion out of the economy. By Matthew L.
Wald.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PSYCH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Excerpts from ``Escaping the Advice
Trap'' (Andrews McMeel), by Wendy M. Williams and Stephen J. Ceci,
psychologists at Cornell University. Drawing on 59 difficult cases,
they gave pertinent details to at least two psychologists with
doctorates and asked what they thought. Sometimes the answers were
similar, but other times they diverged wildly _ indicating that all
advice is subjective, determined by values and culture, even when
dispensed by experts.

NEGOTIATORS ARE INCHING FORWARD ON EMISSIONS CURBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th)

<P>
   BONN, Germany _ Six months ago in Kyoto, Japan, delegates from
around the world agreed for the first time to make specific,
legally binding reductions in industrialized countries' emissions
of heat-trapping gases believed to affect Earth's climate.
</P>
<P>
   Now negotiators grappling with the details of putting the first
cuts into effect are finding the task as difficult as that of
hammering out the original accord.
</P>
<P>
   As they made their first formal efforts to flesh out the Kyoto
accord in talks here over the last two weeks, it became clear that
the agreement remains largely a work in progress. Thanks to the
same clash of interests that nearly scuttled the negotiations in
Kyoto, the work may not be finished for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Kyoto meeting took place, said Michael Zammit Cutajar
of Malta, who heads the U.N. climate secretariat, the initial
agreement was seen as a kind of summit to be reached. But ``when we
got to Kyoto, we saw it wasn't a peak at all but a plateau.'' With
a new mountain ahead, he added, ``we are not anywhere near the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   As the next phase of the struggle got under way, developing
countries renewed their insistence against submitting to specific,
mandatory emissions caps until wealthier nations achieve
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   That left open the question of whether the poorer nations can be
drawn more fully into the reduction program anytime soon. If not,
American politicians say, the Kyoto Protocol, as the agreement is
called, cannot be approved by the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The talks here set the stage for the next high-level conference
of the more than 150 countries that signed the 1992 treaty under
which the Kyoto Protocol was negotiated. The conference is
scheduled for Buenos Aires in November. Its main objective will be
to make as much progress on the details of the protocol as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized countries to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and five other heat-trapping
atmospheric gases by an annual average of about 5 percent below
1990 levels for the period 2008 through 2012. Some countries are to
cut their emissions by more than that, some less. The U.S.
reduction target is 7 percent. Carbon dioxide is produced by the
burning of fossil fuels like coal and oil.
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto targets are widely viewed as a first step, since
overall concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will
continue to rise if deeper cuts are not eventually made. Without
any reductions at all, scientific advisers to the delegates here
say, the Earth's average surface temperature will rise by 2 to 6
degrees Fahrenheit, with a best estimate of 3.5 degrees, by 2100.
</P>
<P>
   A warming of this magnitude, the scientists say, would cause the
sea level to rise and inundate many coastal areas. It would also
worsen droughts and rainstorms, cause more heat waves and floods,
increase precipitation generally and shift climatic and
agricultural zones to the benefit of some regions and the serious
harm of others.
</P>
<P>
   For the countries here, the immediate challenge is to enable the
first steps included in the Kyoto accord to be taken. That involves
agreeing on how new mechanisms for cutting emissions will work in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   One, which negotiators have named the clean-development
mechanism, is a system for channeling and certifying rich
countries' investment in emissions-reducing projects in poor
countries _ power plants that emit less carbon dioxide, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations involved would share the credit for emissions
reductions achieved, and part of the proceeds would help the
developing countries adapt to climatic change.
</P>
<P>
   Another mechanism is called emissions trading. In this system,
much favored by the United States, a country or private company
could achieve its reductions target partly by buying reductions
from another country or company that had achieved excess cuts.
Proponents say that this arrangement would achieve the required
cuts globally, and at lowest cost.
</P>
<P>
   These two mechanisms are the operational heart of the protocol,
and both came under criticism in the talks just concluded.
Developing countries balked, resisting pressure to move rapidly
until questions about the mechanisms are answered.
</P>
<P>
   What is required now is ``to learn and understand,'' said Vijai
Sharma, the chief delegate from India, who said that much had been
unclear in the chaos of Kyoto. Answering the questions and then
formulating rules for operating the mechanisms ``is going to take
long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the developing countries' caution is that they
are likely, eventually, to come under the same rules as the rich
nations. And many delegates from the poorer countries say privately
that while the clean-development mechanism holds apparent benefits
for them, it is unclear what the costs might be.
</P>
<P>
   On emissions trading, a split developed between the European
Union and much of the rest of the industrialized world, including
the United States, over the critical issue of how much of a given
country's reduction it should be allowed to achieve by purchasing
emissions rights from another country.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans insisted that some cap be placed on the proportion
of a country's reduction that can be achieved through trading.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other countries insist just as strongly
that trading should be unrestricted. Otherwise, they say, the
market mechanism will not function properly and the cost of
reductions will rise. The Americans say it is simply not yet known
how much emissions can be reduced by domestic action. &QL;

GOP ASPIRANTS FOCUS ON MORAL ISSUES IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Wis., Tenn., Mo., N.H., Ga., Ind., Mont.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ A parade of prospective presidential
candidates converged here this weekend for a gala that the state's
Republican Party billed as a showcase of ``ideas and visions'' for
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the event more resembled a celebration of the
traditional nuclear family of the 1950s, and featured contenders
who were unusually aggressive in presenting themselves as morally
upright, vehemently opposed to abortion and, in some cases, hostile
to homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a dozen Republicans sought to win over (or, at least,
catch the attention of) the particularly conservative subset of
voters who will participate in the crucial presidential caucuses
here in 2000, traditionally the first battleground of the primary
season.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this conservative state, the heavy emphasis on social
and moral themes was a striking shift from forums of past years,
when the messages were also dominated by clashes over specific
legislation or programs. The oratory here offered a preview of how
the intraparty jockeying will play out over the next two years and
may reflect a dearth of issues for Republicans to trumpet _ or a
great belief that the most rightward-leaning contender will capture
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering featured some prominent Washington lawmakers like
Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the Budget Committee, but was
dominated by lesser-known politicians who are seeking to test their
appeal on a presidential stage. Some of the more prominent
potential candidates like Gov. George Bush of Texas, Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, Jack Kemp, the vice presidential nominee in
1996, and Speaker Newt Gingrich, did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   The baldest appeal to the roughly 2,000 Iowa Republicans who
gathered in Cedar Rapids came from Gary Bauer, the president of the
Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared with Reggie White, the star defensive lineman of the
Green Bay Packers, who caused a furor three months ago for a range
of comments before the Wisconsin Assembly involving homosexuals and
racial and ethnic groups. Among other things, White, who is black,
said then that blacks ``like to sing and dance'' while whites
``know how to tap into money.'' Homosexuality, he said, is ``one of
the biggest sins'' in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing cheers from the delegates here on Friday night, Bauer
declared, ``I stood with Reggie White. No to same-sex marriages! No
to saying that way of life is acceptable!''
</P>
<P>
   At a reception earlier in the evening, White, towering over
Bauer, thanked the conservative for jumping to his defense after
CBS removed him from consideration as a football commentator
because of his remarks. ``I said what I meant _ and I meant what I
said,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   As if to one-up Bauer, Steve Forbes, the publisher, sought to
prove his bona fides by appearing here with the Rev. Louis Sheldon,
chairman of the Traditional Values Coalition, who for years has
been one of the nation's most antagonistic voices against
homosexuality. Forbes has sought to enhance his ties with social
conservatives since his failed presidential bid in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a display of the fierceness of this competition for
conservative voters, Alan Keyes, who is also weighing a second run
for the White House, angrily condemned Forbes as not being truly
against abortion because he has not criticized two Republican
governors who favor abortion rights, Christie Whitman of New Jersey
and George Pataki of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes' professed interest in the moral agenda is in my
opinion totally false,'' Keyes told reporters. ``I'm not interested
in phonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to engage Keyes, Forbes said simply, in an interview,
``My record has been clear and consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri tried to prove his devotion by
carrying his usual anti-abortion prop: a sonogram of his grandson
at 24 weeks. He referred repeatedly to eliminating the ``marriage
penalty'' in the income tax and was also aggressive in portraying
himself as happily married, often taking his wife, Janet, by the
hand. She stood by his side during his speeches this weekend and
when they dished out sundaes to the delegates at their ``ice cream
social.''
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans and Democrats are gearing up for the midterm
elections in November, the two-day convention here was the latest
demonstration that, simultaneously, maneuvering for the White House
in 2000 is well under way. The jockeying is particularly intense
because, for the first time since at least 1964, there is no early
heir apparent on the Republican side.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals were more than just talk, for no delegate left here
empty-handed. Forbes, for one, passed out shopping bags for each
participant that included Forbes hats and a cassette tape of some
of his radio commentaries. While former Gov. Lamar Alexander of
Tennessee, one of the best-organized candidates in this state, put
forth a ``family-friendly tax plan,'' delegates flocked to his
down-home Tennessee supper that included chicken wings, corn on the
cob and pecan pie. Saturday morning, Alexander served sticky buns
and coffee in souvenir plaid mugs.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important opportunity for the candidates came
Friday night, when they were each given 11 minutes (the two or
three who went over found their microphones cut off) at center
stage in a darkened hall to sell themselves to Iowa Republicans. In
a demonstration of how wide open the contest may be at this stage,
the other contenders all drew respectable applause but no one
except Keyes, an accomplished speaker and radio talk show host,
drew an outsized response.
</P>
<P>
   Several delegates said in interviews that rather than have one
favorite, they had three or four.
</P>
<P>
   With a giant American flag as the backdrop, the prospects here
dwelled almost largely on moral issues, to the point that some
delegates complained that it was too much. ``It's a little bit
scary,'' Ron Rasmussen, 62, a small-business owner here, said of
the speeches. He said he would have preferred that the speakers
talk about ``states rights, citizens rights and getting taxes
reduced.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kasich emphasized the importance of faith and virtues. ``I have
been in politics now for 20 years,'' he declared, ``and I realize
that making more laws isn't going to fix the things that bother us
the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire was one of several speakers who
savaged President Clinton's character _ many also castigated
Clinton for his planned trip to China _ but then declared: ``My
life's goal is to stop abortion in this country _ and to protect
the lives of unborn children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, who since last year has called for
Clinton's impeachment, said he hoped he could ride his
outspokenness on the president to the White House. ``I didn't hear
the `I-word' out there!'' he bellowed to the delegates when he
appeared on stage. ``Impeach! Yessir. Yessir!''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle did not attend because he was
in Virginia raising money for his political action committee and
for local candidates. His wife, Marilyn, took his place but
appeared to spoil any efforts to repair her frosty relations with
reporters by snapping at them for asking whether she agreed with
the recent amended statement of beliefs by the Southern Baptist
Convention that a woman should ``submit herself graciously'' to her
husband's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only read what's in the newspapers, and coming from the
background I have, my dealings with the press, I really don't
believe those very much,'' she said. ``And I'd rather see the
actual statements themselves rather than take them from the
newspapers.'' Reminded of the actual, highly publicized statements,
Mrs. Quayle became testy, telling a reporter, ``I'd like to see it
in continuity, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Gov. Mark Racicot of Montana, said he was not
running for president. But after watching the other Republicans
sell themselves, he said at a news conference on Friday that he was
``a little bit startled by some of the strong rhetoric'' of his
colleagues. &QL;

   URI, Kashmir _ In this idyllic spot in the Kashmir highlands,
Indian troops hold ground overlooked on three sides by Pakistani
troops, some well within artillery range. But at sunrise the other
day, the only noticeable weapons around the headquarters of the
Indian army's 12th Infantry Brigade were the drivers, irons and
putters in the hands of the senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way, absolutely no way, that there is going to be
another war here,'' Col. Narendra Singh Mehta, 48, said as he took
breakfast beside an army golf course that nestles above the Jhelum
River. Three miles downstream, the river crosses the ``Line of
Confrontation,'' the term both sides use to describe the boundary
separating the parts of Kashmir held by India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the stakes in the conflict rose immeasurably when first
India and then Pakistan conducted nuclear tests and declared
themselves nuclear powers. The tests raised worldwide alarm, with
President Clinton and other leaders appealing to India and Pakistan
to settle their differences over Kashmir to prevent the territory
from becoming the flashpoint of a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 50 years, India and Pakistan have fought three wars
in the lush valleys that run through the Himalayas here. Two of
these, in 1947 and 1965, began over Kashmir; a third, in 1971, was
an outgrowth of another conflict 1,000 miles to the east, the civil
war in East Pakistan that drew in Indian troops and gave birth to
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   After 26 years without another war, India and Pakistan still
have hundreds of thousands of troops arrayed against each other
along the 550-mile confrontation line, and exchanges of gunfire are
as common as the rainstorms that sweep the mountains at this time
of year. Few weeks pass without casualties on both sides, mostly
among civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Indian side, at least, few seem worried about another
war, much less one that would go nuclear. ``There may be some local
exchanges of fire, the sort of thing that's been happening here for
years, but nuclear weapons have made full-scale war unthinkable,''
Mehta said, to nods from fellow officers who joined him in their
regular golf foursome.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmir dispute has its roots in 1846, when Britain
installed a Hindu maharajah to rule what had long been a
predominantly Muslim territory. When the subcontinent was
partitioned at independence in 1947, the Hindu ruler hesitated over
joining India or Pakistan, choosing India only after fighters from
Pakistan attempted to seize the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing war was halted by a U.N. cease-fire in 1949 that
left India in control of two-thirds of the territory and Pakistan
with the other third. Little changed in the two subsequent wars,
with India claiming all of the territory and Pakistan demanding
that India honor a pledge it gave in the 1940s that it would allow
Kashmiris a plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
   At bases here that are only 65 miles from Islamabad, Pakistan's
capital, Indian officers have traditionally been upbeat, especially
after getting the better of Pakistan in the three wars.
</P>
<P>
   But just as striking as the mood at the golf course, many
Kashmiri Muslims also say the situation in the Indian-ruled part of
the territory, after a decade of insurgency by Pakistan-backed
rebels, is as relaxed as it has been in years.
</P>
<P>
   All around the Kashmir Valley, the heartland of the insurgency,
there are signs that Kashmir is looking much more like the fabled
land it was for centuries _ a place noted for its adherence to the
gentle Sufi form of Islam, the romanticism of its writers and poets
and its fine craftsmanship in lacquerware, woven shawls and
carpets.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Indian tourists have returned for the first time in
years, filling graceful houseboats on Dal Lake in Srinagar, the
summer capital of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, India's winter games were held near here,
reopening resort hotels closed since 1989, when the Muslim
insurgency intensified. Hindu pilgrims are returning to ancient
shrines. Carpet workshops are busy again.
</P>
<P>
   In the lush orchards and rice paddies along the valley, whole
families are working from dawn to dusk in areas once made hazardous
by cross-fire. Abdul Rahim Bhatt, a 45-year-old farmer sitting with
his family in a rice-paddy near Srinagar sipping tea, said that
ever since the insurgency began, his wife and children had not
joined him in the annual task of transplanting rice shoots. ``By
the grace of Allah, life is nearly normal again,'' he said. In a
week touring the valley, dozens of Kashmiris offered similar views.
The impression was of a territory less troubled about its prospects
than the outside world was.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after India conducted its nuclear tests in May,
Indian leaders appeared to set out to raise temperatures over
Kashmir, saying that India's acquisition of nuclear weapons had
tilted the balance of power in India's favor. This alarmed
Pakistan, and helped tip the balance in Pakistan toward testing its
own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After its tests, the Pakistani government took its turn at
heightening tensions. But both sides now seem to be turning away
from confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Indian military commanders leave little doubt that they welcome
the turn toward moderation, not least because they believe they are
well on the way to achieving India's main goal in Kashmir:
eliminating the Muslim rebels.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Instead of 5,000 to 7,500 Muslim insurgents _ estimates used in
the mid-1990s _ Indian commanders say there may be fewer than half
as many now, and probably fewer than 1,000 ``active gun-toting
militants,'' in the words of Lt. Gen. Krishan Pal, India's
commander in the Kashmir Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is much better, and improving fast,'' Pal said.
He said that Indian intelligence reports showed that insurgents
crossing into Indian-held territory from the Pakistan side had
slowed to a trickle, and that most of those were being killed by
Indian troops.
</P>
<P>
   As important, he said, nearly half the remaining insurgents are
``foreigners,'' a term Indian officers use to refer to Pakistanis,
and a ``scattering'' of Muslims from Egypt, Libya, Sudan and other
countries in the Middle East and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   According to Western human-rights groups, both sides have been
guilty of widespread abuses. Amnesty International, among other
groups, has chronicled cases in which Indian forces are said to
have abducted, tortured and executed suspected rebels and their
sympathizers, and to have fired indiscriminately on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The reports have listed similar abuses by the rebels, including
killings of villagers, car bombings in Srinagar and Jammu, the
winter capital, and the abduction and killing of officials,
tourists and others.
</P>
<P>
   Among leaders of the Kashmir resistance movement who maintain
political offices in Srinagar, there is little effort to disguise
how weak the insurgency has become. Shabir Shah, a leading
proponent of independence for Kashmir who spent 21 years in Indian
prisons, has become an outspoken advocate of negotiations with
India, and has implied that something less than a complete
breakaway might be accepted. Other resistance leaders appear
demoralized.
</P>
<P>
   But if India has the upper hand in the fighting, there is little
sign that it is winning Kashmiris' loyalties. Many say they are
deeply disillusioned with India's political solution: a revival of
the Kashmiri-led state government that was disbanded when direct
rule was imposed in 1989. The man who headed the state government
then, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, a 61-year-old physician, returned from
England to run and win a 1996 election that many Kashmiris regard
as deeply flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah came back, in most Kashmiris' eyes, as New Delhi's
puppet. After 20 months in his old office as chief minister,
driving around Srinagar in a convoy of armored cars, he has yet to
get rid of the stigma.
</P>
<P>
   So far, according to many Kashmiris, his government has been
busier announcing new schools, hospitals and roads than actually
building them.
</P>
<P>
   The chief minister's worst mistake may have been his vociferous
support for India's nuclear tests. After a visit to the nuclear
test site with Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he outdid even
the Hindu nationalists with his polemics. ``The next war will be
fought on the soil of Kashmir,'' he said. ``But this time, modern
weaponry, including nuclear weapons, will be used.''
</P>
<P>
   But India's view seems to be that the risk of a nuclear war will
affect Kashmir in much the way that the American and Soviet nuclear
arsenals affected postwar Europe _ by freezing the territorial
division, since neither India nor Pakistan can rationally
contemplate trying to seize territory from the other.
</P>
<P>
   This could explain why Lal Krishna Advani, India's hard-line
interior minister, greeted Pakistan's nuclear tests by saying they
were good for India ``from every point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   The central government's top official in Kashmir, Girish Chandra
Saxena, who is the governor of Jammu and Kashmir, seemed to take
this view when he said in an interview that neither India nor
Pakistan would risk a full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation embarks on a course of nuclear suicide, and I don't
think there are any nuclear suicide bombers even in Pakistan,'' he
said. ``So the real answer is for both sides to cool it, achieve
what is achievable on other issues and leave aside the intractable
issues like Kashmir.''

   SALT LAKE CITY _ In a college neighborhood east of the historic
Mormon Temple here last week, four young Southern Baptist men and
women bowed their heads with Clint Roberts, whose T-shirt asks,
``What's more important than eternal life?''
</P>
<P>
   After Roberts, director of the Baptist Campus Ministry at the
nearby University of Utah, asked God's blessing, the group set off
to knock on doors to talk with students about conversion and
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered at the first house, and a woman turned them away
at the next. But at the third, a university fraternity, the door
was opened wide and the group invited in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a personal testimony that God has helped me,''
Ann-Marie Sandy told five fraternity members seated on a long
couch.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts talked about the campus ministry and invited the young
men to visit.
</P>
<P>
   They listened attentively, answered a couple of questions and
then indicated they wanted to turn back to their studies. Later,
they agreed that admitting the group had been the proper thing to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on a mission, too,'' said Jonathan Nielsen, referring
to the months he spent in Bogota, Colombia, as a Mormon missionary.
``So I know how it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, in meetings like these, members of two of
the most determinedly missionary faiths in the United States, the
Southern Baptist Convention and the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, have been coming face to face in what has been a
courteous if somewhat wary encounter.
</P>
<P>
   That it has been happening here, on ground that the 19th-century
Mormon leader Brigham Young declared a modern-day Zion, is the work
of the Southern Baptists. While holding their annual convention in
here last week, about 3,000 volunteers also began a weeklong
effort, ending Friday, to bring an evangelical Protestant message
to the 2 million inhabitants of Greater Salt Lake, Mormon and
non-Mormon alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the biggest evangelistic outreach in the Salt
Lake Valley in history,'' said Phil Roberts, an official with the
Baptists' North American Mission Board (and no relation to Clint
Roberts). ``There may be as many as 50,000 personal knocks on the
door,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a $600,000 budget, Southern Baptists bought television
and radio commercials, put up billboards, dispatched mailings and
held block parties, all to draw attention to their message.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the plans began to circulate a year ago, prompting
speculation about tensions and raising the specter of
finger-jabbing debates between Baptists and Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the oratory within the Salt Palace Convention
Center, where the Baptists met from Tuesday through Thursday,
sometimes grew hot, as when one minister opened a sermon by calling
Salt Lake City the ``headquarters of a counterfeit Christianity.''
And pamphlets published by the mission board strongly criticized
Mormon beliefs, including that the church's president is a prophet
capable of receiving divine revelation.
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets, it was mainly a case of the polite meeting
the polite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone was very concerned that there not be
hostilities expressed,'' Phil Roberts said. ``I've warned our
people that you may win an argument, but you may not win a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Mormon officials had offered similar counsel. In a
speech at Brigham Young University in February, Elder Boyd Packer,
a top church officer, said: ``If you meet someone who challenges
our right to the title Christian, do not confront them. Teach them
_ peaceably.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview, another Mormon leader, Elder Alexander
Morrison, who supervises the church's work in northern Utah, said:
``If all you do is position yourself to respond to what other folks
say of you, you don't get much done in this world. The Baptist
convention has been interesting, but not very disruptive in terms
of our responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   During the convention, Southern Baptist officials kept a tally
of the fruits of their efforts. On Tuesday, after volunteers had
been in the field four days, John Yarborough, the mission board's
vice president, announced, ``We have seen over 760 people pray to
receive Christ on the streets and in the homes of Salt Lake City.''
Those numbers, he added, ``are not mere accounting digits, but
represent souls in the kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Baptist messengers, as convention delegates are
called, broke into applause at the announcement that conversions
had topped 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently relatively few were Mormons. Baptist officials
said that most of the converts seemed to come from among the
unaffiliated, a group that has grown as Utah's population has
swollen with arrivals from other states. Indeed, Mormons now make
up slightly less than 50 percent of Salt Lake City's population,
church officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the increasing number of non-Mormons, the Mormons
began their own continuing missionary effort in northern Utah in
the 1980s and now field a force of nearly 500 missionaries there.
They make about 6,000 converts a year, about 2 percent of the
church's annual total worldwide, Morrison said. ``In general, we do
very, very well where we are well known,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Southern Baptists, who were planning a special
outreach to the local Hispanic population this weekend, the
volunteer evangelists said what counted was making contact with
anyone who would listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to share with them as much as we can,'' said
David Paul, a senior from Baylor University in Waco, Texas. ``What
we're trying to do is plant seeds.''

U.S. SEEKS PACT WITH CHINA ON TARGETING MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares for a summit meeting
in Beijing this month, the United States and China are trying to
negotiate an agreement to no longer target nuclear missiles at each
other, senior U.S. officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said that Washington was pressing China to
codify its promises earlier this month to further restrict the
supply of missile technology to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Asia director of the National Security Council, Sandra
Kristoff, is in Beijing trying to complete work on the substantive
agenda for Clinton's visit, the first by a U.S. president to China
since the crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square nine years
ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to leave Washington on June 24, and the deadline of
the visit is a great spur to the negotiations. But the Chinese, by
past pattern, tend to make their hardest decisions at the last
moment, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The United States tried to get a mutual detargeting agreement
with China before President Jiang Zemin's visit to Washington last
October, the officials said. But the effort foundered on China's
insistence that detargeting be coupled with a mutual pledge of no
first use of nuclear weapons in any crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. strategic doctrine has always rejected pledges of no
first use of nuclear weapons, because they are judged essentially
meaningless and unverifiable. Also, during the Cold War, there was
the real concern that NATO might have to use nuclear weapons to
stop a big invasion by Warsaw Pact conventional forces into Western
Europe, and Soviet suggestions of no-first-use pledges were always
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to change our doctrine in the context of
China,'' a senior U.S. official said Saturday. ``There are alliance
reasons in Asia not to change it, as well,'' the official said,
referring to the reliance of Japan and Southeast Asian nations on
the U.S. nuclear umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Detargeting itself, though considered part of ``confidence
building'' between nations, is essentially symbolic, since missiles
can be retargeted again in a matter of minutes, experts in nuclear
weapons have said.
</P>
<P>
   In a post-Cold War show of good faith, the United States and
Russia have announced that they no longer have missiles targeted at
each other, but both sides admit that detargeting would barely slow
a nuclear exchange _ unlike the separate storage of missiles and
warheads, for example, which some nonproliferation experts now
advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress have expressed shock that China has
about 13 strategic missiles targeted on the United States,
according to a CIA estimate reported in The Washington Times _ a
shock that surprises administration officials and Chinese experts,
who say it is common knowledge that China has weapons targeted on
the United States, and that the United States has many times more
nuclear missiles aimed at China.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the key issues for the summit talks are those involving
proliferation _ China's exports of potentially dangerous equipment,
materials, chemicals and technology to Iran and Pakistan, which
recently set off nuclear-test explosions after those by India.
</P>
<P>
   China, in the 1980s, was responsible for giving Pakistan the
expertise, bomb design and fissile material to become a nuclear
nation, and was sanctioned twice by the United States, in 1991 and
1993, for providing Pakistan with medium-range missiles, the M-11,
and missile parts.
</P>
<P>
   China then pledged not to provide any more M-11 assistance under
the Missile Technology Control Regime. While China has agreed to
abide by the regime, which covers missiles that can carry a
500-kilogram (1,100-pound) warhead 300 kilometers (about 190
miles), it has refused thus far to sign it and its detailed annexes
of banned dual-use equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese technological assistance to Pakistan continues, but
Pakistan's recent Ghauri missile was produced with North Korean
parts, not Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Another key issue for Clinton, arguably more important than
detargeting, is to get China to codify its pledge to further
restrict assistance to Pakistan. China made that pledge during a
meeting of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council
_ China, the United States, Britain, France and Russia _ on June 4
in Geneva. At the meeting, the permanent members, all acknowledged
nuclear powers, discussed the nuclear tests of India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique, the countries all agreed, ``consistent with
their policies,'' to prevent the export of equipment, materials or
technology that can in any way assist programs in India or Pakistan
for nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles capable of delivering
such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   That pledge was vague, U.S. officials acknowledge, and they are
trying to get the Chinese to codify it into their laws and
regulations ``in some more enforceable form,'' an official said.
The Americans are also hoping that the pledge could stretch to
include missiles with shorter ranges than those covered under the
Missile Technology Control Regime, but expect Beijing to reject
that interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   In a related issue, the Americans are trying to get Beijing to
further restrict its chemical industry from exporting dual-use
chemicals and equipment to Iran that could be used for chemical
weapons. The Chinese are studying U.S. proposals for new and
tighter export controls and methods. In May 1997, Washington
sanctioned seven companies and individuals for such trade, but some
of it continues.
</P>
<P>
   Given previous cases of the diversion of supercomputers and
other high-tech exports from civilian to military uses, Washington
also wants China to agree to outside inspections of enterprises
buying these devices, before the shipment and afterward. The
Chinese have agreed to look carefully at the issue, but say that
their sovereignty will be violated by mandatory postshipment
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are also pressing China for a breakthrough on at
least one sector, perhaps agriculture, in accelerated negotiations
on China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Membership
would require significant market openings to outside goods, which
would be hard for China in the middle of the Asian financial
crisis, and would require politically risky layoffs.

STARR ADMITS GIVING REPORTERS INFORMATION ON CLINTON INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel
investigating President Clinton, acknowledged in a magazine
interview that he and his aides have given information on the
Monica Lewinsky matter to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But he also insisted that these leaks were neither illegal,
because they did not involve testimony before a grand jury, nor a
violation of Justice Department ethics barring leaks of
``substantive information'' about a prosecution. In the interview
with the magazine, Brill's Content, Starr defended his actions as
necessary ``to engender confidence in the work of this office.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, responded Saturday in a
statement, saying, ``The article represents an admission from Mr.
Starr that he and his deputies have violated grand jury secrecy
rules. An independent investigation of this matter is now more
necessary than ever to determine how to address these violations of
secrecy and to address the question of what steps need to be
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, traveling with the president in Portland, Ore., was
alluding to the fact that it is against the law to release grand
jury information. Some courts, including the U.S. Court of Appeals
in Washington, have held that the prohibition extends to
information gathered by prosecutors in preparing for grand jury
proceedings. Other courts have taken Starr's view about the
legality of releasing such information.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, Starr's spokesman, said at 12:30 p.m. Saturday
that he would not comment until he had finished reading the
article, but would try to do so by 2 p.m. He did not call by that
time, and further attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Jan. 21, when the first stories appeared suggesting
that Clinton had had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a
former White House intern, most of the reporting on the subject has
been based on unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, sought
contempt sanctions against Starr for ``the deluge of leaks which
quite obviously stem from your office.'' Starr replied by
suggesting that the White House was the source of some leaks. No
action has been taken on the motion.
</P>
<P>
   The article by Steven Brill, the editor and publisher of the new
magazine on the press, identifies various reports as apparently
coming from Starr's office, including the Washington Post's initial
story and a Newsweek article of Feb. 2. The newsweek story relied
on taped conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, a
former co-worker, that reportedly contained statements by Ms.
Lewinsky indicating she had demanded a job as the price of denying
a sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr identified three reporters, Michael Isikoff of Newsweek,
Susan Schmidt of the Washington Post and Jackie Judd of ABC News,
as journalists to whom his deputy, Jackie Bennett had talked
``extensively'' about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in the April 15 interview, also said that he had held
discussions with two New York Times reporters before publication of
a Feb. 6 article about Betty Currie, Clinton's secretary. That
article described how Mrs. Currie had received gifts the president
had given to Ms. Lewinsky, and that the president had talked to
Mrs. Currie about questions he had been asked concerning Ms.
Lewinsky at a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine reports that Starr told Brill, ``I only wanted to
talk to them about the timing.'' He said, ``My understanding was
that they knew the substance of it.'' He also said Bennett had
talked to the Times reporters, Jeff Gerth and Stephen Labaton, who
wrote the story with Don Van Natta, ``more extensively.'' But
Bennett told Brill that he was ``in no way a source for the
information in the Times' Betty Currie story.''
</P>
<P>
   The article in the new issue of Brill's Content, which was
released to various news organizations Saturday, is highly critical
of much of the reporting on the matter, saying that journalists
worked hastily and rushed unconfirmed information to the public.
The article also suggests that leaks from Starr's office were
orchestrated to pressure Ms. Lewinsky and her lawyer into
cooperating with the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   But the direct quotations of Starr could prove significant,
because they clearly relate to Kendall's accusations of
prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The article quotes Starr as saying that there was ``nothing
improper'' about discussions with reporters ``because we never
discussed grand jury proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely not 6-E,'' he said in reference to the
federal rule barring disclosure of grand jury information, ``if you
are talking about what witnesses tell FBI agents or us before they
testify before the grand jury or about related matters.''
</P>
<P>
   But on May 5, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia said the prohibition extends to ``not only what has
occurred and what is occurring, but also what is likely to occur.
Encompassed within the rule of secrecy are the identities of
witnesses or jurors, the substance of testimony as well as actual
transcripts, the strategy or direction of the investigation, the
deliberations or questions of jurors, and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether these leaks, if not illegal, still violated
Justice Department and American Bar Association guidelines against
leaks of pending investigations, Starr replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be true except in case of a situation where what we
are doing is countering misinformation that is being spread about
our investigation in order to discredit our office and our
dedicated career prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is our obligation to counter that kind of
misinformation,'' he said. ``And it is our obligation to engender
public confidence in the work of this office.'' &QL;

IN TURKEY, THE LOT OF THE PRESS INCLUDES JAIL TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ A couple of dozen of Ragip Duran's friends
arranged a farewell dinner for him Thursday night at a restaurant
in Istanbul's artistic Asmalimescit quarter. Spirits were high,
jokes and stories were told, and much Turkish food was washed down
with much beer, wine and raki, the potent anise-flavored national
drink.
</P>
<P>
   Duran, a prominent journalist who has worked for several Turkish
newspapers as well as for the BBC and Agence France-Presse, is not
leaving Istanbul for an extended vacation. Nor has he taken a job
or accepted a fellowship abroad. He is going to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has some of the most restrictive press laws of any
country professing democracy. Journalists who challenge
long-established taboos risk falling afoul of the anti-terror law,
which bans propaganda for Kurdish guerrillas or other groups that
are considered threats to the nation. Under that law Duran, 43, has
been sentenced to serve seven months in prison beginning Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His case is far from unique. After a period of tolerance, the
Turkish authorities imposed measures in 1993 intended to crush the
Kurdish insurgency. Thn-Prime Minister Tansu Ciller authorized the
deployment of hundreds of thousands of troops in the mostly Kurdish
southeast, and they carried out intensive sweeps through guerrilla
areas and evacuated hundreds of villages.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a new crackdown on the press began and dozens
of intellectuals and others deemed sympathetic to the guerrilla
cause were killed by shadowy death squads.
</P>
<P>
   The murder campaign has all but ended, but the prosecution and
imprisonment of journalists and intellectuals continues.
</P>
<P>
   A court recently upheld the conviction of a leftist social
critic, Haluk Gerger, who was imprisoned this year after he
published an article portraying Kurdish guerrillas as authentic
representatives of the Kurdish people.
</P>
<P>
   The week before last, police also picked up Esber Yagmurdereli,
a blind lawyer who is facing a 22-year sentence for ``spreading
separatist propaganda,'' and returned him to jail. He had been
freed for health reasons, but refused to submit to medical
examinations because he said he did not want to be ``treated as a
special case.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, prosecutors have spread their net to include
not just those who speak favorably of Kurdish nationalism, but also
those who support Islamic causes. Istanbul Mayor Recep Tayyip
Erdogan is appealing a 10-month prison sentence for making a speech
that judges found to be pro-fundamentalist. Another leading figure
in Islamic politics, former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, is
the subject of several investigations that could led to his
prosecution and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's farewell dinner for Duran, several Turkish
journalists spoke bitterly of the European Union's decision in
December not to consider Turkey's application for membership. They
said it had led anti-democratic forces here to conclude that there
was no reason for Turkey to ease its policy toward dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support of Europe has been extremely important to
civilians in countries emerging as democracies, like Spain and
Portugal,'' one journalist asserted. ``But when it comes to Turkey,
Europe just turns its back. How are we supposed to develop
democracy here without any help from people who say they support
our ideals?''
</P>
<P>
   Duran's crime was to publish an article portraying Kurdish
guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan as a thoughtful figure who ``cites
Zarathustra or Freud'' and ``gives a lot of importance to equality
and fraternity.'' This contradicts the official view that Ocalan is
a ruthless terrorist without redeeming qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the founding of our republic, four or five subjects have
been established as taboos, and you can only write about them if
you accept the official line,'' Duran said. ``You are free to say
that Kurds are Turks or that Kurds do not exist in Turkey, but if
you try to understand the Kurdish problem and say that Kurds have
rights, that is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The second taboo is Islam, or any suggestion that the Republic
has not been able to wipe away the influence of Islam in daily
life. The third is the role and function of the army in the Turkish
government and state. Free discussion of the Armenian problem and
its history is also impossible, and the same is true about
relations with Greece and Cyprus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state tries to say that the press shouldn't be getting
into these issues,'' he said, ``but I think they are very complex
problems that have to be examined and studied. That's what got me
into trouble.'' &QL;

<P>
   BRIDGEVIEW, Ill. _ The house on Thomas Street in this suburb 15
miles southwest of Chicago has a red rose bush growing under the
front window, fishing rods leaning against the door and two boys in
Bulls T-shirts shooting baskets in the drive.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to the federal authorities, these stock images of
middle-American life are deceiving: this is the home of a man who
has operated secretly as a high-ranking member of the Islamic
terrorist organization Hamas, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Mohammed Salah, served nearly five years in an
Israeli prison after pleading guilty to membership in Hamas.
Released in November 1997, Salah, a naturalized U.S. citizen born
in Jerusalem, returned to his home in this quiet subdivision near
one of the area's largest mosques. Salah, 45, lived modestly and
unobtrusively with his wife, Azita, and three children _ until last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the government stepped in. Prosecutors obtained a court
order seizing the Thomas Street property, as well as bank accounts
in seven Illinois financial institutions worth nearly $1.5 million.
Prosecutors did not charge Salah with a crime, but law enforcement
officials said their investigation could lead to his indictment on
terrorism-related charges because they had evidence that the money
was to be used illegally to underwrite the Hamas war of terror.
</P>
<P>
   The action represented the first time that federal prosecutors
applied civil forfeiture laws in an effort to stop the flow of
money through U.S. financial institutions to a terrorist group
abroad. More frequently, these laws are used against drug
traffickers, bank swindlers and fraudulent stock traders.
</P>
<P>
   But more importantly, the case seemed to signal a hardening in
the government's attitude toward Hamas activities in the United
States. For years, law-enforcement officials often expressed
uncertainty about Hamas supporters who said their efforts here were
humanitarian campaigns to help support hospitals, orphanages and
schools in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   In a highly detailed affidavit, federal prosecutors disclosed
what they presented as a reconstruction of Salah's bank
transactions in the early 1990s. Prosecutors said that wire
transfers of tens of thousands of dollars from other accounts in
the United States and Switzerland linked Salah to specific
terrorist attacks, including one in which an Israeli soldier was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   But Salah, in an interview with his lawyers present, said the
government had seriously misjudged him, mistaking his charitable
efforts on behalf of the Palestinians as terrorism. ``I am not a
member of Hamas, I am not a supporter of them,'' Salah said. ``I am
a person who likes to help poor people.''
</P>
<P>
   Salah said his admission of guilt in an Israeli military court
was a sham _ the only way he could avoid a potential life sentence.
He said he signed an incriminating statement because he feared for
his life after days of beatings and physical threats by the
Israelis. ``Is this man a bag man for a terrorist network?'' said
his lawyer, Matthew Piers. ``The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   The voluminous affidavit prepared by the FBI said the agency had
obtained evidence, mainly bank records, that showed for the first
time how Salah and his alleged confederates deposited hundreds of
thousands of dollars in several Northern Illinois banks and engaged
in one real-estate deal that was intended to supply money to
support the Hamas campaign of terrorism against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The illegal transfers have supported specific terrorist
activities,'' the affidavit said, ``involving the extortion,
kidnapping and murder of the citizens and government of the State
of Israel as part of an ongoing movement and campaign publicly
pledged to the goal of forcing, through coercive and violent means,
the state and citizens of Israel to cede physical and political
control and dominion over the lands comprising Israel and the
occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI document said Salah used a cover story to carry out his
activities, operating as a computer analyst for the Quranic
Literacy Institute, a Chicago-area group that translates sacred
Islamic texts. In reality, the government said, Salah worked
secretly as an important Hamas courier and conduit who moved money
around the world to finance weapons purchases and launch attacks
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit combines new financial data with Israeli
intelligence information and the admissions that the Israeli
military authorities said Salah made to them after his arrest. At
the time of his arrest, his statements suggested, Hamas had
logistical and financial support in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis said Salah had admitted that he helped train and
recruit candidates for Hamas military cells in the West Bank and
Gaza and conducted background checks and interviews for prospective
members. His training, the affidavit said, included mixing poisons,
developing chemical weapons and preparing remote-control explosive
devices.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving this training as a Hamas member in the late
1980s, Salah began operating as a financial agent for Hamas in
1991, opening accounts at First National Bank of Chicago, LaSalle
Bank and Standard Bank &AMP; Trust in suburban Evergreen Park,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Salah's account of his actions is far different. He denied
telling the Israelis that he was a Hamas recruiter. He said he
moved to the United States as a youth to join his older brother,
who lived in the Chicago area. He studied chemical and electrical
engineering, but never found work in his field, opting instead for
jobs in Arab-owned grocery stores and as a used car salesman as he
pursued what he described as humanitarian efforts. He said he
volunteered the literacy group and never misrepresented his income
to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   As his reputation grew, Salah said, he began receiving money
raised in the mosques and from wealthy benefactors to distribute to
the needy. But he received the money in deposits and wire transfers
to his personal bank accounts, in an arrangement that he described
as a private philanthropic network created outside the system of
laws and tax exemptions that regulate large financial gifts from
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials expressed skepticism at Salah's
account, saying large deposits to Salah were split into smaller
sums in an apparent effort to avoid notice. The affidavit said that
from June 1991 to December 1992 Salah spent about $100,000 on
``direct support of Hamas military activities.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the FBI said he gave a Hamas member $48,000 to buy
weapons, including an M-16 rifle used in a suicide attack in
October 1992 that resulted in the murder of an Israeli soldier in
Hebron. In December 1992, Salah traveled to the West Bank for what
the government said was a Hamas operation.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, according to the affidavit, was ordered by Mousa
Mohammed Abu Marzook, described as a Hamas leader. Marzook
instructed Salah to distribute $790,000 to Hamas units for
terrorist actions, the government said. In the following days a
total of $985,000 was deposited into Salah's LaSalle account.
</P>
<P>
   Salah said the trip was an effort to distribute money to
destitute families after a mass deportation of Palestinians after a
brutal murder of an Israeli border guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money came from donations, mosques, individuals and
charities and support projects,'' Salah said. ``I've never even met
Abu Marzook.''

CURRENT TOBACCO BILL PLEASES NO ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The anti-smoking bill now before the Senate has
strayed far afield.
</P>
<P>
   Amendments added last week included a big tax cut for many
married couples, vouchers to pay for some children to attend
private and parochial schools and grants to the states for
child-care programs. Before the Senate is finished, which could be
as early as this week, more extraneous benefits will probably be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   What the bill does not have is what the cigarette makers and the
state attorneys general wanted most last June when they negotiated
the settlement that prompted Congress to take up the issue. It
would not give the tobacco companies immunity from lawsuits filed
by or on behalf of people with smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, from the perspective of the attorneys general, once
the tax cuts and anti-drug provisions of the Senate bill became
fully effective, little money would be left for the states to spend
on anti-smoking campaigns and other public health programs.
</P>
<P>
   So no one is happy.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies have walked out, saying it would be futile
for them to negotiate further with lawmakers who are mostly
interested in punitive taxes and penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote
to all senators on Friday, saying that the Chamber was stepping up
its advertising campaign against the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Public health organizations like the American Heart Association
and the American Cancer Society are threatening to oppose the
legislation because the anti-smoking and medical research programs
they favor are being given short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans complain that the bill is the kind of legislation
they hate most _ a tax-and-spend approach to a social problem, in
this case teen-age smoking. Democrats say that the incremental
increase in cigarette prices, $1.10 over five years, is
insufficient to keep young people from becoming addicted to
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, if the bill comes to a vote in the Senate, it will
probably be passed by a large majority. The main reason is that
senators can be sure that the measure, as it stands now, will not
become law.
</P>
<P>
   So senators will feel free to vote for it even if they are
uncomfortable with important elements of the legislation. They are
less interested in the substance of a bill that will not be enacted
than they are in avoiding getting burned politically.
</P>
<P>
   The senators can be sure that the bill will be changed because
of the stance of the Republican leadership in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich told The Washington Times that there was
``no chance, none'' that the House would even consider legislation
like the Senate bill. ``It's dead because we won't take it up,'' he
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   What Gingrich is contemplating, his associates say, is a much
less ambitious measure. He would not raise cigarette taxes. Nor
would he give the tobacco industry any protection against lawsuits.
Apparently, he plans to try to copy the low-budget ``Just Say No''
campaign that Nancy Reagan employed against drugs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In this respect, the difference between the way the House and
the Senate function is important. Senators are free agents. There
are few restrictions in the Senate on what amendments can be
offered. And a big, contentious bill like the tobacco measure can
conceivably pass even if the majority leadership is opposed.
</P>
<P>
   But the House is tightly controlled by its leaders. It is safe
to assume that the House will pass either the tobacco bill that
Gingrich favors or none
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that if an anti-smoking measure does become
law this year, it will be written in the conference committee where
the differences between the Senate and House bills will be
reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the White House has favored all along. The
president and his advisers have little influence when a bill is
being debated by 100 senators or being drafted by the House
Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But in the conference committee with perhaps a dozen lawmakers,
the White House will have a seat at the table. And at this stage, a
veto threat carries considerable weight.
</P>
<P>
   Predictions are risky about legislation that has been rescued
from more near-death experiences than Wile E. Coyote. Don't place
any bets, but as of this weekend, here is the best guess about what
lies ahead:
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, is
expected to conclude soon, maybe next week, that the Senate has
spent all the time it can afford on the tobacco bill. Important
measures like the defense bill and all the appropriations
legislation needed to keep the government running are in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   So Lott will probably support a motion to cut off debate. If he
does so, he will get the 60 votes such a motion requires for
passage, and the bill will likely be approved with 70 to 75
senators voting ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Republicans' task force on tobacco, headed by Rep.
Deborah Pryce of Ohio, can be expected to make its recommendations
along the lines Gingrich favors within a week or two after the
Senate acts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats led by Rep. Henry Waxman of California will fight the
Gingrich approach, holding that the Republicans are stooges for the
tobacco industry, but the Gingrich bill will probably be approved
before Congress leaves town for the monthlong August recess.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave September for the conference committee to meet.
The nature of the legislation these lawmakers and the president
agree on, if they can agree on anything, is impossible to predict.
</P>
<P>
   But usually, there is one big bill, often a budget measure, that
Congress deals with in a last heave before it adjourns for the
year. The bill is often loaded with ornaments to make sure that it
appeals to a majority of senators and representatives and gets
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the Christmas tree bill this October is
the tobacco legislation.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moderate to locally heavy rains will douse parts of eastern New
England Sunday as a steadfast high pressure system over the
Canadian Maritimes blocks the advance of a low pressure system off
the New Jersey coast. The sluggish low will promote persistent
onshore winds from southeast New England to Maine, importing a
steady supply of Atlantic moisture. Rainfalls of an inch are
possible from Massachusetts to New Hampshire, where the brunt of
the import of ocean moisture occurs. Farther inland, isolated
clusters of showers and thunderstorms will speckle the central and
northern Appalachians as a pool of high-altitude cold air hovers
over the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop across the
middle Mississippi, Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys as a sluggish
low pressure system north of Kansas City draws humid air north from
the Gulf of Mexico. A few of these storms may reach severe levels,
with the region at risk spanning from west Tennessee to Missouri,
Illinois and Iowa. Only a very small part of this region will be
affected by severe weather. Scattered showers and thunderstorms
will develop over parts of the northern Plains as moist air
circulates westward around the Kansas City low.
</P>
<P>
   Hot, dry winds from the southwest will surge into west Texas and
west Oklahoma. Winds will average 15 to 30 mph with higher gusts.
Blowing dust will reduce visibility at times. Farther east in
Texas, isolated thunderstorms will erupt along the boundary
separating the dry air from humid air from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Merging Funnels
</P>
<P>
   A tornado spotter reported that three funnel clouds merged into
one over Riverton, Wyo., on Thursday. Below the base of a rotating
thunderstorm, a wall cloud dipped downward as the rate of
condensation increased from rain-moistened air drawn inward by the
storm's circulation. Three funnel clouds then spun up and lowered
beneath the center of the rotating wall cloud. The funnels, similar
to when ice skaters spin faster as they draw their arms toward
their bodies, rotated at a faster pace than the wall cloud. As the
system's spin got better organized, the funnels merged into one.

BAN ON FILM HAS POLAND DEBATING CENSORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ A documentary that takes a caustic look at the
Polish operations of the American direct-sales company Amway has
set off an unusually strenuous debate here about press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The Polish-made film ``Welcome to Life,'' which is dominated by
hard-sell pep rallies that are a hallmark of the company and by the
motivational jargon of its distributors, was stopped from being
shown on television, as a result of a court order sought by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Amway argued that in seeking the injunction it wanted to protect
its reputation and its employees.
</P>
<P>
   But to more than 50 Polish journalists from across the political
spectrum, the successful court action was reminiscent of the old
communist way of doing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``A court ban amounts to a return of preventive censorship,''
the editors said in a petition to President Aleksandr Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
   The signers included Jerzy Urban, who was the spokesman for the
Communist Party in the 1980s and is now the editor of a ribald
weekly newspaper, Nie.
</P>
<P>
   The court action touched a raw nerve in Poland because Amway has
represented itself since the collapse of communism as a sure way
for Poles to become entrepreneurs and live the rich life of their
dreams. The company says it has enlisted 80,000 Poles as
distributors of its home-care products and has said that it sees
expansion into former communist countries as essential to continued
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But in China, concern over exploitation of naive people led the
government in April to ban all door-to-door sales, although Amway
can supply retail outlets with its products.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1959 in Ada, Mich., Amway has been a controversial,
closely held company. Its business practices have been the subject
of court cases in the United States and Canada. In 1979, the
Federal Trade Commission ruled that Amway was not an illegal
pyramid scheme, but ordered the company to stop setting prices at
which distributors sold products.
</P>
<P>
   Since the injunction was imposed in March, the country's biggest
newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, has published the sound track to the
film. The film is a best seller on the video black market in the
southern town of Krakow.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the dialogue goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``As a former member of the Communist Party apparatus, I was
surprised to see so many smiling, happy people clapping to the
rhythm of music,'' says a middle-aged Polish distributor. ``My
immediate association was of a Communist Party feast. Back in 1993,
this sort of thing was a complete shock to me. I simply did not
believe that there could be so many happy people in these difficult
days of political and economic transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Polish distributor says: ``There are people who have
inborn leadership qualities, people such as Napoleon, or even
Hitler, though it may seem to be a very negative example. He too
was a leader who knew how to attract the masses, the whole German
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The film goes on to show a meeting in a large hall where a man
on the stage shows how door-to-door distributors should get
householders to accept motivational tape recordings that the
distributors sell. He demonstrates how a distributor should come
within an inch of hitting a would-be customer on the head with a
tape, forcing the person to accept the tape as a way of protecting
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Amway's business, the film says, is devoted to
distributing motivational tapes intended to make distributors think
the Amway way.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Amway, Piotr Czernowski, said in an interview
that the film was unfair but that he had cooperated with the
filmmaker, Henryk Dederko, at the start of the project. Dederko
received financing from the government television station to make
the documentary, which was to be shown first on that channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Polish media believe that there should be freedom of any
expression without having any responsibility,'' said Czernowski. He
said Amway was concerned that the film would ``negatively affect
their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Journalists and editors say the case brought by Amway has
already had a chilling result. Not long after the court ruled
against the screening of ``Welcome to Life,'' a prominent Polish
businessman won an injunction against Urban's weekly, Nie, that
prevents the planned publication of an article about him.

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ On the Shankill Road, in the heart
of Protestant West Belfast, Penny Purdy tucked her three small
children into the back of her small red car the other day, fussing
with them and warning them to behave. A few hundred yards from her
car, a Catholic bomber killed 10 Protestants and himself in a fish
shop in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, for the first time in her life, Mrs. Purdy, a
Protestant, goes about her daily routine not worrying that she and
her loved ones might be killed in an instant in the sectarian
warfare between the Protestant majority and the Roman Catholic
minority in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Purdy, like 72 percent of the people in this predominantly
Protestant British province, voted May 22 in favor of a new peace
agreement to end the violence that has killed more than 3,200
people since 1969. She said she would vote again June 25 for a new
provincial Assembly to carry out the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Like an increasing number of Protestant and Catholic people
here, she is beginning to feel, with some vestigial caution, that
after 30 bloody years peace may well have arrived to stay in
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last winter when they were doing all that killing,'' she said.
``my wee Zoe asked, `Why has that man been killed?''' after another
tit-for-tat killing between Protestant and Catholic paramilitary
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized then,'' Mrs. Purdy said, ``that I'm 30 years old
and I have never known peace in my lifetime. The agreement means
peace for my three children. So I voted yes in the referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   About half the Protestants in the province voted no, mistrustful
of the Irish Republican Army's willingness to continue its
11-month-old cease-fire while politicians try to reshape the
province's political structure. But she is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think they mean it,'' she said of the IRA and its
political wing, Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people, officials and experts agree that the rate of
killings has dropped sharply since the first IRA cease-fire in
August 1994. From 1969 until 1994, the rate was about 10 dead a
month; now, after four years of intensive effort toward a peace
settlement, the rate is about about one a month, and none since the
agreement was approved May 22 in referendums here and in the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland police force, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, says there has been little if any paramilitary
violence since the referendums. Instead of reports of bombings and
shootings, people have been discussing the nasty theft of five
lambs, including a black one, owned by two young girls near
Portadown, west of here.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts emphasize that justifiable hope must still be
tempered with skepticism _ that if the politicians do not move
ahead toward new governmental panels to carry out the agreement,
voters _ and gunners _ could change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement got a solid endorsement in the referendum,''
said Andy Wood, a political consultant and former information
director for the British government in Belfast. ``We'll have to see
whether it receives such solid support six months from now. A lot
of people thought of their kids, swallowed hard, held their noses,
and voted for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Disillusionment, he said, could lead to a return of violence.
</P>
<P>
   David McKittrick, author of several books on Northern Ireland,
is also wary. ``Nobody really thinks it's all over forever,'' he
said. He said violence could erupt, as it has in recent years, if
Protestant marchers are allowed to take their parades through
resentful Catholic neighborhoods later this month and in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very dicey,'' he said of the prospects for the parades.
``Only a couple of hundred bully boys can start the confrontation.
It only needs a few to spark off the whole thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent afternoon in West Belfast, where much of the
killing has taken place, hope was more apparent than fear. On the
Shankill Road, a Protestant shopkeeper whose customers include
hard-line and mainstream Protestants said he had voted in favor of
the peace agreement, but asked, for commercial reasons, for
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep talking about Protestants,'' he said. ``Most of them
around here call themselves Protestants, but 90 percent of them
never see the inside of a church.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a wall poster depicting the Rev. Ian Paisley, the
hard-line Protestant political leader, apparently wiping a tear
from his eye. ``Don't Let Paisley Put Tears in Your Eyes,'' the
poster says, referring to Paisley's fulminating speeches against
the peace agreement. The poster was put up, the shopkeeper said, by
Protestants favoring the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Paisley posters in Protestant areas would have been
unthinkable a few years ago. But like many Protestants, the
shopkeeper said Paisley's grip on the Protestant mind and vote is
slipping fast, that he is losing sway with Protestants to David
Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, which supported the
peace agreement. Trimble is likely to head the new Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Curry, 46, an unemployed pipe fitter, disagreed with the
shopkeeper. He said he had voted no because he still distrusts the
IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should the IRA knuckle down now after all these years?''
he said. ``The IRA is giving in too easy. You take it with a pinch
of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   A mile or so away from the Shankill, on the Glen Road, a patrol
of six British soldiers stalking unseen paramilitaries, wearing
combat camouflage uniforms and helmets, armed with automatic
rifles, reminded people that the conflict is not officially over.
But Catholics along the nearby Andersonstown Road were sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be some storms ahead,'' said Eamonn
Trainor, 35, a high school teacher. ``But the peace will survive.
We are finally getting away from the politics of the cave, the
Neanderthal approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Aidan Darragh, owner of a newspaper and candy store, admitted
that he had been sure the peace agreement would not be approved.
Now that it has been, he said, ``Things look rosy now.`
</P>
<P>
   He gave credit for the deal to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and
to Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party. Darragh said he had never
before had a kind word for Trimble, but that to win approval of the
agreement ``David Trimble worked very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to get a wee bit of sense,'' Darragh said. ``He
knows now they're going to have to share power with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be some minor disturbances over the parades. But
after a couple of days it'll be over. Nothing like the past. People
are saying: `It's over. Let's get along with our lives. Let's make
the peace deal work.' '' &QL;

CLINTON: HOLLYWOOD, ACCESS TO FIREARMS, LAX SUPERVISION FUEL
KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)  (bl) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ President Clinton on Saturday blamed the
glorification of violence in popular culture, easy access to
firearms and lax parental supervision for the recent rash of
schoolyard shootings that have left a river of blood from
Mississippi to Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, the president said Hollywood bore
much of the responsibility for the recent carnage by producing
movies, television programs and music lyrics that romanticize
killing and twist the minds of impressionable teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no wonder, as scores of studies show, that our children
are increasingly numb to violence,'' Clinton said in his radio
address. ``They see and hear it everywhere _ from TV screens to
movie screens to computer screens and in popular music.
</P>
<P>
   ``When mindless killing becomes a staple of family
entertainment, when over and over children see cinematic conflicts
resolved not with words, but with weapons, we shouldn't be
surprised when children, from impulse or design, follow suit,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done many times before, the president called on
Hollywood to exercise self-restraint in the barrage of violence
that pervades film and television entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he lectured Hollywood for its share of
responsibility for violence in the American culture, he planned to
appear at an $800,000 fund-raiser for the Democratic National
Committee at the Beverly Hills home of the entertainment mogul Lew
Wasserman, founder of MCA Corp. The event, which was to include
many of the top names in Hollywood, was scheduled for Saturday
night in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, the president also called on Congress to pass
tougher gun laws and provide financing for after-school programs to
channel juvenile energy into positive pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced that he had ordered the Department of
Education and the Justice Department to produce an ``early warning
guide'' to help parents and teachers identify the signals that
often precede an outburst of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that terrible threats and rage in the face of
rejection can be more than idle talk,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived in Oregon on Saturday to speak at the Democratic
fund-raising event and to deliver the commencement address at
Portland State University. He also was scheduled to meet with
survivors and the families of victims of the May 21 shootings at a
school in Springfield, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, police officers found and detonated two bombs at
the airport in Eugene, Ore., where Clinton's plane was to land
today for the meeting in Springfield. Officials said they were
tipped by an anonymous caller, and found the two devices in a
culvert near the airport. It was unclear whether there was any
connection to the presidential visit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted the graduation speech to a defense of diversity
and a plea for tolerance of the swelling wave of immigrants to
America.
</P>
<P>
   He said that citizens have a responsibility to welcome new
arrivals, not fear or shun them, and he recalled the xenophobia in
America's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Americans have met each group of newcomers with
suspicion, with violence and discriminatory law, and doubted they
could ever become truly American,'' Clinton said. ``So great was
the hatred of Irish immigrants 150 years ago that they were greeted
with signs that read `No dogs or Irish;' so profound was the fear
of Chinese immigrants in the 1880s that they were barred from
entering the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Such treatment of immigrants is not only wrong, the president
said, it is ``un-American.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that immigrants have responsibilities as well _ to learn
English, to study the Constitution, to obey the law and embrace
American culture. &QL;

BILL TO LIMIT PROSECUTION OF HOSPITALS LOSES SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Fla.)  (lb) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A congressional effort to adopt a law making it more difficult
for prosecutors to bring cases against hospitals under a federal
fraud statute has lost support and no longer has the votes to pass,
sponsors of the legislation say.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the bill had appeared almost certain to be
approved by Congress. But support shifted after the Justice
Department recently adopted guidelines requiring greater care in
using the fraud statute against health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   A key figure who has reversed course on the legislation is Rep.
Bill Delahunt, D-Mass., who was an original co-sponsor of the bill.
Delahunt now says that the Justice Department guidelines make the
new legislation ``inadvisable.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview, the lawmaker who introduced the bill in the
House, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., said that while he still
believed the legislation should be passed, the guidelines had
probably killed its chances for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there will be support for this bill to pass
while these guidelines are being watched,'' McCollum said. ``But
there's no doubt the guidelines never would have been introduced if
it wasn't for this legislation. Only time will tell whether they
are satisfactory or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the legislation said they would be watching
carefully to see how federal prosecutors applied the guidelines,
which are intended to ensure that the fraud statute is used in a
fair way. They said the bill could once again pick up support if
the rules proved unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud statute, known as the False Claims Act, was used in
investigations as part of a national project by federal prosecutors
to battle fraudulent billing by hospitals of government health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials complained that they were receiving letters
from prosecutors demanding settlement, without a chance to present
their cases. Some also said they were being forced into considering
settlements under the threat of prosecution, which could require
the eventual payment of significantly larger sums of money as
fines.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that was written in response to those complaints
redefined how prosecutors could use the False Claims Act against
health-care providers. Among other changes, it called for raising
the standard that a jury must use to determine whether a civil
violation has been committed by a health-care provider.
</P>
<P>
   It also creates rules that would preclude the government from
bringing such cases under certain circumstances, including when the
amount of money in question is less than certain minimal levels.
Recently, some House members have discussed a plan to attach the
legislation to an appropriations bill this week to speed its
passage.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposals to change the False Claims Act, which for the
last decade has been the main tool used to recoup government losses
from fraud, created enormous concern among senior Justice
Department officials. These officials, while acknowledging that
there may have been cases in which individual prosecutors went too
far, said the new legislation would hinder their ability to bring
civil cases against health-care providers who defrauded programs
like Medicare.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The new Justice guidelines, which emerged after a number of
private sessions with members of Congress, have several
requirements for prosecutors seeking to bring cases against
hospitals using the False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, prosecutors must allow hospitals a full
opportunity to be heard before making a demand for settlement; they
must establish an adequate factual and legal case against a
health-care provider before seeking a settlement, and they must
take into account the effects an enforcement action could have on
the availability of medical services.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has also established working groups in
Washington to coordinate national enforcement efforts involving
health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Those rules addressed a number of significant congressional
concerns about the national investigations of hospital billing. In
a June 11 letter to Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder, Delahunt
wrote, ``I believe that the guidelines provide a basis for
resolution of this controversy that makes it unnecessary and
inadvisable to proceed further'' with the effort to reform the
False Claims Act.
</P>
<P>
   Still, sponsors of the bill said they would be closely watching
how the department applied the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be an effort for accounting of what they're
doing,'' McCollum said. ``And maybe an amendment to assure that
regular accounting is going to occur.''

A LATE SURGE HELPS NIGERIA WIN A STUNNER OVER SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ They play all season in scattered outposts from
South Africa to Russia, from Turkey to Kansas City. Their team
reunions are usually marked by financial squabbles and political
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Nigeria staged one of the most spectacular games of
this World Cup, or just about any other World Cup, for that matter,
beating Spain, 3-2, as both teams ran and shot against each other
for nearly the entire 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The winning goal came in the 78th minute on Sunday Oliseh's
slicing right-footed shot from the right side that found the left
corner, past the desperate dive of Andoni Zubizarreta, the Spanish
goalie playing in his 124th international game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult to get to this stage,'' said Oliseh, who
plays for Ajax of Amsterdam, ``and we have had more difficulty than
any other team in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Every World Cup has its so-called Group of Death _ the most
competitive pairings in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the consensus choice was Group D, encompassing these
two teams as well as Paraguay and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is ranked only 47th in the world, often skipping
important tests, but Saturday the Nigerians gave the
often-disappointing Spaniards a whiff of mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think ours is the most difficult group of all,'' said Javier
Clemente, the coach of Spain, before this cup. ``It's the group
with the most quality. Before coming I said, `Let's avoid the
Africans,' and we have to play Nigeria, the strongest African team,
with lots of international experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria is one paradox in this World Cup. It exports players to
the better European leagues, and it won the 1996 Olympics in
Atlanta, using many of same the players sloshing around the
rain-slicked field Saturday in the home city of Jules Verne.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians showed skill and courage that was there long
before the peripatetic Bora Milutinovic became the coach in
December, at the pricey level of $35,000 plus $250,000 if the Super
Eagles should win the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic had done well with his three previous teams, Mexico,
Costa Rica and the United States, and Saturday he tied the cup
record by coaching a fourth team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy for the people of Nigeria,'' Milutinovic said in
his broken English afterward, while wearing a white tribal robe at
the news conference. ``They fought all the way against a very tough
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic, 53, has been under intense criticism by the
Nigerian news media, and the political intrigue increased last week
with the death of the strongman president, Gen. Sani Abach.
Milutinovic's preference for defense and his suspicion of
opportunism flies directly against the natural inclinations of the
Nigerians, who were burned in the 1994 World Cup, when they could
not hold a one-goal lead against Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Spain also was put out by Roberto Baggio and Italy in 1994, and
the Spaniards were disappointed again Saturday, if not terminally
dispatched. They came out organized and aggressive, scoring first
after Mobi Oparaku struck down Alfonso Perez for a direct free kick
25 yards from the Nigerian goal.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Hierro, the experienced free-kick specialist for Real
Madrid, lashed a right-footed shot that hooked around the Nigerian
wall and caught the right corner of the goal in the 21st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than be discouraged, Nigeria came right back and earned a
corner kick from the right side at 25 minutes. Garba Lawal, who
plays for Roda JC in the Netherlands, took a left-footed kick that
hooked back toward the Spanish goal. Hierro went up too soon in
front of Mutiu Adepoju, who plays for Real Sociedad in San
Sebastian, and Adepoju leaped and deflected the ball backward, into
the near corner, a perfect show of practice and instinct, to tie
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians put so much pressure on Spain that Zubizarreta,
the long-standing goalkeeper who will retire after this tournament,
had to venture out twice to use his foot skills as an extra
defender.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second half, Hierro and Raul showed the skills that
helped Real Madrid win its latest European championship. At 47
minutes, Hierro let loose a 40-yard bomb that soared high and long,
giving Raul time to break behind the Nigerian defense. The ball
landed on the instep of his left foot and never touched the ground
until he had whacked it past Peter Rufai.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria never gave up, as Lawal broke behind Spain's Ivan Campo
on the left side and had enough balance on the slippery pitch to
release a left-footed low shot that slithered off Zubizarreta tie
at 73 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes later, Oliseh's goal thrilled the large Nigerian
contingent, including a band of drums and trumpets, that had been
playing incessantly since leaving the Montparnasse Station in Paris
at 7:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian victory was a triumph for the world soccer body,
FIFA, which has enlarged recent World Cups to the current total of
32, to include more teams from the emerging nations. The joy and
heart of the Nigerians on Saturday showed they may indeed survive
this Group of Death. &QL;

U.S. OFFICIALS STRUGGLE WITH MULTIRACIAL HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of study, the Clinton administration
decided last October that people could, for the first time,
identify themselves as members of more than one racial group when
they fill out federal forms.
</P>
<P>
   That was the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the announcement, the administration has
struggled with a few basic questions: Now that people may describe
their multiracial heritage in full detail, what will the government
consider them? If people start to list themselves on census forms
or passport applications as, say, black and white, or white and
Asian, or black and white and American Indian, in which category
should the federal government place them?
</P>
<P>
   Given how much of American society is described in racial terms,
these are hardly arcane questions. How does one describe a
neighborhood that, based on census data today, is considered 20
percent black, or a town that has an Indian population of 4
percent, when, as they can on the 2000 Census, people begin listing
themselves as members of more than one race?
</P>
<P>
   Important legal decisions in discrimination suits, and some
government policies such as the enforcement of the Voting Rights
Act, are also highly dependent on racial statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of dollars and political power depend on this,''
said Prof. Robert Hill, director of the Institute for Urban
Research at Morgan State University in Baltimore, and a member of a
citizens' board that is advising the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau produced an options paper that highlighted the
complexity _ and, some have said, the absurdity _ of the possible
solutions to this conundrum. In dry bureaucratic language, the memo
set forth suggestions that have sparked debate among statisticians
and representatives of racial groups, and could easily provide
fodder for late-night comedians.
</P>
<P>
   One option is the ``full distribution'' approach. Under this,
people would be placed in a racial category that corresponds to a
combination of races they list. A man who describes himself as
white and also as Asian would be placed in the race category of
``white and Asian.''
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of such a method, according to the Census Bureau
paper, is to fully describe the rich mosaic of American society.
The disadvantage? When the category of ``some other races'' on the
census form is also thrown in, the various combinations would give
the United States 63 officially recognized races.
</P>
<P>
   Another option put forth in the paper is called the ``all
inclusive'' approach. Here, the government would assign one person
to one or more categories, depending on the combination of races
listed by that person. The problem with this, as the paper states,
is that ``the resulting distribution adds up to more than 100
percent of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Still another possibility, according to the Census Bureau, is
the ``collapsing'' approach, in which a person of mixed race is
placed into one of the six racial groups that will be recognized by
the government for the 2000 census _ American Indian, Asian, black,
native Hawaiian and other Pacific islander, white and other.
Hispanic origin is considered an ethnic category and not a racial
category. A person who lists American Indian and white would be
placed in either one of these categories.
</P>
<P>
   But which one? And on what basis would the decision be made?
</P>
<P>
   In its paper, the Census Bureau lays out options. Such people
could be randomly assigned to a racial category. They could be
assigned a race based on the racial makeup of their neighborhood.
They could be assigned on a proportional basis, using current
racial breakdowns in the overall population as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau's paper also suggests a plan where ``a person
selecting `white,' `American Indian' and `Asian' would be tabulated
one-third in each category.''
</P>
<P>
   The current dilemma came about as a result of the increasing
number of inter-racial and inter-ethnic marriages _ primarily
between whites and Asians and between non-Hispanic whites and
Hispanics _ and the requests of their offspring to no longer be
forced to select one racial category on federal forms.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the change, some advocates for established racial
groups warned the Office of Management and the Budget, which
oversees federal policy on racial classification, that changing the
existing officially recognized races would be complicated and
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about, no more than, maybe, 5 percent of the
population, and we're turning ourselves upside down when 95 percent
only list one race,'' Hill said. ``To me, that is the tail wagging
the dog.'' &QL;

ANNAN'S STRATOSPHERIC PROFILE GIVES U.N. A NEW FACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For the first time in its half-century of life,
the United Nations seems to be basking in the glow of a celebrity
secretary general.
</P>
<P>
   Kofi Annan, his aides say, is the man all New York wants at
dinner parties. In this season of graduation speeches,
photographers have zoomed in on him. He is held up as a fashion
example, and this month George magazine named him one of the 20
most fascinating men in politics.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. family is not totally united in happiness about this.
When bulletin boards around headquarters became almost exclusively
devoted to photographs of his every meeting and trip _ Kofi
conquers Baghdad, Kofi goes Hollywood _ the grumbles started. Some
officials called the addition of a pictorial Annan display outside
the cafeteria a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   Camera teams began to accompany the secretary general and his
wife, Nane, just about everywhere. Then came a little booklet of
speech extracts titled ``The Quotable Kofi Annan,'' published by
the organization's Department of Public Information. Was someone,
people asked, at work creating a cult of personality here? And if
so, who?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not accept the term `personality cult' because that's
not the way the U.N. functions,'' said Shashi Tharoor, a close aide
to Annan, as he acknowledged a role in these recent developments.
``Nothing could be more foreign to a man of Kofi Annan's extremely
well-known modesty and humility as a human being.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But'' Tharoor added, ``we have no apologies to make about
using Kofi Annan and his personal image to enhance the standing of
the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   A well-known writer on Indian politics and novelist, Tharoor has
years of experience in the United Nations. He is about to become
the secretary general's communications director, a new slot in the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put a warm and human face on the U.N. is almost basic
public relations _ and Kofi Annan is that face,'' said Tharoor, who
worked with Annan in peacekeeping and moved with him to the
secretary general's office last year. ``In his first year and a
half in office, he has become increasingly identified to television
viewers around the world, and indeed to headline writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone, Tharoor said, are the days when New York magazine could
joke, ``If you thought Kofi Annan was a decaffeinated brew ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration forced out Annan's predecessor,
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to get a leader it considered more
attractive to Congress. But it has seen many hopes dispelled by
Republican leaders' refusal to pay the organization a debt of over
$1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tharoor is optimistic, and banking on Annan's appeal.
Critics may describe the United Nations as a glass box full of
faceless bureaucrats, but Annan is a major exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have someone who is neither anonymous nor faceless and
comes across not as a bureaucrat but as a regular human being who
thinks, who is reflective, is witty and cares,'' Tharoor said.
</P>

the financial sword of Damocles over our heads, it would be crazy
not to use the secretary general's ability to reach out to
Americans.'' &QL;

WHO NEEDS RONALDO? GERMANY HAS BIERHOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICE, France _ While the Americans have camped at an isolated
vineyard for the World Cup, with only Beaujolais grapes to keep
them company, Germany has chosen the fun and sun of the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl dropped in for a visit on Friday. And
coach Berti Vogts has brought along classical music to the Cote
d'Azur, better to help him relax by the pool while he works on his
tan.
</P>
<P>
   And why shouldn't Vogts be so serene? While the Americans are
desperately looking for someone _ anyone _ who can put the ball
into the net during Monday's opener in Paris, the German team
enters the match with four of the best forwards in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Vogts will choose two, most likely Jurgen Klinsmann, making his
third World Cup appearance, and Oliver Bierhoff, the latest scoring
sensation in the Italian League who has revived a career that once
seemed destined to end without the slightest hint of international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the great Ronaldo of Brazil who led Italy's Serie A
in scoring this season. Nor was it Gabriel Batistuta of Argentina.
Nor was it the Italian stars Roberto Baggio or Alessandro Del
Piero. It was the tall, slender Bierhoff, an economics student, who
plunked in 27 goals for Udinese, earning himself a handsome $12
million transfer for next season to help resuscitate the fallen
giant AC Milan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit strange to be called a superstar in the same breath
with those other athletes,'' the 30-year-old Bierhoff said. ``I
hope I am able to bear the pressure and perform to expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 2 inches, he is tall for a striker. While Klinsmann
roams the flanks, Bierhoff is a classic center forward who waits
like a poacher in front of the goal for the chance to score. Like a
basketball forward, he is an expert at backing in and using his
arms in the low post. For each goal that he scores in the World
Cup, he said, his sponsors will contribute a total of $6,700 to
UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be aware that he uses his body and his arms to
push you away,'' said Thomas Dooley, the American sweeper who was
born in Germany. ``He's very tall, so it's easy for him. He's very
good in the air; you have to try to hold him when he jumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon signing with AC Milan, Bierhoff said he hoped to outscore
Ronaldo in the World Cup, just as he outscored him in the Italian
League. He said he felt the need to get noticed. Perhaps that is
because he went so long without recognition. Playing in the World
Cup seems almost like a dream, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think I have to wake up,'' Bierhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Rolf, is the director of a regional power company.
As a young player in Essen, Germany, Bierhoff admittedly played
like the rich kid that he was. He was reluctant to dive on the
ground for balls, he said, and at the end of every match, his
jersey remained an unstained white. His father cured him of this
fastidiousness by having him dive 50 times in a row onto wet grass
covered with a scrim of ice. Three or four repeats of this drill
convinced the shivering teen-ager that daintiness was not an
admired trait in soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to learn to get dirty,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, he kicked around the German Bundesliga for years, moving
from one team to the next without exciting anyone, and finally,
during the 1990-91 season, Bierhoff struck out for Austria, where
he scored 23 goals in 32 league games for Salzburg. That got him a
ticket to the Italian League, but Inter Milan farmed him out right
away to Ascoli in the second division. Ascoli didn't want him
either. Bierhoff told Agence France-Presse that one day about 100
fans surrounded his car, spitting at him and issuing threats and
insults.
</P>
<P>
   The team's president told him not to bother coming back to
practice, Bierhoff said. Stubborn, he would not leave. A new coach
came in and encouraged him and, a season later, Bierhoff led
Italy's second division in scoring with 20 goals. That got him a
promotion to Udinese for the 1995-96 season, and caught Vogts'
attention when he was putting together Germany's team for the 1996
European championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my baddest experience but my most important
experience,'' Bierhoff said of Ascoli. ``Now, if I have some
difficulties, I'm not falling down. I have only to think about that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierhoff scored only twice in the 1996 European tournament, but
he delivered his second goal in sudden death overtime to defeat the
Czech Republic in the championship game. Once a nobody, he was now
a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so low, I could only go up,'' Bierhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It was very important to do something on the
international level.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierhoff has improved his conditioning, and the explosiveness in
his legs, by using weights, and his goal scoring has provided him
with muscular confidence. He has scored 17 goals in 26 appearances
with the national team.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Americans, Bierhoff said he knew little about them,
except that it was important for Germany to play its own game. The
three-time World Cup champions tend to start slowly and build
throughout the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've been warned,'' Bierhoff said. ``The Americans aren't
some little team. They've beaten Brazil. We know we have to be 100
percent now. But at the end we are one of the favorites, and we
have to accept it and show that we're a good team.'' &QL;

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The volunteers scrubbed, painted and hammered,
mending a peeling church and a crumbling community center, and then
gathered to bask in the praise of their leader, an imposing man in
a sport shirt emblazoned with a child's red wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `So you had a big media event a year ago, but
what's happened since?''' said Colin Powell, recalling the verve
and hoopla, and more than a dollop of skepticism, that surrounded
what was called a ``summit'' on volunteerism, in Philadelphia. The
meeting spawned America's Promise, Powell's organization to help
children in danger of getting into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Florida, you're telling them what's happened since,''
Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the triumphant tone, the general's words seemed to
recognize clearly that there is still more than a little skepticism
surrounding his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   An American hero accustomed to ticker tape, the retired general
and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has seen his
profile fade somewhat from the national spotlight as he has
undertaken a mission that in some ways is more complicated than
battlefield logistics and whose success is harder to measure. And
there have been some stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, the organization used a part-time director, but
soon found that the job would require more attention, ultimately
settling on Peter Gallagher, a former top officer at AT&AMP;T, as its
full-time chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Powell concedes that his group was also taken by surprise by the
turf concerns among other philanthropic organizations, and he works
to dispel the notion that America's Promise is a new charitable
competitor. Rather, he says, it is an umbrella organization that
acts as a go-between for givers and social-service groups.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been difficult to sustain the kind of attention that
was lavished on the Philadelphia conference, officially the Summit
for America's Future, where President Clinton and former President
George Bush served as co-chairmen. In addition, the 61-year-old
Powell lamented that his efforts, especially in the first months,
were inevitably seen through a political lens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question seemed to be `What's Powell up to?''' he said,
once again ruling out any desire to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's visits to cities around the United States generate big
headlines in local newspapers, but he has been largely missing from
the pages of the national press.
</P>
<P>
   After the early obstacles and stumbles, the organization has
begun to build momentum, with a register of impressive commitments
from big corporations and an outpouring of workaday people willing
to roll up their sleeves for programs that reach out to children.
On three successive days recently, Powell exhorted big rallies of
volunteers and civic leaders in Minnesota, Michigan and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The general, who often cites figures showing that 15 million
children are at risk of following a wayward path, said he took on
the mission to help steer them away from trouble because there is
no greater obligation than helping young people on society's
margins. The campaign was inspired by former Gov. George Romney of
Michigan, who long called for a vast movement to help young people.
</P>
<P>
   As the unpaid leader of America's Promise, Powell seeks
donations of time and money from corporate leaders, matches donors
with charitable providers of services, and travels around the
country to inspire the local and state volunteer movements born in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he goes, Powell cites the campaign's successes, which
include millions of dollars in contributions and millions of hours
in volunteer time pledged by companies like Allstate, Lenscrafters,
Eli Lilly and Pfizer. While the organization operates on a $6
million annual budget, provided by charitable organizations and
donors, America's Promise raises far more in donations that go
directly to social-service providers.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of the nation's growing willingness to help guide
disadvantaged young people, more than 200 volunteer organizations
have sprung up around the country since the Philadelphia
conference. The Boys and Girls Clubs alone have begun more than 200
new clubs around the country, and the number of volunteer mentors
at Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America has increased 22 percent
in a year.
</P>
<P>
   America's Promise does not keep a tally of the amount of time
and money donated, in large part because the group simply gets
donors and providers together, and never touches the contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of major philanthropic leaders, it is much too early
to gauge whether Powell's efforts will translate into a serious
reduction in the number of young people who join gangs, go to
prison or die from gunfire. But the campaign so far has won mostly
favorable reviews, if not universal raves.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Rimel, president of the Pew Charitable Trusts, the
Philadelphia foundation that contributed $1 million to Powell's
organization at its inception, characterized its efforts thus far
as something less than a home run but more than a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard questions will need to be asked in three to five
years,'' Ms. Rimel said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other charitable groups, Ms. Rimel said, there had been
concern that America's Promise would ``come in and sop up a lot of
the resources.'' But as it had intended, she said, the organization
has worked as a deal maker and broker between donors and providers
of help.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Rimel said the campaign might initially have underestimated
its ability to raise money _ an enviable situation, but one that
has posed an enormous logistical challenge in figuring out how best
to earmark the money it raises.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Beene, the president of the United Way of America, said
Powell's organization had succeeded in elevating the importance of
volunteerism at the grass-roots level. ``I have never seen another
time with more focus on volunteerism in this country,'' Ms. Beene
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the progress being made by local groups inspired by
America's Promise ranged from heroically successful to something
less than had been expected, but she said such differing results
were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beene also said Powell's group faced a mammoth challenge in
simply learning the players and abilities in the vast world of
philanthropy. Noting that there are more than 700,000 nonprofit
organizations, including 28,000 new ones each year, Ms. Beene said
Powell's group was ``learning a new landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``They've been at this about a year. United Way has
been doing it for 100 years _ and we're still learning the
landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell's organization focuses on five goals it wants to achieve
for children who might otherwise go astray: a relationship with a
caring adult; a safe place during nonschool hours; a physically
healthy childhood; a marketable skill; and a willingness to ``give
back'' through community service.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Goodwin, the president of the Points of Light Foundation,
a volunteer group started by Bush, said Powell's efforts had
succeeded in changing the way Americans view volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volunteerism was something done by little blue-haired old
ladies or wives of corporate titans, but not the rest of us,''
Goodwin said. ``That view has changed dramatically.''

LONGO HAS BECOME THE LONE RIDER OF HER SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people in cycling think Jeannie Longo is the best female
bicycle rider ever. But not many like her as a person. They say
Longo, a 39-year-old Frenchwoman, is self-centered and selfish,
anti-establishment, anti-everything and anti-everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Longo says it is all envy and misunderstanding. She insists she
is a sensitive person, so soft that she often cries when
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not that tough,'' she said in an interview last week in
Philadelphia, where she was competing in the Liberty Classic. ``My
husband taught me to be strong in the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 4 inches and 105 pounds, she looks fragile. At home
near Grenoble, she raises chickens and organic vegetables and sells
her own line of vitamins. But most of the time on and off the bike,
she is a tiger.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Patrice Ciprelli, who has coached her since 1979,
married her in 1985. Starting in 1985, she has won nine world
championships on the road and three on velodrome tracks. In the
1996 Atlanta Olympics, she won the gold medal in the road race and
the silver in the road time trial. She has broken 36 world records.
</P>
<P>
   Despite scrapes and bruises from a four-woman crash near the end
of last Sunday's $44,737 Liberty Classic, the world's richest
one-day bike race for women, she finished 25th. Her next stop will
be the richest stage race for women, the $100,000 Hewlett-Packard
International Women's Challenge, Tuesday through next Sunday in
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the scrapes she experiences seem to be of her own
making. Wherever she goes, the stories follow. She is always
different. She trains alone.
</P>
<P>
   When she rides for the French national team, she sometimes
refuses to stay at the team hotel and will not eat with teammates.
Those teammates seldom talk to her. French officials do, largely,
it is said, because they like the medals she wins for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   She further alienated French cycling in the 1994 world road-race
championships in Sicily. Four other riders, two of them French,
broke away near the end and built a big lead. France was sure to
win at least a bronze medal if Longo and the other French riders in
the main pack followed cycling protocol by staying there and
slowing potential pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   No protocol for Longo. She wanted a medal herself, so she
started chasing the leaders. The pack happily joined her and caught
up. As a result, no French riders finished in the top 10. The next
day L'Equipe, the French sports daily, summed it up with a blazing
Page 1 headline that read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Longo _ Traitre'' _ traitor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Longo won the world time trial championship in Spain.
The next day, the international federation fined her 50,000 Swiss
francs (about $34,000) because when she posed for pictures on the
podium, she put a sponsor's sticker on the world champion's rainbow
jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Longo, with an excellent command of English, told her side of
the story this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``The officials said I put on a sticker during the ceremony, but
I did not do it. After the ceremony, after everyone left,
photographers asked me for a picture with my medal. I put on the
sticker then. The next day, someone showed the officials a picture
with the sticker, and they decided to punish me.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made me write a letter to explain, and when I did they
said the fine will be only 2,000 francs, not 50,000. That was
better because 50,000 francs is more than my sponsor paid me all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Longo seems to feel everyone, starting with her opponents, is
out to get her.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time,'' she said, ``they don't want me to win. If
they want to win themselves, OK, but wanting me to lose? That is a
big frustration for me. And they watch me all the time in a race.
Sometimes I'll move a finger and they say, `Look, look, Longo is
moving her finger.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it is a sign of respect, or at least recognition.
Sometimes I feel like a little mouse. I never say, `Look, I'm here
and I should win everything.'''
</P>
<P>
   The same scrutiny comes from officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they fair to me?'' she said. ``It depends. Some have been.
But some say: `This is Jeannie Longo. Watch her.' If I have a flat
tire in a race, the jury will stay with me to be sure I don't cut
behind a car to get a draft. They don't do that with other riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am paying the price of success. It is the price of my
personality because I always say what I want to say. It is better
to tell the truth as soon as you can because the truth will always
be known anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a victim because I am not the loser. I've had a good
time, good memories, a good life. But I am a pioneer, and it is the
destiny of each truth to be denied before being recognized. It is
not easy. It is easier to stay the same way as the others. If you
want to go further, you have to go through this. You have to fight
them.'' &QL;

BENEATH HIS BOXER'S LOOK, GILKEY IS THANKFUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Bernard Gilkey looked like he had just sparred with Roy
Jones Jr. Luis Lopez was calling the New York Mets left fielder
Pernell Whitaker. A mouse swelled over Gilkey's bloodshot left eye.
A tiny laceration dotted the top of his left eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   That Gilkey's teammates were able to joke about his appearance
was a good sign. Gilkey _ and every other Met _ felt fortunate the
damage was not worse. For a scary moment, Friday night, Gilkey
experienced first-hand what eventually cut short the careers of
Tony Conigliaro and Dickie Thon.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey was beaned by a high and tight fastball from the Marlin
rookie Ryan Dempster. Luckily for Gilkey, ``it wasn't a flush
shot,'' as he put it. Instead, the ball hit Gilkey above the eye,
before sending his helmet flying off.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was amazing that Gilkey wasn't seriously injured,
considering the ball hit his face first. X-rays and a post-game
examination did not reveal any further damage, and Gilkey was
listed as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dodged a bullet by Gilkey not being hurt,'' Mets manager
Bobby Valentine said. ``The pitch got away from the pitcher and it
was in a bad area.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey, who had just snapped an 0 for 25 slide with a single in
his previous time at bat (he was thrown out trying to stretch the
hit into a double), did not think Dempster was throwing at him.
Neither did Carlos Baerga, whom Dempster hit three batters later in
the same inning.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Dempster has hit five batters in three
major-league starts. Less than a month ago, he was pitching in
Class AA, where he made seven starts. Last year, Dempster spent the
season in Class A.
</P>
<P>
   What Gilkey was upset about was that the hard-throwing Dempster
_ who probably would not be in the majors on any other team than
cost-cutting Florida _ was throwing high and tight with little
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you throw that hard, up and above the shoulders and inside,
that's dangerous,'' Gilkey said. The left fielder was extremely
fortunate the damage was not worse.
</P>
<P>
   Cook Keeps Lid On
</P>
<P>
   The Mets let a game they should have won get away from them
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii pitched an adequate five and a third innings,
allowing two runs on two hits. The Japanese right-hander left with
the Mets ahead, 3-2. He also left reliever Dennis Cook in a sticky
situation, with runners on first and third, thanks to a two-base
error committed by Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   But Cook, who pitched on the Marlins' World Series championship
team last season, needed just two pitches to extricate himself from
the jam _ and then cruised through the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Cook recorded the first two outs, before allowing
a double to Mark Kotsay. On came the right-handed reliever Turk
Wendell to face the right-handed hitting Mark Kotsay. The Florida
right fielder delivered a run-scoring single. And the game was
tied.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon relieved and induced Cliff Floyd into an
inning-ending comebacker. But Bohanon was nicked for a two-out
bloop single in the bottom of the ninth by pinch-hitter John
Cangelosi to give the Marlins runners on first and third. And then
Baerga could not glove Todd Dunwoody's grounder up the middle,
allowing Craig Counsell to score from third with the winning run in
a 4-3 Marlins' victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, Wendell and Bohanon were pitching in the late innings
because John Franco and Mel Rojas needed rest. Manager Bobby
Valentine said he thought both Cook and Bohanon threw well and
deserved better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wendell could do better,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Pondering Hundley
</P>
<P>
   After meeting in Port St. Lucie, Fla., with disgruntled catcher
Todd Hundley, Friday afternoon, general manager Steve Phillips said
he will decide ``in short order'' whether or not to grant Hundley's
request for a no-trade clause if the All-Star catcher is to play
any position other than catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to change positions to help the club's chances,''
Hundley's representative, Seth Levinson, said. ``He's not asking
for an extension, for more money or to be traded. He's asking not
to be traded. For the first time in his career, Todd senses that he
is part of an organization that has a good chance to make the
playoffs. It would be a crushing blow to Todd not to give him an
opportunity to be part of the experience. He very much wants to be
a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said his talk with Hundley ``went really well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's healing,'' Phillips said. ``He looked great. It
looked like he's getting in shape.''

MEXICO BEATS SOUTH KOREA, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYONS, France _ It has been a most unpleasant year for South
Korea, and what happened Saturday afternoon at Stade de Gerland
will not change the national mood.
</P>
<P>
   For approximately two minutes, it appeared this might at last be
South Korea's opportunity to experience World Cup success. But
shortly after Ha Seok- ju's long free kick had deflected into the
Mexican goal in the 28th minute, Ha was jogging off the field after
becoming the first player in this tournament to receive a red card
for tackling an opponent from behind.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans would have had enough trouble holding their
unexpected lead over the flashier Mexicans with 11 players on the
field. With 10, it quickly became a question of when, not if, coach
Manuel Lapuente's team would find a way to put the ball past the
fine Korean goalkeeper Kim Byung-ji.
</P>
<P>
   A second-half substitute, Ricardo Pelaez, was the first Mexican
to succeed, slamming home a deflected corner kick with his right
foot in the 51st minute. Teammate Luis Hernandez would score twice
more in the 74th and 84 minutes to secure Mexico's 3-1 victory in
the opening Group E match for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would be difficult, but we really wanted to give
Mexico a reason to be happy,'' said Hernandez, the striker with the
long blond hair who, like his team, was not particularly sharp in
matches this spring.
</P>
<P>
   With its tumbling currency and standard of living, South Korea
could have used a reason to be cheerful, too. ``Our players have
been paid and our national team well taken care of, but everybody
sees and hears what is going on at home,'' coach Cha Bum-kun said
prior to the match. ``There are players who have people close to
them who are suffering, so it's clear that the economic crisis is a
source of motivation for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic difficulties have had an impact on South Korean
soccer, which has traditionally been Asia's strongest. Several
players have been forced to play for club teams in Japan after
being dropped from the South Korean league, whose team owners
include major corporations like Hyundai, Daewoo and Samsung. The
falling won also kept thousands of South Koreans from making the
long journey to France to support their team, but after Ha's free
kick from 32 yards deflected off the side of Diulio Davino's head
and into the lower right corner of the goal, the South Koreans who
did make it to Lyons were making plenty of noise in their joyous
corner of the stands.
</P>
<P>
   This World Cup is still taking shape, but there already have
been several abrupt reversals of fortune. Brazil's Cesar Sampaio
scored the opening goal against Scotland and then gave the Scots
back the goal after his foul gave them a penalty kick. France's
substitute striker Christophe Dugarry scored a goal against South
Africa that immediately transformed him from the butt of jokes to
national hero.
</P>
<P>
   In the 30th minute Saturday, it would be Ha's turn to experience
the flip side, and after he slid into the back of Jesus Ramirez's
legs in a futile attempt to strip away the ball, the Austrian
referee Gunther Benko was soon showing him the red card that FIFA
had promised to any defender who tackled from behind.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   South Korea, already missing its star striker Choi Yong-soo
because of an injury, was now without another key player. In its
fifth appearance in the World Cup finals, the country is still
searching for its first victory, and considering the quality of the
other two teams in Group E _ the Netherlands and Belgium _ South
Korea's chances of getting the breakthrough triumph before it
co-hosts the next World Cup with Japan are highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's aim is to get past the quarterfinals for the first
time. It won the Gold Cup in February and has some remarkable
individual talent. Cuauhtemoc Blanco's ball-handling stretched the
imagination Saturday: On two occasions he trapped the ball between
his ankles and leaped through two Korean defenders to break free.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Manuel Lapuente, the Mexican who replaced Bora Milutinovic
in January, certainly looked satisfied after this match, but it was
still a better day all around for Milutinovic. Lapuente's new team
only defeated South Korea. Milutinovic's new team, Nigeria, stunned
Spain, 3-2. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: A RARE SIGHTING OF NICK FALDO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ Nick Faldo was walking to his ball just off the
12th fairway at the Westchester Country Club's West course when a
voice in the gallery whispered:
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to be the best player in the world. How would you like
that distinction?''
</P>
<P>
   Now it's almost as if Nick Faldo had dropped off the planet. He
was the world's No. 1-ranked golfer not so long ago, but lately he
might as well be the subject of an unsolved mystery: Has anybody
seen the three-time British Open champion and three-time Masters
winner?
</P>
<P>
   But every so often he has been sighted.
</P>
<P>
   When he appeared at his induction into the World Golf Hall of
Fame last month, he joked, ``I'm using this for inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   He needs it. He also needs a putting touc.
</P>
<P>
   Going into this weekend's Buick Classic, the 40-year-old
Englishman had skidded to No. 41 in the world ranking, to No. 104
in the PGA Tour's scoring average this year at 71.68, to No. 126 in
the money leaders with $144,996, down there behind R.W. Eaks, a
rookie from the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But after a shaky 74 in Thursday's opening round, the real Nick
Faldo was sighted again, briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Friday's rain that was sometimes steady and sometimes
soft, he was cruising along at 3 under par until play was suspended
because of standing water on the greens and fairways. But when play
was resumed in Saturday morning's fog, he had a bogey-bogey-par
finish for a 70 and 144.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have started,'' he said outside the scorer's
trailer. ``We couldn't see the pin on 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before he putted out on the 18th green, play was
interrupted again because of the fog that limited the visibility to
about 200 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the feel yesterday,'' he said of his putting on Friday.
``Things got a bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last eight holes Friday, he had five birdies, each with a
putt from inside 12 feet. In that stretch, he also had two bogeys.
One with a three-putt green at the eighth hole, the other after
hooking his tee shot on the 442-yard 11th hole into heavy wet rough
behind a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a Tight Lies metal wood that he endorses with a
multimillion dollar contract, he swung mightily, but his ball
squished no more than 30 yards. Still in the rough but with a clear
shot, he noticed several spectators moving behind the gallery ropes
ahead on the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep still, please,'' he called. ``Keep still.''
</P>
<P>
   Muttering to himself, he added: ``If I hit it over there, I'll
quit. I promise.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit it on the green, then two-putted from 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need to quit and he would not have quit, but for him
to even joke about quitting tells you how depressed he is with his
golf.
</P>
<P>
   His best finish this year has been a tie for 18th in the Players
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 36 rounds in 10 previous PGA Tour events, only five were
in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at the Masters about his putting touch, he replied, ``It's
silky smooth.'' That turned out to be a joke, too. He opened with a
par 72, but blew to a 79 and missed the 36-hole cut. This, of
course, was the same man (but not the same golfer) who in 1996 had
ripped up the green jacket ordered for Greg Norman when the
Australian had a 6-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' Faldo had said that Saturday night. ``If you
put a little pressure on him, you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   In their final-round duel, Norman collapsed with a 78 as Faldo
shot an almost robotic 67 and won by five strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But except for his victory in the Nissan Open in Los Angeles
early last year, Faldo hasn't even come close to resembling the
golfer who won the British Open in 1987, 1990 and 1992, and the
Masters in 1989, 1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In his last five major tournaments, Faldo has missed the 36-hole
cut in three: the last two Masters and last year's PGA Championship
at Winged Foot.
</P>
<P>
   But with his six major titles, more than any of the current
golfers on the PGA Tour except Tom Watson (who has eight), Faldo
knows that history will measure him by his trophies, not by his
prize money and his endorsement contracts.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, he recently played the Olympic Club in San
Francisco where the 98th U.S. Open will begin on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rough there is brutal,'' he said. ``They've had 15 inches
of rain this year. Between the rain and all the fertilizer, it's
thick and heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the 5-inch rough there is as tall as the tales
already being told about the balls lost in it.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing you know, there will be stories about the caddie
who put a golf bag down in the Olympic rough to look for a ball and
then couldn't find the bag. But when the Open begins, Nick Faldo
just wants to find himself.

SPORTS COLUMN: WAYS TO IMPROVE HOCKEY  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 44 hours between the end of Game 2 and the
beginning of Game 3 were filled with an unusually pleasant
afterglow. Even though it seemed as if the Detroit Red Wings were
poised to sweep the Washington Capitals in the Stanley Cup finals,
the conversational buzz was not about yet another one-sided
championship round or the absurdity of playing games on ice on
sultry June nights or the many mistakes of a tedious and ragged
season.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Joe Hardy and the musical version of the
long-ago Washington Senators, it seemed as if everyone was talking
about the game! The game! The game! Television ratings might have
been low, but those fortunate enough to see it in person or on ESPN
were not ready to forget the Red Wings' 5-4 overtime victory on
Thursday night in Joe Louis Arena. Game 3 was Saturday night in MCI
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's performance showed hockey at its visceral best. Even
those who try to stay neutral and detached could feel the little
hairs tingle on the back of their necks, their heart rates
increasing and their jaws dropping at what the eyes were enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   And did the players have as much fun as the witnesses?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we like to play,'' said Steve Yzerman, the
Detroit captain, who emphasized the word ``we.'' ``Our coach
doesn't care for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it in a nice way, not particularly critical of coach
Scotty Bowman. Few coaches in the current era encourage their
players to open up and entertain in this manner. The coaches prefer
low scores and boring games. It is said that they do this to
``protect their jobs.'' But they continue to get fired anyway, so
why not try to put on a show?
</P>
<P>
   The declining entertainment value of the product will be high on
the agenda this month, first in meetings of general managers, later
in the court of the board of governors. Many around the National
Hockey League are concerned that exciting games such as Thursday's
have become the exception rather than the rule, even in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, the bosses will seek solutions. It is likely that the
league will try to increase offense by moving the goal line from 11
feet to 13 feet from the backboards to encourage creativity in the
radius of the net. Another possibility is the reduction of the goal
crease on each side. This would allow attackers to legally post up
to the right and left of the goal without putting their skates in
the forbidden blue paint before the puck enters it.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL also might use two referees, instead of one, to further
discourage obstruction fouls, particularly those behind the play
and away from the puck.
</P>
<P>
   One alteration that should be considered is the liberalization
of the off-side rule by eliminating the center red line as a factor
in the ``two-line pass'' from the defensive zone. Because it is
illegal for a team to complete even a 10-yard forward pass from
inside its blue line beyond the center line, coaches have learned
to stifle opposing attackers by clogging up the middle of the ice
with the neutral-zone trap.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the red line from off-sides rulings and allowing
passes up to the next blue line would force defending teams to
align themselves more vertically instead of horizontally. Spreading
them out in this way would create more skating routes and better
passing angles. This would generate momentum in the neutral zone,
resulting in more scoring rushes.
</P>
<P>
   This rule has worked for decades in college hockey. It will soon
be used for international tournaments. In that NHL owners are not
about to lose seating by widening the rinks, the liberalization of
the offsides rule is the best way to swing the balance away from
the defense and toward the offense.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another critical question this summer will concern the Olympics.
Because the Czech Republic beat Russia in the gold-medal game last
February, some North Americans think the experiment was a failure.
They would have preferred the United States against Canada in the
final.
</P>
<P>
   But those who stayed objective know that the Winter Games in
Japan produced many marvelous hockey games, and more of the same
are likely if the NHL sends its players to Salt Lake City in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the league learns from its mistakes of this season, the
next Olympic winter should not include an extraneous all-star game
and four-day break. Do one or the other _ not both. And while it
may hurt them in short-term revenue, even the most shortsighted
owners might acknowledge that it could make big-picture sense to
reduce the schedule in Olympic years _ from 82 games to maybe 78.
If not, at least shorten the exhibition season and begin the
schedule a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, stop stretching out the playoffs over nine weeks to
tickle the fickle flirtation with American television networks like
Fox. Hockey season must end in May.
</P>
<P>
   Horrendous camera work, longer television timeouts and
nine-month seasons are not going to attract new fans but they do
irk current ones. When the Fox robots took the ice during
intermission of Game 1 in Detroit, you could hear the booing
beneath even the incessant blare of the gratuitous rock music.
</P>
<P>
   It is time to call a timeout on all the shuck and jive and think
about the game! The game! The game!

STARR ADMITS GIVING REPORTERS INFORMATION ON CLINTON INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to expand Appeals Court name in 4th graf. No pickup.)  (th) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel
investigating President Clinton, acknowledged in a magazine
interview that he and his aides have given information on the
Monica Lewinsky matter to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But he also insisted that these leaks were neither illegal,
because they did not involve testimony before a grand jury, nor a
violation of Justice Department ethics barring leaks of
``substantive information'' about a prosecution. In the interview
with the magazine, Brill's Content, Starr defended his actions as
necessary ``to engender confidence in the work of this office.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, responded Saturday in a
statement, saying, ``The article represents an admission from Mr.
Starr that he and his deputies have violated grand jury secrecy
rules. An independent investigation of this matter is now more
necessary than ever to determine how to address these violations of
secrecy and to address the question of what steps need to be
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, traveling with the president in Portland, Ore., was
alluding to the fact that it is against the law to release grand
jury information. Some courts, including the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, have held that the
prohibition extends to information gathered by prosecutors in
preparing for grand jury proceedings. Other courts have taken
Starr's view about the legality of releasing such information.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, Starr's spokesman, said at 12:30 p.m. Saturday
that he would not comment until he had finished reading the
article, but would try to do so by 2 p.m. He did not call by that
time, and further attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Jan. 21, when the first stories appeared suggesting
that Clinton had had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a
former White House intern, most of the reporting on the subject has
been based on unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, sought
contempt sanctions against Starr for ``the deluge of leaks which
quite obviously stem from your office.'' Starr replied by
suggesting that the White House was the source of some leaks. No
action has been taken on the motion.
</P>
<P>
   The article by Steven Brill, the editor and publisher of the new
magazine on the press, identifies various reports as apparently
coming from Starr's office, including the Washington Post's initial
story and a Newsweek article of Feb. 2. The newsweek story relied
on taped conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, a
former co-worker, that reportedly contained statements by Ms.
Lewinsky indicating she had demanded a job as the price of denying
a sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr identified three reporters, Michael Isikoff of Newsweek,
Susan Schmidt of the Washington Post and Jackie Judd of ABC News,
as journalists to whom his deputy, Jackie Bennett had talked
``extensively'' about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in the April 15 interview, also said that he had held
discussions with two New York Times reporters before publication of
a Feb. 6 article about Betty Currie, Clinton's secretary. That
article described how Mrs. Currie had received gifts the president
had given to Ms. Lewinsky, and that the president had talked to
Mrs. Currie about questions he had been asked concerning Ms.
Lewinsky at a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine reports that Starr told Brill, ``I only wanted to
talk to them about the timing.'' He said, ``My understanding was
that they knew the substance of it.'' He also said Bennett had
talked to the Times reporters, Jeff Gerth and Stephen Labaton, who
wrote the story with Don Van Natta, ``more extensively.'' But
Bennett told Brill that he was ``in no way a source for the
information in the Times' Betty Currie story.''
</P>
<P>
   The article in the new issue of Brill's Content, which was
released to various news organizations Saturday, is highly critical
of much of the reporting on the matter, saying that journalists
worked hastily and rushed unconfirmed information to the public.
The article also suggests that leaks from Starr's office were
orchestrated to pressure Ms. Lewinsky and her lawyer into
cooperating with the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   But the direct quotations of Starr could prove significant,
because they clearly relate to Kendall's accusations of
prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The article quotes Starr as saying that there was ``nothing
improper'' about discussions with reporters ``because we never
discussed grand jury proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely not 6-E,'' he said in reference to the
federal rule barring disclosure of grand jury information, ``if you
are talking about what witnesses tell FBI agents or us before they
testify before the grand jury or about related matters.''
</P>
<P>
   But on May 5, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia said the prohibition extends to ``not only what has
occurred and what is occurring, but also what is likely to occur.
Encompassed within the rule of secrecy are the identities of
witnesses or jurors, the substance of testimony as well as actual
transcripts, the strategy or direction of the investigation, the
deliberations or questions of jurors, and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether these leaks, if not illegal, still violated
Justice Department and American Bar Association guidelines against
leaks of pending investigations, Starr replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be true except in case of a situation where what we
are doing is countering misinformation that is being spread about
our investigation in order to discredit our office and our
dedicated career prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is our obligation to counter that kind of
misinformation,'' he said. ``And it is our obligation to engender
public confidence in the work of this office.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: WEANING THE WORLD OFF MICHAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael leaves us, I will also miss the breathless crushes
he evoked in other men. There has been nothing like it since Mickey
Mantle made middle-aged men cry by showing up, for a fee, at their
birthday parties.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali makes big boys melt with a frozen half-smile. But
the Mick and Ali reached their powers long after they retired, when
their fans had grown into their nostalgia years. Michael will make
his fans swoon again Sunday night with his tongue hanging out,
rising to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   And what a range of fans. The chairman of Harvard's
Afro-American Studies Department, Henry Louis Gates Jr., describes
Jordan in The New Yorker as ``both hulking and suave, and it's easy
to see why he has become a totem of black masculinity; he makes
Bill Cosby look like Uncle Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to Michael in the fanzine Slam, Scoop Jackson
writes that the few things that he, a ``brotha,'' could depend on
were ``Santa Claus, tax season, Tanqueray and you.'' And in last
week's Fortune cover piece, Roy S. Johnson calculates that the
``Jordan effect'' has helped pump $10 billion into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   What a loss! Post-Michael, the courts will be empty and young
men will run through the streets barefoot. Stock markets will crash
and greed will again be a sin. Desperately diversifying, David
Stern will declare American football, played by either sex, the
true national pastime.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be just fine. As you can see, I'm already in grief
therapy. Actually, we have been in the post-Michael era for some
time now; once there was public discussion of having to live
without him, we were already getting used to living without him.
There's always videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Some think we entered the post-Michael era two years ago when
Reebok's new Allan Iverson sneaker sold out more quickly in certain
cool stores than did the latest Air Jordan from Nike; the hip had
marked Jordan as establishment, without edge.
</P>
<P>
   Others think that Jordan's time passed when he had no
authoritative response to the charges that Nike was exploiting
Asian workers. In the booming '90s, few realists expected Michael
to feel the pain of sweatshop fingers, but they did expect him to
know about them.
</P>
<P>
   So much had been made of Michael's involvement in his many
business interests _ he helped design the shoes, smelled the
cologne, tasted the hot dogs, sat on the board of the sunglasses
company _ that he looked flabby or bogus by not at least saying, in
his detached, friendly, pragmatic way, that maybe in Indonesia the
Nike dollar was a reasonable alternative to not working at all.
</P>
<P>
   But, no, already more of a suit than a jock, Gates' ``greatest
corporate pitchman of all time'' and ``the ultimate winner-take-all
celebrity'' wiggled; he promised to look into the situation. After
the season.
</P>
<P>
   We looked past that. After all, Michael has given us more
moments than anyone since Ali, and his public image is as elegant
and clean as Joe DiMaggio's.
</P>
<P>
   He has never had a scandal stick or been involved in a major
legal action. So he liked to gamble. The spinners said that proved
how much he needed competition; he said he was no Pete Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Michael's baseball sabbatical was an endearing Roman holiday _
the world's greatest basketball player, just like you and me, had a
secret dream that failed. Michael came back and gave basketball its
last good years. As Stern well knows _ why else would he float a
challenge to the National Football League? _ the NBA is probably
over as a growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Bulls, expansion, violence, a star system that
promoted Dennis Rodman and Latrell Sprewell, as well as Jordan,
damaged brand equity far more than the slacker Shaq, Reggie (ET II)
Miller and Kobe Bryant can repair.
</P>
<P>
   Trust Nike to already have covered its assets; still the
monster, although slipping, it is branding more and more women and
soccer teams with the swoosh. Nike owns Brazil, which may someday
be as huge as Michael. And there's always Tiger Woods, who may be
boring but has already paid for himself by helping to fuel the golf
renaissance. Can you believe that Jack Nicklaus is building a
course in New York City?
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of morality, Michael's passing may affect that
wonderfully cynical HBO sitcom ``Arliss,'' now in its third season.
In the first new show, the superagent Arliss arranges a
heterosexual photo-op for a client who has been having trouble
getting a contract as a backup quarterback, because of rumors he is
gay. In the second show, Arliss arranges better contracts for a
linebacker on steroids and a running back feigning injury. With
Michael's aura gone, Arliss may look like just another excellent
ESPN documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The final arbiter on all this, The Sporting News, rated Michael
the most powerful person in sports last year, the first athlete to
make No. 1 (up from No. 27 in 1997).
</P>
<P>
   The Sporting News looked beyond the hulking and suave brotha
worth $10 billion yet was still breathless in its own hard-core,
straight-arrow fashion. Michael proved himself a true role model
``by showing up for work, well prepared, enthusiastic and
respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   If he takes that away with him, post-Michael will be the
apocalypse. Who will make the shoes?

COMMENTARY: ARTIST SEES FAME VANISH, FAST AS IT CAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. _ The night his first solo exhibit opened in New
York, Don DeNarie was as jumpy as a rabbit. People wearing black
clothes and sophisticated smiles were strolling the little Gershwin
Gallery on East 27th Street oohing and aahing over paintings he had
done while he was still living in his car. It was too much.
</P>
<P>
   Don clung to a corner, looking as if he were ready to bolt. But
he stuck it out. People said big things were waiting for
Woodstock's most visible homeless person now that his talent was no
longer a secret. Some big things were happening already.
</P>
<P>
   A CBS Morning News team was working on a profile of him. A
producer-friend of one of his nine children was bankrolling an
apartment for him. He was painting nudes on canvases he bought
instead of scavenged; for the first time in six years, he was
sleeping in a warm bed.
</P>
<P>
   Not least, his son Duke, 15, product of the fourth of his five
marriages, was living with him. And Don had virtually stopped
hanging out on the Village Green, where for 25 years he had been a
leader of the long-haired, pot-smoking band of street people who
hit on tourists for pocket change.
</P>
<P>
   People like neat little stories that end happily ever after. But
nine months later, Don DeNarie is back living in his car (with a
dog this time) in a friend's driveway not far from the Village
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Try as he might, he can't figure out exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just kind of fell apart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had problems with the apartment he and Duke were living in,
he said. ``Fumes were killing us.'' And when he finally got out of
there, after about a year of the fumes, he couldn't find another
apartment. ``Duke and I went away; we were in Arizona for two
months. Then, we came back and couldn't find a place. For an arts
colony, Woodstock hasn't been very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention, he was distracted by all the attention he was
receiving. After the gallery show and the CBS profile last
September (which led to an invitation to be honored at a dinner in
Rochester), he was stopped wherever he went. And that was all too
much. It stopped his painting cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the streets for five months now,'' he said, ``and
I'm only now just starting to get the visions in my head that make
me want to paint again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people might say that Don DeNarie was homeless so long that
at 56, he had forgotten how to live any other way. That his life
had been so formless that the rigors of the creative life, with
people relying on him to produce, became too oppressive. That
homelessness can be like drug addiction, with relapses and a
perverse pull on the psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had started painting as a young man, but life intruded. A few
years ago, he picked up an old canvas in the Woodstock dump and
started painting again. Two longtime friends, Lenny and Nancy
Kislin, noticed his paintings hanging in several living rooms _ Don
had traded them for favors and food _ and were so impressed that
they brought them to New York City for the 1997 Outsider Art Show,
the annual exhibit of work by untrained artists.
</P>
<P>
   Don's paintings were singled out for praise, which led to all
the attention he has received since the show.
</P>
<P>
   Kislin, who also exhibited several of Don's paintings in the
1998 Outsider Art Show in January, said he has tried to help Don.
But Don had his own ideas about what he wanted. ``If anyone wants
to help Don, I'll do what I can,'' he said. ``But I'm out of his
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Don's paintings have sold for up to $3,500, but he owed
more than he made, especially to Steven Haberstroh, who paid for
his apartment and expenses. Haberstroh, a longtime friend of one of
Don's sons, runs a company, Habo Entertainment, in Brooklyn, and
has taken on the job as Don's manager. He still envisions big
things for his client. He has started filming a documentary of
Don's life, which has been full of adventures and drama.
</P>
<P>
   Don, meanwhile, said he'd rather have money than fame. ``Fame
means nothing,'' he said. ``I've got $40 in my pocket.''

UNEXPECTED PROBLEM IN COLORADO: SUBPAR OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shocking development at Coors Field:
</P>
<P>
   ``When you gave up four runs in the first, you knew you could
come back,'' Don Baylor said. ``Now you're always playing the
infield in early, trying to cut that run off. It makes you manage a
little differently. You can't give them up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado Rockies' manager was explaining the surprising
problem his team has encountered this season. If the highest-priced
Baltimore Orioles and the home run-hitting Seattle Mariners have
created the most serious head scratching with their poor,
underachieving play, the Rockies are close behind with the
disappearance of baseball's lustiest offense.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that for three years hit for the highest average,
slugged the most home runs and scored the most runs. The only thing
that kept the Rockies from winning was their pitching. Now that
their pitching has improved, their hitters have lost their
lustiness.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the team that became notorious for playing under
two wildly different hitting personalities, overpowering at home
and feeble on the road, can't hit much of anything anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reason most likely is the absence of Andres
Galarraga, but Bobby Jones _ not their own pitcher, but the Mets' _
also could be a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given them probably all the information we can give them
on pitchers,'' Baylor said. ``Their preparation is there. Everybody
knows what everybody throws. One excuse guys tried to use before is
that the curveball rolls at Coors Field and then we go on the road
and it's a sharper breaking ball and it takes time to get
accustomed to that. That theory has been thrown out the window
night after night.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposing pitchers, Baylor said, no longer shy away from using
their breaking balls at the unfriendly confines of Coors. He
attributes the change in thinking to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with Bobby Jones of the Mets last May,'' he said.
``Before, he would come to Coors Field and abandon his breaking
ball. He went back to throwing it and pitching guys inside like he
does anywhere else. Each guy followed after that. They go with
their strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones recalled that game, which he won, 6-1, though his
explanation for the change in his pitching was slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you throw a curveball there, you have to change your
release point because it doesn't break as much,'' he said of his
big, over-the-top curve. ``That particular game, I started throwing
more of a slider or a slurve. I changed my release point in order
to get it down.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jones altered the Coors pitching style, Galarraga changed the
Rockies' hitting fortunes by defecting to Atlanta as a free agent.
The Rockies lost the first baseman because they would not guarantee
a third year of a contract and the Braves would.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who will be 37 this week, showed no sign of age the
past two seasons, in which he batted .311, hit 88 home runs and
drove in 290 runs, leading the league both years in RBIs. His
departure has left a gaping void in the cleanup slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galarraga was the guy you wrote in there, and you filled in
everyone else around him,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor has used Larry Walker, Vinny Castilla, Dante Bichette and
Todd Helton, a rookie, in the fourth spot, but no one has replaced
Galarraga. ``You take Galarraga out of that mixture, and it seems
that pitchers aren't intimidated as much,'' the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Castilla has been the Rockies' major offensive force, hitting 22
home runs and driving in 61 runs. Bichette bulked up during the
winter and came to spring training with the announcement that he
was stronger and would hit more home runs. He has hit fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who staged a phenomenal performance last year and won
the National League's Most Valuable Player Award, has been slowly
recovering from a January elbow operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes and goes,'' Baylor said. ``If he has to make a lot of
throws to the plate or to bases, it bothers him. Then he's out of
the lineup for three, four days at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks, the other remaining member of the once fearsome
fivesome, is having a dreadful season, hitting .196 at Coors.
</P>
<P>
   As a team, the Rockies are hitting .299 at home, compared with
.316, .343 and .321 the first three seasons at their new park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before with the offense,'' Baylor said, ``every inning, every
other inning, you'd get a rally going. It just doesn't happen.''

PITCHERS AT THE PLATE  
 INTERLEAGUE WILD-CARD PLAY UNFAIR?  
 YANKEES ON THE RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pitchers at the Plate
</P>
<P>
   So much for the complaint that American League pitchers are at a
disadvantage when they have to bat in interleague games played in
National League parks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first phase of this season's interleague games, AL
pitchers batted .155 (15-for-97), compared with .113 (9-for-80) for
NL pitchers. AL pitchers, in fact, did not hit much worse than NL
designated hitters (.190) in games played in AL parks. AL
designated hitters did not exactly distinguish themselves either,
hitting .226.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Burba of Cleveland hit the only home run among pitchers,
and Eric Milton of Minnesota and Doug Johns of Baltimore each had
two hits in one game.
</P>
<P>
   An Unfair Advantage?
</P>
<P>
   Does the current format of interleague play produce an unfair
advantage for one team over another in the wild-card race?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been an argument right from the start, but not a
serious one,'' said acting commissioner Bud Selig. ``Has there been
a lot of grumbling? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the format used this year and last, teams in one league
play against teams in the other league's corresponding division. If
one division is particularly weak and another strong, a wild-card
contender playing the weak division could benefit with a
significant number of victories.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the interleague subjects the owners addressed at
their quarterly meeting in Seattle last week, Selig said, as they
discussed whether they wanted to continue the same format or begin
rotating divisions.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no sentiment for adopting the kind of format the
National Football League uses in scheduling interdivision games:
teams are matched based on the previous season's records. That
system might appear to be fairer, but it would present its own
problems for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Union lawyer Gene Orza cited one problem. ``Let's say you took a
West Coast team that was really poor and said, because you did
poorly last year, you play an equally poor East Coast team,'' Orza
said. ``What you gain in that, you lose in travel. This team would
be tired from a 3,000-mile trek. The travel is a very big component
of competitive integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The current system has potential problems, Orza acknowledged,
but ``the idea of matching up teams based on record and not where
they are is impractical.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, a one-game matchup in the NFL is different from a
three-game baseball series. A weak NFL team has little chance of
beating a strong team on any given Sunday, but the outcome of a
baseball series can be determined by a hot team or a hot pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, the Chicago Cubs went to Minnesota with
a 37-24 record and a first-place tie to play the Twins, who had a
27-33 record and were nine and a half games out of first. The Twins
won two of the three games.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees on the Run
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lead the baseball world in just about everything
else, so why not stolen bases? Yet their major-league-leading total
of 80 is so alien to their recent history that it is mind-boggling
to think they have that many.
</P>
<P>
   Go back only a few seasons to the Buck Showalter years and look
hard to find the stolen bases. In Showalter's four seasons as
manager, the Yankees were last in the league twice and 12th twice.
Their 39 stolen bases in 1993 were the fewest for any Yankees team
since 1965. The total represented 2.5 percent of the league total.
This year's total is 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like us running that much, to tell you the truth,''
Paul O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter's team now, the Arizona Diamondbacks, has a National
League-low 23 steals (3.6 percent of the league total).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have nine guys who can steal a base, who are
above-average runners,'' Showalter said. ``I've got a couple guys
who can steal bases when the right matchup is there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Showalter questioned the wisdom of trying to steal if the
percentage of success is not good. His team's percentage is 62.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're stealing at a 50, 60 percent rate,'' he said, ``is
that good baseball? Is it good baseball to run when you're not
capable of running? So much attention is being paid to the running
game nowadays. I look around and see some of the percentages of
stealing. It makes you wonder sometimes if it's as good a play as
people make it out to be. Twenty-seven outs are very precious.''

KEVIN SUTHERLAND: HIGH AND DRY AND IN THE LEAD AT BUICK CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ The PGA Tour has taught Kevin Sutherland to be
patient. In his third full season on the Tour, Sutherland is still
waiting for his first victory. He is still waiting for the one week
in which everything clicks.
</P>
<P>
   So when rain forced the second round of the Buick Classic to be
suspended Friday before most of the field teed off, Sutherland
didn't mind. He was in first place. He was dry in the clubhouse.
And he could think of far worse situations to be in.
</P>
<P>
   With his opening-round 7-under-par 64, Sutherland held a
two-stroke lead heading into Saturday's second-round play at
Westchester Country Club. Bob Tway, J.P. Hayes, and Steve Lowery,
none of whom teed off Friday, were in a three-way tie for second
place at 66. Play was suspended Friday just a few minutes past
noon, with most of the second round still unfinished. Sutherland
was one of many golfers who never teed off on Friday, but when you
are sitting in first place, a lengthy rain delay is much easier to
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the clubhouse talking mostly,'' said Sutherland, when
asked how he passed the idle time Friday. ``And I probably ate more
than I should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials planned to resume the second round Saturday
morning at 8 o'clock. After the second round is completed, a
decision was expected to be made on the rest of the schedule.
Several scenarios could take place, including playing 36 holes
Sunday, extending play until Monday or shortening the event to 54
holes. But none of those decisions had been made when play was
halted Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rain or shine, Sutherland was looking forward to the weekend. A
33-year-old native of Sacramento, Calif., Sutherland is coming off
his best season on the Tour, winning just over $455,000, and a
victory at Westchester would rank as his career highlight. Yet, as
Sutherland watched the rain fall, he was careful not to get too
giddy about having the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of golf to be played, and a lot can happen,'' he
said. ``It's too early to think about playing with the lead. I had
a great round Thursday, but I have plenty of work left to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Sutherland did not have to look far for morale support.
His younger brother, David, who also plays on the Tour, is also in
the tournament. And whatever sibling rivalry they have is kept off
the golf course. ``We're competitive at other things, but not
golf,'' Kevin said. ``We help each other, and it's really nice to
have each other on Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin and David, who is 38, have never been paired together at a
PGA Tour event. That is just fine with Kevin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a distraction for us,'' said Kevin,
thinking about the prospect. ``It would be a lot more difficult to
concentrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland hopes to concentrate well enough this weekend to win.
He finished second at last year's Houston Open, an experience that
gave him confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn a lot about how to handle different situations from
watching things that happen out here,'' Sutherland said. ``I was
also in contention at Hartford in 1996, but I shot a 74 on Sunday
and never really threatened. But that was still a great experience.
D.A. Weibring won that tournament, and I watched how he handled
being in the lead, how he worked the last day. That helped me a lot
in Houston, when I was in contention again.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland had two chip-ins during his opening round, including
a 15-yarder for an eagle at No. 18. Those are the kinds of shots
that win tournaments. And Sutherland, who tied a nine-hole
tournament record by shooting 29 on the back nine, was encouraged
by his improved ball striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball better than I had for three months,''
Sutherland said of his opening round. ``I was struggling early in
the year, but I may have finally found something.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tom Lehman, Lee Westwood and Jim Furyk among the golfers
within striking distance, Sutherland knew it would take more solid
play to maintain his lead. Yet, it was nice to be the player that
everyone else was chasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great round Thursday to get in this position,''
Sutherland said. ``Hopefully, I can put three more good rounds
together.''

NEW YORK REAL ESTATE BOOMS, EVEN WITHOUT STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The West Side of Manhattan south of 42nd Street has
been the subject of intense real-estate speculation in recent
years. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has said that if a new baseball
stadium is built over the rail yards at 33rd Street and 11th Avenue
it will unleash a torrent of new development.
</P>
<P>
   But some of that is already under way, according to real-estate
brokers and developers. In the latest example, David Werner and
Credit Suisse First Boston emerged on Friday as the winning bidders
for the Starrett-Lehigh Building, a mammoth green and red building
near the West Side Highway in Chelsea that serves as a landmark to
the city's disappearing industrial past.
</P>
<P>
   Werner, his partner Mendy Wolfe, and First Boston bid slightly
more than $150 million, a surprisingly high sum for the aging,
19-story, 1.9 million-square-foot building that covers the block
bound by 26th and 27th streets, between 11th and 12th avenues,
according to real-estate executives involved in the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   But it is another indication that industrial buildings on the
West Side have become hot commodities as midtown rents soar and
office tenants migrate toward the West Side in search of less
expensive space.
</P>
<P>
   Werner outmaneuvered rival developers Larry Silverstein and
Douglas Durst, Richard Kalikow and Laurence Gluck of Stellar
Management Co. All the bidders were planning to renovate the
building and boost rents from $10 a square foot to about $25, which
is still well below the midtown average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the latest example of the unchecked appreciation of New
York real-estate values,'' said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman of
Eastern Consolidated Properties. ``There's a strong move west now,
and it looks like some office development may actually take hold.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starrett-Lehigh Building, which is owned by Leona Helmsley,
was built in 1932 as a freight terminal and warehouse for steel,
tire and even wine companies. Train tracks once ran under the
building, which is marked by alternating bands of red-brick and
green-framed windows.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks can descend from driveways on 27th Street to gigantic
elevators that carry the tractor-trailers to various floors for
deliveries. The upper floors offer spectacular views of the Hudson
River and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Mrs. Helmsley has sold more than $1.2
billion worth of the real-estate holdings of her late husband,
Harry Helmsley. The Starrett-Lehigh Building was the latest
property to go on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Lambert, the chairman of Eastdil Realty who organized
the sale for Mrs. Helmsley, confirmed that a top bidder had been
selected, but he declined to provide details. ``We're getting ready
to make a recommendation to Mrs. Helmsley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Real-estate executives, however, say that Werner had the high
bid and would be the most likely buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever the new owner is, he will have to invest as much as $80
million to make the landmark building attractive to office tenants,
real-estate executives say. There are only four passenger elevators
in the 19-story building. The lobby needs to be refurbished, and
the heating system and many steel windows need to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The current tenants range from a printing company to an
advertising photographer's studio. Nearly one-third of the building
is vacant. Buyers are betting that the demand for office space will
only increase, because there is little new construction.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, prices for buildings in the garment district south of
Times Square have more than doubled over the last year as office
tenants have taken over showroom buildings and loft space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The redevelopment the city was hoping to stimulate on the West
Side is there without a stadium, and it shows no sign of abating,''
Hauspurg said.

<P>
   Earlier this year, Charles Bendit and Paul Pariser of Taconic
Investment Partners acquired another sprawling industrial building,
at 111 Eighth Ave. in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-story, 2.3 million-square-foot building covers the entire
block bounded by Eighth and Ninth avenues, between 15th and 16th
streets. Bendit said the neighborhood had benefited from the Sports
Center at Chelsea Piers and the improvements made to the West Side
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Although many developers who pushed over to the West Side during
the last real-estate boom were hammered during the recession in the
early 1990s, the new crop of speculators believe the risks are
worth it, especially at the Starrett-Lehigh Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the last great opportunities to buy space at a low
price per pound,'' said William Adamski, director of the
real-estate finance group at First Boston. ``What other building
today can offer tenants large or small blocks of relatively
inexpensive space?''

SPORTS COLUMN: A CELEBRATION IN CHICAGO IS ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The statue stood so tall, so proud, so reassuring for
those who came to worship as if it were a shrine. No doubt in its
eyes. No fear. No reason not to believe that the night would be
everything it was supposed to be. The guardian of the United
Center, the messiah of professional sports, would make the photo a
time piece to savor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' the people with the cameras would say. ``Could
you move just a bit?''
</P>
<P>
   Fathers would say to their children: ``Go over with your sister.
Stand up straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Some had walked past Michael Jordan's statue dozens or hundreds
of time without stopping to notice the inscription on the base's
front: ``The best there ever was. The greatest there ever will
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they mouthed the words, snapped photos from every angle,
tossed coins through the bars, into the impressions of Jordan's
hand and footprints.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-year-old Mike Chambers of Staten Island had flown in for
the intended occasion: last game of the season, of the Bulls' sixth
championship run, possibly of Jordan's fabled career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting married in August, my brother's my best man, and
this is his gift, Jordan's last game,'' Bill Chambers, 29, said,
holding the camera as his brother posed in his Jordan jersey by the
statue. ``I got tickets from Fox Sports, where I work in New York.
We flew in this morning, go back tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   David and Latisha Grummer were nearby, in from Los Angeles, with
their daughters Carissa, 5, and Dakota, 20 months. Tom Mader, a
season ticket-holder for 15 years from Geneva, Ill., brought his
9-year-old son, Anthony, who posed in front of the Jordan statue in
his Toni Kukoc jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' Mader said. ``Jordan won't be back next year.
I'm a numbers guy, work in finance. It'll cost Jerry Reinsdorf $80
million to bring them back. He doesn't have it. This is emotional.
This is sad. So we're all coming tonight, all the original season
ticket-holders I started with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes before game time Friday night, it was as if
Jordan himself was up on the pedestal. Many had come without
tickets, just to be near the building, to gawk at the statue.
Traffic was backed up coming into the west side and Jordan, of all
people, was in it.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived only a few minutes late, the scene recorded by the
credentialed video mob, but it was an early warning that this was
no staged event, with no corporate script, and no guarantees.
Statues do not have nights when they take 26 shots and make only
nine. They do not go without a field goal in the first quarter and
shoot one for seven in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, for the first time in the NBA finals, the Utah
Jazz did not treat Jordan like a human shrine. Bryon Russell
challenged him with his elbows and chest. The Jazz swarmed him the
way Indiana did when he posted up. An old war horse named Antoine
Carr gave him schoolyard respect when Jordan drove the ball to the
basket. Carr sent the legend crashing to the floor, along with all
his plans for a postgame Champagne bath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we have to go back to Utah,'' Jordan said,
after Karl Malone and the Jazz had extended the National Basketball
Association championship series to a sixth game, hanging on to win
Game 5, 83-81. ``It's a duplicate situation as in 1993.''
</P>
<P>
   The statue, dedicated on Nov. 1, 1994, coldly lists only
Jordan's achievements through the Bulls' first three championships.
It makes no mention of Game 5 of the 1993 finals, the Phoenix Suns
written off like some Harlem Globetrotter prop. When the Bulls lost
that night, it was the last NBA game Jordan played on the cozy
Chicago Stadium court he loved. He came no closer to the scripted
finish that night than he did on Friday night's end-game 3-point
attempt off one foot from in front of the Chicago bench.
</P>
<P>
   Had he made that shot, there might have been a rally by the
statue to rename the building after him. Jordan shot an air ball,
muting the crowd, silencing a city, but reminding himself the chase
is more about such moments than it is about planning them like a
birthday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 1.1 seconds, I knew I wanted the ball, but no one knew what
was going to happen,'' he said wistfully. ``That's part of my
personality, the way things have happened in my career. Everybody
was anticipating a big shot on our side, holding their breath. And
that's the beauty of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he often relives 1993, Game 6, in Phoenix, his send-off
to a 17-month sabbatical. The Bulls were losing by two on their
last possession. The ball, inbounded in the backcourt, touched
every player's hands before John Paxson launched a title-clinching
3-pointer, dispelling the doubt and eliminating the fear, that a
statue could never reflect.
</P>
<P>
   If this is Jordan's last season, then to see him in Utah is
going to be one last, special treat. Dealing with doubt. Facing the
fear. A photo opportunity, if there ever was one.

CITY AND STATE AGREE ON PLAN FOR OVERSIGHT OF PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Plans to create a long strip of elegant parkland
along the Hudson River took a giant step forward last week, as the
city reached agreement with the state on who will govern the park
and how it will be run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked out our problems,'' Deputy Mayor Randy Levine
said. He added that the state, which owns the section of the
riverbank from Battery Park to 34th Street, and the city, which
owns the land from 34th to 59th streets, have agreed to lease their
land to a new entity to be created by a bill now before the
Legislature. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had been reluctant to sacrifice
ownership permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Gargano, chairman of Empire State Development Corp., the
state economic development arm, said the agreement paves the way
for smooth operation of the park. He said that under the deal, his
agency will build the park and the city and state Park Departments
will cooperate in running it.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Gargano's agency has overseen the features of the
park, a temporary bike path and several recreational piers, that
have already been opened. ``It should be run by the Parks
Departments,'' Gargano said. ``Empire State should not be in the
business of running parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall governance, long a particular concern of the city, has
been settled, the officials said. Each government will appoint five
members to a board, with the chairmanship rotating every two years.
Previously, both governments had four appointees, and the Manhattan
borough president had one. Board meetings have been rare for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The state and city hope to include their agreement in
legislation now before both houses of the state Legislature. If
that legislation fails, they say they will put as much as possible
in a memorandum of understanding, the present basis of governing
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents thus say the park is at a critical juncture. While
the city and state agreement pushes the park further forward than
it has ever been, they say legislation is needed for important
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Albert Butzel, president of the Hudson River Park
Alliance, a coalition of civic and environmental groups, said a law
was needed for revenues from development projects, such as Chelsea
Piers or the Circle Line, to go to the park. At present, they flow
to state and city coffers.
</P>
<P>
   For another, he said, a law could definitively identify piers as
part of the park, meaning they would be forever protected.
Legislation would also permanently protect wildlife, such as baby
striped bass, at the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, legislators say the park bill is likely to pass the
Senate, particularly if Gov. George Pataki strongly pushes it.
Though environmentalists worry that Sheldon Silver, the Assembly
speaker, may not be on board, Assemblyman Richard Gottfried, an
author of the bill, says Silver will support it with relatively
minor modifications. Neither Silver nor his staff returned calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing was getting the mayor on board,'' said Sen.
Franz Leichter, the bill's Senate sponsor. ``If we let this
opportunity go by, we may live to regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the state expects to begin construction of the
Greenwich Village part of the park in September. But for people who
have fought for a decade for the vision of a clearly defined,
strictly protected and self-sufficient park, it seems a bit like
now or never.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time and people are starting to peter out,''
said Pam Frederick, chairwoman of Community Board 4 in the Clinton
section of the city. ``You can only sustain your energy for so
long.''

STARR ADMITS GIVING REPORTERS INFORMATION ON CLINTON INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to correct word to ``retrieve'' in 10th graf. No
pickup.)  (th) 
 By ADAM CLYMER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel
investigating President Clinton, acknowledged in a magazine
interview that he and his aides have given information on the
Monica Lewinsky matter to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But he also insisted that these leaks were neither illegal,
because they did not involve testimony before a grand jury, nor a
violation of Justice Department ethics barring leaks of
``substantive information'' about a prosecution. In the interview
with the magazine, Brill's Content, Starr defended his actions as
necessary ``to engender confidence in the work of this office.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, responded Saturday in a
statement, saying, ``The article represents an admission from Mr.
Starr that he and his deputies have violated grand jury secrecy
rules. An independent investigation of this matter is now more
necessary than ever to determine how to address these violations of
secrecy and to address the question of what steps need to be
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, traveling with the president in Portland, Ore., was
alluding to the fact that it is against the law to release grand
jury information. Some courts, including the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, have held that the
prohibition extends to information gathered by prosecutors in
preparing for grand jury proceedings. Other courts have taken
Starr's view about the legality of releasing such information.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, Starr's spokesman, said at 12:30 p.m. Saturday
that he would not comment until he had finished reading the
article, but would try to do so by 2 p.m. He did not call by that
time, and further attempts to reach him were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Jan. 21, when the first stories appeared suggesting
that Clinton had had a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a
former White House intern, most of the reporting on the subject has
been based on unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, sought
contempt sanctions against Starr for ``the deluge of leaks which
quite obviously stem from your office.'' Starr replied by
suggesting that the White House was the source of some leaks. No
action has been taken on the motion.
</P>
<P>
   The article by Steven Brill, the editor and publisher of the new
magazine on the press, identifies various reports as apparently
coming from Starr's office, including the Washington Post's initial
story and a Newsweek article of Feb. 2. The newsweek story relied
on taped conversations between Ms. Lewinsky and Linda Tripp, a
former co-worker, that reportedly contained statements by Ms.
Lewinsky indicating she had demanded a job as the price of denying
a sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr identified three reporters, Michael Isikoff of Newsweek,
Susan Schmidt of the Washington Post and Jackie Judd of ABC News,
as journalists to whom his deputy, Jackie Bennett had talked
``extensively'' about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in the April 15 interview, also said that he had held
discussions with two New York Times reporters before publication of
a Feb. 6 article about Betty Currie, Clinton's secretary. That
article described how Mrs. Currie had retrived gifts the president
had given to Ms. Lewinsky, and that the president had talked to
Mrs. Currie about questions he had been asked concerning Ms.
Lewinsky at a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case
the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine reports that Starr told Brill, ``I only wanted to
talk to them about the timing.'' He said, ``My understanding was
that they knew the substance of it.'' He also said Bennett had
talked to the Times reporters, Jeff Gerth and Stephen Labaton, who
wrote the story with Don Van Natta, ``more extensively.'' But
Bennett told Brill that he was ``in no way a source for the
information in the Times' Betty Currie story.''
</P>
<P>
   The article in the new issue of Brill's Content, which was
released to various news organizations Saturday, is highly critical
of much of the reporting on the matter, saying that journalists
worked hastily and rushed unconfirmed information to the public.
The article also suggests that leaks from Starr's office were
orchestrated to pressure Ms. Lewinsky and her lawyer into
cooperating with the independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   But the direct quotations of Starr could prove significant,
because they clearly relate to Kendall's accusations of
prosecutorial misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The article quotes Starr as saying that there was ``nothing
improper'' about discussions with reporters ``because we never
discussed grand jury proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely not 6-E,'' he said in reference to the
federal rule barring disclosure of grand jury information, ``if you
are talking about what witnesses tell FBI agents or us before they
testify before the grand jury or about related matters.''
</P>
<P>
   But on May 5, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia said the prohibition extends to ``not only what has
occurred and what is occurring, but also what is likely to occur.
Encompassed within the rule of secrecy are the identities of
witnesses or jurors, the substance of testimony as well as actual
transcripts, the strategy or direction of the investigation, the
deliberations or questions of jurors, and the like.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether these leaks, if not illegal, still violated
Justice Department and American Bar Association guidelines against
leaks of pending investigations, Starr replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be true except in case of a situation where what we
are doing is countering misinformation that is being spread about
our investigation in order to discredit our office and our
dedicated career prosecutors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is our obligation to counter that kind of
misinformation,'' he said. ``And it is our obligation to engender
public confidence in the work of this office.''

WELFARE SHIFT CAUSES CRISIS FOR SHELTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The sharp decline in New York state's welfare
rolls has created an unexpected crisis for financially struggling
homeless shelters in New York City's suburbs and upstate
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The shelters have fallen victim to a quirk in the state law
governing their state and local aid: Their financing is essentially
tied to the number of people ruled eligible for welfare benefits in
their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Because the number of people collecting welfare has plummeted,
financial support for the shelters in the 57 counties outside New
York City has also dropped sharply, even though the homeless
population has remained fairly steady.
</P>
<P>
   The situation _ an unanticipated consequence of changes in the
welfare system, particularly requirements that recipients take
workfare jobs _ has forced shelters to turn homeless people away,
reduce the number of days they are open and, in some cases, to go
out of business entirely, shelter operators and advocates for the
poor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shelters are being squeezed to such a point that they're
cutting back to a troubling extent,'' said Shelly Nortz, a lobbyist
and welfare analyst for the Coalition for the Homeless. ``We're
afraid that it is only going to get worse as welfare reform gets
implemented more aggressively around the state and the caseloads
are reduced further.''
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of the state's homeless population is in New York
City, homelessness is a considerable problem in the rest of the
state. In 1997 alone, homeless shelters across the rest of the
state took in about 60,000 people, compared with the 100,000 who
stayed in city shelters, according to the Coalition for the
Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing upstate shelters has its origins in the
system under which they receive public funds. Shelter operators are
paid for each night they house a person as long as that person is
deemed eligible to receive welfare benefits by the local welfare
office. That system was established to ensure that shelter
operators would act as advocates for the poor by encouraging
homeless individuals and families to apply for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But in an era in which local governments are aggressively
reducing the welfare rolls through a combination of sanctions and
stricter enforcement of eligibility requirements, the financing
formula is threatening to undermine the shelter system. Suddenly,
shelters are faced with a growing population of people who are
needy but unable to get public assistance because they have opted
not to take a workfare job or were disqualified for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funding system made sense in an era when the presumption
was that anyone who is homeless qualified for public assistance,''
Ms. Nortz said. ``But that is no longer true. It's an entirely
different ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The financing crisis has not hit homeless shelters in New York
City, experts say, because of court orders mandating that city
officials provide shelter to all homeless individuals and families,
regardless of their eligibility for public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   State welfare officials said they were surprised to hear of the
problem, but they added that many individuals who have been cut off
from welfare can get their benefits back simply by complying with
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions would be rather meaningless if people are able to go
to a sympathetic homeless shelter,'' said Dan Hogan, a deputy
commissioner for the state's Office of Temporary and Disability
Assistance. ``If we are talking about people who have been
sanctioned, the answer is for them to come into compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The response to the problem has varied from one county to
another. In Albany County, social-service officials have made
changes in which they pick up some of the cost of housing homeless
people who, for whatever reason, do not qualify for public
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But shelter operators and advocates for the poor said the move
did little to ease the pressures that shelters are facing. Donna
DeMaria, who runs a shelter near the state Capitol, said her
shelter has devoted itself to taking in former welfare recipients
who are being turned away by other shelters that don't want to be
saddled with the expense of housing them.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, after sustaining major financial losses serving
that population, the shelter closed its doors. ``People are coming
off the welfare rolls, but they still need housing,'' she said.
``That's meant that shelters like ours are really struggling to
survive. It's a horrible situation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the neighboring city of Troy in Rensselaer County, the
operators of Joseph's House, a 30-bed shelter, said they have
suffered such steep losses that they have given thought to
operating only in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Neitzel, the shelter's director, estimates that nearly
half of her clients no longer qualify for public assistance. As a
result, she said, the shelter is losing about $100,000 a year.
``The reimbursement system just doesn't make sense anymore,'' she
said. ``Suddenly, we're seeing people on the streets of upstate New
York with absolutely no income. It's a shaky situation.''
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, things are not much better. Every day, the
Nassau-Suffolk Law Service, which provides legal services to the
poor, gets at least one phone call from a shelter operator who is
desperate to get a shelter resident back on welfare so they can be
paid to provide housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of concern among shelter operators is much higher
than I've ever seen it,'' said Tom Maligno, the agency's executive
director. ``They're asking us for legal help to appeal the local
agency's decision to sanction a person and take them off the
rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the problem has been largely limited to single adults
in the state-financed program known as Home Relief, according to
the experts. That is because state and local officials have been
knocking them off the rolls in instances when they failed to
fulfill a host of new requirements. The most notable is the
requirement that recipients work in exchange for their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The state's own research has shown that many former Home Relief
recipients have left the program not because they have found
employment but because they have been penalized for failing to meet
the requirements of the workfare program. Between October 1990 and
September 1996, the number of times local social-service districts
penalized recipients for failure to comply with rules climbed to
72,771 from 5,593 statewide, according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Operators of homeless shelters and advocates for the poor expect
the shelter crisis to grow because of recent state and federal
changes that give counties greater freedom to impose workfare
requirements on single mothers, who make up the bulk of the welfare
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already beginning to see some sanctions being applied to
women with children,'' said Tom Schmitz, the human services
director for the 17 shelters that the Salvation Army runs in
upstate cities like Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo. ``We're
worried that there will be more sanctioning of woman and children.
It poses a serious issue.''

THE POSH AND THE POWERFUL MEET IN BERMUDA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Ky., N.C.)  (lb) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Given the Atlantic Ocean's propensity for
inclement weather, offshore racing can be a demanding sport. But
once a decision is made to set sail, the next question is how
quickly or how comfortably the voyage will go. Sailors rarely have
it both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Speed and comfort are the differing priorities of two 60-foot
yachts competing in the Newport Bermuda Race, which begins at 1
p.m. Friday off Newport. The two sailboats, as dissimilar as
saltwater and freshwater, are the oldest and newest of 163
sailboats in the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The older boat, Mistress, is a wooden schooner built in 1930.
Chris McCormick, co-owner with his brother, Glenn, would choose his
schooner hands down for sailing the 635-mile route to Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 40 tons of creature comfort,'' McCormick said recently.
``We'll have the best-looking boat out there. We have sheets,
blankets, towels, silverware and a walk-in shower with hot water.
This is a posh racer.''
</P>
<P>
   On the more streamlined end of the spectrum is Deep Powder, a
Carroll Marine 60 that is expected to be as swift as the
record-setting sloops in the recent Whitbread Round the World Race.
</P>
<P>
   Having never sailed before in a long-distance race, Deep Powder
_ and its new sister ship Rima _ are expected to be the showpieces
of the 1998 Bermuda competition.
</P>
<P>
   Deep Powder shows a glimmer of high style with wood veneer, a
compromise to the heavy mahogany interiors of yesteryear. But
freshwater showers will not be available during racing.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will there be staterooms to sleep in, or the cushioned
seating and lavish wood detailing one can expect in the main saloon
on Mistress.
</P>
<P>
   At night, much of Deep Powder's crew of 16 will be sitting on
the windward rail to keep the yacht under proper trim.
</P>
<P>
   On the two-masted Mistress with its crew of 12, having a sailor
sit on the rail is like watching a robin on the edge of a birdbath.
Nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   Mistress competed in nine Newport Bermuda races from 1930
through 1954. In its 1930 Bermuda debut, Mistress finished sixth,
as one of seven schooners to finish at the head of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   But now Mistress is the only schooner racing to Bermuda. The old
style has been replaced by sleek, high-tech sloops that are the
future of yacht racing.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, Deep Powder and Rima are apt to sail into Bermuda
at least a day sooner than the schooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mistress probably won't see where the two new 60s went,'' said
Geoff Stagg, president of Farr International, the yacht designer
based in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be over the horizon. Only if the schooner has perfect
conditions, a broad reach where it can crack open the sails in a
strong breeze, might it be able to hang in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Mistress might reach 11 knots on a broad reach, Deep
Powder is likely to come up with at least 18 knots on a close
reach.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the difference in the caliber of racing today. The 41st
running of the Newport Bermuda Race includes boats ranging in size
from 34 to 80 feet.
</P>
<P>
   It includes Boomerang, the 80-foot maxiyacht that in 1996 set
the Newport Bermuda Race record of 57 hours 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Top sailors such as Russell Coutts and Chris Dickson are
expected to be on other maxis.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the allure of the Newport Bermuda Race. Still
revered as one of the nation's top amateur events, the competition
allows for professionals by applying updated handicap rules.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing which boat to sail becomes a matter of both style and
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Chigas, owner of Deep Powder, is set on winning above all
else. His 60-foot carbon-fiber sailboat weighs a mere 15 tons. It
has swept-back spreaders that eliminate the need for running
backstays, which in turn make sail-handling easier. But below deck,
life on board will be hard compared with the luxuries on Mistress.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes down to who is actually having more fun, only an
individual can say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have plenty of fruit, sweets, turkey, ham, cheese and
roast beef on board, and hot meals too,'' Chigas said. ``I'm
looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   MAKING WAVES
</P>
<P>
   TORI MURDEN, a 35-year-old lawyer from Louisville, Ky., was
expected to set out alone from Wanchese, N.C., Saturday in a second
attempt to row across the Atlantic Ocean. Her 3,635-mile trip will
be to Brest, France, aboard a 23-foot rowboat; the voyage is
expected to take 100-120 days. On her first try last October,
Murden and LOUISE GRAFF, her partner, withdrew after Murden became
ill. They were the only American competitors in the Atlantic Rowing
Race, a team competition from the Canary Islands to Barbados.

WORKERS' LAWSUIT AGAINST TRUMP FACES ANOTHER DELAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eighteen years ago, Wojciech Kozak helped build Trump
Tower, the skyscraper jewel in Donald Trump's real-estate empire.
Today, Kozak recalls that time with nightmare memories of
backbreaking 12-hour shifts and of being cheated with 200 other
undocumented Polish immigrants out of meager wages and fringe
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked in horrid, terrible conditions,'' Kozak said of the
six months he spent in 1980 wielding a sledgehammer and a blowtorch
in demolishing the Bonwit Teller Building on Fifth Avenue to make
way for Trump Tower. ``We were frightened illegal immigrants and
did not know enough about our rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozak, like other laborers on that job, has no hope of
collecting about $4,000 in back wages from a contracting company
that began the demolition and later became insolvent. But after
almost two decades, the demolition workers are still struggling to
compel Trump and his business associates to compensate a union's
welfare funds and thus increase pension and medical benefits for
some of the Polish workers.
</P>
<P>
   Kozak is now a party and witness in a class-action lawsuit that
has meandered through the federal courts for 15 years and charges
that Trump owes $4 million to the union welfare funds for the work
the Poles performed. Filed in 1983, the suit has been bogged down
by a torrent of motions and appeals of judicial decisions and by
the deaths of a judge, a lawyer, the original lead plaintiffs, an
important witness and two of Trump's co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to resolve the tangled case _ one of the oldest on
the civil dockets of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan _ Judge
Kevin Duffy last month warned lawyers for both sides to be prepared
to begin a jury trial on 48 hours' notice.
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday, in a development that could delay the trial
yet again, Duffy ordered the case assigned to another judge.
Lawyers for both sides said the 48-hour notice was still in effect,
but that it was unclear when the trial would start.
</P>
<P>
   Trump denies that he was aware of the working conditions at the
site in 1980 or that any of the demolition workers were
undocumented immigrants. He is also challenging claims that he is
liable for payments to the union that were evaded by the demolition
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was to try to keep a job going that was started by
someone else,'' Trump, in an interview, said of his company's
efforts to guarantee that the demolition contractor paid wages to
employees. ``In fact, we helped people and it has cost a lot of
money in legal fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozak and other Polish immigrants who were hired for the
demolition said in interviews that they often worked in choking
clouds of asbestos dust without protective equipment like safety
masks, metal helmets and gloves. They accepted the conditions
because they thought the job would pay 10 times as much as they
could earn in Poland, said Kozak, 56, a slightly built man who
became an American citizen and joined a laborers' union.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Nalepa, 63, who suffered a head injury in the demolition,
said he and fellow workers were baffled by the unending suit. ``It
makes you think that only the rich have rights in the courts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition project on Fifth Avenue and 56th Street lasted
from January to June 1980. It cleared the way for an ornate
68-story glass-sheathed structure containing shops and an atrium on
the lower floors and 263 condominium apartments above that
originally sold for $500,000 to $10 million each.
</P>
<P>
   The tower was financed and built by Trump's development company,
Trump Organization, and Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records and testimony, the Trump-Equitable
joint venture hired Kaszycki and Sons Contractors Inc. at a fee of
$775,000 to raze Bonwit Teller's 10-story flagship department store
although the contractor had little demolition experience.
Demolition Workers Local 95 of the Laborers' International Union of
North America had a collective bargaining agreement with the
Kaszycki company, of Herkimer, N.Y., requiring it to pay specified
wages to union and nonunion workers at the Trump Tower site and to
make additional payments for each worker into the local's pension
and medical insurance funds.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Sloan and Lewis Steel, lawyers for current and retired
Local 95 members in the suit, assert that William Kaszycki, owner
of the contracting company, hired about 200 Polish immigrants who
were not Local 95 members and agreed to pay them $4 to $5 an hour
on 12-hour shifts seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaszycki company, the plaintiffs said, violated the union's
$11-an-hour minimum wage scale and made payments to the local's
welfare funds for only 12 to 15 employees. The contractor also
failed to pay the 200 Poles their full wages, causing work
stoppages and delays in destroying the old building.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs contend that Trump was desperate to meet
demolition and construction deadlines and that his company in May
1980 began supervising the demolition, assuming full responsibility
for adhering to the union contract and for the payments to the
union welfare funds.
</P>
<P>
   When the suit was filed in 1983, the lead plaintiff was Harry
Diduck, a dissident member of Local 95. Diduck had not worked at
Trump Tower but maintained that that he and about 500 Local 95
members and retirees lost medical and pension benefits because
Trump-Equitable and the Kaszycki company owed the union funds more
than $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of arguments and a nonjury trial on some of
the issues, in 1991 Judge Charles Stewart of U.S. District Court in
Manhattan ruled that Trump and his associates conspired with Local
95's president, John Senyshyn, to withhold payments to the funds.
He determined that Trump-Equitable owed $325,415 plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, however, appealed the findings and each won partial
victories. A federal appeals court upheld most of Stewart's
decisions but ruled that Trump-Equitable had been denied a full
opportunity to rebut the charge that the funds had been damaged by
the loss of contributions for the Polish workers.

 NEW YORK: Polish workers. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The appeals court also ruled that Stewart wrongly dismissed a
claim by the plaintiffs that the Trump group was responsible for
payments to the funds because it had been the workers' actual
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart died in October 1994 and the case, with new issues at
stake, was assigned to Duffy. But progress was further hampered by
the deaths since 1991 of Diduck, the original plaintiff; Burton
Hall, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, and Kaszycki and Senyshyn, who
were co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Before ordering lawyers to be ready for trial on two days'
notice, Duffy recently denied motions for further delays and for
searches for more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Admonishing both sides, he said, ``There must be an end to all
litigation: Even Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce ground down to a
conclusion.'' He was referring to an estate dispute in Charles
Dickens' novel ``Bleak House'' involving generations of the
Jarndyce family that was so convoluted no one understood it. Edwin
Schallert, the chairman of the Federal Court Committee of the
Association of the Bar of the City of New York, described the Trump
case's longevity as ``extraordinarily rare'' for the District
Court. Schallert said records show that the average civil suit in
the court takes 29 months and that 90 percent of cases are tried
within four years.
</P>
<P>
   At different stages, Trump has retained four prominent Manhattan
law firms to represent him. ``The legal history of this case is a
jigsaw puzzle,'' said Thomas Bolan, Trump's latest lawyer and a
former partner of the late Roy Cohn. ``We are now back to square
one on the key issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who is expected to testify at the trial, said he had
resisted efforts to settle the case out of court. ``It would be
cheaper, but on principle I won't,'' he said. ``We did nothing
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sloan, the plaintiffs' lead lawyer, said she would be paid
for 15 years of legal work only if her side won. The fees would be
set by by the court, she added, and would be paid by Trump and his
co-defendants. She estimated that if the $300,000 judgment, and
accumulated interest, is upheld a second time, the payments to the
funds would rise to about $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are facing large firms, it tends to make the
litigation protracted,'' said Ms. Sloan, who is a solo practitioner
specializing in union and civil rights law. ``But we are
stubborn.''

EDITORIAL: RACE, MEMORY AND JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Miss.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, June 14:
</P>
<P>
   It was just a year ago Sunday that Bill Clinton looked out on a
field of black caps and tassels _ and of upturned white, yellow,
tan and black young faces _ at the University of California at San
Diego and called for the nation to engage in ``a great and
unprecedented conversation about race.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a president pining for a legacy, and race had been the
special burden and pain of his South. The resistance to integration
in Little Rock, Ark., and the later murders of such black men as
Vernon Dahmer in Mississippi, had repulsed him as a boy and young
man.
</P>
<P>
   The president announced an advisory board that Saturday, gave
himself a year to affect the attitude of the country and promised a
report to the American people. That deadline, and the dialogue,
have long since drifted. Hampered by a White House that was well
intentioned but wary of ugly confrontations, the full seven-member
panel never met as a body in the Deep South or in the hard black
ghettos of the urban North.
</P>
<P>
   The president led some of its town meetings, but the people who
came to talk in such places as Denver, Phoenix and San Jose,
Calif., tended to be civic activists. The bulk of Americans _ those
complacent about racism or indifferent to it _ stayed home, as did
the real racists.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a week ago, some twisted people issued a report of their
own. They took a 49-year-old black man named James Byrd Jr. for a
ride in the small town of Jasper, Texas. Then they beat him
senseless, chained him to the rear bumper and dragged him to his
death, severing his head and an arm in the process.
</P>
<P>
   There are many levels of racism in a culture. Clinton introduced
his ``Initiative on Race and Reconciliation'' on a California
campus because that state had become a battleground over the public
policy of affirmative action, which the voters had just decided to
abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Already, as he spoke that day, the number of black and Hispanic
students accepted to the university system was dropping.
Affirmative action had been created to make education and jobs
accessible to a population still hampered by the collective
experience of slavery and by the years when intimidation and murder
by whites were common.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in the policy, and Clinton's appearance before a
university graduating class of so many different colors, was the
assumption that those crude and brutal times were past.
</P>
<P>
   But the three men arrested in the killing of Byrd in east Texas
are not university graduates. They are prison graduates _ mean,
poorly educated and culturally impoverished. The crime itself is as
stupid, as barbaric, as any that horrified the nation more than 30
years ago, when the civil rights movement was at its height. The
men arrested then were often Klansmen. The men in jail in Jasper
are said to have links to the Klan and a racist prison gang.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be people filled with resentment and malignant
feeling at the bottom of society. They do not shape the larger
culture. But they stun it, and their actions can inform it. The
president has now put off his report to the American people on race
until the end of the year. Perhaps with more time and aggressive
scheduling, his effort at dialogue will produce a new national
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the authorities in Mississippi and Texas have
demonstrated that equal law enforcement with a long memory remains
this society's most potent weapon against racial violence, if not
against the prejudice that lurks in some hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi authorities have rearrested a group of men who
have been several times tried but never convicted in the 1966
firebombing death of Dahmer, a National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People leader. In Jasper, the community has
rallied around a sheriff bent on color-blind prosecution of this
lynching by pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's contribution could be enduring. That will not be clear
for a long time yet. But the legacy of Vernon Dahmer and James
Byrd, bless their souls, could be purifying and real, an
affirmation that justice can be certain and equal in the former
heartland of segregation.

   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard D. Bodig, an economist who was also a singer
and student of early music, died on May 26 at Lenox Hill Hospital
in Manhattan. He was 75 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Bodig served as economic adviser to the general counsel to the
Mobil Oil Corp. for 30 years, retiring in 1986. After retiring, he
worked on economic advisory projects for the National Executive
Service Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Bodig became interested in early music in the 1950s. Fluent in
10 languages, he also translated 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts
on performance practice from Italian and German into English and in
1995 published a collection of Renaissance duets.
</P>
<P>
   As a singer, Bodig performed with Richard Taruskin's Cappella
Nova, the Canby Singers, and the Dessoff Choir.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, who is concert coordinator for the
Frick Collection, he is survived by two sons, Christian, of Los
Angeles, and Paul, of New York City; and a sister, Alice, also of
New York City.

DISPUTE OVER FLIER IS HEADING TO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NY-BUDGET) 
(mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City Council leaders said Saturday that they would go
to court to force Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to retract a flier
critical of the Council that was tucked into 900,000 property tax
bills last week.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the flier was not only blatantly political but also
inaccurate, the officials said they wanted the city to send a
follow-up letter giving the Council's response. The flier contended
that the Council had set the tax rates illegally, and had raised
taxes for single-family homeowners. The Council says that both
accusations are false.
</P>
<P>
   The message in the bills reflected the mayor's fury over the
City Council's decision to pass next year's budget over his
objection. Giuliani and the Council have dueled to a stalemate, so
the details of the budget now seem destined to be decided in court.
</P>
<P>
   Round 1 went to the mayor late Friday night, when the Council's
request for a temporary restraining order to prevent the mailing of
the bills was turned aside by Justice Edward Lehner of state
Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the mayor and the Council went to Lehner's home to
argue their cases at 9 p.m., six hours after the mayor's office had
released the flier. Richard Weinberg, the general counsel to the
City Council, said he contended that the mailing ``misuses a
bureaucratic function for starkly political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's lawyers asserted that the bills were
already in the mail, so nothing could be done. The Council's
lawyers then withdrew their request as long as the administration
checked to be sure no bills still awaited mailing.
</P>
<P>
   The flier began by asserting that ``the City Council voted out a
budget proposal and fixed property tax rates in an invalid and
improper manner.'' It concluded by saying that Giuliani ``will do
everything in his power to reduce the City Council's proposed
spending and to prevent the property tax increase that the City
Council would otherwise be imposing upon many of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a
civic watchdog group financed by business interests, said that the
language of the flier was ``really rubbing it in the Council's
face.'' He said he believed the mailing would make it much more
difficult for the mayor and Council to work out their differences
over how to spend the city's $34 billion budget next year.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McMahon, the Council's finance director, said that as a
result of Friday night's ruling, taxpayers would pay last year's
rates, which were printed on the disputed bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Finance used taxpayers' funds to advance a
political agenda that was not truthful, so now we will ask a court
to direct the Department of Finance to do a mailing correcting its
inaccuracies,'' McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's aides said the flier was nothing more than ``an
instructional sheet on how to pay your taxes'' that is included
with the bills every year. Cristyne Lategano, the mayor's
communications director, said the administration would fight the
Council's request for a follow-up letter as ``fiscally imprudent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The notice is 100 percent accurate,'' Ms. Lategano said. ``The
only thing different this year was that we had to point out the
truth that the City Council was supporting a tax increase.''
</P>
<P>
   The Council did not raise the overall tax rates. But under the
formula the Council adopted last week, homeowners would pay
slightly more than last year, while owners of co-ops, condominiums
and commercial property would pay slightly less.
</P>

ELSTER'S FAN-APPRECIATION SITE PROMISES PLENTY OF INTERACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   While Rangers shortstop Kevin Elster is on the 15-day disabled
list, Elster's personal manager tries not to give him much to think
about.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold him to this, but Wayne Hanks has an idea that Elster
``might'' be putting some thought into his Fan-Appreciation
Entertainment Site (www.elster.com) during the down time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to give him some time to himself at this time, but I'm
sure (development of the Web site) is the kind of stuff he's
thinking about,'' said Hanks, who works with Elster in ventures
outside of major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, who deferred comments about the site to his
representatives, is recovering from a dislocated shoulder he
sustained June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites are probably not his greatest concern, but if Elster
is putting thought into his site, it appears to be a lot to think
about. Elster.com is loaded with the promise of interaction not
normally seen on most personal Web sites, especially any associated
with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Elster.com has several user-friendly games in the works. If
everything goes as designer Rick Gardner plans, the games will not
require the plug-in software usually associated with online
interaction.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the features on Elster.com are scheduled to be activated
gradually and during stages, said Gardner of Gardner Graphics in
Hollywood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site's going to be in ongoing development for the next
month to six weeks,'' Gardner said.
</P>
<P>
   Elster and his wife, Kimberlee Drake, actively suggested game
concepts to Gardner, whose job is to develop them.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's trivia game on Elster promises long-lasting fun.
Gardner said he has designed the database to remember the score of
each player's performance from visit to visit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the interactive games, Elster.com also promises
chat sessions and news updates.
</P>
<P>
   Features up and running include a ticker update on Elster, a
photo gallery, a baseball forum and cyber postcards. The site also
includes an index of links to other Elster fan pages. Many of the
site's pages have sizable graphics, so be prepared for long
downloads.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner said he has not worked on a sports site before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more fun and more cool than I thought it would
be,'' he said. &QL;

JOE DIXON, 81, JAZZ MUSICIAN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Dixon, a clarinetist and saxophonist who played
with many of the great jazz ensembles during a career that began in
the 1930s and lasted about 50 years, died on May 28 at his home in
Oceanside, N.Y. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who was born in Lynn, Mass., began studying clarinet at
age 8 and played his first recital at 12. After hearing a recording
by Bix Beiderbecke, he bought an alto saxophone and added jazz to
his repertory, although he continued his classical studies at the
New England Conservatory of Music. He joined the Tommy Dorsey
Orchestra in 1936 and also played with Bunny Berigan, performing on
more than 100 recordings by the time he was 21.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint with Fred Waring's Pennsylvanians, he joined
the Navy during World War II and played with Eddie Condon's band
while stationed in New York City. After his discharge, he played at
Condon's Manhattan nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked with the CBS staff band and with the NBC
Orchestra before joining the Adelphi University faculty in 1977. As
director of jazz studies at Adelphi, he taught clarinet, saxophone,
and flute and the history of jazz. He also directed the Nassau
County Jazz Festival and organized the Nassau Neophonic Youth Band.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Betty, and a daughter, Sherry
Mandan, of California.

EDITORIAL: REINFORCING DIPLOMACY ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, June 14:
</P>
<P>
   The mock air attacks NATO plans to carry out Monday in the
Balkans are a timely and reasonable response to the growing
military violence being orchestrated by Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president, in the Serbian province of Kosovo. As seen with
Iraq earlier this year, diplomacy backed with a show of force can
move a leader with a history of failing to respond to gentler forms
of international persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   As the Kosovo crisis grew more severe in recent weeks,
Washington first tried to encourage a negotiated solution by
offering Serbia relief from economic sanctions. When that failed to
dissuade Milosevic from military action, America and its allies
issued a series of clear warnings that their patience was running
out.
</P>
<P>
   All outside powers, including Russia, now agree that Milosevic's
forces have been primarily responsible for the increasing violence
against Kosovo's Albanian majority population. That includes the
deaths of some 200 civilians, the expulsion of more than 50,000
people from their homes and the flight of 10,000 or more of these
uprooted refugees across international frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the Yugoslav army has sown deadly land mines
along Kosovo's border with Albania, raising the risk of a broader
regional conflict. NATO hopes that its simulated air raids against
targets in Kosovo's immediate neighbors, Albania and Macedonia,
will convince Milosevic that he must end the violence and begin
good faith negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   This show of force is part of an international diplomatic
strategy. The Clinton administration is right to stress that its
goal remains a diplomatic solution, not a military one. Russia's
president, Boris Yeltsin, can help diplomacy succeed if he takes a
firm line with Milosevic in Moscow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin should quickly dispel any illusions Milosevic may have
that his big Slavic brother will defend him no matter how
outrageously he behaves in Kosovo. Instead, Yeltsin should use his
considerable influence to warn the Yugoslav leader that he must
rein in his forces immediately.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of blunt diplomatic message from Russia coupled with
NATO's demonstration of air power should convince Milosevic that he
should back off. If it does not, before Washington contemplates
moving any further down a path that could lead to American military
intervention, the Clinton administration must do what it has not
done to date.
</P>
<P>
   It must spell out what specific political goals it means to
achieve in Kosovo, what role military force might play in advancing
these and what kind of limits _ chronological, geographical and
operational _ it is prepared to impose on any American mission.
</P>
<P>
   Without such clarifications there cannot be the kind of informed
debate a democracy requires before considering the use of military
force.

JEANETTE NOLAN, 86, ACTRESS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanette Nolan, who began her film career 50 years ago as Lady
Macbeth opposite Orson Welles and is now being seen as the mother
of the character played by Robert Redford in ``The Horse
Whisperer,'' died on June 5 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles. Miss Nolan, who lived in Hollywood, was 86.
</P>
<P>
   She had suffered a stroke a week earlier, said her daughter,
Holly Wright of Charlottesville, Va., and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Nolan's 70-year career in acting also included roles in
theater, radio, and television.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, long before Montana became a popular hideaway for
show business stars, Miss Nolan and her husband, John McIntire, an
actor whom she married in 1935, maintained a log cabin in the
Rockies 3 miles from the Canadian border and 14 miles from the
nearest mail drop. There they watched the stars through a skylight
in the roof, fished for trout off the back porch, bagged an
occasional bear or deer for food, trapped beavers (whose fur became
a coat for Miss Nolan), and weathered temperatures of 55 below
zero. She baked her own bread, churned her butter, and, in one
year, she said, put up 500 quarts of vegetables, fruit, and
venison.
</P>
<P>
   When the couple needed to replenish their capital _ McIntire
said all you needed in Montana was a $200-a-year grubstake _ they
would come to New York and star in radio programs.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday nights, for example, McIntire was the ``Crime Doctor''
on CBS, and Miss Nolan the woman he psychoanalyzed. They appeared
frequently on ``Cavalcade of America,'' where Miss Nolan once
played Ann Rutledge to her husband's Abe Lincoln. Fridays would
find them on Philip Morris' ``Perfect Crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I might play the murderer and Jeanette the moll,'' McIntire
said. ``Or things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Nolan, who could produce an Irish dialect or Spanish,
Italian, German, or Russian accent on demand, also appeared on
CBS's ``Big Sister'' series and ``The Court of Missing Heirs.'' The
busy days of rehearsals and broadcasts often lasted 15 hours and
made the couple long for the peace of Montana.
</P>
<P>
   After Miss Nolan made her film debut in 1948 opposite Welles'
Macbeth, she performed in well over 20 films, including ``Words and
Music'' (1948), ``No Sad Songs for Me'' (1950), ``The Big Heat''
(1953), ``The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' (1962), ``The
Rescuers'' (1977), ``True Confessions'' (1981), and ``Cloak and
Dagger'' (1984).
</P>
<P>
   On television, where she earned four Emmy nominations, Miss
Nolan appeared on more than 300 programs, including ``Perry
Mason,'' ``Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ``Richard Diamond, Private
Detective,'' ``I Spy,'' ``The FBI,'' ``Charlie's Angels,'' and
``MacGyver.'' She also had three series of her own: ``Hotel de
Paree,'' ``The Richard Boone Show,'' and ``Dirty Sally,'' a spinoff
of ``Gunsmoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Nolan, one of three children of Ada and Edward Nolan, a
union official, was born in Los Angeles in 1911. Short of money as
a student of theater arts at Los Angeles City College during the
Depression, she took a classmate's suggestion that she audition for
a radio show. Asked if she could do a Scottish dialect, she did it
and three others. She was hired at once and never stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   McIntire died in 1991. Their son, Tim, also an actor, died in
1986 when he was 42. Besides her daughter, Miss Nolan is survived
by her sister, Miriam Walker, of Ashland, Ore.; and a grandson.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: AT A GATHERING IN WALDEN WOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somehow a visit to Walden Pond doesn't really resolve the image
of Henry Thoreau. What it does instead is clarify the
contradictions, the disparities from which that image is shaped.
</P>
<P>
   The light rising from the surface of the pond on a June
afternoon reflects indiscriminately on the objects around it. The
same was true of Thoreau's mind, no matter how ill-assorted the
objects he wrote about might have been. What harmony there is in
Thoreau's thinking, I believe, came from the collision and eventual
abrasion of dissimilar ideas, the struggle, as he might have put
it, between the acorn and the chestnut obeying their own laws.
</P>
<P>
   Thoreau's best work is the result of two very different but
complementary perspectives. One came about when he refused to pay
his poll tax and was jailed in Concord for a night. Of the village
and its institutions on that evening, he wrote that he was ``fairly
inside of it.'' The other perspective was, of course, the one he
took when he chose to live fairly outside of Concord, in a small,
hand-built house on a rise above Walden Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Both stances, for that is what they were, were honored recently
in a clearing on Pine Hill, just southeast of the pond, by a crowd
that included President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The
occasion was the dedication of the Thoreau Institute and the
permanent conservation of 96 acres of the Walden Woods, both
brought about by Don Henley, the lead vocalist of the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   The president and the first lady had come to Walden at Henley's
invitation. So too had the professors who introduced Henley to
Thoreau's writings, and so had Mohandas Gandhi's
great-granddaughter and Ed Begley Jr. and the rest of the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   And so, most improbably of all, had Tony Bennett, who jogged out
of the Walden Woods and onto the stage as if it were the
Copacabana. He sang one unaccompanied verse of ``America'' and then
trotted back into the arms of the waiting foliage. It was,
naturally, an afternoon of disparities, which the bright sun did
nothing to dispel.
</P>
<P>
   When the president stepped up to the lectern and leaned his arms
across the top, I could not help thinking of what Thoreau noticed
during his night in jail _ not the striking of the town clock or
``the evening sounds of the village,'' but the fact that he had
never ``seen its institutions before.''
</P>
<P>
   I had never seen the institution of the presidency in person
before, but the man on the stage stood deep within it, and he
commented upon the distortion it created, remembering a time when
he and his wife could walk in the woods without the experience
seeming more real to observers than it did to the two of them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a basic trope of Thoreau's mind to search for a point of
view slightly higher than the one you could gain from the top of
Pine Hill. He could not say what you might see from the very
highest vantage point, but perhaps his own was high enough. ``It is
not many moments,'' he wrote, ``that I live under a government,
even in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to imagine what Thoreau might have said about the
tribute being paid to him from so deep within a primary institution
of a government he barely acknowledged, but there were too many
answers, all of them true and all contradictory.

UNPREDICTABLE OLYMPIC CLUB COULD GET EVEN TOUGHER AT U.S. OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a country smitten with underdogs and overachievers, perhaps
it is appropriate that golf's national championship will once again
be settled at the Olympic Club in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The course, after all, has a perfect record when it comes to
humbling the giants of the game during U.S. Open competition.
</P>
<P>
   When the 156 competitors tee off in Thursday's opening round,
they will be covering the same 6,797 yards of par-70 terrain that
produced improbable results such as Jack Fleck over Ben Hogan
(1955), Billy Casper over Arnold Palmer (1966) and Scott Simpson
over Tom Watson (1987).
</P>
<P>
   After closing a two-stroke deficit in the final four holes,
Fleck knocked off Hogan in an 18-hole playoff. Casper vanquished
Palmer in a Monday playoff as well, but had to make up a
seven-stroke deficit on the back nine during Sunday's round to
force the extra session. Simpson edged Watson, but did it in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   During their PGA Tour careers, Fleck, Casper and Simpson have
combined to win five major championships. Palmer won seven,
establishing himself as low man on the totem pole among Olympic's
Open runner-ups. Watson has eight. Hogan, a longtime Fort Worth
resident who died last July, finished with nine.
</P>
<P>
   Such history is enough to jump-start the hopes of even the
longest long shot in this week's field, said Mark Calcavecchia, who
last cracked the top 20 of an Open leader board in 1987, the last
time the event visited Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you think anything is possible,'' said Calcavecchia,
who finished 17th in the 1987 Open, but has missed the cut the past
four years. ``This year, I've been telling myself, `I really should
play good at the Open.' I drive it good. I can chip with anybody.
And I'm a pretty good putter.''
</P>
<P>
   Those skills will be put to the test on a tract that features
few level lies on its fairways, let alone its small, sloping
greens. Hogan once four-putted the smallest green on the course,
No. 18, in the 1946 San Francisco Open. Nick Price, a three-time
competitor at Olympic, likened lining up putts at the hilly course
to ``trying to read Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   To this inherent frustration, add the handiwork of U.S. Golf
Association officials. They have taken the 17th hole, a 522-yard
par-5 for club members, and turned it into a 468-yard par-4 for
Open competitors. By building a new tee box for this week's event,
they have added 40 yards to a hole that played to a scoring average
of 4.56 in the 1987 Open, when it was trimmed down to a 428-yard
par-4.
</P>
<P>
   The rough, unusually thick because of San Francisco's soggy
spring (courtesy of El Nino?), will be topped off at five inches,
one inch higher than last year at Congressional Country Club in
Bethesda, Md. Grounds crews have spent weeks digging in the bunkers
to soften the sand. In some spots, fresh sand has been added to
increase the possibility of buried lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to reproduce Hell Bunker or anything like
that,'' said David Fay, executive director of the U.S. Golf
Association. ``But it should be a hazard. If I can get a fried-egg
lie at my home course, why can't they in the U.S. Open?''
</P>
<P>
   At Olympic Club, USGA officials said, that possibility exists
more strongly than at any Open site in the past seven years.
Players are not necessarily thrilled by the USGA's subtle touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they need fresh sand? So when we hit it in the bunker,
it will be up to our ankles?'' said Calcavecchia, who is not in
favor of the USGA's tweaking of the Olympic layout. ``Why stop at
five inches with the rough? Why not 10-inch rough and ankle-deep
sand? That sounds like a USGA setup. I guess they felt like we need
some fresh hazards out there. It sounds to me like they want an
over-par score to win and they just might get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, the defending champ, does not dispute the possibility
than the Open champ could fail to break par for the first time
since Andy North won with a 1-over effort in 1978. Els, who posted
a winning total of 4 under in 1997, predicted that Olympic Club
will provide a ``much tougher test'' for players than Congressional
despite being 422 yards shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, every winning score at the Open has been under par
except one: Corey Pavin's even-par effort in 1995 at Shinnecock
Hills Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y. Els said a similar scenario is
likely in San Francisco, where Olympic will be the first seaside
course since Shinnecock to hold the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never really know how the weather is going to be this time
of year in San Francisco, to start with. There's always a breeze,
and they've got a lot of tall trees, so it could swirl around a
bit,'' Els said. ``The greens are small, and they'll be firm. I
really think it's going to be the toughest test since Shinnecock.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest headaches, in no particular order, figure to be
found at:
</P>
<P>
   Quake Corner, the course's signature stretch (Nos. 2-5). In
addition to a view of the Golden Gate Bridge from the third tee
box, Quake Corner features two of the three toughest holes on the
course, according to the handicap index.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7, a reachable par-4 (288 yards) with a three-tiered putting
surface. Greg Norman once drove the green and four-putted for
bogey.
</P>
<P>
   No. 16, a 609-yard par-5 that doglegs to the left, making it
unreachable in two shots by even the longest hitters. With only two
par-5s on the course, Simpson said Olympic ``takes away a
disadvantage'' for shorter hitters like himself.
</P>
<P>
   No. 17, a converted par-5 that will play as a 468-yard par-4.
Even with a new tee box, the landing area is slanted and should
funnel shots to the right. Players also will be hitting long-iron
approaches to a green meant to handle 9-irons and pitching wedges.
Don't be surprised if players approach the 4.56 scoring average
from the 1987 Open.
</P>
<P>
   No. 18, a par-4 with a tiny green but a ton of tilt. During the
1987 Open, Fuzzy Zoeller likened the undulating surface to
something you'd find at Putt-Putt, saying: ``You one-putt this
green, you get a free game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the potential pitfalls at Olympic, players are most
concerned about No. 17, which has one of the most severely sloping
fairways on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally had to snap-hook the ball into a hill to keep it
on the fairway in 1987,'' said Watson, the reigning MasterCard
Colonial champ. ``If you hit a straight ball, it wound up in the
right rough ... It surprises me that they're adding length to that
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   But not Calcavecchia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be any tougher than it was. In '87, that fairway was
unhittable,'' Calcavecchia said. ``I played with John Mahaffey, and
he hit a 25-yard hook that landed in the first cut of rough on the
left. It wound up in the right rough. The landing area slopes that
much.''
</P>
<P>
   David Frost, the 1997 Colonial champ, has been a persistent
leader-board presence at Olympic Club. In addition to finishing
17th at the 1987 Open, Frost was second at the 1993 Tour
Championship and fourth at the 1994 Tour Championship, both played
at Olympic. The course, he said, reminds him of Colonial, with lots
of doglegs and tall trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are similarities. Both courses make you work the ball in
both directions off the tee quite a bit,'' Frost said. ``But
Colonial plays a bit shorter. Olympic is more deceiving. Being at
sea level, with all that heavy air and morning mist, you definitely
need to hit more drivers there. It's a much more demanding course
off the tee, especially when it's windy. And it's usually windy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Perry described Olympic as ``very severe,'' with a high
percentage of blind shots. ``It's a course that really wears on
you,'' Perry said. ``You don't feel like you get a break out there
on any hole. You feel like you're struggling on every shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if firm and fast conditions prevail throughout the
week, as USGA officials hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything depends on whether the greens stay dry,''
Calcavecchia said. ``They're small to start with, so it's hard to
keep approach shots on them. And when those greens are firm, the
first hop is huge. You can play an entire round and never leave a
ball mark. And they're tough to read because you're always putting
in and out of shade from all the tall trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Underdogs, however, have a knack for working their way out of
the shadows and finding their place in the sun at the Olympic Club.
Just ask Fleck, Casper or Simpson.

NEW YORK LEGISLATURE WINDS DOWN, QUIETLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Last week, just days before the end of the 1998
legislative session, state Sen. Nicholas Spano strolled through the
lobby outside the Senate chamber, chatting quietly with a few
colleagues and lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in the session, usually I don't want to come out
into the lobby for fear of getting attacked by people who want
their pet bills,'' said Spano, a Republican from Yonkers who has
been in the Legislature for 20 years. ``This is the quietest I've
ever seen it at the end of session.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of year when the Capitol would normally be the scene
of fevered negotiations and bill-drafting, it feels, instead, like
a resort town whose summer swarms have not yet arrived.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of personal animosities among the major players
and election-year politics have made for an unusually quiet
five-month session. There have been few serious talks about pending
bills among legislative leaders and Gov. George Pataki, and most
lawmakers and lobbyists say that means there is little chance that
much will be done before the scheduled end of the session on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there is any shortage of important issues left to
resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers of both parties hope to take the first step
toward changing the state Constitution to allow casino gambling.
But on Wednesday, the Republican majority leader of the Senate,
Joseph Bruno, declared the issue all but dead for the year because
the legislative leaders had barely talked about it. ``There isn't
any serious conversation going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same inertia appears to be about to doom several other
proposals that have broad support, like streamlining the state's
multilayered court system, allowing mutual insurance companies to
sell billions of dollars in stock and joining a cartel of states to
allow dairy farmers to charge more for milk.
</P>
<P>
   Just two major issues are under serious discussion and appear to
have a good chance of passage, officials in both parties said.
</P>
<P>
   One is an expansion of the state's health-care program for poor
children.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue involves some kind of compromise on criminal
sentences. The Republicans want to end parole for violent felons.
The Democrats insist that as conditions for this change, drug
treatment must be substituted for mandatory prison sentences for
some drug offenses, and prison education programs that Pataki
eliminated three years ago must be restored.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In several other areas, there are competing proposals involving
the same interest groups: Republicans want charter schools, while
Democrats want to restore some of the education money that Pataki,
a Republican, vetoed from the budget; Republicans want to renew
laws favoring auto insurers, while Democrats want measures to lower
premiums; some lawmakers want a gay rights bill, while others want
the state to track people infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In any normal year, each of these pairs of initiatives might be
a natural for a trade, ensuring enactment of both measures. But
this has been anything but a normal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, it's still possible that the last couple of days will be
like a hurricane,'' said Lester Shulklapper, one of the Capitol's
most prominent lobbyists who includes casino interests among his
clients. ``But right now, there's no energy, no feeling anything's
happening. Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   This year for the first time, the Legislature abandoned the
practice of having the legislative leaders negotiate the state
budget privately with Pataki. Instead, the leaders of both houses
worked out a budget publicly, through conference committees. As a
result, the Legislature passed a budget just two weeks overdue,
robbing both parties of a favorite ploy, delaying the budget to
gain leverage on unrelated issues.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who is seeking re-election, used his line-item veto
power for the first time, eliminating $1.6 billion in spending that
the Legislature had approved. The vetoes pushed his relations with
legislative leaders to a new low. Although the governor appears to
have mended fences with the Senate Republicans, he and the
Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, have barely spoken to
each other for months.
</P>
<P>
   After the governor's budget vetoes, many legislators expected _
wrongly, it seems _ that Pataki and legislative leaders would
negotiate to put some of the money back, and other business was put
on hold while they waited for an end game that never came.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is pervaded by a sense of the unknown,'' said
Assemblyman Steven Sanders, D-New York City. ``In many ways, we're
in territory where we've never been before.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, focused on his re-election effort, has been less active
than usual in privately lobbying and publicly exhorting the
Legislature to action. He has been crisscrossing the state at a
campaign-season pace to announce factory openings and environmental
cleanup grants, and promoting his new book in forums like the
programs of Montel Williams and Howard Stern, making him less of a
physical presence than in years past. Some legislators joke that he
treats the Capitol like little more than a mail drop.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has pressed hard for just two pieces of
legislation, an end to parole for violent felons and the creation
of charter schools, which are public schools with particular
missions that operate apart from the usual bureaucracy. He renewed
the debate over casino gambling with a letter urging the
Legislature to pass a constitutional amendment to allow it, but he
waited until mid-May to do so, and lawmakers say he has not
pressured them on the subject since.
</P>
<P>
   Last year saw two battles with great consequences, both
politically and in the lives of millions of people: the fight over
renewal of rent controls, and the overhaul of the state's welfare
system. In 1995 and 1996, Pataki successfully pushed for deep
budget and tax cuts and a revision of the workers' compensation
system, and he tried unsuccessfully to change welfare.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there is nothing as momentous on the calendar.
Lawmakers say that has eliminated much of the motivation to make
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing anybody absolutely has to have before they go
home,'' said a prominent Assembly Democrat, speaking on the
condition of anonymity. ``That's a good thing, since Shelly and
George aren't on speaking terms, and everyone's already in campaign
mode, anyway.''

TRIAL STARTS IN KILLINGS OF 5 PROSTITUTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ A former postal worker who confessed to
killing five prostitutes and dumping their dismembered bodies in
trash bins is to go on trial Monday in Long Island's first death
penalty case since capital punishment was reinstated in New York
state in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Robert Shulman, 44, is charged with taking his
victims to his rented apartment in a small house in Hicksville,
where he is said to have beaten them to death and cut their bodies
into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a detailed confession after his arrest in April 1996,
but he has since insisted that details of the confession were
suggested to him by detectives and that he was coerced into signing
it.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman acknowledged taking the prostitutes to his apartment for
drugs and sex, but then said he ``blacked out.'' When he awoke, he
found their bodies, panicked and tried to hide them by disposing of
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers argued during three months of evidentiary hearings
that Shulman's statements to police should be excluded because they
were made during an interrogation stretching over two days. His
lawyers, Paul Gianelli and William Keahon, also argued that police
never had sufficient cause to arrest Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Georgia Tschiember, an assistant district
attorney, argued that the detectives who questioned Shulman did
nothing wrong and that Shulman's confession indicated only that the
detectives' interrogation techniques were effective.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Arthur Pitts of Suffolk County Criminal Court ruled a week
ago that Shulman's arrest was proper and that the statements he
made could be used against him.
</P>
<P>
   Police were led to Shulman's apartment by prostitutes who worked
a section of Jamaica Avenue in Hollis, Queens, where Shulman would
often cruise for women. One prostitute who said she went with
Shulman but was not harmed, said she last saw one of the three
slain women leaving the Queens pickup area in Shulman's blue
Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to argue that Shulman killed three of
his victims in Suffolk County. He is charged with murdering Kelly
Sue Bunting, 28, of Hollis, whose body was found in a trash bin in
Melville in December 1995; Lisa Ann Warner, 18, of Jamaica, Queens,
whose body was found at a trash-recycling plant in the Williamsburg
section of Brooklyn in April 1995, and an unidentified woman whose
body was found in a garbage container in Medford in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last several months.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman, who worked as a clerk at the post office in Hicksville,
several blocks from his apartment, was charged separately in
Westchester County last year with the murder of two women in 1991
and 1992 whose bodies were found in trash bins in Yonkers.
Westchester officials are awaiting the outcome of the Suffolk
trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his 17-page ruling dated June 5, Pitts said the authorities
had many valid reasons to arrest Shulman, including witnesses who
identified him as the last person to be seen with Ms. Bunting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, forensic experts had identified fibers and
cat hairs linking Ms. Bunting and the unidentified woman found in
Medford to Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   The Suffolk County district attorney, James Catterson Jr.,
announced in 1996 that he would seek the death penalty for Shulman.
Catterson said the case was ``the classic definition of a serial
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the law reinstating capital punishment, a suspect can be
charged with first-degree murder if accused of killing two or more
individuals within a two-year period in the same or similar
circumstances, or killing someone while committing another felony,
like rape or sodomy, or killing a police officer, among other
categories.

CLINTON'S EFFORT TO BRING RACES TOGETHER NEVER GOT OFF GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If anyone needs convincing that President Clinton's
initiative on race has done at least a little good, let them talk
to Fannie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In the six months since Clinton went to Akron, Ohio, for his
first town hall meeting on race relations, Brown's ``Coming
Together Project'' has blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   The signup list for her workshops to promote racial
understanding has grown by the dozens. Money has poured in, desks
and computers have been donated to fill the one-room office, and
two full-time workers have been added.
</P>
<P>
   But as the curtain comes down Sunday on Clinton's yearlong race
initiative, Fannie Brown's experience stands out less as a success
story than as a sorry symbol of what might have been possible in
every nook and cranny of America.
</P>
<P>
   Bedeviled by ideological infighting, a vague sense of purpose,
and a president distracted by personal and political crises, the
initiative is widely viewed as at best a missed opportunity _ and
at worst as an exercise in futility. Few people inside the White
House or out expect anything akin to the lasting impact of the last
major presidential effort of this kind _ Lyndon Johnson's Kerner
Commission of 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kerner Commission is very high in our history, but there
is nothing distinctive about this commission,'' said Ron Walters, a
political scientist at the University of Maryland at College Park.
``And the discussions themselves never really took off.''
</P>
<P>
   No one faults Clinton for his ambitions. The challenge he took
on _ to prod Americans to talk to one another and get beyond skin
color and ethnicity _ was remarkable and unprecedented for a
president acting in the absence of a social crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Last June 14, standing before an adoring multiracial crowd at
the University of California at San Diego's commencement, Clinton,
his cap and gown blowing in the wind, said that 10 years from now
he wanted people to look back and say, ``This year of honest
dialogue and concerted action helped to lift the heavy burden of
race from our children's future.''
</P>
<P>
   He must have known how hard the work would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honest dialogue will not be easy,'' he said. ``We'll all have
to get past defensiveness and fear and political correctness and
other barriers to honesty. Emotions may be rubbed raw, but we must
begin.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Walters said, somehow the dialogue never got off the
ground. After the high hopes in Akron, one of the enduring images
is the look of irritation on Clinton's face when he showed up at a
meeting of his race advisory board at Washington's Mayflower Hotel
_ and then never showed up again.
</P>
<P>
   In the year of Lewinsky, Whitewater, and Starr, of crisis
management and frenetic foreign travel, there just wasn't much time
to dwell on America's most enduring social divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were unrealistically high expectations in terms of what
would immediately be accomplished by the initiative,'' said William
F. Winter, a former Mississippi governor who sits on the
seven-member race advisory board that Clinton appointed.
</P>
<P>
   The distractions also didn't help. ``It has obviously been
difficult for him to maintain the level of unimpeded leadership
that he posseses, but having these distractions forced upon him
every day is unfortunate,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the White House admits that the dialogue never was as frank
as Clinton wanted. Emotions weren't rubbed as raw as he expected,
and a year later, the central question he posed, ``Can we become
one America in the 21st century?'' is arguably no closer to being
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, some would say that within the race board, the question
was never properly asked.
</P>
<P>
   One problem was the board's slow start. Several months passed
between the San Diego speech and the assembling of the board's
staff. The initial sluggishness reduced the amount of time
available to debate some hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, deliberations were considered public under the Open
Meetings Law. Some found that open-air dialogue and the early media
scrutiny constraining.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, having a situation where you are asking people
to bare their soul ... that is inhibiting,'' said the deputy White
House chief of staff, Sylvia Mathews.
</P>
<P>
   Far more damaging, many say, is that the board, hemmed in by
squeamishness in the White House, never settled on a primary focus.
Its conversations droned on, business-like, about such things as
the effects of racial disparities in education and employment. But
its shied away from the questions that preoccupy the racial
discourse elsewhere in America: What is the purpose and future of
affirmative action? What is to be done about the residual vein of
racial animus? Should the nation issue a formal apology for slavery
to get that ugly past behind us and help us move on?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would any thoughtful, enlightened adult person in this
country really think we would get to the tough issues in a national
dialogue on race?'' asked board member Angela Oh, a blunt-talking
lawyer from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Walters, the political scientist, said: ``Just think about what
happened in Jasper, Texas,'' where three white men last week were
accused of chaining a black man to the back of a pickup and
dragging him to his death. ``That conjures up images of lynching,''
he said. ``One has to discuss those things, and at the end of the
day do something serious about it. You can't leap over that and get
to racial reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh said she wanted to deal with contentious issues such as
whether Clinton should apolgize for slavery. ``We were not
permitted to broach the subject,'' she said. ``Nobody raised it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who would not permit it, she said: ``I just don't think we
were interested in taking something up that he (Clinton) was not
interested in pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   NAACP chairman Julian Bond, a longtime civil rights activist,
said such decisions made the race effort seem irrelevant and
disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada has apologized to the Indians, Germany has apologized
to the Jews. The Southern Baptists have apologized for their bad
behavior, and part of coming to grips with this is the
acknowledgment of wrongdoing,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have not had any national acknowledgement of
wrongdoing, in the distant past or recent past. Apologies are not
just words. But words hurt and words can help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often that Bond and Ward Connerly agree. But Connerly,
a University of California regent and a leading opponent of
affirmative action, agrees that the race effort is stained for not
dealing with the tough issues of slavery and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton should not be faulted for getting involved,'' Connerly
says. ``The fault is that he hasn't provided leadership. This is
going to be remembered as a lost opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond said of Clinton's initiative: ``This all has been kind of
fuzzy from the start, and that's his fault. I'm just not clear what
was their charge, what were they supposed to do?''
</P>
<P>
   At times, it looked as if the race initiative had fallen off the
president's radar screen. There were often long stretches where he
did not mention it in speeches or devote much time to it.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, give a memorable speech in Little Rock, Ark.,
to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the integration of Central
High School. He also met with a group of conservatives like
Connerly who oppose affirmative action, with civil rights leaders,
and members of Congress on the race issue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the board meeting at the Mayflower, where Clinton
was clearly irritated by the snail's pace of the race panel's work,
he has attended two town hall meetings.
</P>
<P>
   At the first, Clinton delivered an Oprah-esque performance,
walking across the stage, microphone in hand, at one point baiting
Boston scholar Abigail Thernstrom into a debate over affirmative
action in the military. At the second, Clinton was little more than
a spectator as professional athletes, coaches, and team owners
debated the overlay of race in sports. A third discussion on race
is planned for July 8.
</P>
<P>
   John Hope Franklin, the race panel's chairman and a noted
historian at Duke University, wrote Clinton monthly reports to
supplement weekly reports from the initiative's staff.
</P>
<P>
   In his first report, Franklin wrote: ``I would, of course, be
pleased to discuss these recommendations with you.'' His second
report ended with: ``I would, of course, be pleased to discuss any
of the above thoughts with you,'' before signing off with ``my best
wishes,'' as Franklin always did.
</P>
<P>
   For his entire year as chairman, Franklin never met face-to-face
with Clinton. Franklin stopped offering to meet with the president
after sending the second report.
</P>
<P>
   The race board's work now is nearly finished, except for a few
more meetings over several months and a final set of
recommendations for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who says he wants to be remembered for inspiring

   Christopher Edley, an adviser to Clinton for the race

Edley said, adding that those ideas are still being framed.

TAUNTS AND TRICKERY IN CITY BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An aide to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently paused to
chat with a City Council member outside a men's room in City Hall.
But did the aide actually need to use the facilities? Or was he on
an espionage mission to glean vital information and confuse matters
with mayoral propaganda?
</P>
<P>
   The Council could not risk the chance. Just as the aide was
about to enter the men's room, a sergeant-at-arms ordered him to
leave the immediate premises. After all, this was war, and he was
in Council territory.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter is just one of several bizarre moments to have
sprung from the dispute between the mayor and the Council over the
city's budget. There was the day that the city's top budget
director, a man of linebacker proportions, snatched documents from
a Council leader's hands and literally ran away. Or the late night
when agents from both camps played budgetary brinkmanship over a
few beers. And the Council's days-long exploitation of a threat
from the mayor's office _ ``We will bring you to your knees'' _
that no one ever said.
</P>
<P>
   All these episodes, and more, were born of a wrenching battle
made more vitriolic by the memories of the combatants' formerly
cordial relationship. And it is all the more awkward because the
opposing forces operate under the same roof. Eyes are averted,
handshakes withdrawn. And certain courtesies are suspended.
</P>
<P>
   In the east wing of City Hall, leaders of the
Democratic-controlled Council have urged members to stick together,
swallow their fears and brace for the engagements to come. In the
west wing, the Republican mayor and his top aides jokingly call
themselves ``wartime consiglieres'' _ a phrase lifted from ``The
Godfather'' _ as they gird themselves with the fuel of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   It is a time for misinformation, media manipulation and
late-night debates over obscure passages in the city charter. As
Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro said, ``You plan for every possible
scenario, and you have responses for every possible scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a month ago, both sides were optimistic that they could
reach a consensus budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1; a
$2 billion surplus has a way of creating good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations soon soured between the mayor and Peter Vallone
_ the Council speaker and a gubernatorial candidate _ partly over
various tax-cut proposals but mostly over the future of the New
York Yankees. Giuliani insisted that Vallone drop his call for a
referendum on whether taxes should finance a new stadium in
Manhattan for the Bronx-based team; he argued that it would disrupt
sensitive discussions. The speaker refused.
</P>
<P>
   Budget talks ended abruptly, and the maneuvers, profound and
petty, began.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Menges, the mayor's legislative liaison to the Council, was
in mid-sentence with Councilman John Sabini when the
sergeant-at-arms ordered him to leave the restroom. He then moved
to a Council anteroom and struck up a conversation with another
Council member, but a sergeant-at-arms again told him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Menges declined to comment, and Council aides responded by
citing examples of similar insults from the mayor's side _ of
agency commissioners instructed not to provide the Council with
information. Still, the incident became a cause celebre for the
mayor's aides, who made sure that reporters were apprised.
</P>
<P>
   The Council developed a rallying cry of its own, after a brief
meeting between Mastro, the mayor's top negotiator, and Bruce
Bender, the Council's chief of staff. ``We discussed from his
perspective that the Council was going its own way, and from our
perspective that we would have to have a strong response,'' Mastro
recalled. ``No voices raised, no fancy rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Bender briefed anxious Council leaders about his
meeting with Mastro, they interpreted his account to mean that the
deputy mayor had vowed to bring the Council speaker to his knees.
Within hours, the supposed threat had become another ``Remember the
Maine,'' used to unite Council members in the bond of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase resurfaced so often, in fact, that Vallone developed
a stock answer that he used several times: ``There's only one time
in my life that I was on my knees, and thank God my wife said
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Just one problem: The threat had never been made, officials on
both sides say. ``The words that the speaker attributed to me, for
what he apparently perceived to be good campaign fodder, were never
uttered,'' Mastro said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Friday, June 5, the Council defied both the mayor and
precedent by adopting a $34 billion budget. Dozens of Council
members, reveling in their political courage, gathered in the City
Hall's rotunda that afternoon to cheer and chortle.
</P>
<P>
   Only Thomas McMahon, the Council's finance director, and his
staff tempered their celebration. They knew that at some point
before midnight, the mayor's staff would be issuing a figure _ its
estimate of city revenues _ that could foul up the calculations
that the Council had used in arriving at its budget. All they could
do was wait _ and drink beer _ at the Nathan Hale bar on Murray
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the mayor's budget director and McMahon's
adversary, was also waiting for his analysts to develop a revenue
figure. But his persistent questions so disrupted their work that
he left his Park Place headquarters _ where he uses the soundtrack
to ``Top Gun'' to prepare for budget battles, and recordings of
Gregorian chants to calm down _ to wait in City Hall. An analyst,
David Rubenstein, would walk the estimates over as soon as they
were completed.
</P>
<P>
   As midnight drew closer, McMahon's colleagues drank some more
and placed bets on what the mayor's revenue number would be. But
McMahon kept stepping out onto Murray Street to drag on a cigarette
and glance nervously toward the lights of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he recognized his budgetary enemy, Rubenstein, walking
up the street with the manila envelope clutched to his chest. As he
walked past McMahon, Rubenstein muttered: ``It's in here.''
</P>
<P>
   That prompted McMahon to start shouting for one of his own
analysts, Kurt Richwerger. ``Kurt! Kurt!'' he shouted,
half-jokingly. ``Let's get Kurt to jump him!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The shouting prompted Rubenstein to begin running. McMahon could
only watch him run across Broadway and disappear inside City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:51 p.m., McMahon's beeper sounded. It was Lhota: The
mayor's revenue estimate was $251 million short of what the Council
had used in its calculations, forcing it to come up with a way _
either by raising taxes or making budget cuts _ to make up the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, at least, detente was declared. Rubenstein
returned to the bar to drink and swap silly budgetary threats with
the Council analysts. As a matter of fact, he and Richwerger are
longtime rivals in the subterranean world of revenue estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the federal tax reform of 1986?'' Richwerger later
asked. ``We had different opinions about its implications for city
agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The truce was brief. For all the minor absurdities, both sides
see the budget battle as a defining moment in city history. Vallone
maintains that the budget is sound, and that it demonstrates that
two branches of government _ not just the mayor _ have a say in
city spending. Giuliani counters that the Council's budget will
create huge deficits in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Because both sides expect the fight to end up in court, they
have taken care not to violate the City Charter as they make each
move. But there have been gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a mayoral aide solemnly delivered copies of
Giuliani's vetoes, totaling about $196 million, to the Council's
chief of staff, Bender. But seconds later, Lhota, the budget
director, burst into the office, grabbed the documents from Bender
and dashed out of City Hall. Observers said that Lhota moved
quickly for a very large man.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, the mayoral aide appeared once again at the
Council's door with the veto documents. Lhota later explained that
a few pages of veto cuts were missing from the veto documents.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the Council's turn. Like a general rallying his
troops for a historic engagement, Vallone summoned the 51 members
to City Hall on Thursday to override the mayor's vetoes _ only to
postpone the vote until Tuesday. It turned out that the Council's
lawyers were concerned that they had not followed a requirement to
give the public sufficient notice of their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be no end in sight for either the squabbles or
the touches of the absurd. A few nights ago, leaders from the
Council and the mayor's office traveled to midtown Manhattan to
present their cases before television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   For a few awkward moments, the adversaries found themselves
sitting together in a studio lounge. They discovered that they had
little to talk about.

OUTDOORS: ACCESS RIGHTS IN PERIL ON CERTAIN WATERWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEPHEN C. SAUTNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unknown to most anglers, the right to fish hundreds of miles of
waterways within New York state has hung precariously in the
balance for more than a year, following a court decision that
greatly limits where the public can cast a line.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling stemmed from a case involving 10 fishing guides
arrested in 1995 in Oswego County for fishing from their drift
boats along a private stretch of the Salmon River known as
Douglaston Run _ two and a half miles managed as a ``pay-to-fish''
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The landowner, former state Sen. Douglas Barclay, sued for
trespass. The guides argued that the Salmon was a ``navigable''
waterway _ a designation that allows access by boaters and
canoeists, and has traditionally implied fishing rights. The case
wended its way through two lower courts before a Court of Appeals
finally ruled that while navigability did include a right of
passage by boaters, it did not include a right to fish.
</P>
<P>
   In a written opinion, Judge Joseph Bellacosa stated, ``The
longstanding public easement of navigation in navigable-in-fact
rivers does not sweep away or displace other rights ... including
that of exclusive fishery.'' In one fell swoop, the decision
jeopardized decades of work by the New York state Department of
Environmental Conservation to provide easements for anglers to have
access to the state's navigable waters.
</P>
<P>
   It also meant that landowners whose deeds include river or lake
bottoms could either ban fishing altogether, or charge an admission
fee, even if the water in question is stocked with fish purchased
with state funds. (New York state operates a massive hatchery on
the Salmon River where migratory Pacific salmon, steelhead, brown
trout and Atlantic salmon migrate past both public and private
stretches.)
</P>
<P>
   So far, the DEC does not appear overly concerned about the
ruling, though a department spokesman admits it could leave other
state waterways vulnerable to fishing bans. ``To some extent the
Barclay decision does set a precedent that could endanger the
public's access rights to other properties that are similar,'' said
Sam Thernstrom of the DEC ``It's an area of developing case law
where a lot of questions have not been answered yet.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a chilling thought for anglers. Dery Bennett, executive
director of the American Littoral Society, a national conservation
organization that fights for public access to waterways, described
the ruling as ``smacking of elitism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's next?'' Bennett asked. ``Are we going to make a kid
with a cane pole and a can of worms have to pay up before he goes
down to the pond to catch a few pumpkin seeds?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Yvonne Kopy of the New York state chapter of the
Fisheries Defense Fund, anglers have already begun feeling the
effects of the court ruling. Kopy cited an example along Johnson
Creek in Point Breeze, where a property owner levies a fee to fish
for that stream's monster brown trout _ again stocked with state
funds. The owner has even hired wardens to patrol his section of
the river.
</P>
<P>
   She also heard from bass anglers who had been chased from
casting under docks after launching their boat at a public launch
ramp.
</P>
<P>
   Kopy, whose husband was one of the defendants in the original
suit, questioned why the DEC and Attorney General Dennis Vacco have
stayed silent on this issue, noting that in similar cases in
Montana, Alaska, Florida and Virginia, state wildlife agencies
successfully defended anglers' rights. ``My concern is the DEC and
attorney general's failure to respond to the public; how can public
funds support private enterprise like this when it's forbidden in
our constitution?'' she said, referring to the New York
Constitution. ``No one has answered that.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, a Pennsylvania court considered a case
involving an angler arrested after wading onto a private stretch of
the Lehigh River owned by a fishing club. After key testimony by
Pennsylvania's Fish and Boat Commission and others, the court ruled
the Lehigh navigable, and therefore fishable by the public.
</P>
<P>
   But relief may be on the way for New York anglers in the form of
legislation proposed by Assemblyman Alexander Pete Grannis. His
bill, set to go before the Assembly in this session, would
essentially overturn the Court of Appeals ruling by including the
right to fish under the legal definition of navigable.
</P>
<P>
   With Governor George Pataki recently championing the right of
public access on the Hudson River over lands owned by Metro North,
Grannis is hoping the climate is right to move his bill forward.
Perhaps then the state's 1.1 million licensed anglers who don't own
private water but do spend some $15 million in license fees can
breathe a collective sigh of relief.

CHARLES DISCH, 96, DRUGGIST AND FRIENDLY CURMUDGEON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Disch, who dispensed strong bitter medicine
and good-natured vitriol during more than 60 years as the Shelter
Island druggist and resident curmudgeon, died on May 31 at a
mainland nursing home in Greenport. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   As the longtime proprietor of Shelter Island's only drugstore,
Disch became an indispensable fixture on the small secluded island
between the forks of eastern Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   On a Manhattan-sized island whose population would barely fill a
single big city apartment complex, Disch's Shelter Island Heights
Pharmacy, just up the hill from the Greenport ferry, was where
folks from all over the island went to fill a prescription, pick up
a newspaper, sip a soda, lick an ice-cream cone, send a telegram,
catch up on the local gossip and receive a daily dose of the
mock-crotchety proprietor's patented prolixity.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he had an unkind word for everyone. In an insular
society where anyone who hadn't been dissed by Doc Disch couldn't
be said to have arrived, he had his standards. And while any of
Shelter Island's 2,000 or so year-round residents could rely on a
cheerful tongue-lashing, on an island whose summer population
swells to more than 10,000 sometimes annoying vacationers, Disch
took a while to cool off to summer people, especially those with
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Let a stylish young matron come tripping into the store chirping
away to some friends about how much they would love meeting this
really wonderful old curmudgeon character, and Disch would become
elaborately polite, even managing a thin smile as he suppressed a
chuckle over what he would be saying about his condescending
visitors once they left.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was around so long that it might have seemed he had
arrived with the first white settlers in 1652, Disch was actually
born in the South Fork town of Sag Harbor, where he and his older
sister, Beatrice, were orphaned early and grew up in the swirling
company of their Irish-born mother's legions of nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   A small, trim man whose youthful red hair was set off by
piercing blue eyes, Disch was an accomplished athlete who became
something of a dandy and enjoyed the Roaring '20s so much he saw no
reason to stop partying just because it was no longer illegal.
</P>
<P>
   After working his way through the Fordham University College of
Pharmacy, Disch returned to Sag Harbor, married and became a
pharmacist's assistant on Shelter Island.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he bought the business a decade later and moved into
the six-room apartment above the drugstore, Disch was well on his
way to establishing his legend in a community of East Enders with
such a rarefied sense of humor that their ancestors named one North
Fork town Southold and called a South Fork community North Haven.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who operated his drugstore seven days a week and
sometimes had to go downstairs at 3 in the morning to fill an
emergency prescription, he maintained a remarkably active outside
life centered on golf by day and tavern life by night.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his pal Jake Piccozzi, who operated a gas station
around the corner and was known as the mayor of Bridge Street,
Disch became the center of a hard-partying band of Shelter Island
revelers that sometimes included former Gov. Hugh Carey.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tribute to Disch's reputation as an equal opportunity
celebrant that as a steadfast and lifelong Republican he did not
hold Carey's Democratic affiliation against him.
</P>
<P>
   Disch, who sometimes swam from Shelter Island to Greenport to
refresh himself after a serious evening out, slowed down a bit
after a son received his pharmacist's degree and joined the
business in the mid-1950s, but even when he eventually gave up his
place behind the pharmacist's counter and took up his position at
the first stool at the soda fountain, Disch continued to be the
store's official greeter, not to mention chief shill for a
cherished concoction only he dared call coffee.
</P>
<P>
   It is recalled by old-timers as a murky liquid so vile to the
taste that some thought it could only have been brewed to grow hair
on the chest, but its real purpose seemed to have been to clear the
heads of those who had been out partying with the proprietor the
night before.
</P>
<P>
   Disch became so partial to it and to his role at the drugstore
that after selling the business a few years ago and moving in with
a son, he came to regret the decision, but not, apparently, his
six-decade run as the cheerful scourge of Shelter Island.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his 90-year-old wife, Dorothy; two sons, Paul
of Shelter Island and Peter of Yorktown Heights; a daughter, Mary
Barbara Dubas of Shelter Island; seven grandchildren and six
great-grandchildren.

FBI CONNECTIONS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT SENATOR PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK LEHR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As an FBI supervisor, John Morris was overseeing an
investigation of then-Senate President William M. Bulger in 1986
when a gift arrived from the politician's big brother, gangster
James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger _ a $5,000 cash bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Morris accepted it, as he had others. This spring, the retired
FBI agent admitted he had earlier taken two $1,000 payoffs from the
notorious South Boston crime boss.
</P>
<P>
   But the previously undisclosed timing of the $5,000 payment _
combined with revelations last week about William Bulger's
knowledge of his brother's ties to the FBI _ are raising renewed
questions about the thoroughness, vigor, and impartiality of the
FBI probe of William Bulger in the 75 State Street scandal of the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Raising further questions is the disclosure that a second key
official involved in the 75 State Street investigation, former
federal prosecutor Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan, was involved in the
FBI's dealings with Whitey Bulger dating to the early 1980s, when
O'Sullivan was the region's top Mafia prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, having risen to interim US attorney, O'Sullivan worked
in tandem with Morris on the critical reexamination of the 75 State
Street affair, a case involving charges of extortion and
influence-peddling that gripped Beacon Hill and the Boston
political establishment at the time. The review cleared William
Bulger of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   These are the kinds of connections that can be made today as a
result of FBI agents' testimony and once-secret FBI files that are
being unsealed during ongoing US District Court hearings in Boston.
And the web of interlocking relationships does not end with Morris
and O'Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   There is former FBI agent John Connolly, the longtime
``handler'' of Whitey Bulger, who is also a friend of William
Bulger. Though Connolly later denied Morris's account, Morris
testified recently that during the 75 State Street probe, Connolly
came to the white-collar crime squad and talked to Morris about
William Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connolly approached me and asked me what the Senate president
should do, that he's been asked to submit to an interview, and what
did I recommend that he do,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Under further questioning, Morris acknowledged that the overture
by an FBI agent from another squad, acting on behalf of a subject
of an investigation, was irregular.
</P>
<P>
   The new nuggets about William Bulger have mostly tumbled out at
the margins of the hearings, whose primary focus is to examine
every wrinkle in the FBI's nearly 20-year relationship with Whitey
Bulger and his associate, Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi. Judge
Mark L. Wolf ordered the hearings, which began in January, to
consider a defense claim that racketeering charges against Whitey
Bulger, Flemmi, and two other underworld figures should be
dismissed due to FBI misconduct and an FBI promise of immunity from
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, the references in court to both Bulgers, to
overlapping government officials, and to 75 State Street are
intriguing asides. But they are intriguing nonetheless. In short,
the fate of the 75 State Street case in late 1988 and early 1989
ended up in the hands of a top government prosecutor and a corrupt
FBI supervisor, both of whom were involved in the FBI's long and
questionable relationship to Whitey Bulger _ an association that
until now was buried inside secret FBI files and never talked about
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Bulger became embroiled in the 75 State Street case
through his boyhood friend and former law partner Thomas E.
Finnerty. In the mid-1980s, Finnerty, a former prosecutor with
little to no experience in real estate development, was involved
with controversial developer Harold Brown in the development of 75
State Street, an office building in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Brown would later claim that Finnerty, citing his influence with
Bulger, had threatened to ruin the $286 million project unless
Brown cut him in as a partner. In the summer of 1985, Brown made a
payment of $500,000 to Finnerty, and within days, Finnerty paid
Bulger nearly half of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Finnerty would later say he had a contract with Brown to serve
as a consultant for the project and denied any wrongdoing. Bulger
said the money had been a loan from Finnerty, an advance against a
legal fee he had earned from another case but for which he had not
yet been paid. Bulger later repaid Finnerty with interest, saying
he did so as soon as he learned Brown was the ``remote source'' of
the funds.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1986, however, a federal investigation into possible
extortion was under way, with Brown cooperating as part of a larger
federal probe into city development deals. Finnerty and Brown also
filed civil lawsuits against one another, and the whole matter
spilled into public view in a Globe Spotlight Team story in early
December 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Morris was serving as the supervisor of the FBI's white-collar
crime squad at the time, and he oversaw the closing of the 75 State
Street inquiry days before the Globe story appeared, a move made
without the FBI ever having questioned William Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brown, in a sudden turnaround, opted to settle the civil
lawsuit with Finnerty by paying him $200,000 _ over and above the
$500,000 paid earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But following the media accounts detailing the dispute and an
ensuing public outcry, the case was reopened by O'Sullivan, who had
left the New England Organized Crime Strike Force to become the
acting US attorney. William Bulger was interviewed, although the
reinvestigation consisted largely of this two-hour session with two
prosecutors and two FBI agents at the law offices of Bulger's
attorney, R. Robert Popeo, according to sources. In March 1989,
O'Sullivan concluded there was insufficient evidence to seek
federal indictments for extortion against either Bulger or
Finnerty. ``It was not a close call; it was a clear call,''
O'Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, William Bulger was a featured speaker at the
retirement party for FBI agent John Cloherty, a former member of
the organized crime squad and a friend of Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, during the extraordinary federal court
hearings, Morris confessed to a darker side. In testimony given
under a grant of immunity from prosecution, Morris admitted to
committing various crimes, including taking $7,000 in payoffs from
Whitey Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1985, when he took over as supervisor of the white-collar
crime squad, Morris had spent most of his career in the Boston
FBI's organized crime unit. He had been Connolly's boss, and he had
gone along on a number of encounters with Connolly, Whitey Bulger,
and Flemmi. They all had dined together; Morris had hosted dinners
at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Morris testified that the first time he took money from Whitey
Bulger was in 1982; he testified he asked Connolly to get $1,000
from Bulger so he could fly his girlfriend to Georgia to visit him
at a law enforcement conference.
</P>
<P>
   The second payoff came in 1984, after Morris had left the
organized crime unit. This time, Morris testified, Connolly
delivered a case of wine from Bulger and Flemmi, and at the bottom
of the box Morris found $1,000 in cash stuffed in an envelope.
</P>
<P>
   The third and largest payoff was for $5,000 while Morris was
supervisor of the white-collar crime squad. The money followed a
homecooked meal. ``After dinner, Connolly and Flemmi got up and
walked out of the apartment,'' Morris testified in April. ``Bulger
hung back, and as he was putting his coat on, he pulled out an
envelope and gave the envelope to me. He said, `Here, this is to
help you out,' and walked out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   During the court hearings, Morris did not put a date on this
final payoff, describing it as coming sometime after the 1984
money. But in an interview last week, one of his lawyers, Michael
Collora, said the $5,000 in cash was handed over to Morris ``in
late 1986'' _ meaning this last batch of Whitey Bulger money came
during the early part of the FBI's probe of 75 State Street, and
William Bulger and Finnerty.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has so far refused to testify at the current court
hearings, citing his Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination. In out-of-court comments to reporters, he has
called Morris a liar.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris had still more to say about Connolly, this time about
Connolly's actions during the renewed 75 State Street probe in
early 1989. And during Morris's testimony on April 27, Judge Wolf
himself took over some of the key questioning about 75 State
Street, Connolly, and Bulger:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Wolf:  &LR; Did you also communicate through Mr. Connolly to William
Bulger confidential information concerning the status of the
investigation of William Bulger?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morris:  &LR; Connolly approached me and asked me what the Senate
president should do, that he's been asked to submit to an
interview, and what did I recommend he do? And I told Connolly that
I recommended that he submit to an interview.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Did you tell him why?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morris:  &LR; Because I didn't feel that the case was very strong. I
didn't think that he could hurt himself. I thought it would be to
his advantage to submit to the interview and put an end to the
public clamor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Other FBI agents, were they in the habit of coming to you
and asking you for the results of investigative efforts in an
effort to advise an individual who may be a target whether he
should submit or not to an interview process by the FBI?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Morris:  &LR; No, sir.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the current court hearings have also revealed new
information regarding O'Sullivan's involvement in the FBI's long
history with Whitey Bulger. Morris testified that in 1979, he and
Connolly went to O'Sullivan and urged the prosecutor to keep Bulger
and Flemmi out of an imminent indictment in a horse race-fixing
case. Morris said he ``indicated'' to O'Sullivan that the two were
FBI informants. The plea succeeded, and Bulger and Flemmi were
named only as unindicted co-conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   Other once-secret FBI documents, along with other agents'
testimony, demonstrate that O'Sullivan played a key role in ongoing
discussions in the early 1980s about how best to handle State
Police suspicions that the FBI was protecting Bulger and Flemmi,
and also about whether the FBI should either retain Bulger as an
informant or cut him loose.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Sarhatt, the FBI agent in charge of the Boston office
in 1980, testified in January he could not recall whether he and
O'Sullivan actually referred to Whitey Bulger by name during
telephone discussions about Bulger's status, but that O'Sullivan
strongly urged the FBI to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   It did. During a string of successful Mafia prosecutions in the
mid-1980s, Bulger and Flemmi were on board as FBI informants,
contributing secretly to O'Sullivan's glory. By 1989, O'Sullivan
oversaw the federal review of the 75 State Street case, which ended
when he concluded that no indictments were warranted. Though he
hinted strongly that ``power brokering,'' which he equated to
influence peddling, had been part of the deal, he told reporters
that power brokering was not necessarily a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``No witness has even alleged that state Senator Bulger was
criminally involved in this matter through his relationship with
Mr. Finnerty, and any inferences that he was so involved are not
supported by the weight of the evidence,'' said O'Sullivan at the
press conference on March 31, 1989. In January 1992, Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger announced that a separate state review
had also exonerated Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Now in private practice at Choate, Hall and Stewart, O'Sullivan
was expected to be a key witness at the ongoing federal court
hearings, but in early March, he suffered a heart attack and then
an adverse reaction to medication.
</P>
<P>
   This week, one of his partners, Hugh Scott, said O'Sullivan was
``heading home, where he will continue to recuperate. It would be
an incredibly inappropriate time to talk to him about any
substantive stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite new evidence linking O'Sullivan to the FBI and Whitey
Bulger, O'Sullivan previously has denied any knowledge of that
arrangement. ``I don't buy it,'' he said in a 1988 interview
shortly before a Globe Spotlight Team story disclosed the FBI's
ties to Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Then last summer, O'Sullivan hedged; he told FBI investigators
that while he might have thought Bulger and Flemmi had been FBI
informants, he was ``never specifically told that'' while he was a
government prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asked through a spokesman to comment on Morris's admissions
about taking payoffs during the State Street investigation, and his
brother's involvement with the FBI, William Bulger declined.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger retired from the state Senate in January 1996 and is now
president of the University of Massachusetts. During the height of
the 75 State Street case in early 1989 he made little public
comment beyond strongly denying any role in the project. He was
more expansive in his 1996 memoir, ``While the Music Lasts.'' He
devoted most of a chapter to the affair, condemning the Globe's
coverage and describing the hardship the case caused him.
</P>
<P>
   But he left many questions about his connection to the case
unanswered. In his book, Bulger writes at length about college
tuitions and his financial straits being the basis for taking a
loan from Finnerty. But in fact, $225,000 of the Brown money that
he had received from Finnerty went into a conservative Fidelity
tax-exempt bond fund, another $7,000 was used to purchase a share
in a Chicago-based cable television company, and $15,000 went to
himself in a check on which he was the payee.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir includes next to nothing about Whitey Bulger and the
FBI, or the overlapping interests of agents like Connolly and
Morris and the two Bulger brothers. Morris does get a mention: the
book notes that Morris was disciplined following the 75 State
Street case for leaking to the Globe the fact that William Bulger
had finally met with FBI agents for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Connolly insists the former Senate president never
knew of his brother's ties to the FBI. Even so, it is not as if
William Bulger could not have surmised something was up.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, retired FBI supervisor James Ring testified he had
gone along to one of the dinners Connolly arranged with Whitey
Bulger and Flemmi. The dinner, he testified, was at Flemmi's
parents' house in South Boston, and at one point, in popped William
Bulger from his home across the way.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there were William Bulger, Whitey Bulger, Stephen
Flemmi, and at least two FBI agents. ``These people were not
consultants. They were not friends,'' Ring testified Wednesday
about his chagrin at the manner in which Connolly socialized with
his informants.
</P>
<P>
   The entire scene, said Ring, was ``stupid.''

FIGHTING TO LIVE CLEAN AND KEEP HIS CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Dale Graham lumbers through the front door of
the Children's Aid Society in midtown Manhattan, and three small
boys begin shrieking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!'' one cries as he and his two brothers
race toward the towering 6-foot-4-inch, 290-pound visitor in
stylish black jeans, black parka and gold chain.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest boy, 4, buries his face between Graham's shins. The
two older boys, 6 and 7, fiercely clutch his calves. Graham, a
recovering crack addict who has spent 23 of his 41 years cycling in
and out of jail, is ebullient. He stoops, collects all three in his
massive arms and gently squeezes them.
</P>
<P>
   It is Graham's first visit with his sons since he completed a
10-month drug rehabilitation program. The Children's Aid Society,
citing Graham's 14-year crack addiction and criminal record, wants
to put the boys up for adoption. Graham is desperate to win them
back. His success at blocking the adoption in court depends on how
convincingly he can complete the metamorphosis from addict and
inmate to responsible father.
</P>
<P>
   As the giddy children leap up and down around him, Graham hands
out three presents painstakingly wrapped in used gift paper: a $28
battery-operated train set and used $5 ``Lion King'' and ``Bambi''
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   But after the boys tear open their gifts, they begin fighting,
and Graham struggles to exert authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to me! Listen to me!'' he says, his frustration and
baritone voice rising. ``There's no batteries. There's no
batteries. It ain't gonna work!''
</P>
<P>
   Moments after it began, the visit is fraying as Graham betrays
the pressure he is under.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for Graham are high. A relapse, or another arrest,
would probably result in the boys' disappearing from his life
forever. If they are adopted, their new parent will control whether
Graham can ever see them again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids' best interest, that's what's keeping me from doing
something crazy,'' he says. ``I have never been as determined as
this in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's most vexing demon, and the source of much of the city's
crime, is addiction. A three-year study released in January by the
Columbia University Center on Alcohol and Substance Abuse found
that drugs or alcohol played a role in the imprisonment of 80
percent of the inmates in the United States in that period. City
officials estimate that 70 percent of the 41,000 children in foster
care in New York have a parent who is an addict.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and his drug counselor agreed to let a reporter spend
five months observing as Graham fought to end his addiction
permanently and regain custody of his sons. His struggle offers a
rare window into what occurs when a drug-addicted criminal does
what society asks and tries to salvage his life.
</P>
<P>
   On the February day of his visit with his sons, Graham is
entering a crucial period. After living in the relative cocoon of a
residential drug treatment program, he has just moved into a
single-room-occupancy hotel. No longer required to attend
counseling and abide by a curfew, he is free to roam streets that
consumed him only months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In a month, his job-training program will place him in his first
legal job in more than a decade. And most important, a court
hearing that will most likely be his last opportunity to halt the
permanent adoption of his children is seven weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   After the uproar in the waiting room, Graham, his sons and a
social worker go into a small, colorfully decorated room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put these in these,'' Graham says, showing one boy how to put
together track lengths. The boys start quarreling over a piece of
track. ``Yo, yo, quiet!'' Graham shouts.
</P>
<P>
   At his best, Graham can be extraordinarily determined and
perceptive, openly and earnestly discussing an addiction that led
to prison and the loss of his children to foster care. At his
worst, he can be manipulative and short-tempered, a man vulnerable
to relapse and, judging from his past, prone to violence.
</P>
<P>
   All three boys were placed in foster care four years ago while
Graham was in jail and their mother was using drugs. Only the
6-year-old and 7-year-old are his; the 4-year-old is the child of
another man.
</P>
<P>
   He and the mother of his two sons also had a girl, now 14, whom
he lost to adoption. At the time, Graham was in jail and the mother
was using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where she went,'' he says. ``I guess that's why
I'm so determined to not lose these two.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham also has a 13-year-old son with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   He and his children are part of a cycle. Studies by the Medical
School of the University of California at San Diego and other
institutions found that children of addicts are four times as
likely as those of nonaddicts to develop substance abuse problems,
even if they are adopted by another family.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics, Graham argues, explain why he should rear his
children. If anyone knows the temptations his sons will face, he
does.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, Graham's biweekly visit with his sons ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Dad,'' one son says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, too,'' Graham says. ``Come over here. I'll hug
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys again clutch Graham's calves. He again gently envelops
them in his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll call you,'' Graham says, and walks out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to Avoid Streets of `Triggers'
</P>
<P>
   That night, Graham saunters up the front steps of the Project
Create Drug Rehabilitation program in Harlem. He warmly greets
another former convict still enrolled in Project Create, a program
typical of the treatment available to poor addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is eager for company. His girlfriend, a 37-year-old
convicted felon and recovering crack addict nicknamed Cookie, left
for Virginia two days earlier to visit two estranged daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that he is lost without her. While he was dealing
drugs, Graham says, he moved from girlfriend to girlfriend, but
this relationship is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a good girl who doesn't want to get high,'' he says.
``I'd be a fool to lose her. I know I can't do it alone.''

RACES IN MASS. HAVE VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON EQUALITY GAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Are minorities close to achieving equality in
Massachusetts?
</P>
<P>
   Whites thinks so. In their view, conditions for people of color
in Massachusetts have gotten better in the last five years, giving
them about the same chance in life as themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action has gone far enough, they say. Now it's time
for minorities to do more to help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But African-Americans, Latinos, and Asian-Americans see a
starkly different state, one where equality remains a long way off.
Although Latinos see some progress in the last five years, blacks
are much more likely to say things have stayed stagnant rather that
gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   With one-quarter to one-third of minorities reporting acts of
discrimination within the last month, blacks and Latinos think
government should do much more to make things better for
minorities. Blacks in particular would like to see affirmative
action expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Those are just some of the important differences revealed by a
new University of Massachusetts public-opinion poll that surveyed
white and minority attitudes on issues from affirmative action to
education to the bedrock institutions of American life.
</P>
<P>
   That survey, done as a cooperative venture by four institutes at
the University of Massachusetts, shows that on a number of
high-profile issues, the views of African-Americans, Latinos, and
Asian-Americans vary greatly from the white majority in
Massachusetts _ and in some cases, from one another. The new survey
doesn't exactly paint a picture of two separate states, but it
certainly shows a Commonwealth where different racial groups are of
different minds on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   With the state's demographic mix changing steadily, a closer
examination of minority sentiment is essential to understanding the
state, the academicians say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studies indicate that 30 percent of the state will be people
of color by 2010,'' said Russell Williams, research associate at
the Trotter Institute. ``We have to realize that there are
different perspectives that haven't been captured by previous
studies.''
</P>
<P>
   The new poll surveyed 381 whites residents and 348 minorities _
127 blacks, 114 Asian Americans, and 107 Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   Although the individual minority-group samples would be small
for head-to-head coverage in a fluid political race, those sample
sizes are considered satisfactory for social and attitudinal
research. On those samples, the margin of error is about nine
percentage points; the sample of white voters has a margin of error
of about 5 percentage points.

   Two of the starkest differences between the white sample and
nonwhite residents came on questions that dealt with the basic
status of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   By counts of 63 to 33 percent and 51 to 36 percent,
African-Americans and Latinos said they are still a long way from
gaining equality with whites. But Asian-Americans were split, with
44 percent saying there was a long way to go, and 47 percent
disagreeing.
</P>
<P>
   The white sample thought otherwise. Sixty-two percent thought
Asian-Americans had basically the same chance in life as whites,
with 25 percent demurring; 55 percent said equality had come for
African-Americans, with 37 percent disagreeing; and 48 percent
judged it true for Latinos, with 41 percent disagreeing.
</P>
<P>
   A similar difference came when the groups were asked whether
conditions in Massachusetts ``had gotten better'' for minorities in
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the whites surveyed thought so, but only 29 percent of
African-Americans agreed. Instead, 48 percent said things had
stayed the same.
</P>
<P>
   Personal experience could inform the minority viewpoint.
One-third of African-Americans, 31 percent of Latinos, and
one-quarter of Asian-Americans said they had experienced
discrimination within the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; Given those perspectives, it's probably not surprising that the
races were also in strong disagreement on two questions about the
role government should play toward minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent of Latinos and 46 percent of African-Americans
said government should make every effort to improve the social and
economic position of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But that proposition won support from only 26 percent of whites.
Forty-two percent said minorities should help themselves instead,
with 32 percent embracing an in-between position. Only 28 percent
of African-Americans and 20 percent of Latinos thought said
government should make no special efforts, but rather leave it to
minorities to help themselves, with 27 percent and 23 percent
endorsing an intermediate position or expressing no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Asian community sentiment was more mixed: 38 percent wanted
government to do more, 27 percent said it was time for minorities
to rely on themselves and not government, and 35 percent fell
between the two extremes.
</P>
<P>
   A similar split between whites and nonwhites came on the issue
of affirmative action. Forty-nine percent of African-Americans and
53 percent of Latinos felt the programs should be increased.
</P>
<P>
   But only 18 percent of whites thought so, with 28 percent
wanting to decrease those programs, and 36 percent favoring the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 11 percent of blacks and 6 percent of Latinos
wanted to pare back affirmative action, while 30 percent and 21
percent, respectively, were satisfied with the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-Americans fell in the middle, with 31 percent supporting
an increase, 17 percent saying affirmative action efforts should be
decreased and 33 percent favoring the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BILINGUAL EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The races split in several different ways on bilingual
education. Asked if the public schools should teach only in English
or in other languages as well, Latinos backed bilingual education
by a margin of 81 percent to 14 percent, followed by
African-Americans, at 54 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Asian Americans were split on the question, with 48 percent
in favor and 46 percent opposed. Only 35 percent of whites backed
bilingual education, while 61 percent said instruction should be in
English alone.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Watanabe, co-director of the Institute for Asian-American
Studies, said those answers gave a clear view not just at the
difference between whites and minorities, but also between the
minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   However, each racial group gave relatively strong support to the
idea of standardized tests as a gateway for high school graduation,
with three-quarters of whites and Asian-Americans in support, and
more than three-fifths of blacks and Latinos agreeing. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
IMPORTANT ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The four groups also cited different matters when asked what
they believed to be the most important issue facing Massachusetts
today.
</P>
<P>
   Crime was the biggest concern to Latinos, education most
important to Asian-Americans. Blacks were split between crime and
education. Whites, too, were divided, but between education and
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime and schools and education were clearly much higher
priorities for the nonwhite sample,'' said Carol Hardy-Fanta,
research director of the McCormack Institute's Center for Women in
Politics &AMP; Public Policy.

 NEW YORK: it alone.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He and Cookie met at Project Create a year ago. Counselors
discourage such relationships, reasoning that addicts should not
associate recovery with a specific person. Graham ignored the
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Project Create, a nonprofit agency, is on 111th Street near St.
Nicholas Avenue, an area with a stubbornly resilient drug trade.
During walks through the area, Graham occasionally bumps into
people he got high with.
</P>
<P>
   While commuting to his job-training program _ Binding Together,
a nonprofit agency in Manhattan that teaches recovering addicts to
use computerized copiers _ Graham avoids blocks where crack is
sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of the whole thing is to stay away from your
triggers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He is also staying away from another danger: Because of his
race, his size and his clothes, Graham says, he is a favorite
target of spot searches by the police. If he walks along a
dealer-infested block, he risks being caught in a police sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my record,'' he says, ``it would be very hard for me to
make a person believe I wasn't out there to do something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bad Times Started Early
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Graham muses about a life gone wrong as he lies on
the floor of a half-renovated brownstone in Brooklyn. He is
providing security for a contractor who fears that addicts will
strip the former crack house of its new pipes and appliances.
</P>
<P>
   With all but $42 of his biweekly welfare check going to lodging,
the job provides spending money. Working a double shift on a
Saturday, he will stay in the small, dusty room from 8 a.m. until
midnight. ``It keeps me off the streets,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Christmas Day in 1956, Graham grew up in Brownsville,
Brooklyn, one of five children of a coffee shop manager and a truck
driver who are still married. His mother, Mary, 72, answers her
phone, ``Good afternoon, God is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham's older brother, James, joined the Marines; a younger
brother, Adrian joined the Army. Both now run businesses in
Florida. His sister, Gwendolyn, is a schoolteacher in Brooklyn.
Graham and another younger brother, Stephen, who is in prison for
stabbing a man to death while high on angel dust, have drug
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger is very smart,'' Graham's mother says. ``But he
outsmarted himself.''
</P>
<P>
   At 14, in his first theft, Graham stole a typewriter and a copy
machine from his junior high school. Jailed twice as a juvenile, he
grew up behind bars and became more comfortable there than on the
street. ``When I was young and running wild, jail didn't bother
me,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he started smoking angel dust, also known as PCP,
because he liked the high. In 1985, he turned to crack cocaine and
spent the next decade in jail or homeless. Only self-preservation
and threats of stiff punishment seemed to change his behavior. He
switched to selling drugs after robbery sentences were increased
and a man he tried to mug pulled a gun on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started selling drugs to get away from the violence,'' he
says without a trace of irony.
</P>
<P>
   His last jail term broke him. Sleeping in a Rikers Island
dormitory, he felt vulnerable to attack from other prisoners, and
his blood pressure rose. ``I used to actually feel relieved when
the cops arrested me,'' he says. ``But this last time, I didn't
feel relief until I was heading home.''
</P>
<P>
   Why it took two decades for Graham to change is complicated, he
says, but the largest reason was his failure to recognize how drugs
had shaped his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I didn't have a drug problem; I thought I had a jail
problem,'' he said. ``Now, I see that it was the drugs that was
leading me to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   And Finally, a Day in Court
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, Graham arrives 45 minutes early in Bronx Family
Court for the hearing on his bid to block his biological sons'
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when impressing a judge is pivotal, he wears a gray
suit, maroon shirt, black tie, alligator-skin loafers with red
velvet stripes, and a thick gold necklace.
</P>
<P>
   As he waits, he broods. He scribbles in a newspaper, fidgets and
picks at his fingernails. His feet twitch back and forth. ``Courts
make me nervous,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His hopes for keeping his children lie in a thin envelope with
``Diplomas'' carefully written on its exterior. ``I've got
everything I've done in the last year here,'' he says, referring to
papers certifying his enrollment in drug rehabilitation, parenting
class and job training. ``He's got to lay it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'' is Harold Jones, a harried, graying man who is Graham's
court-appointed lawyer. The two have not spoken for seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour-and-a-half delay, Graham, three lawyers and the
adoption agency caseworker shuffle into the courtroom. Judge Myrna
Martinez-Perez sits behind a small wooden bench.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Steinhagen, a Manhattan lawyer, represents the Children's
Aid Society. Cesar Molina, a Legal Aid lawyer, is the children's
law guardian, appointed to protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Davis, the children's caseworker, takes the stand first.
Citing Graham's criminal record, she recommends that his parental
rights be terminated. Graham sits silently, his left knee furiously
bouncing beneath the wooden table.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Ms. Davis says the children have told
her they want to be adopted. Graham sighs and looks at his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call Graham,'' Jones announces. Nervously adjusting his
suit, Graham takes the witness stand. Finally, his chance to
explain his new life has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Jones leads Graham through basic questions, but Graham answers
awkwardly. His grammar, already bad, worsens. He fidgets between
answers. A muscle on the left side of his face twitches.
</P>
<P>
   Jones asks Graham to explain why he should have his children.
``I feel that I'm capable of taking care of the youths,'' Graham
says. ``I'm no longer thinking that way no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Places I be in the street, where I used to be there, I don't
go there no more,'' he stammers. ``I put myself in school, you
know. I've been doing everything positive.''

 NEW YORK: everything positive.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jones concludes his questioning, and Ms. Steinhagen, the foster
agency's lawyer, wastes little time. After debating with Graham
exactly how many years he has spent in jail, she settles into a
simple, and devastating, line of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true that in 1973 you were convicted of robbery?'' she
asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true that in 1975 you were convicted of forcible entry
with a deadly weapon?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Graham's face twitches, Ms. Steinhagen retraces a criminal
history, conviction by conviction. Fifteen guilty pleas or
convictions over 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   Each question seems to drive a stake into Graham. His answers _
a grudging ``yes'' each time _ shift from defiant to angry to
beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination by Molina, the children's law guardian, is
brief and also damaging. Graham leaves the stand and stares at the
floor as he shuffles to his seat.
</P>
<P>
   After perfunctory concluding arguments, Judge Martinez-Perez
says she is prepared to rule. Although she recognizes the efforts
Graham has made, she says the interests of the children are of
primary importance. After years of tumult, the boys deserve
consistency in their lives. She ends bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come ``to set these children on a course of
stability,'' she says. ``I grant the petition to terminate Graham's
rights as a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   In one fluid motion, Graham stands, grabs his diplomas and
storms out of the courtroom. He would later admit that, for a
moment, he was seized by his old instinct to lash out, to be
violent. He speaks with Jones about an appeal and holds his tongue
until he is inside the elevator. Boiling with rage, he curses the
court and the adoption agency, but most of all he curses his
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times am I going to be punished for what I did?'' he
later thunders. ``This is what I get for doing the right thing!''
</P>
<P>
   A Steady Course And a Night Job
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, Graham graduated from his job-training program. He is
off welfare and has held down an $8-an-hour job for a month,
working the graveyard shift for a Manhattan printing company.
MaryAnne Flynn, his drug counselor, says he shows no signs of
relapsing. His anger with the judge's ruling still simmers, but he
has stayed in control.
</P>
<P>
   He filed an appeal to block his sons' adoption on April 12. He
chose to work nights, he says, ``so I can have the days free, so I
can do what I need to do in court. I still want them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever delicate mix of forces is holding him together _ fear
of jail, a desire to regain custody of his sons, his love for
Cookie, Narcotics Anonymous or his counselor, Ms. Flynn _ remains
stronger than the roadblocks confronting him. For now, he is
beating his demon.

JORDAN SEEKING RELAXATION TECHNIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Michael Jordan recalled being one of the last players
to board the team plane in 1993. The Chicago Bulls were off to
Phoenix for a Game 6 they had not envisioned after failing to
clinch their third straight title at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got on the plane with a cigar and celebrated a little bit
and got everybody else to enjoy themselves, relax a little bit and
play the game,'' Jordan said, referring to how he alleviated some
of the pressure the Bulls would face against the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Tomorrow, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, the Bulls find themselves in a similar
predicament. They have a three-games-to-two lead in the NBA finals,
but Karl Malone and the Utah Jazz canceled Chicago's confetti
shower on Friday night by pulling out Game 5, 83-81.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes after Jordan's last-second 3-pointer did not draw
iron, five United Center employees walked across the floor with the
franchise's world championship trophies, preparing to pack them
away for another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we blew our opportunity,' Jordan said. ``This happened
to us before. My job as a leader is still to maintain the positive
thought process that it takes to go into a road game and come out
with a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, how do I that? I don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no place in the National Basketball Association like
the Delta Center, a closed-in, cacophony of sound where the Jazz
has gone 44-7 this season. Chicago was a mediocre 25-16 on the road
during the regular season, and the Bulls have lost four of their
last five playoff games in visiting arenas _ including all three to
the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their job will not only be to phase out a hostile crowd,
but also to try to get over a Game 5 hangover. They seemed on their
way in the first half, holding Utah to 30 points with the same
stingy defense that paved their way to a 3-1 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   But then Jordan and Scottie Pippen began missing shots, unable
to go to the rim without a purple jersey in their way. They missed
31 shots between them and received no help from Luc Longley (six
points, three turnovers).
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hornacek, assigned to Jordan duty for much of the series,
did not match up against Jordan at all in Game 5. Instead, Coach
Jerry Sloan turned to the quicker Bryon Russell. When Jordan put
the ball on the floor, another Jazz defender helped out.
</P>
<P>
   And for once in five games, not a single Bull could distract
Karl Malone on offense. He scored 39 points and hit a clutch
baseline jump shot with 53.3 seconds left to give Utah a four-point
cushion and interrupt Chicago's parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was just a lot of distractions, that sort of took
our focus away from what we had to do tonight,'' Pippen said
afterward of the pre-game revelry.
</P>
<P>
   Asked the team's mood after Game 5, Pippen said: ``It was quiet,
pretty much. We know what we have to do now. We have to go there
and win a game on their court.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson would not blame the championship preparation
for his team's ills. Instead, he chose congested traffic from the
suburbs into the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we were concerned just driving to work,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us two hours to come down to work. We knew it was
going to be a difficult game to get going, because of the
transportation problems that were out there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Bulls had worse problems driving to the basket on Friday.
For one of the few times in the past week, they met resistance. The
Jazz, an accommodating team that once acted as if it did not want
to rankle NBA royalty and felt no shame in losing to Jordan,
finally began to play with the same emotion and precision that won
the West.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be the last days of the dynasty, Jordan has another
great challenge before him: winning one game on another team's
floor for his sixth title in eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to play a good game and get everybody involved,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to try to make sure our defense continues to play solid.''
</P>
<P>
   After loosening up the Bulls on the team flight to Phoenix in
1993, Jordan kept up his playful demeanor in the most tense moments
of Chicago's season. Walking onto the team bus before that Game 6,
he greeted his teammates with a sarcastic, ``Hello, world champs.''
</P>
<P>
   They laughed and won their third straight title.
</P>
<P>
   After so many games and so many seasons of inventing new
challenges and creating motivation, what can he possibly come up
with this time?

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSES LAKE, Wash. _ Well before the school shootings in Oregon
and the South prompted a search to the depths of the national soul,
a 14-year-old honors student named Barry Loukaitis walked into his
algebra class in this hard little farm town and shot his teacher in
the back and two students in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Guns and violent videos were always around the boy's house. He
learned how to fire weapons from his father. And he picked up a
pose from the Oliver Stone movie ``Natural Born Killers,'' telling
a friend it would be ``pretty cool'' to go on a killing spree just
like the two lead characters in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black and armed with three of the family firearms,
Barry entered Frontier Middle School in this desert town 180 miles
east of Seattle on Feb. 2, 1996, and turned his guns loose on
fellow ninth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sure beats algebra, doesn't it,'' Barry said, according
to court records, as he stood over a dying boy who was choking on
his own blood. He was tackled by a teacher and hauled off to jail,
where he promptly took a nap.
</P>
<P>
   A sign soon appeared on a nearby school, bearing a single word:
Why? Of late, that question has been asked around the United
States, following a spate of multiple-victim school shootings over
the last nine months that have left 15 people dead and 42 wounded.
People wonder whether something aberrant and terrifying _ like a
lethal virus, some have called it _ is in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   While precise answers may be elusive, the recent killing sprees
share a remarkable number of common traits. The first of the rural,
multiple-victim student shootings, here in Moses Lake, looks in
many respects like a road map of what was to come. From this case
and interviews with police officers, prosecutors, psychologists and
parents of the attackers _ as well as the boys' own words _ several
patterns emerge:
</P>
<P>
   _ Each case involved a child who felt inferior or picked on,
with a grudge against some student or teacher. The attackers
complained of being fat or near-sighted, short or unloved _ the
ordinary problems of adolescence, at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, most of the assailants were suicidal, and of
above-average intelligence, according to mental-health experts who
have examined most of the children arrested for the shootings.
Their killings are now viewed by some criminologists and other
experts as a way to end a tortured life with a blaze of terror.
</P>
<P>
   _ The killers were able to easily acquire high-powered guns, and
in many cases, their parents helped the children get them, either
directly or through negligence. Guns with rapid-fire capability,
usually semiautomatic rifles that can spray a burst of bullets in a
matter of seconds, were used in the incidents with the most
victims. Single-fire, bolt-action guns or revolvers would not have
caused nearly as much damage in human life, the police say.
</P>
<P>
   _ To varying degrees, each of the attackers seemed to have been
obsessed by violent pop culture. A 14-year-old in West Paducah,
Ky., was influenced by a movie in which a character's classmates
are shot during a dream sequence, according to detectives. Violent
rap lyrics may have influenced one of the boys in the Jonesboro,
Ark., case, his mother says. In particular, a song about a stealth
killing eerily matches what occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The killer who has confessed in Pearl, Miss., says he was a fan
of violent fantasy video games and the nihilistic rock 'n' roll
lyrics of Marilyn Manson, as was the boy charged in the
Springfield, Ore., shootings last month. The Springfield youth was
so enmeshed in violent television and Internet sites that his
parents recently unplugged the cable television and took away his
computer, a close family friend said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The student killers gave ample warning signs, often in
detailed writings at school, of dramatic, violent outbursts to
come. The boy in Moses Lake wrote a poem about murder, saying,
``I'm at my point of no return.'' Similar jottings were left by the
boys in the South, and in Springfield. In virtually all of the
cases, adults never took the threats and warning signs seriously.
Or they simply overlooked them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the overall pattern, it's a pretty serious
wake-up call,'' said Dr. Ronald Stephens, executive director of the
National School Safety Center, which monitors school violence from
its headquarters in Westlake Village, Calif. ``We are seeing an
increasing number of violent, callous, remorseless juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's behind it,'' Stephens said, ``seems to be a combination
of issues that range from the availability of weapons to the
culture our kids immerse themselves in to the fact that many
youngsters simply have no sense of the finality of death.''
</P>
<P>
   People argue, in the age-old debate, that the killers are simply
bad human beings or that their actions can be linked to a corrosive
family environment _ nature vs. nurture. Certainly, the recent
shootings give plenty of new material for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of the young killers place blame on the surfeit of guns,
the influence of junk culture and children stressed to a snapping
point. But they also look at themselves, their broken marriages,
their lives of stress and hurry, and wonder how all that affected
their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about Barry at all,'' said JoAnn Phillips, the
mother of Barry Loukaitis in Moses Lake, in court testimony last
year in her son's case. A few weeks before the shooting, she had
told her son that she planned to divorce her husband and that she
herself was suicidal, but she was oblivious to how this would
affect her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are responsible for our kids, but you tell me, where did I
go wrong?'' Gretchen Woodward said in a interview recently in which
she discussed her son, Mitchell Johnson, the seventh-grader
accused, along with Andrew Golden, of killing five and wounding 10
in Jonesboro last March. ``I think there's a lot more pressure on
our kids today than there was when we were growing up.''

<P>
   The Killings
</P>
<P>
   Urban Trend Takes Rural Turn
</P>
<P>
   Children have long killed children in the United States. The
peak was the 1992-93 school year, when nearly 50 people were killed
in school-related violence, according to the School Safety Center.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those killings were in urban schools, and prompted a
federal law banning guns from schools, security measures like metal
detectors, and efforts to control the influence of gangs. What is
different now is that the shootings are largely rural, have
multiple victims and, within the warped logic of homicide, seem to
make no sense; many of the victims have been shot at random.
</P>
<P>
   In looking at the 221 deaths at American schoolyards over the
last six years, what leaps out is how the shootings changed
dramatically in the last two years _ not the number, but the type.
</P>
<P>
   Most earlier deaths were gang related, or they were stabbings,
or they involved money or a fight over a girlfriend. (Boys are
almost always the killers.) Then came the Moses Lake shooting in
1996. Barry Loukaitis, who confessed to the shootings and was found
guilty as an adult in trial last fall, did have a target in mind
when he walked into the afternoon algebra class _ a popular boy who
had teased him. He shot the boy dead.
</P>
<P>
   But then he fired away at two other students, people against
whom he said he had no grudge. He shot the teacher, Leona Caires,
in the back. She died with an eraser still in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in a tape-recorded session with police why he shot
the others, Barry said: ``I don't know. I guess reflex took over.''
</P>
<P>
   After Moses Lake, shootings of a somewhat similar nature
followed. In February 1997 in Bethel, Alaska, a boy armed with a
12-gauge shotgun that had been kept unlocked around the home killed
a popular athlete, fired shots at random and then tracked and
killed the principal. Like Barry, the 16-year-old Alaskan killer
thought it would be ``cool,'' prosecutors said, to shoot up the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved what he did,'' said Renee Erb, who prosecuted the
youth, Evan Ramsey. ``This was his moment of glory.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, the killings seemed to come with
numbing sameness. All but one of the victims apparently were chosen
at random in the shootings outside a high school in Pearl, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aiming at anyone else,'' said Luke Woodham, convicted
last week in the shootings, in a tape-recorded confession played at
his trial in Hattiesburg, Miss. ``It was like I was there, and I
wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   In West Paducah, Ky., three girls were killed and five other
students wounded in a shooting with no apparent motive. ``It was
kind of like I was in a dream,'' the accused attacker, 14-year-old
Michael Carneal, told his principal.
</P>
<P>
   In March, an 11-year-old steeped in gun culture and a
13-year-old with a troubled past opened fire, in what seemed like a
military assault, at students who filed out of Westside Middle
School in Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   And finally in Springfield last month _ where a boy with a love
of guns is accused of mowing down as many students as possible in
the crowded school cafeteria, using a semiautomatic rifle taken
from his father _ the victims were anyone who happened to be in the
way, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   People ask why this is now happening in white, rural areas, said
Dr. Alan Unis, a University of Washington psychiatrist who did an
examination of the Moses Lake assailant for the court. ``It's
happening everywhere,'' he said. ``One of the things we're seeing
in the population at large is that all the mood disorders are
happening earlier and earlier. The incidence of depression and
suicide has gone way up among young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Suicide rates for the young have increased over the last four
decades and have leveled off near their all-time highs. More than
1.5 million Americans under age 15 are seriously depressed, the
National Institute of Mental Health says. The number may be twice
as high, in the view of the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attackers in the recent cases had shown signs of
clinical depression or other psychological problems. But schools,
strapped for mental health counselors, are less likely to pick up
on such behavior or to have the available help, principals at the
schools where the shootings happened said.
</P>
<P>
   The Guns
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Children and Easy Access
</P>
<P>
   A depressed, insecure child is one thing, and quite common. But
that same boy with a gun can be a lethal threat. In all of the
recent shootings, acquiring guns was easier than buying beer, or
even gas. And these children armed themselves with small arsenals,
as if preparing for battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Moses Lake assailant used to play at home with his family
guns as if they were toys, friends testified in court. In his
confession, Barry Loukaitis said he took two of his father's guns
from an unlocked cabinet, and a third one _ a .25-caliber
semiautomatic pistol _ from a family car.
</P>
<P>
   The gun used in the Alaska school shootings was kept unlocked at
the foot of the stairs in a foster home where Evan Ramsey was
living, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings in West Paducah, Jonesboro and Springfield were
similar in that semiautomatic weapons _ capable of firing off
dozens of rounds in under a minute _ were used to kill children.
Weapons of less rapid-fire capability would likely have reduced the
death tolls, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jonesboro and Springfield, the parents of the accused
assailants followed the general advice of the National Rifle
Association and taught their children, at an early age, how to use
guns properly. The story of how Andrew Golden, accused in the
Jonesboro shooting, was given a gun by Santa Claus at age 6, and
was an expert marksman in the Practical Pistol Shooters Club a few
years later has been widely reported.
</P>
<P>
   But less well-known is how the other accused Jonesboro killer
came by his knowledge of guns. Mitchell Johnson's mother, Mrs.
Woodward, said in an interview that she taught her boy how to shoot
a shotgun, and then he took a three-week course.
</P>
<P>
   When the boys were arrested after hitting 15 human targets at
Westside Middle School, police found nine guns in their possession.
Most of them had been taken from the home of Andrew's grandfather,
Doug Golden, a conservation officer who says he usually kept his
guns unlocked in the house.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Kipland Kinkel, the boy accused of the
Springfield shootings, were not gun enthusiasts, but their son was,
according to interviews with family friends. The parents agonized
over the boy's gun obsession, finally giving in and buying him a
weapon. The father and son took courses in marksmanship and safety,
and the guns were kept under lock and key.
</P>
<P>
   But given Kip Kinkel's moods and temper, the parents had debated
over whether to get him a single-loading bolt-action weapon or
something with more rapid-fire capability. They settled on the more
powerful gun, a .22-caliber semiautomatic Ruger rifle. It was a
fatal mistake, according to some people who are studying the recent
shootings. It was that rifle that Kip used to fire off 50 rounds at
Thurston High School.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid had them by the throat,'' said Dr. Bill Reisman, who
profiles deviant youth behavior for law-enforcement officials and
recently gave a closed-door briefing to community leaders from
cities where the school shootings occurred. ``They were terrified
of his interest in guns, but they went out and bought him guns.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kinkel family friend, Tom Jacobson, who played tennis every
other week with the boy's father, said the parents were looking for
a way to control and connect with their volatile child. The
parents, Bill and Faith Kinkel, were both killed by their son,
prosecutors in Oregon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were devoted parents in a tight-knit family,'' Jacobson
said in an interview. ``Bill had tried everything with Kip. I think
he just ran out of ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Culture
</P>
<P>
   Too Influenced by Music and Film?
</P>
<P>
   Just as easy to get as guns were videos or cassettes in which
murder is a central theme, and often glorified. Jurors in the trial
of Barry Loukaitis were shown a Pearl Jam video, ``Jeremy,'' about
a youth who fantasizes about using violence against classmates who
taunt him. That video, along with ``Natural Born Killers,'' a movie
about a pair who kill their parents and then go on nationwide
shooting spree, were among Barry's favorites, his friends
testified.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the boys accused in the Jonesboro attack,
Mitchell Johnson, was a big fan of gangsta rap. Friends and
relatives say a favorite song was one by Bone Thugs-n-Harmony,
called, ``Crept and We Came,'' about killings.
</P>
<P>
   The boy also played Mortal Kombat, a popular video game that
involves graphic killing of opponents, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many cultural forces predisposing kids to violent
behavior,'' said the Rev. Chris Perry, a youth minister for
Mitchell Johnson at Central Baptist Church, who has talked to the
boy three times since the shootings. ``There is a profound cultural
influence, like gravity, pulling kids into a world where violence
is a perfectly normal way to handle our emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell also loved gospel music, the preacher said, and he
sang for elderly people at nursing homes. Millions of children
listen to violent-themed rap music, play Mortal Kombat and witness
killings on television, and do not become murderers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Loukaitis was obviously influenced by `Natural Born
Killers,''' said John Knodell, who prosecuted the Moses Lake
assailant. ``But there are hundreds of thousands of kids who watch
these things and don't blow away their schoolmates.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrist in the Loukaitis case, Unis, also is reluctant
to blame violent cultural influences. But he and other experts say
there is a syndrome at work in which a child who sees a shootout on
the news may be inspired to try something similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media or violent videos do not by themselves make the
event happen,'' said Ms. Erb, the prosecutor in Alaska. ``But it
shows them a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Signs
</P>
<P>
   Cries for Help Often Overlooked
</P>
<P>
   The boys accused of shooting classmates are inevitably portrayed
as average children. But a look inside their bedrooms or their
journals, or a discussion with their friends shows they left ample
clues of trouble to come.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carneal was known as a slight boy who played baritone
sax in the school band in West Paducah, the son of an elder in the
local Lutheran church. After the killings, his principal, Bill
Bond, looked at some of his notebook writings and found a child who
felt weak and powerless, with an angry desire to lash out at the
world.
</P>
<P>
   About a week before the shooting, Michael warned several
classmates that ``something big was going to happen'' and they
should get out of the way, detectives said. At least three of the
boys accused in other cases did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaskan assailant warned specific students the night before
the killings to go up on a second-floor balcony. ``These kids
didn't tell anyone,'' said the prosecutor, Ms. Erb. ``Instead, they
got right up there the next day to get their view of the
killings.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ninth-grade English class, Barry Loukaitis wrote a poem
about murder that ended this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at his body on the floor,
</P>
<P>
   Killing a bastard that deserves to die,
</P>
<P>
   Ain't nothing like it in the world,
</P>
<P>
   But he sure did bleed a lot''
</P>
<P>
   Kip Kinkel read a journal entry aloud in his English class about
killing fellow students.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attackers were also suicidal, writing notes before
the killings that assumed they would die.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Woodham's journal writings from Mississippi were
particularly graphic. He left a last will and testament, leaving
music cassettes to the older boy who is said by police to have
influenced him. ``I do this to show society, `Push us and we will
push back,''' he wrote. ``I suffered all my life. No one ever truly
loved me. No one ever truly cared about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reisman said parents and teachers should be alarmed by such
writings. Animal abuse, arson and a sudden interest in death and
darkness are red flags, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Often the assailants live in the shadow of successful older
siblings, Reisman added. But the most common element is deep
depression, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll all have depression, in the state in which they do
these things,'' Reisman said. ``When they're cornered, the first
thing they say is `Kill me.' It's suicide by cop.''

The Music Palace, New York's last Chinese-language theater, in
Chinatown, is set to be demolished and replaced by an office
building. Like many newcomers, immigrants from China once relied on
movies in their native tongue as a bridge between old country and
new. As the immigrants became more familiar with their adopted
country, their adopted country became more comfortable with them.
And eventually, the specialty theaters lost much of their
relevance. The growing popularity of videotapes is partly to blame,
along with Chinese cable television programs. (Andrea Mohin/New

Belfast serves as a reminder of the long conflict. Some experts
emphasize that justifiable hope must still be tempered with
skepticism -- that if the politicians do not move ahead toward new
governmental panels to carry out the agreement, voters -- and

WORLD BOWL ENDS SEASON OF HARD SELL FOR NFL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Texas, Fla.)  (lb) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ While most of Europe is fixated on the
World Cup soccer matches in Paris, Mario Bailey's future may well
hang on what happens at a very different football championship here
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who comes from Seattle, is the starting wide receiver
for the Frankfurt Galaxy, one of six teams in the National Football
League of Europe. For the past four years, he has played
professional American football in a country where he does not speak
the language and where most people remain baffled about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his teammates, most of them Americans, Bailey spends
three months a year in a Holiday Inn and flies to games in Spain,
the Netherlands, Britain and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey earns about $1,000 a game, on top of his living expenses,
and has become remarkably popular among Frankfurt fans who have
nicknamed him Super Mario. But his only real goal is to play
professional football back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going out on the field, and the guys are all calling me
`old man,''' Bailey, 27, said before a practice session on
Thursday. ``I used to be the young guy here, and now they're
calling me old.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday marks a crucial turning point. In a game that is expected
to draw about 45,000 spectators to Wald Stadium here, the Galaxy
will face the Rhine Fire from Duesseldorf in the National Football
League's European title game, known as the World Bowl. If things go
well, Bailey has a chance of being signed by an NFL team at home.
If they don't, he plans to hang up his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will also be important for the NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the National Football League reorganized and
relaunched what used to be called the World League, the title game
is expected to attract more spectators than any game yet.
</P>
<P>
   But American football has been a hard sell in Europe, and with
the exception of Germany, where U.S. military bases helped spark an
interest in American sports, the game is catching on very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In Frankfurt, which was surrounded by U.S. Air Force and Army
bases throughout the Cold War and still has a big American
population, the Galaxy draws about 30,000 spectators a game.
Indeed, team officials say the German teams are making a profit and
they draw heavy attention from local radio and newspapers. SAT 1, a
national television network, now broadcasts a weekly half-hour
program of Galaxy highlights.
</P>
<P>
   But the other teams _ the Barcelona Dragons, the London
Monarchs, the Amsterdam Admirals and the Edinburgh Claymores _ have
had more trouble. Attendance in those cities is less than 10,000 a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest challenge is to put down roots,'' said Oliver
Luck, president of the NFL Europe and a former quarterback for the
Houston Oilers. ``We need the average guy in the street to care
about what happens to his team. We need people to have emotional
involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been progress. Luck said that league revenues _ from
ticket sales, television rights and sponsorships _ climbed about 70
percent this year to $20 million. That is still in the red, and
Luck said he did not expect the league to make a profit for another
three or four years.
</P>
<P>
   The losses are made up by the NFL franchises in the United
States, which view the NFL Europe partly as a farm league and
partly as a potential source of future income.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the obvious cultural barriers, both players and
executives say the league is struggling between conflicting goals.
On the one hand, the league wants high-caliber play, but that means
relying heavily on American players, who tend not to stay as long.
On the other hand, league officials want to foster fan loyalty,
which would mean using more local players whom the fans could
identify with more easily than an American who drops in for a year
or two.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American players overwhelmingly outnumber local players and
receive the lion's share of glory. There are no European
quarterbacks in the NFL Europe, and it is rare to have even two
European players on the field at one time.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, many of the best American players are athletes
who are already under contract with NFL teams in the United States,
and those athletes usually return to those teams after one or two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to alleviate the problem, the NFL Europe requires
that at least seven out of 45 players on each roster come from the
home country. The teams are also required to have at least one
national player on the field during every other series of plays.
</P>
<P>
   In another tactic to boost the role of local players, Luck has
actively recruited a number of well-known but retired soccer
players for the role of kicker. The most famous example is Manfred
Burgsmueller, now 49, who was the fourth-leading scorer in
Germany's soccer league. Burgsmueller has been the Rhein Fire's
kicker for three years now.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the problems, many American players say playing in
Europe is better than sitting on a bench in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get into any regular-season games,'' said Damon
Huard, the 24-year-old quarterback for the Galaxy who is injured
and will not play Sunday. He was allocated to the league from the
Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get more game time here, and there's no substitute for
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not here for the money, you're here for the work and
the chance to polish your game. If you're dream is to play in the
NFL there aren't too many ways to get there.''

   (NYT8) NEW YORK -- June 13, 1998 -- NY-CHINESE-THEATER, 6-13 --
The Music Palace, New York's last Chinese-language theater, in
Chinatown, is set to be demolished and replaced by an office
building. Like many newcomers, immigrants from China once relied on
movies in their native tongue as a bridge between old country and
new. As the immigrants became more familiar with their adopted
country, their adopted country became more comfortable with them.
And eventually, the specialty theaters lost much of their
relevance. The growing popularity of videotapes is partly to blame,
along with Chinese cable television programs. (Andrea Mohin/New

   (NYT7) BELFAST, Northern Ireland -- June 13, 1998 --
NIRELAND-PEACE, 6-13 -- Protestants and Catholics are cautiously
adjusting to the idea of a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. A
loyalist mural on the Shankill Road in the heart of Protestant West
Belfast serves as a reminder of the long conflict. Some experts
emphasize that justifiable hope must still be tempered with
skepticism -- that if the politicians do not move ahead toward new
governmental panels to carry out the agreement, voters -- and
gunners -- could change their minds. (Carlos Lopez-Barillas/New

   (NYT6) SALT LAKE CITY -- June 13, 1998 -- BAPTIST-MORMONS, 6-13
-- Southern Baptist students praying before going door-to-door to
bring their message to a neighborhood in Salt Lake City. While
holding their annual convention here last week, about 3,000
volunteers also began a weeklong effort to bring an evangelical
Protestant message to the 2 million inhabitants of Greater Salt
Lake, Mormon and non-Mormon alike. Conversions topped 1,000 after a
week of effort by the volunteers. (Monica Almeida/New York Times

Colin Powell, the retired general and former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, talking to supporters in Tampa. Powell, now the
unpaid leader of America's Promise, a volunteer organization that
benefits youths at risk of a wayward life, travels throughout the
U.S. singing the effort's praises. Powell, who often cites figures
showing that 15 million children are at risk of following a wayward
path, says he took on the mission to help steer them away from
trouble because there is no greater obligation than helping young
people on society's margins. (Phillippe Diederich/New York Times

CALIF-BILINGUAL-FOE, 6-13 -- Ron Unz, 36, left, the man who beat
bilingual education in the nation's most populous state with
Proposition 227, with an acquaintance. Unz, who owns a software
company in the Silicon Valley, does not have a particularly strong
personal connection to the issue of bilingual education. Unz,
unmarried and childless and has never set foot in a bilingual
classroom. Unz says he is driven by a pure conviction that
bilingual education, as a method of acclimating children into
English, defies both logic and test scores, and that the current
system is flawed. ``It's nice to be able to fix broken things,'' he
says. (Peter DaSilva/New York Times Photo)

KASHMIR-CONTROVERSY, 6-13 -- Brig. Haider Khan, who commands
Pakistani troops in the Jhelum River valley, tracks Indian troops
in the mountains behind him every day. ``This is very tough
terrain,'' he says, pointing from his bunker to an Indian strong
point. ``Good for the defense.'' For Pakistan, the subcontinent's
nuclear arms race and the attendant hand-wringing by the great
powers has brought an unexpected boon: Kashmir, a cause
long-forgotten by the world, has suddenly moved to the top of the
international agenda. (John Kifner/New York Times Photo) (See also

in Bridgeview. Salah's niece, far left, and three children also
attended the rally. Prosecutors have not charged Salah with a
crime, but law enforcement officials say their investigation could
lead to his indictment and that they have evidence that accounts in
seven Illinois financial institutions worth nearly $1.5 million,
are being used illegally by Salah to underwrite the Hamas war of
terror. (Lloyd DeGrane/New York Times Photo)

REAL ESTATE: CONNECTICUT TOWNS IMPLEMENT RIDGE-LINE DEVELOPMENT
LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELEANOR CHARLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Traveling along Interstate 91, some motorists tend to
slow down as they gaze at the 44 mountains that pass through 30
communities along the central corridor of Connecticut from the
Massachusetts border almost to Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic gesture to cooperate in the preservation of these
mountains, called the Trap Rock Ridges, 17 towns in their path
signed an agreement called the Metacomet Ridge Conservation Compact
last April 22, Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily wooded and largely inaccessible, most of the ridges are
undeveloped, visited only by intrepid hikers on the Metacomet and
Mattabesett Trails along the crest. That dry, rocky environment is
home to the rare electric blue skink lizard, the falcate
orange-tipped butterfly, prickly pear cactus, stands of Torrey's
mountain mint and delicate purple hair grass.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the relentless push of housing development has begun
creeping up some of the mountains, sending the towns scrambling to
implement a 1995 state law allowing them to restrict development on
the ridges. The measure was co-sponsored by Rep. Mary Mushinsky of
Wallingford and State Sen. Thomas Gaffey of Meriden, both
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Several towns have worked on new regulations, and among the
compact towns Meriden, Durham, Berlin, Simsbury, Middletown and
Farmington have passed or are in the process of passing zoning that
limits or prohibits development within 150 feet of the tops of the
ridges.
</P>
<P>
   But before the regulations can be enforced maps must be drawn
detailing how and where development, clear-cutting of vegetation
and any new quarrying operations are to be restricted or
prohibited. Existing quarries are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the 17 compact communities _ Branford, North
Branford, Guilford, East Haven, Wallingford, Middlefield,
Plainville, West Hartford, Avon, Suffield and Bloomfield _ are
still wrestling with zoning proposals or adding to existing
limitations along their ridge lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage the towns to do what they can, whether through
purchase, regulations or donations,'' said Norman Zimmer, author of
the compact and a member of the Meriden Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, royalty and wealthy individuals have favored the
tops of mountains as strategic and awe-inspiring sites for castles,
fortifications and baronial mansions. But these ridges, said
Zimmer, ``must be preserved esthetically and recreationally''
because ``they are the Central Park of Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the ridges, said Mushinsky, ``goes back to
the dinosaur era, when they were formed. They rise above the rest
of the state _ a continuous series of parallel basalt ridges, which
at one time were lava. One side is a sheer scarp, the other side is
a slope, but rocky and difficult to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   The name trap rock, she believes, evolved from a Swedish word
trappa, meaning step, describing the configurations that formed
layers of basalt in the Jurassic and Triassic periods.

Connecticut's Blue Trail system.'' Existing development on the
ridges varies widely from none at all in Meriden, which is
surrounded by seven ridges, to about 30 homes built over several
years on Avon's ridges, where 10 additional houses have been
approved for construction and an additional eight are in the
approvals pipeline. They will be priced from $800,000 to $3
million. Stephen Kushner, Avon's town planner, said that the views
justified the prices.
</P>
<P>
   So far, restrictive measures have been hailed by townspeople who
regard the majestic chains of mountains as among their most
precious assets. In addition, ``they are major water-recharge
areas,'' said Zimmer. ``Water percolates down through the ridges to
reservoirs at the base of the mountains,'' he said, adding that
development could contaminate the water.
</P>
<P>
   But the new rulings are causing confusion and resentment among
individual ridge-land owners and developers who contend that their
holdings are being rendered worthless. Contractors, too, who have
been mining the century-old ridge quarries, crushing the rock to
build roads, houses, hospitals, storm sewers, schools and an
endless array of construction projects are suddenly concerned about
future supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stone that's mined in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New
Hampshire is the best in the world,'' said Joseph LaRosa, owner of
LaRosa Construction in Meriden. ``Perhaps they could designate
certain areas for new quarries'' _ a practice, quarriers say, that
has been followed in some Western states.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Francoline, a developer in Avon and chairman of the
Connecticut Developers' Council, is concerned that ``building
materials in this part of the country are extremely expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will be a lot more expensive,'' he said, ``to bring
stone in from elsewhere, adding to fuel consumption and
pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Meriden's City Council approved the new zoning last year, based
on a model set of regulations that conforms to the 1995 state
statute and was distributed to all the towns. But the city's
Planning and Zoning Commission rejected the Council's map of some
30 affected properties, the final step required to put the
regulations into practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stated that we ought to work on compensation for property
owners,'' said Stephen Zerio, chairman of the Economic Development
Committee of the Council.
</P>
<P>
   Compensation promises to be a major bone of contention. ``I need
to be compensated for five acres on which I pay $350 a year in
taxes,'' said Ross Gulino, a landowner and developer. Taxes on
undeveloped ridge land in Meriden, designated by the town as excess
land, are extremely low. and levied at a fraction of the full rate.
Assessor Steven Hodgetts said ``one person is paying $25 a year on
three acres, another with 315 acres is paying $14.50 an acre,'' or
$4,567.50.
</P>
<P>
   Gulino contends that ``pretty much all'' of his five acres are
within 150 feet of the top. ``I planned to market it as a single
lot or maybe three lots,'' he said. ``If the legislation goes
through I will wind up with 50 feet or less, not enough to build
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, as vice president of BRG Realty, a family-owned firm,
he was a principal in the purchase of a predeveloped subdivision of
40 lots on 41 acres at the base of the mountain, plus the remainder
of the slope including the top parcel. Fifteen lots at the base
sold for $60,000 to $100,000 each. ``Lots at the top would have
added value because of the view,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline Travers, a Meriden widow with 20 acres, lives on the
lower half. The rest is within 150 feet of the summit. The new
zoning, she said, ``will devalue my land _ it won't be very salable
for me or my children.'' Disturbed by what she perceives as
insensitivity on the part of thousands of people who favor the new
zoning, she said ``they don't own _ they just like to look at the
view.'' No doubt a protracted period of adjustment and probably a
spate of lawsuits is in store as the various towns struggle to
create regulations that will pass muster at the state level. Of the
towns that adopted new zoning, Berlin does not allow quarrying and
prohibits development higher than 350 feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   Simsbury does not allow clear-cutting and requires replacement
of trees in some cases, and Middletown may limit houses to one
story or require moving them to lower ground if they interfere with
views of the ridge line. Farmington, where development has produced
some clear-cutting and ``houses that stick out when you look up at
the ridge,'' according to Elizabeth Dolphin, assistant planning
director, is trying to deal with existing regulations that have
produced disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Branse, a Glastonbury lawyer who drew up the model
regulations for the 17 compact towns, said that most of the
confusion comes from flawed interpretations of the model and
ignorance of the state statute. On the subject of compensation, he
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``General law states that government may regulate land use to
protect the public welfare, but it cannot regulate it down to where
it has no value. Any regulation will cause diminution of value.
What is reasonable is what courts debate regularly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers of ridge land knew it was difficult to get up there and
to build on it,'' he continued. ``However, the regulations allow
what is deemed reasonable use of the property so as not to make it
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Gulino, he indicated that the courts might not
sanction compensation for losing the use of one piece of property
when the owner has sufficient property nearby that is viable and
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state statute only allows restriction,'' said Terry
Tondro, professor of law at the University of Connecticut. ``If a
town had a flat prohibition, affected landowners could go to the
state statute, which takes precedence. The statute was designed to
protect ridge lines, using the word restrict rather than
prohibit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of zoning is not the maximum enrichment of property
owners,'' said Branse, paraphrasing a Connecticut Supreme Court
decision.

 A FORD IN ITS PAST, A RESORT IN ITS FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LYN RIDDLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND HILL, Ga. _ Henry Ford came to a spit of land on the
Ogeechee River here nearly 75 years ago, and nothing has been the
same since.
</P>
<P>
   He bought every house and parcel he could, assembling some
70,000 acres on which to build a grand manor beside a bend in the
river, 14 miles from the Atlantic Ocean and 23 miles south of
Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   Then 65 and a millionaire many times over, Ford transformed a
malaria-infested backwater village known as a moonshine haven into
a prosperous town with healthy residents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a group of local investors has bought the 1,800 acres left
of Ford's estate (most of the original estate was sold to timber
companies) with the intention of developing a second-home resort
community. The emphasis will be on boating and golfing, and there
will be artists in residence to help home buyers pursue creative
hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Bluff Associates, a South Carolina investment group,
bought the property in March for $47 million from InterRedec, a
holding company once controlled by Ghaith Pharaon. In 1991,
Pharaon, of Saudi Arabia, was indicted in Washington, D.C., on
federal charges of fraud and racketeering relating to the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International scandal. He has never been tried
and remains a fugitive. Authorities believe he is in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Two principals in Sterling Bluff Associates are Peter Pollack
and William Dolan, who engineered a dramatic turnaround for Brays
Island, a former plantation turned resort near Beaufort, S.C., that
teetered on the brink of failure. They repositioned that property
as a hunting and sporting enclave and sold 265 lots in 18 months
for a total of $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the Ford Plantation development, Pollack and Dolan brought
in as their third director Stephen Schram, a former co-chairman of
the Boston Celtics who owns property at Brays Island.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly real estate salesmen on Hilton Head Island, S.C.,
Pollack and Dolan said they hoped to make careers of redeveloping
some of the former rice plantations left along the South Carolina
and Georgia coasts, many of which still belong to descendants of
the nation's great industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   Some that remain include the 18,000-acre Goodhope Plantation,
owned by the Pratt family (whose ancestor, John Pratt, was a
partner of John D. Rockefeller in Standard Oil of Ohio, now Exxon)
and Broad River, owned by the Marshall Field family. The DuPonts
still own property on the Coosaw River, while the Guggenheims own a
hunting camp in Yemassee, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Still standing on the Ford property is a rustic hunting lodge
that the auto manufacturer had built in a day at the suggestion of
his friend, Harvey Firestone, the tiremaker.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-hole golf course was built by InterRedec 13 years ago for
$11 million. Designed by Pete Dye, it has never before been played
by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35 bungalows, with prices starting at $650,000, will be
built beside the golf course. At the yacht basin installed to moor
Ford's cabin cruiser, Little Lulu _ made in the Ford carpentry shop
here, town houses will be built to mimic a Savannah square. In all,
60 will be built with prices at about $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred lots of two to six acres will cost from $300,000 to
$1 million depending on their proximity to the river. With the lot
will come a topographic and tree survey. Deed restrictions
stipulate that a house must be sited with an eye toward
conservation. The main house may not exceed 6,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   But, Pollack said, he did not expect size to be the governing
factor among his buyers. ``It's quality people want,'' he
explained, adding that 90 percent of the home sites would have
water views.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference between this development and Brays Island is
the partnership's plan to offer all ranges of home-building
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come down here they're scared to death about what
builder to get,'' said Dolan.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership hired Daniel G. Paquette to oversee the building
program. Paquette worked for 25 years on a host of restoration
projects in Newport, R.I., including the landmark Redwood Library
and Trinity Church, the latter overlooking Newport Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Home design will be overseen by a review board. Paquette said
homes would be expected to be ``sympathetic'' to Lowcountry
Georgian homes but not replicas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to respect the indigenous architecture but fit this
time,'' he said. ``We also have a burning desire to maintain the
parklike significance that exists here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots will go one sale next month.

<P>
   Since the 1500s, the pine thickets here at Ogeechee Neck have
been inhabited first by explorers from Spain, then France and
finally England. Eventually, the land would become the site of
Revolutionary War skirmishes and later a rice plantation.
</P>
<P>
   During the Civil War, Gen. William T. Sherman in his ``march to
the sea'' destroyed the plantation homes and rice mills along the
Ogeechee. But the avenue of live oaks survived the fires, and the
huge trees still line the drive to the main house that Ford and his
wife, Clara, built in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Ford owned 31 automobile assembly plants, as well
as mines and timberlands, and employed nearly half a million
people. Ford Motor Co. made not only cars but also aircraft. He
selected this obscure site as his winter home because he had what
he thought was a better idea for rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Firestone wanted to find a way to make rubber from
lettuce, which they knew would grow well here in the humid,
tropical climate. The two feared the British would corner the
rubber market and drive prices higher than they wanted to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Thomas A. Edison, they founded the Edison Botanic
Research Co. in Florida and later relocated it here on the
Ogeechee. By 1925, Ford began buying land here and lobbied to have
the town, then called Ways Station, renamed Richmond Hill _
combining the names of two plantations that he purchased, Richmond
and Cherry Hill.
</P>
<P>
   He dispatched doctors and nurses to cure malaria, hookworm,
typhoid and diphtheria among residents. He worked with drainage
specialists to eradicate swamps where insects bred disease. Then he
turned his attention to educating the people of the area. He
established schools for boys and girls alike to teach them
academics and a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Local girls worked in the Community House, where they learned
homemaking, cooking housekeeping and how to play hostess and took
dancing lessons as well. Built in 1937, the structure now houses a
funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who was a teetotaler, destroyed 250 stills in this area
known for its fine moonshine and built a sawmill and timber
operation where stills once stood. He built his employees houses in
the town, which today has a worn look despite the rapidly
developing residential subdivisions surrounding it. The area serves
as a suburb for Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, the Fords decided to build a house on the Ogeechee.
They paid $10,000 for a nearby plantation house, destroyed it and
used the bricks to build a two-story Georgian mansion with gracious
white columns. Historians in staid Savannah fought the demolition
but in the end, Ford won with a promise of an even grander home. It
was finished in 1938, and 55 surrounding acres were landscaped.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Bluff Associates intends to use the manor as guest
rooms for property owners and for a dining area. In the kitchen
will be a chef from 45 South, one of Savannah's finer restaurants.
to run the food operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of people here whose parents or
grandparents worked for Henry Ford,'' said Dolan, the Sterling
Bluff Associates principal. ``The mayor's dad is one.''

DISPARITY BETWEEN BASEBALL'S RICH AND POOR TEAMS CONTINUES TO GROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos are less than three weeks from their
self-appointed D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   Club president Claud Brochu has set June 30 as the deadline for
raising $250 million to build a downtown stadium. If a sufficient
number of luxury boxes and personal seat licenses aren't sold by
then, Brochu is threatening to sell the team to U.S. investors who
plan to move it to northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if the Pittsburgh Pirates, Minnesota Twins or Oakland
Athletics don't get there first. Baseball's economic turmoil is
liable to lead to a major collision of moving vans somewhere along
the Washington, D.C.-area Beltway in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about that,'' interim commissioner Bud Selig
said. ``We're very proud of the fact we haven't had a team move in
27 years, but, as I've said many times, you can't consign a team to
economic bankruptcy. We're going to try to make things work. But if
we have to move a club because they can't compete economically,
then we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   While meeting in Seattle last week, major-league baseball owners
needed only a few minutes to unanimously approve Tom Hicks as owner
of the Rangers. They spent much more time discussing the
ever-widening gap between the haves and the have-nots among
major-league franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Although Selig might profess a lack of concern, any fan
following a have-not team has plenty of concern. In the past three
years, teams with the highest payrolls have dominated baseball. Of
the teams that had the top four payrolls each of the past three
years, all but one reached the playoffs. This year, at the end of
May, 14 teams had more victories than losses. Eleven of those teams
were among the top 15 teams in salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a continuing problem in baseball,'' National League
president Leonard Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Brochu: ``Something has to be done because it's getting
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's only solution appears to be an all-out assault on
local taxpayer pocketbooks for the money to build ballparks. Those
who succeed expect to repeat the miracle in Cleveland, where Jacobs
Field turned a derelict franchise into a financial powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, people will have to have that type of facility
to have a realistic chance of competing,'' Rangers president Tom
Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Those having trouble convincing the local voters and politicos
immediately threaten a move to North Carolina, northern Virginia or
even Portland, Ore. where officials are mulling the possibility of
renovating a 70-year-old minor-league stadium to lure a
major-league franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles average 44,774 spectators per game at
Oriole Park at Camden Yards and can afford a $74.3 million payroll,
highest in baseball. The New York Yankees get $48.6 million a year
in local broadcasting revenues and have a $70.6 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Montreal Expos average 10,661 fans in cold,
barren Olympic Stadium and net about $2 million a year in local
broadcasting revenues. Their payroll is at a major-league-low $16
million, and they regularly trade their highest-paid players.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles owner Peter Angelos, while looking at a model of
Seattle's future stadium last week, said: ``If you have a facility
such as this, your success is pretty much assured, assuming the
demographics are there as well. Without that facility, there's no
way you can compete with teams that have them. But there has to be
a willingness in the community to build that facility. The
economics of baseball won't allow a franchise to build that
facility themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Prospective Florida Marlins owner Don Smiley said the club can't
survive in South Florida without a stadium with a retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no future in operating a ballclub under these
circumstances,'' Smiley said. ``Sooner or later, fans won't put up
with the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners are also trying other avenues to deal with skyrocketing
payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue sharing will transfer $125 million to $140 million from
the top six clubs to the bottom six the next two years. Baseball
continues to explore international marketing and broadcasting
opportunities, revenues that would be shared by all clubs. Clubs
are also allowed to go public with stock offerings, and the
Cleveland Indians, despite the success of Jacobs Field, were the
first to do so. Rangers owner Tom Hicks has said he is considering
such a move.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the Yankees can pull in $48.6 million annually in
local television revenues and not have to share it with anyone,
they'll have a significant competitive advantage on the rest of
baseball. Other owners can only shudder at what might happen if
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner can persuade New York to build
him a $1 billion ballpark in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not deep pockets,'' Mariners chairman John Ellis
said. ``The issue is finding some way to get more parity in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Brochu knows that even if he gets his 35,000-seat stadium,
there's no way he'll be able to compete with the Yankees for free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is we'll be able to keep our own players,''
Brochu said.
</P>
<P>
   The selling point for cities is the economic value that
ballparks bring to surrounding areas, especially downtown areas hit
hard by urban blight. Jacobs Field is a major centerpiece in the
renaissance of downtown Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Chema, executive director of the organization that oversaw
the building of Jacobs Field, said: ``In just admission tax, the
city of Cleveland on Jacobs Field had something in excess of $4
million in the general revenue fund last year. So there are ways to
measure the impact, and it is substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   But new ballparks aren't always the cure-all they're promised to
be. The Mariners are scheduled to move into their new ballpark next
year, but ``The Seattle Times'' has reported that the club will get
stuck for $70 million to $100 million in cost overruns. That can
eat into profits quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants are hoping for a bonanza from their
ballpark, scheduled to open in 2000. But they must first pay off
the $160 million loan on the place, and they're already borrowing
money to meet their payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox moved into the new Comiskey Park in 1991
and drew almost 3 million fans the first year. Now, they're
averaging 15,289 spectators per game and the stadium looks severely
outdated next to the architecturally inspired Camden Yards, Coors
Field and The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   It's also getting more difficult to convince voters to approve
hundreds of millions of dollars for new facilities, even though
Angelos and Schieffer insist that they can have major benefits to a
community.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area turned down the Giants on four referendums before
the club turned to private financing. Pittsburgh rejected a
publicly financed stadium last year, and the Minnesota Legislature
has thwarted all attempts by the Twins for a new ballpark. The
Marlins failed to stir interest in Miami, even after winning a
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the big-market clubs have a stunning change of heart
and agree to complete revenue sharing, struggling owners in
small-market towns feel they have no choice but to go begging for
new ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a utopia to solve all problems, but it's a must,''
Selig said. ``You're not going to change the media revenue streams,
but you have to change the game revenues. If you're playing in an
old ballpark, you negate the opportunity for new revenue streams.''

IN SOME AREAS $1 MILLION HOMES ARE BECOMING COMMONPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LISA PREVOST   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The million-dollar home _ a phrase that not long ago summoned up
images of mansions and perhaps even liveried servants _ has become
so commonplace in the most affluent New York suburbs that in some
communities more than half the homes now on the market are priced
above $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   A $1 million price tag, brokers say, no longer necessarily
implies luxury living. Rather, a $1 million house in some areas is
almost, well, ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the most sought-after sections of Greenwich, Conn.,
such as Belle Haven and Round Hill, $1 million is now considered
entry level, said Susan Hughes, vice president of David Ogilvy &AMP;
Associates and president of the Greenwich Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of
Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, describes the
phenomenon as a ``crowding into the winner's circle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving the market are baby boomers, who are entering their
peak earning years, raising families, and settling into the
communities where they want to be for the long haul,'' said Hughes,
who is not related to Susan Hughes. ``And so they're bidding up
prices in these areas.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While new luxury-home developments are common now throughout the
region, the proportion of $1 million-plus properties is still small
in most towns. But in a few areas, primarily those with established
reputations as comfortable havens for the well-to-do, sales of
homes for $1 million or more make up an increasingly significant
chunk of the market.
</P>
<P>
   These areas include Greenwich, New Canaan, Westport and Darien
in Connecticut; parts of Westchester County, including Scarsdale,
Rye and Larchmont; on Long Island, the villages on Nassau County's
North Shore, as well as the Hamptons in Suffolk County; portions of
central New Jersey, including Far Hills, Harding Township,
Bernardsville and Mendham Township, and the Saddle River area in
Bergen County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, what you're talking about is supply and demand,''
said Mrs. Hughes. ``There is such a demand for large family homes
with certain amenities that it pokes the prices up. And because
land prices are so high, people are also building larger homes and
expanding homes, so the high-end stock is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reflection primarily of the tremendous rise of value in
the stock market,'' said Lee E. Koppelman, director of the Center
for Regional Policy Studies at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for high-end housing in the suburbs is even more
pronounced now than it was during the region's last period of great
prosperity between 1979 and 1985, he said. And the high cost of
housing in Manhattan is a contributing factor. For those with $1
million or more to spend on housing, Koppelman said, ``it does
occur to people that they'll get an even bigger bang for their buck
by investing in an estate property in the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward buying more costly and larger homes appears to
have gained momentum. In Greenwich, for example, the average
selling time for houses priced between $1 million and $1.9 million
has dropped 40 percent since last year, to just 86 days, according
to Nancy A. MacDonald, manager of the Greenwich office of William
Pitt Real Estate. For houses priced above $2 million, the sale time
is down 30 percent, to 185 days, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of 1998, 49 homes sold for $1 million or
more in Greenwich, about 30 percent of all homes sold, according to
figures compiled by William Pitt. Ten years ago, only 17 homes, or
18 percent of first-quarter sales, were sold for more than $1
million. In 1984, the $1 million-plus percentage was zero in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I maintain that if you bought a house in Greenwich in the
early '80s, that was terrific,'' said Ms. MacDonald. ``If you
purchased for $200,000, $250,000 you could probably get $1.5
million for that house. And that's pretty darn good.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling on prices is lifting as well. A 24-room mansion on
the Greenwich waterfront sold this year for a record $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   The mansion, called Haroldlyn Manor, is a Georgian-style house
with a private yacht mooring on six acres. It was once a summer
home for Donald Trump, who purchased it for $3.7 million in 1984,
according to the Greenwich Town Assessor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A million dollars will buy you a comfortable family house in
Greenwich, but nothing fancy, nothing with extravagant amenities,''
said Mrs. Hughes. ``The fancy bedrooms, a finer kitchen, a very
large family room _ houses with these things are generally not
available under $1.4 million.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite the cost, houses just keep getting bigger,
noted Bernard Yudain, a longtime Greenwich resident who is a
columnist for the Greenwich Time newspaper. ``Even some of the big
old houses were never this big,'' he said. ``There used to be more
of a sense of proportion of house to lot size. Now we're seeing
huge houses on relatively small lots. I said the other day,
jokingly, that some of these buyers are bringing the wrecking ball
people to the closing with them.''

</P>
<P>
   Last Monday the Representative Town Meeting, citing concerns
about ``oversized houses,'' passed a resolution urging the Town
Planning and Zoning Commission to give the highest priority to
amending building and zoning regulations to develop ``appropriate''
floor-area ratios, lot sizes, coverage and setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwich is not the only affluent town where the wrecking ball
has been swinging. ``Fifty percent of buyers are looking for what's
here,'' said Joan Quigg, owner of Joan Quigg Realtors in Saddle
River. ``The other 50 percent is looking for what they can knock
down. That wonderful, classic Saddle River look, which was so
understated _ well, all that is now to buyers is just a beautiful
piece of land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very demanding,'' she added. ``They want high
ceilings, and a very, very good kitchen _ whether they do takeout
for the rest of their lives, it doesn't matter. They want a
wonderful master bedroom and bath, and a great room off the
kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the 53 properties currently on the market in
Saddle River are priced above $1 million. The shift toward more $1
million homes began in the 80's in Saddle River, Ms. Quigg said,
but then stopped during the economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The market picked up again in 1994, and has climbed upward
since, she said. Last year, the New Jersey Multiple Listing Service
recorded 25 sales above $1 million in Saddle River; according to
Ms. Quigg, as of May 31 this year, 13 had already sold in that
category. And new homes in Saddle River are selling for closer to
$2 million, she said. .
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, these buyers are making what Ms. Quigg described
as ``the leap to the big house.'' That is because, according to
brokers, the typical high-end buyers in the suburbs these days are
two-income couples with young children. And often they are
purchasing their first home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me my borrowers are getting younger,'' said Craig
Atkinson, a senior financial services officer with Sterling Capital
in Stamford. ``I'm amazed that people in their early 30s are buying
$1 million homes.''
</P>
<P>
   On a $1 million house, the usual loan amount would be about
$750,000, Atkinson said. ``The mortgage interest deduction is about
the only tax deduction any of us have anymore, so a lot of buyers
like to maximize the mortgage amount,'' he said, noting that
exceptions are often made to allow a mortgage of up to 80 percent
of the sale price for customers with adequate assets and income.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly payment on a $750,000 mortgage at a fixed, 30-year
rate of 7.375 percent, said Atkinson, is $5,180, $4,500 of which is
initially deductible as interest. Buyers who opt for an
adjustable-rate mortgage at a 6.625 interest rate for the first
five years pay $4,802 a month, he said, about $4,080 of which is
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Customers rarely borrow more than $1 million, Atkinson said,
because the maximum deduction allowed is interest accrued on a $1
million mortgage. An additional deduction is allowed for interest
on a second mortgage of up to $100,000. ``A lot of the really big
deals get done in cash or through private loans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All-cash deals are sometimes used as a negotiating tactic,
according to Sheila Rice, director of the Fine Homes Division of
Prudential Long Island Realty. Buyers offer to pay in cash as an
incentive for the seller to come down on the price. Once the deal
goes through, she said, they often refinance.
</P>
<P>
   The high-end market in her North Shore territory, which includes
both horse country and beach communities, is enjoying a tremendous
upswing after an extended slump that lasted well into 1996. ``Then,
you could list a home at $1.7 million and it would sell for under a
million,'' Mrs. Rice said. But prices are recovering rapidly, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
   According to data compiled by Prudential, as of June 1, 14
houses had sold for at least $1 million this year in the villages
of Brookville, Old Brookville, Upper Brookville, Matinecock, Mill
Neck, Muttontown, Lattingtown, Laurel Hollow, Lloyd Harbor, Lloyd
Neck, and Oyster Bay Cove. An additional 36 listed in that price
range are under contract, Mrs. Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Should they all come in at more than $1 million, she said, the
five-month total will have already surpassed the 1997 year-end
figure of 44 million-dollar sales. In the majority of the villages,
more than half the inventory is currently priced above $1 million,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Though the hamlet of Locust Valley in the town of Oyster Bay is
often perceived as the center of wealth on the North Shore, Mrs.
Rice pointed out that some of the most expensive homes in the area
are found in Lattingtown, the Brookvilles and Muttontown.
Generally, she said, the closer to Long Island Sound, the higher
the home prices.
</P>
<P>
   Million-dollar bank investment properties are moving
particularly quickly, she noted, because ``buyers think they're
getting a bargain on foreclosures.'' A recent example was a
12-year-old contemporary in Oyster Bay Cove with peeling paint, an
overgrown yard and a pool full of murky green water. A foreclosure
listed at $1.199 million, the property sold in a single weekend.
</P>
<P>
   North Shore properties often come with two or more acres of
land. In contrast, a half-acre is ``a lot of land'' in the $1
million-plus market in Scarsdale, said Joan Frederick, an associate
broker in the Scarsdale office of Julia B. Fee. A couple of new
five-bedroom homes going up on .33-acre lots in the Fox Meadow
neighborhood close to the village center in Scarsdale recently
listed at $1.375 million. In portions of the Heathcote section,
which is less densely developed, one-acre lots alone start at $1
million, according to Mrs. Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   Prices fluctuate on either side of the million-dollar mark in
the older neighborhoods of Edgewood, Fox Meadow and Green Acres,
depending on how well the houses have been maintained and the
degree to which they have been updated.
</P>
<P>
   One five-bedroom brick colonial in Green Acres went on the
market earlier this year for $1.075 million on a street where
houses generally sell for $700,000 to $1 million, Mrs. Frederick
said. The 80-year-old house showed so well that the owners received
multiple offers and wound up getting $1.202 million. In 1984, the
same house sold for $510,000, according to Mrs. Frederick.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the homes now on the market in Scarsdale, or
45 houses, are priced above $1 million. The number of $1
million-plus sales began climbing in 1994, when 22 homes sold in
that price range. Last year the number was 33, and this year, as of
May 27, 25 homes had already sold at more than $1 million each,
Mrs. Frederick said.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is also experiencing an upswing this year, in what was
already a heady high-end market. ``Increasingly, when you're
talking about the $1 million market, you're talking about every
part of Manhattan,'' noted Frederick W. Peters, president of
Ashforth, Warburg Associates, a Manhattan real estate brokerage.
``A spacious three-bedroom apartment can run you $1 million on
110th and Riverside. And certainly there are any number of
2,500-square-foot lofts that can run you $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said that $1 million-plus sales by his brokers in the
first four months of 1998 on the East and West Sides and downtown
indicate that if the current pace continues, volume in that market
could be up as much as 80 percent by the year's end.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lawrence Sicular, a broker and appraiser for Brown
Harris Stevens, the $1 million market currently accounts for 37
percent of all sales on the Upper East Side and Central Park West.
That is up from 33 percent in 1997, and 25 percent in 1996. ``It's
a strong but conservative market,'' he noted. ``So the biggest
price increases are for the best located and largest apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of properties selling for $1 million or more in
the suburbs. In Greenwich, according to Ms. MacDonald of William
Pitt, a home that recently sold in the prestigious shore community
of Belle Haven was snapped up almost immediately, despite a price
that would once have been daunting even by Fairfield County
shorefront standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people had been in the house for 40 years,'' she said.
``It was incredible waterfront property. They probably paid
$50,000, if that, and they were holding out for $3 million. I'm
sure they got close to that, if not that.''

DON'T FORGET TO HONOR OLD GLORY ON FLAG DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It came in the mail with no name, no date and no
return address, so I don't know who to thank for sending it to me.
</P>
<P>
   It's a powerful, one-page piece of writing titled ``Do You
Remember Me?''
</P>
<P>
   From what I can make out, it must have been written sometime
during the Vietnam War, but I don't know by whom.
</P>
<P>
   But I do know why. Because too many of us don't remember.
</P>
<P>
   Today being Flag Day in this country, maybe we should, if just
for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, remember me? Some people call me Old Glory; others call
me the Stars and Stripes. I also have been referred to as the
Star-Spangled Banner. But whatever they call me, I am your flag or,
as I proudly state, the flag of the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that has been bothering me, so I thought
that I might talk it over with you because it is about you and me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember some time ago -- I think it was Memorial Day --
people were lined up on both sides of the street to watch the
parade. The town's high school band was behind me, and naturally I
was leading the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your daddy saw me coming along waving in the breeze, he
immediately removed his hat and placed it against his left shoulder
so that his hand was directly over his heart. Remember?
</P>
<P>
   ``And you -- I remember you. Standing there as straight as a
soldier, you didn't have any hat, but you were giving the right
salute. They taught you in school to place your hand over your
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very proud as I came down your street. There were some
soldiers home on leave, and they were standing at attention giving
the military salute. Ladies, as well as men, all paying me the
reverence that I deserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I may sound as if I am a little conceited. Well, I am. I
have a right to be. Because I represent the finest country in the
world. More than one aggressive nation has tried to haul me down,
but they all felt the fury of this freedom-loving country. You
know. You had to go overseas and defend me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened? I'm still the same old flag. Oh, I have a
couple more stars added since you were a boy. A lot more blood has
been shed since the Memorial Day so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad is gone now. The old town has a new look. The last time I
came down your street I saw that some of the old landmarks were
gone, but in their place, shining majestically in the sun, were a
number of new buildings and homes. Yes, sir, the old town sure has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I don't feel as proud as I used to. When I come down
your street, you just stand there with your hands in your pockets
and give me a small glance and then look away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of all the places I have been -- Anzio,
Guadalcanal, Korea and now Vietnam. Then I see the children running
around and shouting. They don't seem to know who I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a sin to be patriotic anymore? Have you forgotten what I
stand for? Have you forgotten all the battlefields where men fought
and died to keep this nation free? When you salute me, you are
actually saluting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at the Memorial Honor Rolls sometime. Look at the
names of those who never came back. Some of them were friends and
relatives of yours. Probably went to the same school with some of
them. That's who you are saluting. Not me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it won't be long until I'll be coming down your street
again. So when you see me, stand straight, place your hand over
your heart, and you'll see me waving back -- my salute to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll know that you remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   It went on the books as Public Law 99-54 back on May 30, 1916,
the day Woodrow Wilson signed Presidential Proclamation 1335,
making June 14 Flag Day.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind Public Law 99-54 was to provide a national pause
-- ``a way for all citizens simultaneously to share a patriotic
moment by pausing to say the Pledge of Allegiance at the same time
across the country,'' the history books say.
</P>
<P>
   That time is 4 p.m. today -- our time. Just in case we remember.

Column: New Jazz attitude brings site change
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ So Dennis Rodman gets to return to the state of
his discomfort, which is Utah or anyplace where you are expected to
act like something other than a calculated nitwit.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan gets to return to that swank hotel suite where he
and Ahmad can sit side by side on the piano bench and tickle the
ivories. Perhaps a little travelin' music.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bulls, it means packing up the tattooed man/lady, the
round, rumply, evil general manager, the whining, condescending,
manipulative coach and going back out on the road, which is where
you expect to find a three-ring circus.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jazz, it's Home Malone.
</P>
<P>
   That short. That simple. It's all the men in purple ever wanted
out of their return engagement to the NBA Finals, a chance to get
His Airness and all of his court jesters back onto their home
floor, amid the din of the loudest arena on the planet, and take
their chances.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly things change.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight hours earlier, the confetti, balloons and
scaffolding for the portable stage were in place at the United
Center for another celebration of America's reigning sports dynasty
and all of the wretched excess it has come to symbolize.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after turbulence in the air on the way to the victory
party, we check in our bags at the Delta Center as the Jazz tries
to keep us all in our seats with the safety belts fastened on the
way to a Game 7 landing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mailman finally delivers with 39 points and instead of smoke
from the traditional victory fires, all that hung in the air of
Chicago was the haunting, taped voice of Frank Sinatra singing,
``Thaat's liife.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, what might the ``Chairman of the Board'' have
crooned if Salt Lake City had been his kind of town _ ``I met a man
who danced with his wives?''
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know, but it also would be bigamy to say this series
suddenly has turned into a classic just because four of five games
have lurched through the fourth quarter with the outcome in doubt.
But there are people who think those Fox TV shows of police chases
and car crashes are grand entertainment too, so there is no
accounting for taste.
</P>
<P>
   What we have is basketball that is so fiercely played nobody can
shoot straight, pass to the intended target and run the proper
offense, or it is sloppy beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, the Mailman and Rogaine pitchmeister, spent the first
four games of the series playing as if a side effect of the
hair-replacement tonic was a huge bald spot in the fourth quarter.
Then he stepped up Friday night and became an interloping John
Travolta with all of the fancy steps at what was supposed to be the
Bulls' ``Last Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally the Jazz got the kind of clutch performance it needed
from John Stockton, who kept delivering the ball to the right
places. And on a night when the Jazz finally showed some bark,
``Big Dawg'' Antoine Carr came howling off the bench with a dozen
points, including eight huge ones in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, mostly, was in attitude. Rather than tiptoeing
into church and worshipping at the altar of the Bulls, the Jazz
took on the role of attackers and never let up. The message was
delivered in the first half when Malone drew a technical for
tossing a shoulder into the chest of Rodman after scoring on a
fast-break dunk. It was a different kind of night for Malone, who
wouldn't allow himself to be deterred and it was Dennis the Clown
who was distracted, picking up five fouls and just three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton drew half of a double technical for an exchange of
elbows with Scottie Pippen. Jeff Hornacek mixed it up with Rodman
and was whistled. But it showed evidence of the flame inside the
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The debate quickly changed from whether Jordan or Pippen was
more deserving of the Finals MVP Award to which of them could miss
more big shots. The five-time champs were never impressive, as if
all they had to do was show up and NBA commissioner David Stern
would hand them another trophy.
</P>
<P>
   In a defining moment down the stretch, Jordan missed an open
jump shot, then missed a driving layup, followed by a missed tip by
Pippen and another foul by Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls seemed more preoccupied trying to make a grand exit to
their era than in finding the door to win one last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the hunt,'' Stockton said. ``We're still
kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a pleasant and surprising change from kicking
themselves.

 By PETER PASSELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, the gap in wages between skilled and unskilled
workers has widened sharply. But new research shows the inequality
doesn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Discrepancies in job benefits and the quality of work life have
also grown, pointing to a bigger chasm than previously recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unskilled workers get the short end of the stick _ and it's
getting shorter,'' said James Heckman, an economist at the
University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Study after study has shown that the gains from post-1970s
economic growth have eluded unskilled workers. The median wage of
those with only a high school diploma fell by 6 percent, adjusted
for inflation, from 1980 to 1996, while the earnings of college
graduates rose by 12 percent. Though there have been indications in
recent months that a scarcity of workers in the surging American
economy has begun raising wages for those on the low end, the gain
has been modest so far and not enough to counter the decades-long
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, wages alone provide an incomplete picture of a worker's
standing. Though economists have long recognized the need to
incorporate working conditions and fringe benefits in any
comprehensive analysis, they have been stymied by a lack of
detailed data.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. Brooks Pierce, an economist at the U.S. Department of
Labor, used confidential data regularly collected by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics from businesses to measure trends in total
compensation. The results are striking: While specialists had long
assumed that benefits acted as a leveling influence, particularly
because of government-required benefits like Social Security and
unemployment insurance, the opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, people in the top one-tenth of the work force made
$24.80 an hour, 3.95 times the $6.28 an hour for workers in the
bottom one-tenth. By 1996, the wage gap had widened, with the
high-end workers averaging $25.74 an hour, or 4.72 times the $5.46
an hour of those at the bottom. Wages for the purposes of Pierce's
study are all expressed in 1997 dollars to account for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The decline among unskilled workers is hardly surprising given
the increasing demands of an information-driven economy. But to
understand it requires a look at total compensation, which places a
value on benefits like health insurance, vacation time and pension
plans.
</P>
<P>
   By Pierce's calculation, the total compensation in 1982 of
workers in the top 10 percent _ $35.16 a hour _ was 4.56 times that
of workers in the bottom 10 percent _ $7.72 an hour. Fourteen years
later, the ratio had increased to 5.43 to 1, with highly paid
workers having gained $1.73 an hour and low-end workers having lost
93 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits led to a greater discrepancy in earnings between high-
and low-wage workers in both 1982 and 1996. Moreover, they were
responsible for one-tenth of the increasing disparity between the
working elite and the working poor over the 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits have long been perceived as a great equalizer. In
percentage terms, after all, a bare-bones $3,000 medical insurance
package adds more to the compensation of a worker making $20,000
than a full-frills $10,000 package for an executive earning
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, according to Pierce, is that a growing number of
workers at the bottom of the pay scale have lost access to key
employer-provided benefits.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of workers received paid holidays and
vacations in 1996, but less than 10 percent of those in the bottom
tenth received paid leave of any kind. Similarly, about 70 percent
of workers have pension plans, while less than 10 percent of those
in the bottom can count on any employer-financed retirement
benefits. Access to health insurance follows a similar pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Employers generally cannot deny benefits to lower-wage workers
without putting the tax-exempt status of those benefits at risk. So
how is this disparity in benefits possible?
</P>
<P>
   Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University whose own
research on medical benefits confirms Pierce's findings, points to
loopholes that allow companies to deny benefits to workers just
starting out and to workers not classified as full time.
``Employers are figuring out all sort of ways to discriminate
between employees they wish to keep and those who come and go,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would come as news to Mary Mendez, a 40-year-old
single mother who sorts apples in a packing plant in Wenatchee,
Wash., for $7.71 an hour. Her employer takes such a strict view
toward paid absences that she was docked for the hours she missed
while recovering from a minor accident at the plant. And while the
company does offer health insurance in an industry where fringes
are rare, she must contribute $21 a month to cover her child.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, employers have turned to temporary and contract
workers, whose pay packages do not include time off and other
benefits. United Parcel Service even endured a strike in which a
big issue was the company's desire to use more part-time workers to
hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even bigger surprise than the lack of benefits is how
little people with especially demanding or unpleasant jobs are
compensated for difficult working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Job hazards, everything from working in extreme temperatures to
working a dangerous, lonely night shift at a highway convenience
store, would seem to command higher wages than similar work under
less taxing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lillie Reed says her job as an aide in a nursing home in
Stamford, Conn., is dirty, sometimes dangerous _ and getting
harder.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, each nursing assistant cared for seven
patients. Today, it could be as many 16 on weekends. ``The people
coming to the home are older, sicker and angrier,'' she adds.
``It's really tough lifting them, dressing them and keeping them
clean.''
</P>
<P>
   By looking at arguably the best measure of job conditions, the
risk of injury, a new study by Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at
the University of Texas, found that workers on the low end of the
wage scale were falling ever further behind.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, workers in the top quarter of wage earners lost 38
percent more days to on-the-job injuries than workers in the bottom
quarter, Hamermesh found. By 1995, the pattern had reversed.
High-wage earners lost 32 percent less days than low-wage earners.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that only workers at the top end of the
wage scale are interested in their own health and safety. One
possible explanation for the failure to reduce injuries among low
earners, suggests Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton
University, is the declining power of labor unions. While employers
may know how dangerous a job is and how much it would cost to make
it safer, individual workers rarely do. A union may be able to even
the playing field by tracking health and safety issues and
negotiating improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation, favored by Hamermesh, is that all unskilled
workers _ union and nonunion _ have lost much ground over the last
two decades as skilled workers added so much more to corporate
productivity. ``Overall, workplace safety hasn't changed much,''
Hamermesh said. ``High-paid blue-collar workers with hazardous jobs
have simply become low-paid blue-collar workers in hazardous
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   In sheer number, construction workers are probably the group
most affected. Asbestos workers in New York City are a good
illustration. In the late 1980s, the union wage for removing
asbestos insulation from old buildings was $31 an hour. But in the
1990s, an influx of largely Polish immigrants eager for even
hazardous jobs led to a rise in nonunion removal companies and a
collapse in wages for both groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contractors had no trouble getting workers for $12 to $15 an
hour _ and workers willing to do the job without respirators,''
said Pawel Kedzior, the business manager for Local 78 of the
Asbestos, Lead and Hazardous Waste Laborers.
</P>
<P>
   The local has made a comeback under new leadership, recruiting
1,200 Polish and 500 Hispanic members. But the current union wage
of $19.90 an hour for asbestos removal _ sometimes with little
effort to protect workers from asbestos detritus _ is the
contemporary reality of the market for unskilled labor.
</P>
<P>
   After making some assumptions about the value of job safety,
Hamermesh found that the increased risk of injury between
high-paying and low-paying work had significantly compounded wage
inequality. By his calculation, the change in injury rates
magnifies the growth in the wage gap by as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To many advocates for the poor, such evidence underscores the
importance of enforcing health and safety regulations and of
encouraging employers to provide benefits to low-wage earners.
Economists do not disagree, but they say that the relatively low
productivity of unskilled workers is the root of the problem and
warn that it is not so easily solved.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in amenities and benefits for these people would
almost certainly lead to downward pressure on wages or increased
unemployment. ``There's no obvious way around it,'' said Krueger of
Princeton. ``At the end of the day, mandated improvements in
working conditions would most likely be paid for by wage cuts.''

STAGING IS EVERYTHING AS FILM, TV CREWS SEEK PRODUCTION SPACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With none of its trademark glamour and glitz,
Hollywood has descended on an anonymous factory building in the
western San Fernando Valley and quietly started pumping out
celluloid dreams.
</P>
<P>
   In a scenario repeated at a growing number of unexpected
locales, the two-story building on Variel Avenue in suburban Canoga
Park that once produced aircraft parts and later shampoo has become
an entertainment studio. Ray-Art Studios has already served as home
for ``Blade,'' starring Wesley Snipes as a high-tech vampire
fighter, and the TV sitcom ``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a story occurring throughout the suburban San Fernando and
Santa Clarita valleys, as owners of property that once housed
manufacturing or retail operations have discovered that going
Hollywood makes financial sense. While major studios like Universal
and Warner Bros. will charge up to $4,500 a day for their largest
soundstages, independents can sometimes get more than $3,000 per
daily rental, particularly if the space has at least 15,000 square
feet and high ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosive growth of entertainment production in recent
years, stages on studio lots are often booked for months. That
means producers have been turning to unlikely suburban locations
like Canoga Park, Sylmar, Van Nuys and Santa Clarita, where a
thriving business has developed in using industrial buildings
dozens of miles from Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art is the fifth incarnation for the plant. It was
originally owned by Boeing Co., then Redken shampoo, which fled in
1995 for New Jersey and sold the property to developer Robert
Selan. He first opened a baseball training facility, then struck
lease deals with producers and renamed it Variel Studios before
selling it to Robert Papazian and James Hirsch last year.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners, best known for producing television's ``Nash
Bridges,'' have divided 83,000 square feet into four walled
soundstages and dubbed it Ray-Art after their fathers. Business has
been so good that they will add up to four stages by the end of
next year, using 100,000 square feet in the back, originally part
of the factory but demolished after the 1994 Northridge Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much demand for space that there's no question that
the new stages will be filled,'' Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art has put up a permanent logo outside the building,
installed wooden flooring over the cement and recently opened a
commissary called Joey's Grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the reality of doing this turned out far better than
our expectations,'' Hirsch said. ``We have been extraordinarily
pleased. Knock on wood that there's a lot of business out there for
people like us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray-Art and famed producer Aaron Spelling recently agreed on a
deal to lease all four existing stages for ``Love Boat: The Next
Wave'' for the coming TV season and have started construction, with
principal photography set to begin in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 14 producers waiting with bated breath on our stages
because it's so hard to find large spaces with 35-foot-high
ceilings,'' said Ray-Art general manager Harry Smith, a 16-year
veteran at Universal. ``I get calls every day, even though we
haven't done any marketing, just word-of-mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice, producers would rather do business on the
industry's 10 major lots _ Fox and Sony in Culver City; Paramount,
ABC and CBS in Hollywood; Universal in Universal City; CBS in
Studio City; and Disney, Warner and NBC in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just renting soundstages on the lot; we're selling a
lot of services,'' said Mike Walbrecht, Warner's director of studio
and production services. ``We have huge wardrobe, props, lighting
and construction departments, and you don't see that at a converted
warehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Warner, with 35 soundstages and 433,000 square feet, is
forced to use large amounts of off-lot space, such as the Spruce
Goose Dome in Long Beach, south of Los Angeles, where it has a
three-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warehouses tend to be cold, damp, without enough electricity
and parking,'' Walbrecht said. ``There are a lot of problems, but
we have to use them. It can be less expensive, but you often have
to bring in power, insulate and get security.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 160 soundstages in the San Fernando and
Santa Clarita valleys, ranging from Warner's Stage 16 with 31,388
square feet to spaces of less than 2,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   They are ground zero in the region's surge in entertainment
production. According to a recently released survey by the Motion
Picture Association of America, entertainment spending jumped a
stunning 75percent to $6.44billion between 1992 and 1996 for the
San Fernando Valley and increased 168percent in Santa Clarita
during that same period to $394million.
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers say those numbers continue to surge, heating
up a thriving market for more soundstages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone that I talk to is planning to add more space,'' said
William Allen, head of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando
Valley and former chief of MTM Productions, which was based on the
CBS lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth will come both within the big studio lots and the
independent operators. I'm quite sure they'll build because
producers are tired of having to wait for space.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nearly two-thirds of the region's soundstages operate at five
major studios _ Universal, Warner, Disney, CBS and NBC. Yet even
with 93 stages of a combined 1.25million square feet at those
facilities, it's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm turning business away,'' said Bob Gould, manager of NBC's
seven stages, home to ``The Tonight Show,'' ``Days of Our Lives,''
``Access Hollywood'' and ``Sunset Beach.'' ``I could easily fill
four or five more.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS, NBC and Universal plan to add stages, but not for several
more years. The CBS lot, originally opened by Mack Sennett and Al
Christie in 1926, will have two new stages in 2000 and two more in
2002, adding 91,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be pretty much built out by then,'' said Michael
Klausman, president of the CBS Studio Center.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's target is to add six stages to the seven it operates. But
Jack O'Neill, vice president of facilities, noted it will be a
complex process because of the need to obtain approvals and replace
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Construction could begin in 2001, he said. The stages each will
contain at least 18,000 square feet _ large enough to house
sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in a situation where we have so much product and
not enough stages,'' O'Neill said. ``I think the demand will
continue for a long, long time. It's tough for us because we wind
up leasing all over town, which is very expensive, when we'd rather
build our own.''
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Universal, which already operates 36 soundstages with an average
of slightly more than 80,000 square feet, has said it plans to add
another 80,000 square feet of soundstages during the next 15 years
as part of its extensive expansion proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the majors have not added soundstages for a long time
because, in a lot of cases, the need is being serviced elsewhere,''
Warner's Walbrecht said. ``So if there weren't so many converted
warehouses available, it would be more imperative to build more
stages. As a result, all the majors are using outside space.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, the owners of soundstages have entered the business by
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a manufacturer of truck bodies for General Motors and
Ford, and I had a lot of property,'' said Sheldon Baer, who broke
into the business eight years ago and now owns four soundstages.
``I had to do an exchange with a health club in Toluca Lake, so my
friends suggested I convert it to soundstages.''
</P>
<P>
   The suburban Chandler Toluca Lake operation eventually occupied
18,000 square feet and became so successful that Baer opened two
more stages with nearly 30,000 square feet at the back of the
closed GM plant in Van Nuys. He is planning to open two even larger
stages by next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done very well, and we kept getting requests for more
and larger space,'' Baer said. ``I don't see the need going away,
because studios want to invest in their own product, not real
estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Or take Del Masino, who operates Delfino Stages in a Sylmar
warehouse. He launched the business five years ago when he
unexpectedly found himself with 30,000 square feet of vacant space.
A friend told him about another warehouse owner in nearby Sun
Valley renting the place out for $900 a day to producers, so he
built two soundstages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep my prices very reasonable, so I have plenty of people
in here,'' Masino said. ``We're not well-known, but we're close to
everything _ 20 minutes from Hollywood, half an hour from the
Westside.''
</P>
<P>
   Location scouts also report a solid business in matching film
companies with empty warehouses, office buildings and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers love industrial warehouse-type space because it's so
easy for set-building,'' said Jim Thompson, head of the Van
Nuys-based Real to Reel service. ``The commercial industry is
pretty hot right now, the TV market is aggressive, and features are
booming because `Titanic' did so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Thompson's more desirable locations include the former
West Valley Hospital in Chatsworth; homes with a mainstream look,
including white-picket fences; and a former Keebler cookie plant in
Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a need for more space,'' he said. ``We're
scrambling to fill our orders. We thought about building something
ourselves, but we're so busy now.''
</P>
<P>
   Leasing a warehouse is attractive because the structures tend to
have plenty of parking and high ceilings. But the space may lack
insulation and soundproofing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really do wonder why production companies don't want to
commit to anything more than what they immediately need,'' said
Tracy Barnacle, who specializes in such property at Real to Reel.
``But I think absolutely everything available will be picked up.
Anything over 40,000 square feet is very desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the case even if the facilities are in Santa Clarita, 25
miles from Hollywood. Santa Clarita Studios, with eight stages and
more than 120,000 square feet, went on the block earlier this year
and has drawn three bids, even though there are three other
operations in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said that the business was heading north,'' said
Herman David, one of the owners. ``What's surprised us is the
interest we've gotten from people in music and cable TV.''
</P>
<P>
   More entertainment development in the Santa Clarita area is
probable. Lincoln Property Co. recently bought Lockheed Martin
Corp.'s Rye Canyon aerospace test site and plans to convert much of
the 511 acres to entertainment production.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of smaller players say the demand is so strong that
they're going to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get calls all the time from people who need stages with at
least 10,000 square feet,'' said Don Oran, who operates Studio 57's
three soundstages with 7,600 square feet in North Hollywood.
``We're in the process of getting more, and I want to be up and
running by August.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Albain, owner of Hayvenhurst Studios in Van Nuys, plans
to build two 16,800-square-foot stages next year on the site of a
former wrecking yard, a block away from his current operations.
``We decided to build pretty-good-size spaces, because you can
never have something big enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zelma Welcome, sales manager for four small stages in Glendale
and Burbank, is also on the prowl. ``We are looking for land,'' she
said. ``We want to put up eight to 10 stages with 14,000 to 20,000
square feet (each).''

New American Regis adds solid citizenship, defense to U.S. team
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LYON, France _ He is an American in France like so many others, the
notable difference being he gets along better with the maitre d's
at restaurants than the menus at McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   This David Regis is the rarest of finds. He can order for the
whole room and not cause French waiters to turn up their noses.
</P>
<P>
   He also can take the soccer ball to his left, unleash a
thunderous hooking cross to the perfect spot and not have to say a
word in English. Which is a good thing, because he can't speak the
language.
</P>
<P>
   But like his new teammates, Regis has come to France as an
American, albeit a new one. And he has come for all the right
reasons. He wants to try to help build U.S. soccer and fulfill a
dream by competing in the grandest tournament of them all, the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he might have brought only a limited English vocabulary
and quite the ironic story, considering the chaotic road he took
toward U.S. citizenship and a trip back to France, which still is
his home. But a whale of a game came along for the Cup, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's defensive skills are at the top level in the world,''
U.S. coach Steve Sampson said. ``He gives us a dimension we haven't
seen a lot of before.''
</P>
<P>
   Regis made it onto the World Cup squad by the skin of his teeth,
or rather the recitation of the Bill of Rights, part of which he
had to memorize for the much-hurried citizenship exam U.S. Soccer
officials helped arrange only three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all, the game is the same and it speaks everybody's
language,'' Regis said. ``So for me it is not difficult adjusting
to the new situation. The American players are smart and have been
very willing to help me adapt as fast as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Regis, 29, who was born in Martinique and lived in Paris from
the age of 12, long has been considered a prime candidate to play
for the French national team. But after months of receiving mixed
messages from French soccer federation leaders while getting
inquiries from Sampson, Regis withdrew his name from consideration
for the French team and began looking for U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 while playing for the French side Racing Club de
Strasbourg, Regis met an American student from Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had coffee and a baguette at a cafe,'' he said of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Regis and Nikki Fogle married, which made him
eligible to become a U.S. citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were obstacles even after Sampson convinced Regis
to join the U.S. training squad in early May.
</P>
<P>
   First, U.S. immigration laws allow foreign spouses of Americans
to become citizens only after they have been married three years.
And David and Nikki Regis did not celebrate their third wedding
anniversary until the opening day of the World Cup this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the loophole in the process was Nikki worked with a travel
agency in France and would not return to the United States for a
year, which allowed the citizenship process to be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem was helping Regis take a crash course in U.S.
history and study for the citizenship exam when he hardly knew a
word of English.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, defender Jeff Agoos, whose place Regis would take in
the starting lineup, spent hours going over points of history and
quizzing Regis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised that the players were so open to me,''
Regis said. ``In Europe, every man is out for himself. It was a new
experience for me. Everybody helped. I probably know more U.S.
history now than most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Regis aced the exam, answering every question correctly and
completing the part of the test that worried him the most _ writing
a sentence in English.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence he wrote might have been something of a reflection
of how the U.S. team feels about their World Cup prospects now that
Regis is in the lineup: ``Today is a very nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Regis, whose friendly, low-key demeanor helped his transition to
the U.S. squad, immediately broke into the U.S. starting lineup
after passing the citizenship test.
</P>
<P>
   It was in an exhibition game against Kuwait in mid-May and
before the game his teammates serenaded Regis with the national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Regis starred in the game, helping the Americans shut out
Kuwait. Afterward, Regis got the game ball and has since showed all
the skills that impressed the French and Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a strong left foot, good straight-up defending ability
and is great heading the ball,'' teammate Cobi Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because he has spent much of his professional career in
Germany, Regis not only has strengthened a shaky U.S. defense, but
brought in a wealth of knowledge about how to play the powerful
Germans, who will be the Americans' first Cup opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is working out, that's why I came here,'' Regis
said. ``All the experience I have in Europe should help, especially
because I've played alongside a lot of German players. I know
almost all of their players, what they like to do and how they
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to play in the World Cup for your country is like a
dream. That never happened in France. To be here now is great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to wear the colors and help this team. I want to learn
more about what it is to be an American and learn more about the
culture. It will take time, but once I learn more about the
language and spend as much time over there as I can, it will be
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he is in France. An American in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``An American is an American is an American,'' Sampson said.
``This is a country of immigrants. David is doing what millions of
people have done for this country. He's living the American
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special to be in France,'' Regis said. ``I'm playing in
my country, for my other country.''

TEXAS REPUBLICANS CALL FOR IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT CLINTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   By R.G. RATCLIFFE &QL; 
and CLAY ROBISON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FORT WORTH _ More than 7,500 voting delegates to the Texas
Republican Convention approved a platform Saturday that urges
Congress to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sufficient evidence exists to indicate that President William
Jefferson Clinton has engaged in acts which in and of themselves
are impeachable offenses,'' the platform said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP platform said those offenses include ``bribery,
influence peddling, obstruction of justice, perjury, subornation of
perjury and gross sexual misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   A special prosecutor is investigating whether Clinton lied in a
sworn deposition about having sex with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky and urging Lewinsky to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican chairwoman Susan Weddington said the
impeachment plank will send a strong message to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strong statement. It says that we're sick, fed up,
tired of the obstructionism,'' Weddington said. ``We just want to
move on so we can feel proud of our presidency and our country's
leader again.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democratic Party spokesman Rafe Bemporad said the
Republicans were engaging in personality politics with the
impeachment plank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the Republican Party continues to engage
in the politics of personal destruction,'' Bemporad said. ``The
majority of the people in Texas and the nation are ready to move on
and take care of the business of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican convention ended Saturday after two days of what
was largely a pep rally for the re-election of Gov. George W. Bush
and the possible GOP sweep of statewide offices this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to inspire, educate and motivate so the grass
roots will be energized,'' Weddington said. ``The message of the
convention at this point is: Democrats, you are in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   While the convention was generally harmonious, tempers flared in
the midday heat outside the Tarrant County Convention Center as
about 100 gays and lesbians staged a rally urging Texas Republicans
to open their party to them. The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay and
lesbian group, had been denied an exhibit booth at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-gay protesters, most of whom were not convention delegates,
taunted rally participants with signs and verbal insults, but
police kept the peace.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. W.N. Otwell, a right-wing minister from Mount
Enterprise who unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for
governor in 1990, organized the counterprotest, he said, to
``confront the Sodomites.''
</P>
<P>
   Weddington, in a speech to the convention later in the day
criticized protesters for ``attacking other people in such a
mean-spirited and derogatory way.''
</P>
<P>
   Weddington, however, reaffirmed her support for the party's
strong platform plank against homosexuality. And within the past
week, a party spokesman had called the Log Cabin Republicans an
``extremist'' group of ``deviant'' individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The only heated confrontation inside the convention occurred
before the convention deleted term limits for party officials from
the state party rules. The convention also eliminated from its
platform any mention of term limits for state and federal elected
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of term limits for elected officials has been a
core Republican issue for most of this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Platform Committee Chairman Michael Williams said the plank was
removed because state term limit laws for federal candidates were
declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. He said
platform committee members believed voters could limit the terms of
state officeholders at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Several planks in the platform appeared to contradict positions
taken by Gov. George W. Bush. In one instance, the platform said
the majority of bilingual education programs in Texas have not
worked and should be eliminated. Bush has said he supports
bilingual education programs that work.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he did not see the bilingual plank as a
contradiction of Bush's position. But he said no politician is
expected to agree with every platform plank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The platform is an expression of the beliefs, the values and
the principles of these delegates,'' Williams said. ``Individuals
here and there may have disagreements with the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Friday said a platform is a statement of the delegates
of the convention, but he said he runs on his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I disagree with certain parts of the platform, I just move
on and campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the convention also adopted a new party rule requiring
Republican candidates to be given a questionnaire on whether they
support specific platform planks. Weddington said it will be
voluntary as to whether candidates fill out the questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates unanimously re-elected Weddington of San Antonio as
party chairman and David Barton of Aledo as vice chairman.
Weddington and Barton originally were appointed to their positions
last year by the party executive committee. Weddington is the first
woman to head either major party in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Weddington vowed to dedicate her service for the next two years
``first to God and then to the betterment of all Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   Convention keynote speaker U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm said the goal of
Texas Republicans this year is to sweep all statewide offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win every statewide office in this election in Texas, we
will see dinosaurs walk in West Texas and the Tyrannosaurus Rex
swim in the Brazos River again before we ever see a Democrat in the
governor's mansion in Austin,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the dinosaurs came back, they would be welcome. The
Democrats would not,'' Gramm said.

FAMED CAFE'S FOUNDER DIES AT 93
</HEADLINE>
 By ANITA BAKER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONDER, Texas _ Grace ``Pete'' Jackson, whose steaks and caramel
pies drew customers from everywhere to the Ranchman's Cafe in the
tiny town of Ponder, died Friday at 93.
</P>
<P>
   For more than four decades, the crusty, well-loved Denton County
native greeted customers, hugged children and served up the tender
plate-size steaks and homemade pies that earned raves in national
magazines and devoted followers in Fort Worth-Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   From the time she opened the restaurant in 1948, her reputations
spread by word of mouth, and ``the world beat a path to her door,''
said Don Swafford, a great-nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was in the grocery business when a small building became
vacant next door, and she decided to put in a restaurant, Swafford
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had no idea it would go over like it did. It just boomed.
Within a year, it kicked off big time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning the restaurant was a family operations, using
her mother's old recipes with help from her sisters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swafford said the recipes had been perfected when the women in
the family cooked for the large threshing crews that worked during
harvests.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson didn't formally advertise, but over the years the word
spread, drawing the famous and the common folk.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Faye Dunaway ate at the restaurant while ``Bonnie and
Clyde'' was being filmed nearby, and Dallas Cowboys stars were
regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, merchandising prince Stanley Marcus celebrated his
wedding anniversary there. It drew authors such as Peter Benchley
and sports figures such as Johnny Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, it also drew real cowboys, who came into town
and tied their horses to the front porch post just to annoy
Jackson, her nephew recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a tough old gal,'' he said. Her husband, R.L. ``Jack''
Jackson, originally did a lot of the cooking. He died in the early
1960s, and she carried on, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was everyone's grandmother, hugging children and
greeting customers when they came in, recalled Dave Ross, who
cooked at the restaurant for years before buying it in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was adamant about how her restaurant was run.
</P>
<P>
   It was all simple home cooking, but always fresh. No frozen
meat. No store-bought pie crusts. Ground meat was made fresh from
steak cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   Steak sauce was not available, unless customers brought their
own. And Jackson chose not to get a liquor license; booze was
something else customers had to bring.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ross has added steak sauce, the restaurant remains
basically the way Jackson set it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is a memorial to her,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Visitation will be from 3 to 5 p.m. Sunday at DeBerry Funeral
Home, 2025 W. University in Denton.
</P>
<P>
   Graveside services will be at 10 a.m. Monday at Roselawn
Memorial Park in Denton.

BORDER _ The U.S. House wants to put troops on the Southwest border
to stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants, a proposal
critics say would make the region look like ``east Berlin during
the Cold War.'' The House plan has ignited protests from Arizona
Gov. Jane Hull and officials along both sides of the border. It
authorizes the U.S. military to be dispatched to join with civilian
law enforcement agencies to prevent the entry of ``terrorists, drug
traffickers and illegal aliens'' into the United States. By JEFF
BARKER and MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GROWTH _ It seemed like the unsinkable plan: Slapping tough
controls on uncontrolled growth. All the polls showed tremendous
public support for a ballot initiative to fight sprawl. It struck
so much fear into business interests and lawmakers that they put
together their own competing proposal. But the environmentalists'
plan to manage growth suddenly sank last week. It hit two icebergs:
Time and money. But unlike the Titanic, the growth management
initiative isn't permanently scuttled. By KATHLEEN INGLEY and
MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
POSADA _ Winslow, Ariz., is a town hanging in the balance. What
will make it or break it is the vitality of its downtown area,
whose rebirth is being led by the restoration of the 68-year-old La
Posada resort, designed by the female architect who also designed
many of the buildings at the Grand Canyon. If the beautful old
resort fails to bring tourists and business to town made famous in
the Eagles song, Take It Easy, Winslow could go the way of so many
other burgs along the old Route 66. By BARBARA YOST. Story will
move in the ``L'' and ``T'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COL (Phoenix) _ Get ready to laugh. Those rib-tickling
yuk-meisters of the Washington press corps are about to apply
several coats of monkeyshine on the tarnished shell of their

Exodus could prove costly to WAC's breakaway eight
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Legal games could replace those on the field for the eight teams
trying to depart the Western Athletic Conference and the eight
schools they leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   WAC presidents have asked league commissioner Karl Benson to
seek legal counsel whether the eight schools leaving the conference
have breached the league's articles of incorporation and failed to
observe their fiduciary responsibilities to the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the process of identifying a firm in Denver to
review this matter,'' said Benson, who declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents of eight schools _ Air Force, Brigham Young, Colorado
State, New Mexico State, San Diego State, UNLV, Utah and Wyoming _
announced in late May they were leaving the WAC to create their own
league, dubbed the Great Western Eight by some, by the summer of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the departing schools said their decision is in
accordance with WAC bylaws, which require they give written notice
of their departure to each league member and the WAC commissioner
on or before Sept. 1. Those papers have yet to be filed, WAC
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents of some of the remaining WAC schools _ Rice, TCU,
SMU, Tulsa, Texas-El Paso, Fresno State, Hawaii and San Jose State
_ are trying to determine whether the split is proper under the
WAC's articles of incorporation.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the school with the loudest complaint is Hawaii.
University president Kenneth Mortimer said an economist has
determined the WAC split will cost the school between $9 million
and $11 million over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer said he asked Hawaii's attorney general for a ruling on
the legality of the split prior to the May 31-June 2 WAC board of
directors meeting in Pebble Beach, Calif., but has not received an
answer. Mortimer did, however, meet with a lawyer before going to
California and kept a legal brief that he shared with presidents
during the WAC board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (presidents of the departing schools) are the ones who
said it is just a business decision,'' Mortimer said. ``And it
looks to me like it is a broken business agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   One lawyer researching the issues said he did not think it would
come to a lawsuit. But the possibility is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look for an appropriate way to resolve those issues,''
said Leon Bennett, an SMU vice president and general counsel. ``We
will not be looking to litigation as the principal means of doing
that. We hope to enter into discussions with them in the near
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the argument is the WAC agreement of incorporation,
which was signed by all 16 school presidents. Some WAC officials
believe the agreement limits the right of any school to leave the
WAC before the middle of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated that when we signed this agreement, that it was
pretty clear,'' Mortimer said. ``There is no out clause. It is a
five-year agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Western Athletic Conference was incorporated as a
Colorado corporation, the WAC presidents were named to its board of
directors. Such corporate boards bear a higher degree of legal
responsibility for their actions than do officials of
unincorporated bodies.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are five paragraphs of the articles of incorporation,
which were signed after the new members, including former Southwest
Conference members Rice, SMU and TCU, joined the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth paragraph of the agreement states that members
``believe that it is in the long-term academic, competitive and
financial best interests of each of them to incorporate and
continue the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The long-term continuation of the WAC, of course, is now in
jeopardy because of the possible split.
</P>
<P>
   The second and third points involve the money paid under
Articles 2 and 3 of the agreement. In Article 2, the members of the
old conference agreed to transfer all assets of the 10-team
unincorporated conference to the new 16-team WAC.
</P>
<P>
   In Article 3, new members agreed to pay $75,000 each to the
league in 1994 and then to pay $35,000 a year for five years from
July 1, 1996, to July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Article 4(a) says that while each WAC member will share equally
in the corporation's revenues, each of the six newest members would
lose $100,000 from their shares for each year through June 30,
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth point, in Article 8(a), said that the incorporation
agreement would remain in effect ``until it is amended or
terminated by all parties hereto or until all of the obligations of
the parties hereto have been fully performed.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight remaining WAC schools are prepared to argue that since
payments and income redistribution continues through June 2001, no
school or schools have the right to leave the league before that
time.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State athletic director Tim Weiser said the issues were
complicated in the move. ``There certainly will be a great deal of
discussion in the coming months,'' he said. ``We are proceeding
with great caution and concern.''
</P>
<P>
   CSU president Al Yates, who organized the breakaway eight,
acknowledged the possibility of a lawsuit but said, ``We are not
just colleagues, but friends, and I hope that will be the way we
operate in the future. The eight departing institutions don't have
much (money). We don't have a conference. We have an idea and a
dream, but there is much work ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight remaining WAC schools, however, have seen that
friendship strained by recent events. Yates spearheaded a group of
five schools _ CSU, Air Force, BYU, Utah and Wyoming _ whose
presidents met secretly at Denver International Airport and decided
to leave the WAC. Some have questioned how Yates, who was chairman
of the WAC Board of Directors at the time, could move to break up
the conference when he was charged with the fiduciary
responsibility of doing what was best for the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic issue relates to the question: Is the WAC a
corporation? Yes, it is,'' Mortimer said. ``Do we have a fiduciary
responsibility to the corporation, and can a minority conspire to
hurt the majority? That's an interesting issue.''
</P>
<P>
   One source who asked not to be named said the five schools at
the original meeting have damaged themselves in terms of ethical
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the WAC had not incorporated, then none of this would be as
significant an issue,'' said the source. ``Rice president Malcolm
Gillis insisted on the incorporation because of what happened to
them during the demise of the Southwest Conference.''
</P>
<P>
   What do the eight schools remaining in the WAC want? Spokesmen
from some of the schools believe they have legal grounds to receive
monetary damages from the departing schools. Mortimer can cite his
worst-case scenario of $11 million that Hawaii won't receive over
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   One WAC source, who requested anonymity, said it is very likely
every school remaining in the WAC could prove it will suffer at
least $1 million per year in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiply that by eight schools over five years, and that's $40
million,'' the source said. ``I think $80 million wouldn't be out
of the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Those figures also may just be saber rattling. SMU president
Gerald Turner, the new chairman of the WAC's board of directors,
has said no one wants to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always the possibility, but in higher ed it is not a
probability,'' Turner said. ``By the time we got out of it,
everyone would have forgotten what it was about and been in three
more conferences the way things are going now.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Turner couches his comments, saying, ``For every stone
we pick up, we find another stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some damages,'' he said. ``After they are all
identified, we want to have as few damages as possible to the eight
(remaining in the WAC). We need to have some type of completion to
that so the WAC can continue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the coin, the eight departing schools want
to claim the money their basketball programs earned from the NCAA
Tournament. Schools receive one unit for every round they advance
in the tournament. The WAC's share will total about $2.5 million
for the 1998-99 academic year and just over $3 million for the
1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The breakaway schools likely will try to use that money as a
bargaining tool in the legal negotiations with the eight remaining
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-eight of the 33 credits were earned by the departing
schools,'' said BYU's Lee Bartlett, assistant to BYU president
Merrill Bateman. ``There clearly are legal things to discuss.''
</P>
<P>
   However, under NCAA rules, the departing schools cannot claim
the money they earned while in the WAC. Tulsa gave up units when it
left the Missouri Valley Conference for the WAC, and Arkansas gave
up units when it bolted the Southwest Conference for the
Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA rules are clear that the conference receives the
money, not the teams,'' said an NCAA spokeswoman. The only way for
the Great Western Eight to receive the NCAA basketball money, she
said, is for the WAC to break up.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said the basketball money is non-negotiable and will
remain with the eight WAC teams.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of the schools remaining in the WAC have had
teleconference calls about the legal aspects of the breakup. But it
appears the angriest is Hawaii's Mortimer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has had an economist look at the numbers, then he could
show economic damages, because they have been in the league 20
years and have the numbers to fall back on,'' another source said.
</P>
<P>
   Could the Hawaiian Legislature get involved? Gov. Ben Cayetano
previously had agreed to pay travel subsidies of $500,000 a year to
the eight schools that split from the WAC if Hawaii could join them
as their ninth team. Hawaii gave $250,000 a year to subsidize
travel from 1979 _ its first year in the WAC _ to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Also in question is the thorny problem of sovereign immunity.
Since seven of the eight schools that split are operated by state
or federal governments, they are shielded in part or completely
from liability in a lawsuit. So it remains uncertain if the
institutions can be held liable for their departure from the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   One source, however, noted state schools have been sued before.
``Sovereign immunity is just another moat around the castle,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since BYU is a private school, it does not have the protection
of sovereign immunity and thus could be tithing to the eight it
left behind. Also, as a member of the board of directors, Bateman's
personal fortune could be in jeopardy, said one lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints) is going to like what they see here,'' said one WAC school
official.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, currently traveling in Russia, has declined comment on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to the fire, according to one league official, is
that Mortimer is intent on a legal challenge, possibly with the
Hawaiian Legislature on his side, even if the WAC as a league does
not vote to sue the Great Western Eight.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Rice officials say they plan to continue with the
eight-team league. When asked at the WAC meetings in California if
Rice intended to pay the $35,000 it owes the league this year
despite the future breakup, Gillis said, ``We will meet our
financial obligations.''

LEWIS DRAWS RAVES AS SOX LEADING MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Darren Lewis was one of several players auditioned in Florida as
Red Sox leadoff man this spring, but when the season began, manager
Jimy Williams abandoned that experiment and restored Nomar
Garciaparra to the top of the order.
</P>
<P>
   But when Garciaparra separated his shoulder diving for a ground
ball May 8 in Kansas City, Williams was forced to find an
alternative. He settled on Lewis, the Gold Glove outfielder whose
offense was an afterthought when the Red Sox signed him two days
before Christmas for the cut-rate price of $500,000, less than half
his 1997 salary.
</P>
<P>
   But what was supposed to be a Band-Aid measure has taken on the
look of permanence, as Lewis has exceeded all expectations in
jump-starting the Red Sox' offense. When Garciaparra returned,
Williams slid him into the No. 3 slot and kept Lewis, who had begun
the year hitting eighth and ninth in the order, in the No. 1 slot.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis doesn't have Garciaparra's extra-base power, but has given
the Red Sox everything a team looks for in a leadoff man: a smart,
patient hitter who knows how to get on base. His leadoff on-base
percentage of .399, which is 78 points higher than his career OBP,
ranks him second with Chuck Knoblauch of the Yankees in the
American League, .001 behind Texas's Tom Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 31 games since he has taken over the leadoff spot, Lewis
has failed to reach base by either a hit, walk, or as a hit batsman
in just five games. When the Red Sox scored 25 runs in three games
last week against the Braves _ the most runs allowed in three games
by the vaunted Atlanta pitching staff this season _ Lewis was on
base three times in each game and scored six runs.
</P>
<P>
   He went hitless in three trips against Tampa Bay Friday night,
but drew a leadoff walk and scored ahead of Reggie Jefferson's home
run, the Red Sox' only scoring until they broke up a tight game
with three runs in the eighth en route to a 5-1 win. With 25 walks,
Lewis has twice as many as the free-swinging Garciaparra (11),
whose more potent bat is needed in the heart of the order,
especially with the Red Sox short on righthanded hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Since last season, the Red Sox have subtracted Tim Naehring,
Wilfredo Cordero, and Mike Stanley as righthanded hitters who
batted in the middle of the lineup while adding just Jim Leyritz,
who has been struggling of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player, one who knows how to play the game,''
Williams said of Lewis. ``How many RBIs does he have?''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has 21, an unexceptional total but one that becomes more
meaningful in this context: Among Red Sox regulars, Lewis ranks
second only to Garciaparra in hitting with runners in scoring
position. Garciaparra is batting .339 (20 for 59), while Lewis is
at .318 (14 for 44) and has more RBIs (17) than hits in those
situations.
</P>
<P>
   While Bret Saberhagen has commanded far more attention on the
subject of comeback player of the year, Lewis, who was buried on
the White Sox bench for much of last season, will merit
consideration if he maintains this level of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   And his defense, along with that of another Sox newcomer, Damon
Buford, has elevated Sox outfield play to a level that hasn't been
seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is an unbelievable worker,'' said third baseman John
Valentin. ``He's out there early every day, hitting, in the weight
room, taking fly balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who is one of the quietest players on the team but
listens to brain-thumping rap music on his headphones before games
to hype himself up, doesn't want to hear talk about comeback
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' he said. ``This is the way I've always approached
the game. Awards, like Gold Gloves and that stuff, are so
secondary. I want a chance to get to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis just missed in '93, when he played on a Giants team that
won 103 games but lost the division title to the Braves, two years
before the wild card was introduced into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this team,'' he said, ``there was no pressure for me to be
an offensive factor, because it's such a great offensive ball
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, he has become a key factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you get older, you get a little smarter,'' he
said. ``I've had my struggles the last couple of years, but
hopefully you have some luck, and hopefully, the hard work pays
off.''

DOOLEY AT HOME PLAYING FOR US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SAINT-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France _ Thomas Dooley remembers the
puzzled expressions of playmates when he was growing up in the
Fatherland in the '60s. ``Dooley? Explain how that is,'' they asked
him. ``That is not a German name.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as American as G.I. Joe. Dooley's father was a US
serviceman who vanished when Dooley was a toddler. Dooley spoke
German, not English, and played a dozen years in professional
leagues there. But he always considered himself a Yank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up like a German but I feel like an American,'' says
the man who will lead the US team into the Parc des Princes Monday
for their crucial World Cup opener against Germany in Paris. When
he hears the two anthems played before the kickoff _ ``The
Star-Spangled Banner'' and ``Deutschland Uber Alles'' _ Dooley will
know which one is his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-eight times I have played for America and 78 times I
have heard the American anthem,'' says the 37-year-old captain, the
oldest man on the US roster by more than two years. ``When I hear
the German anthem, I know the song, but there is nothing inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley has carried an American passport since 1992. He lives
much of the year in Mission Viejo, Calif. He listens to Metallica
before matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked American music,'' he says. ``Van Halen and
everything else. I watched the Super Bowl every year. It was the
one football game they would show in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   So when the offer came half a dozen years ago to join the US
national team, Dooley jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Germany, almost everyone likes America,'' he says. ``You
see so many magazines and movies and TV shows. Young people
especially would love to visit there, even for a few weeks. So when
they ask me, I say, `Of course I want to play there.' It wasn't a
strange thing because my whole life I wanted to go to America.''
</P>
<P>
   America represented more than an adventure to Dooley. It meant a
chance to do the one thing he had never done _ and never would _
for Germany: play in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that good,'' Dooley shrugs. ``I was probably in the
top third of the league in man-marking, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   So the German federation had no problem with a guy named Dooley
playing for the Yanks _ especially at his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 30 when I left,'' he says. ``If I was maybe 22, they
might have said something.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Van Halen kid arrived in his spiritual home (somebody had
given him the Kingston Trio's ``Tom Dooley'' when he was 7), and
was fascinated. The skyscrapers he saw in Chicago delighted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many high-rise buildings in Germany,'' Dooley
says. ``Only in Frankfurt.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was enthralled by California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the beaches, we went to Disneyland,'' he says.
``And Los Angeles is not a bad town.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he opened his mouth that Dooley realized how
American he wasn't. He turned up in camp and couldn't understand a
thing. Paul Caligiuri, who roomed with Dooley and played in the
Bundesliga, became his round-the-clock translator. In uniform,
though, Dooley needed no translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the field you don't have to talk,'' he says. ``Soccer has
its own language.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley's fluency with the ball was beyond question. The
Americans, who'd gone three-and-out in the 1990 World Cup, were
desperate for a seasoned Renaissance man who felt as comfortable
going forward as defending. Dooley, who'd been playing as a central
defender for Kaiserslautern, stepped in and started immediately.
</P>
<P>
   His mates quickly learned to look for him just about anywhere _
buttoning up the back line, prowling the midfield, dashing to open
space in his scarlet boots, even putting the ball in the back of
the net. Dooley's goals didn't come against Third World sides in
offseason friendlies, either. He scored against England in the huge
victory at Foxborough in 1993 and tallied twice against Germany in
a 4-3 loss that convinced the Americans that they could play with
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley quickly became the indispensable man, guaranteed to get
the call whenever the Yanks had to win. He was the only US
midfielder to play every minute of the last World Cup, and he never
left the field in last year's final five qualifying matches.
</P>
<P>
   When captain John Harkes had to sit out the crucial match
against Canada in Vancouver in November with a yellow-card
suspension, coach Steve Sampson handed the armband to Dooley.
``Bring the team to France today,'' Sampson urged him.
</P>
<P>
   When Sampson dumped Harkes from the roster in April, he went to
Dooley again before an important tuneup at Austria and gave him the
armband for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I would like to take some more responsibility,''
Dooley says. ``I said, `Of course I want to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he'll lead the American side in the biggest match
they've played since they met Brazil in the last Cup quarterfinals
before a full house in the Rose Bowl on the fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   It will be an odd thing to stand on the sideline and hear the
anthem of the country where he and his wife, Elke, and his two
children were born and his mother still lives and whose language he
speaks and then play against its team, all of whose members he
knows well. But Dooley says it will not be emotional. He will not
feel torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never went into the German army,'' Dooley says. ``I never
played for the national team, never had the German anthem played
for myself. If something like that had happened, it would be
different.''
</P>
<P>
   He plays for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer now, and
when he retires from the game, he may well live in the States
forever.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yanks win Monday, Dooley has joked that he'll fly to
Berlin, rent a car, and drive through Germany with the stars and
stripes fluttering from the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked my Dad (stepfather) if he would wear an American
jersey,'' Dooley says. ``He said, `No, no, no, I am a German.' But
my mother told him, `If you jump up and cheer when Germany scores,
I will hit you with an umbrella.'''

DEVIL RAYS FELT CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Hatcher, the former Red Sox outfielder who is now a coach
with the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays, had a simple piece of
advice for his outfielders when the team arrived at Fenway Park
Thursday: Don't be intimidated by the Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to teach them how to play the ball off the
wall,'' Hatcher said, as he sat in the visitors' clubhouse after
Saturday's game was rained out. ``You don't want to get caught on
the wall, because it's going to kick back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to tell them to make sure you've got a step on the
grass, so when the ball bounces, it won't bounce over your head and
you'll have an opportunity to throw somebody out at second.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-1 loss to the Red Sox Friday night, the Devil Rays may
have soaked up the atmosphere in their first visit to Fenway Park,
but it was their outfielders who attempted to soak up the knowledge
of how to play one of the most unique and challenging outfields in
all of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that there are so many different angles,'' Hatcher
said. ``The ball will bounce different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely those times when a baseball caroms wildly off
the scoreboard in left, takes a funny hop off the wall, or darts
into one of Fenway's more unique corners that a major league
outfielder can look as silly as a Keystone Kop.
</P>
<P>
   After all, venerable Fenway is where right and center fielders
must learn to cope with the idiosyncrasies of angles, nooks,
crannies; and where the left fielder must constantly joust with the
Green Monster, the 37-foot wall that presides majestically over the
greensward in left.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Arrojo, the rookie pitcher from Cuba who started Friday
night's game for Tampa Bay, said he was unaware of the Wall when he
took the mound. He hardly noticed it. ``Maybe I'll notice it now,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the case for left fielder Randy Winn, who also
was playing at Fenway for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit overwhelming,'' said Winn, who became
intimately acquainted with The Wall when he crashed into it trying
to field a line drive in Boston's three-run eighth inning. ``It
makes you feel like you're playing really shallow. You do have to
play shallow, because if they hit it up in the air, it'll hit off
the wall. It does make it seem like you're playing right in the
shortstop's back pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a place for the claustrophobic, is it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that bad, but it definitely can change the pace of
the game,'' said Winn. ``Because balls you would have a chance to
catch are going to either hit off the wall for a single, or maybe a
close play at second, or a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out early and took some balls off of it, but it's
different when somebody's throwing balls off of it, or hitting
fungoes off of it. The next best thing other than game experience
is probably batting practice, and we didn't have a chance to get
out there for batting practice because of the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to be careful when you go back there, you have
to know where you are and if you're near the scoreboard. Balls are
going to come off it different. There's a ladder there and the
scoreboard, and it can come off the face of the scoreboard, the top
of the scoreboard, so it's going to take some different bounces.
The center fielder has to come and back you up, because you never
know where it's going to hit, and that's one of the
idiosyncrasies.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't that the charm of Fenway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes it is,'' Winn said. ``But with all the little corners and
stuff, experience is going to be the best teacher. It's a good
experience and it's fun to play, but, like I said, you're not going
to feel really comfortable out there until you play a few games.''

PATRIOTS WILL RUN ON FRESH LEGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The shadow of Bill Parcells lingers in New England. Pete
Carroll perhaps never will escape it, unless the Patriots win a
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But the shadow isn't so annoying as Carroll enters his second
year at the helm a year wiser and, one would assume,
better-equipped to run the team.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Parcells mystique, Carroll said, ``I knew coming
into the job that it would always be there, and it's there for
people to bring up from time to time. That's fine. It doesn't
bother me. Bill Parcells is a great coach who has championship
rings. I don't have any yet. I don't have that type of respect. And
I shouldn't have it because if I did, I wouldn't have earned it. I
don't want something for nothing. I'm looking forward to getting
it, and that's what we're trying to build here.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Keith Byars, now a New York Jet with Parcells, was right
last week when he said, ``Pete's a good coach, but he's a work in
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll heard the comment and wanted no part of a response,
especially to an ex-player. They're gone and forgotten as far as
Carroll is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, he has rid himself of the reminders of the
former coach _ Byars, Dave Meggett, Sam Gash. Curtis Martin was
one, too, though Carroll never wished to lose the All-Pro runner.
</P>
<P>
   For all the criticism Carroll and Bobby Grier receive for this,
wouldn't any coach want to bring in his own players? Why else would
Parcells sign up so many ex-Patriots, just as he signed many
ex-Giants when he was here?
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are changing their face and acquiring players
Carroll thinks will be more productive in the long run. In the
process, they are losing valuable experience and leadership _ some
think too much of it. Some preseason publications already have the
Patriots third behind the Jets and Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the team from afar, it's easy to see why that's so.
Martin, Meggett, Byars, and Gash are gone. That's an entire
backfield, and the guys who would stand up and get others in line
if things weren't going well.
</P>
<P>
   The motto now is: ``Young, fast, and strong.'' That's the type
of team Carroll wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, after we've gone through training camp and we start
the season, we'll find that we've upgraded the athleticism of this
team,'' he said. ``Our young guys are fast and strong. You hate to
lose leadership, but in the end it's which team has the most
talented players.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, fast, and strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Pete's team, no question,'' said strong safety Lawyer
Milloy. ``Bill Parcells is gone. The philosophy is different. It's
changed. It is what it is now. It's not like the Parcells days.
These are the Carroll days now.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that means kinder and gentler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Coach Carroll's approach,'' said first-round pick
Tebucky Jones. ``I played for coaches who were constantly
screaming. Pete is more laidback.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people hate to hear that. They equate laidback with soft,
with a coach who lets his players run the ship. But Carroll gets
his points across. If you're not willing to pay the price of being
young, fast, and strong, you're gone. There isn't a lot of hype
associated with it. It just happens.
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Jimmy Hitchcock. The cornerback improved leaps
and bounds from the year before and gave the Patriots a quality
performance for someone who was picked on so often. Hitchcock was
replaced, however.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is being asked to be the starting right corner, even
though he has played defensive back _ and strong safety, at that _
for only two years. But Jones is the classic Carroll player: young,
fast, and strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him on film and he caught my eye,'' said Carroll.
``I thought to myself that he could be a player who could fit into
our scheme and into our plans beautifully. He's big, aggressive,
and he loves to play. I just knew that this is the type of kid who
could help our football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we'd love for him to play the right corner, and I
think he could be a good NFL corner, but if he needs more time, I
know Tebucky Jones is going to be a factor for this team somewhere
on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   If Carroll is paying special attention to Jones, who has been
set back by a hamstring pull, it's because his one regret from last
year is that he didn't do enough developing of young players. He
second-guesses himself a lot on Sedrick Shaw, whom he wishes he had
brought along quicker _ particularly after Martin went down with an
injured abdominal muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was so much going on with my first year and
trying to get things organized that one thing I didn't do as much
of was develop the young players,'' said Carroll. ``We're going to
do that all through the year. What we want to accomplish is a
situation where the young players can push the veterans and if a
veteran misses some time with injuries we can bring a young guy in
and we won't lose a step. That's what we're trying to create in
everything we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition in camp is going to be greater than it's ever
been. We have competition everywhere on the field. And it's the
players who are up for that competition who will benefit the
most.''
</P>
<P>
   One place where it'll be fierce is the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if our young linemen can unseat the veterans, but
they're going to get a chance to do it,'' said Carroll. ``I know
right now Heath Irwin is in his third year and he seems the
best-equipped to step in and take a job. He's about 300 pounds,
which is about the size of a Todd Rucci. Damon (Denson) could also
be a guy who's ready. Scott (Rehberg) and Ed (Ellis) have worked so
hard to improve and they'll get their shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wasn't pleased with Zefross Moss's conditioning at the
mini-camp and acknowledged that Bruce Armstrong was heavier than he
expected. But Armstrong has a history of being in shape when the
bell rings, said Carroll, so he isn't worried. Moss, though,
``doesn't have that history,'' said the coach. ``He needs to come
to camp in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   On the subject of Terry Glenn, Carroll isn't going to make
excuses for the Patriots' offense based on whether Glenn plays or
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs all six weeks before camp to have a good offseason,''
said Carroll. ``He doesn't have any more restrictions from his
injury. At this point, it's all up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The attitude on Glenn gives hope to Vincent Brisby, who was
heading to the salary-cap scrap heap but now appears to be back in
good standing if he performs up to his $1.2 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie (Zampese) is used to having a big receiver in his
offense and they're hard to find,'' said Carroll. ``We have one
right here on our team, so Vincent will get his opportunity to
assume that role.''
</P>
<P>
   It is assumed that the Patriots' defense will pick up where it
left off, but Carroll is cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't played yet,'' he said. ``We can't assume anything.
We have to approach it with the right attitude. I think we have a
nice blend of veterans and younger guys. We have Henry Thomas and
Willie Clay and Willie (McGinest), Ted (Johnson), and Chris
(Slade). We're hoping to get Brandon Mitchell integrated into the
line rotation inside. Our linebackers are pretty set, but we'd like
to see Tedy Bruschi continue to compete with Todd (Collins) for
more playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is thrilled with his young cornerbacks: Jones, Terry
Billups, Mark Tate, and Kato Serwanga. They're raw, but fast. He
has Steve Israel returning, and the team is also considering
Pittsburgh veteran Donnell Woolford if they need a stopgap.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll feels younger, faster players will be better on special
teams. He thinks Jones, Harold Shaw, Chris Floyd, et al will be
much better cover men than some of the veterans who have departed.
</P>
<P>
   Where he may feel the pinch is replacing Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Troy Brown is my punt returner,'' said Carroll. ``I
feel comfortable with Troy back there. But here's a case where this
will be wide-open competition. We have guys like Chris Canty and
Tony Gaiter who could take the job. Tony has great moves. He had an
excellent minicamp, but what Tony has to show is that he can stay
on his feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has seen a renewed urgency in Canty's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some really good things in minicamp,'' said Carroll.
``For one thing he's in much better shape than he was last year at
this time and we're seeing the benefit of that. He seems to be
taking everything more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that attitude due to the threat of Jones?
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be part of it,'' said Carroll. ``That's what I mean
about creating competition. If these guys can feel it and if they
compete like, `You're not going to take this away from me,' that
makes our entire organization so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll thinks he has enough veterans to offset the loss of
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that Bruce is a strong voice on this team and on our
offense,'' he said. ``Shawn Jefferson does some great leadership
things and Drew (Bledsoe) seems to be taking more on every year. I
don't want to overload Drew with that and I didn't want him to step
out of character to do something he's not comfortable with, but
within what he is able to offer, I think you'll see him show more.
</P>
<P>
   ``On defense, we have a bunch of guys like Chris, Willie
McGinest, Willie Clay, Ted, Ty, Lawyer _ they're all assuming more
in that area. Larry Whigham is a guy that gets the team going, so
that's why I believe we're all right in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is looking forward to the rivalries and the competition
in the division. Jimmy Johnson will be gunning for revenge after
the Patriots beat the Dolphins three times last season, including
in the first round of the playoffs. Parcells, against whom the
Patriots split, always has incentive to beat his old team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the challenge that gets the juices flowing,'' said
Carroll. ``Anytime you can compete with coaches with those
credentials and beat them, it's a great feeling. I enjoyed
competing against Marv (Levy) and I know his leaving (Buffalo) is
tough on me personally because I've always admired him. But now
Wade (Phillips) has the challenge of having to replace Marv.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a personal relationship with Jimmy or Bill and I
probably never will, but I think the battles we'll have on the
field will be interesting and competitive and it'll keep everyone's
interest level high.''
</P>
<P>
   In Carroll's first year in New England, when he had to deal with
the pressure of replacing Parcells, getting organized, and
implementing new systems, the Patriots made it to the second round
of the playoffs. It was a step back from a Super Bowl appearance,
but the Patriots did not fall on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that, with Martin, with Gash, with Byars, and with
Meggett, the 1997 Patriots didn't have a good offense (except for
the first four games). Now they'll get to start fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any silver lining, that's it,'' said Carroll.
``We'll be able to replace some of those offensive players with
more athletic players.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, fast, and strong.

   With a snap of the fingers, the New York Legislature approved
$95 million in improvements for Rich Stadium in Buffalo, all of it
to come out of taxpayers' pockets ... Those in the political loop
in Providence are saying they fully expect another dance with the
Patriots before all is said and done. Hartford is certainly
stepping up, trying to include the Patriots in their $1 billion
downtown project that would include a domed stadium.  &UR; Bob Kraft
 &LR; remains mum, indicating the team's first priority remains a new
stadium in Foxborough ... A huge boost for the Patriots is the
return of veteran end  &UR; Ferric Collons &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is considered their
best run-stopper on the line. Collons missed half the season after
undergoing surgery on a chest muscle. ``Ferric coming back should
be a big factor for us,'' said line coach  &UR; Ray Hamilton &LR; . ``I think
he's hungry to play again after missing so much time last year with
his injury. We have a chance to have a very competitive camp and
hopefully guys will come in with the attitude that they want
someone's job.'' ... There are some players upset about contracts
they signed a year sooner than they probably should have. San
Diego's  &UR; Junior Seau  &LR; is a prime example. He missed the first two
days of the team's voluntary minicamp apparently because he is
unhappy with the five-year, $27.1 million deal he signed last year.
Seau disputed that, saying he was on a family vacation. San Diego
general manager  &UR; Bobby Beathard  &LR; and coach  &UR; Kevin Gilbride  &LR; fumed
at the no-show, considering that the Chargers were 4-12 a year ago
and Seau is supposed to be the team leader. He sets a great example
for top draft pick  &UR; Ryan Leaf &LR; . GMs and coaches are watching to see
what the effect of the big contracts will be around the league,
especially in the wake of the windfall television deal. ``It's
something we have to monitor closely,'' said Carroll. ``All of a
sudden, guys who were making decent money are making more money
than they'll ever need.'' ... Another late arriver to camp was
Buffalo running back  &UR; Thurman Thomas &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was coaching his
daughter's softball team. He had missed a previous camp to take
part in a football clinic in Houston. Thomas admitted he was a
little peeved about his role not being defined after 10 years with
the Bills. ``I wasn't that upset,'' said Thomas, ``but I felt like
I was here for 10 years and I thought I would have been told what
my role was going to be.'' If you're thinking trade with the
Patriots, forget it. Same division, and the Patriots wouldn't give
up draft picks ... The 49ers have made  &UR; Jerry Rice  &LR; take it easy as
he returns from his knee injury. He should be ready by the July 21
training camp. Unfortunately, the 49ers' offensive line is in
disarray. Replenishing it was their one big need and they haven't
done it well.

   The news gets better for Boston University punter and kickoff
man  &UR; Ed Costello &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was signed by the Bengals. Cincinnati
veteran  &UR; Lee Johnson  &LR; is talking about retiring, conceding that he
can't kick as well as Costello anymore. ``I can't beat out a young
leg like that,'' Johnson said. ``I know because I had one once.''
... The Bears appear close to downsizing quarterback  &UR; Rick Mirer's
 &LR; five-year, $10 million contract ... Days after giving up a
fifth-rounder to obtain veteran defensive tackle  &UR; Shawn Lee  &LR; from
the Chargers, the Bears released troubled defensive end  &UR; Alonzo
Spellman  &LR; Friday. The Bears were fed up with Spellman, who
following an injury-plagued season wound up in a psychiatric ward
earlier this year after barricading himself in the home of his
publicist ... Former Vikings owner  &UR; Mike Lynn &LR;  is actually thinking
about putting together a group to buy the team back. The money here
is on  &UR; Carl Pohlad &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Minnesota Twins owner. One of the richest
men in America, Pohlad helped ruin the baseball franchise with his
penny-pinching ... The Raiders are expected to receive a
compensatory pick between the first and second round next year
following the death of Washington State lineman  &UR; Leon Bender &LR; ,
their second-round pick this year &UR;  &LR; ... One complaint heard at the
Patriots' fan day last week at Foxboro Stadium is that not enough
fans got autographs because players were able to sign only for
those leaning over the railings ...  &UR; Vinny Testaverde &LR; , released by
the Ravens, has been talking all week to the Bengals, but things
hit a snag late in the week ... For what it's worth _ and maybe
that's not a whole lot _ Bledsoe and  &UR; Scott Zolak  &LR; have been
together as starter and backup longer than any other quarterback
tandem in the league: six years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When the National Hockey League's general managers sit down in
Washington Tuesday to recommend rule changes, Washington's George
McPhee believes there will be strong support to put a second
referee on the ice next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would endorse it,'' said McPhee, who doesn't believe there
will be an excessive amount of tinkering with the game's on-ice
guidelines. ``It would give them more confidence and they'd be able
to cover more areas of the ice. A lot of the stuff that goes on now
is what is happening behind the play, and one ref can't see
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, two refs won't see it all, either, but there is no
doubt a second voice of authority out there would clean up much of
the junk. Under the current structure, linesmen have limited
jurisdiction to chime in when they feel absolutely necessary, but
the truth is, they keep to calling the lines and stopping the
fights. The latter isn't nearly as necessary as it was, say, 5 or
10 years ago, and the game at large has become far faster over the
last couple of decades, placing greater strain on referees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, the league was very different,'' said
McPhee. ``The skaters weren't as good; they weren't as fast. I
honestly believe it would be better with two referees. The job's
just too hard now.''
</P>
<P>
   A second referee not only would make the workplace a more level
playing field, it could add years to referees' careers. Ideally,
the older the referee, the better his judgment, discretion, and
overall feel for the game. Play is so fast that referees are ready
to be phased out by their early 40s, their legs unable to keep up
with the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy in his late 40s, the first thing to go are his wheels,''
said NHL vice president Brian Burke. ``Usually you find that his
vision is fine and his judgment is great, but he doesn't always
have the speed. The NBA has guys on the job into their 60s. We want
to keep our best refs out there as long as possible. We've
experimented with this in preseason, and in games with two refs,
the average time of game has dropped by 14 minutes _ that's huge.
With two refs, you get less nonsense going on out there.''
</P>
<P>
   A second referee on the sheet could give the top whistleblowers
another 10 years on the job, and it undoubtedly would encourage
more en-listees. Earning power isn't bad: Senior referees make some
$200,000 per annum. Tack on another 10 years of earning power,
giving a guy a reasonable expectation to work 25 years, and there
should be no shortage of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   If it passes, the move to a second ref likely would come at the
cost of a linesman. Games still would be governed by three on-ice
officials, but it would be two referees and one linesman rather
than one referee and two linesmen. The league could give some of
their current linesmen a chance to move up to the referee ranks or
sweeten the pot for some of the older officials to retire.
</P>
<P>
   US college hockey introduced a two-ref system four years ago, in
the CCHA. Now, all of college hockey has had at least two years of
employing two refs. Hockey East commissioner Joe Bertagna has been
impressed with the mechanics and feels it makes for a better game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the ref, and then two assistant refs, AR-1 and AR-2 _
to the point that we've done away with the `linesman'
designation,'' he said, noting that the second assistant still
whistles offside calls. ``It's that first assistant who stays
behind the play and serves as that constant reminder to the
players, telling them, `OK, cut it out back here.' It's that stuff
behind the play that really can turn into trouble, things that can
get ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some colleges have the bigger, Olympic-sized sheets for their
home surfaces, another factor that moved colleges to use two refs,
said Bertagna. The bigger the rink and the older the ref, the
greater the chance that a senior official won't be able to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping your senior, or `A-group,' officials working as long
as possible is important,'' said Bertagna. ``You want those guys
with great presence out there, guys with judgment and a real feel
for the game. But if you've got this huge surface, and a guy who's
maybe a little long in the tooth, you're scared that he might not
be able to be around the net when a goal's scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the NHL adopt the idea? Yes, at least in part. If not
ratified in full, look for the idea to be implemented as an
experiment, with perhaps each of the 27 NHL rinks having at least
two games with two refs. Some GMs have to be convinced that it's
the way to go. Once they see the improvement it makes, they'll
endorse it in full for 1999-2000.

   For those who remember  &UR; Dale Hunter  &LR; nearly decapitating
then-Bruin  &UR; Craig Janney  &LR; in the 1990 conference finals, or maybe
his pitchfork-like spear to  &UR; Terry O'Reilly's  &LR; groin when Hunter
was a Nordique, it's hard to imagine the Capitals' tough guy being
glorified. ``When I played against him, I thought he was a real
(expletive),'' said Washington teammate  &UR; Adam Oates &LR; . ``But it's
almost like a  &UR; Cal Ripken  &LR; situation: In 18 years, only once has he
missed games due to injury. Once! You look at the years, the games,
the numbers, everything, and you don't hear anyone mention him for
the Hall of Fame. But I mean, what have you got to do?'' ... McPhee
on the club he inherited last summer after the Capitals fired
longtime GM  &UR; David Poile &LR; : ``He deserves most of the credit here,
he and (the late)  &UR; Jack Button  &LR; and the whole scouting staff. They
did a great job building this team. All we've done is rearrange the
furniture, added a chair or two, and reupholstered a little.''
Perhaps the most valuable change was adding veteran forward  &UR; Brian
Bellows  &LR; for a total cost of around $40,000 in the stretch run.
Once the Capitals signed Bellows, he had to clear waivers, and
another NHL squad could have taken him for the $40,000 _ with the
understanding that he wouldn't have been eligible for the playoffs.
Byzantine, ain't it? ``There were some clubs out there who weren't
happy that we grabbed him,'' said McPhee. Nonetheless, no one
wanted to spend the $40,000, essentially to keep him away from the
Capitals _ what would have amounted to paying a kill fee. Remember,
it was Bellows who beat  &UR; Byron Dafoe  &LR; on a long bomb to clinch the
Boston series. And it was Bellows who muscled the puck to the net
in Buffalo, allowing  &UR; Joe Juneau  &LR; to knock in the series clincher
against the Sabres ... Rumor has it that Poile, now running the
expansion Nashville Predators, soon will acquire veteran blue liner
 &UR; Paul Coffey  &LR; from the Flyers. The Flyers want Coffey gone, which
could be bad timing, because Coffey should be a better player if
the league continues to crack down on obstruction calls (i.e. he
still can skate with the best of 'em). Coffey will make $2.9
million next season, and the Flyers might absorb two-thirds of that
just to move him, and pick up a draft pick or two from the
Predators ... You know it's a whole new era when ESPN is televising
Pro Beach Hockey. When do we see Indoor Water Surfing? ... The idea
of a woman entering the NHL on-ice officiating ranks has been
dormant the last couple of years. But with the outstanding
performances of both the US and Canadian women hockey players at
the Olympics, wouldn't it make great sense to see some of them,
those ready to leave their playing careers, try to move into the
NHL officiating ranks? There is not one good reason for a woman to
be denied a chance at becoming a ref. ``I think it's a great
idea,'' said Burke. ``The NBA has two women officiating, why not
hockey? It's only a matter of time.'' A case could be made that a
linesman must break up fights and a lineswoman might not be able to
handle it. But that depends on the woman. And it's a free world. If
she wants to get smacked around by  &UR; Eric Lindros &LR; , &UR; Chris Simon,  &LR; et
al, then welcome to the boys' club. Team USA's  &UR; Karyn Bye &LR; : &UR;  &LR; ``I
could see a woman doing it, if she could survive the junior and
minor league ranks, why not? Personally, I wouldn't be interested.
I refed a mite game back in my hometown, River Falls, Wis. It was a
boys game, and the parents booed the daylights out of me because I
was a girl. That was back in the '80s, and I'm sure things have
changed, but it still wouldn't interest me.'' ... Edmonton
president/GM  &UR; Glen Sather  &LR; recently let moviemakers use his home in
Canmore, Alberta, for the filming of ``Mystery, Alaska.'' In the
movie, Sather's house is the home of  &UR; Burt Reynolds &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the Mystery
coach who directs his ragtag bunch of hockey players in a game
against the mighty New York Rangers. Sather's son,  &UR; Justin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; suits
up for the Rangers _ something his dad once did ...  &UR; Mark Recchi
 &LR; is looking for a new deal in Montreal that will pay him $7 million
a year. He is using new deals for  &UR; Mats Sundin  &LR; and  &UR; Mike Modano
 &LR; as his comps ... Habs fans in a recent poll by the Journal de
Montreal were adamant about not having  &UR; Vincent Damphousse  &LR; back
next year. It's one thing to be French-Canadian, but loyalty only
goes so far _ and not so far as 16 goals for $3 million ... Dallas
coach  &UR; Ken Hitchcock  &LR; worked two playoff series while suffering the
high fever and swollen glands that are part of mononucleosis ...
The Flames are willing to swap  &UR; Theo Fleury  &LR; and their No. 6
first-round pick to San Jose for the No. 2 pick. If they strike a
deal, the Sharks might look to send  &UR; Owen Nolan  &LR; to the Flames, too
... Former goalie  &UR; Mike Liut  &LR; is the latest to become an agent ...
Wildest rumor making the rounds at the finals: Pittsburgh to send

   Conditioning guru  &UR; Mike Boyle &LR; , his Sports Acceleration North
running at warp speed in Burlington, reports that Jumbo  &UR; Joe
Thornton  &LR; now weighs about 220 _ that's 25 pounds above his draft
weight. ``I see him every day, and even I notice the difference,''
remarked Boyle, who also has Bruins  &UR; Hal Gill &LR; , &UR; Steve Heinze &LR; , &UR; Kyle
McLaren &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Shawn Bates  &LR; going through daily paces. ``Guys like
 &UR; Joe Sacco  &LR; and  &UR; Ted Drury  &LR; are here, too, and they see him now and
say, `My God, he's big.''' Thornton's emphasis isn't solely on
adding upper-body mass, but also powering up his legs. ``You could
see last year that he needed leg strength,'' said Bruins assistant
GM  &UR; Mike O'Connell &LR; . ``If he adds that strength, he won't be
knocked off stride as easily, and overall getting bigger and
stronger should add to his confidence out there.'' ... O'Connell
reports that Group 2 free agents McLaren and  &UR; Jason Allison  &LR; will
see their new contract offers on or before July 1, as provided in
the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Each one, he said, can expect
the minimum 10 percent increase over their now-expired contracts.
McLaren made $750,000 last year, Allison $600,000. It's just a
starting point, folks. Both McLaren and Allison easily can justify
asking for about $2.5 million a year, based on comparable salaries
around the league. If they want to go long-term, say four or five
years, they justifiably could ask for $3 million a year or more ...
If the Bruins go shopping for free agents, they'll do it with an
eye on beefing up their Providence (AHL) squad. `` &UR; Pat
 &LR; ( &UR; Burns &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; did a great job making our younger guys feel
important,'' said O'Connell. ``And next year we want our young guys
to bring it up another level _ guys like Thornton,
( &UR; P.J. &LR; ) &UR; Axelsson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ( &UR; Sergei &LR; ) &UR; Samsonov  &LR; and ( &UR; Anson &LR; ) &UR; Carter &LR; . If
we fooled around too much with the roster, it might inhibit their
growth, and we're hoping some of our other youngs like
( &UR; Cameron &LR; ) &UR; Mann &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Bates, and ( &UR; Randy Robitaille &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; can step it up
next year, too. It could change, but right now that's the way we're
looking to go.'' ... Word around the rink is that the NHL slapped
Penguins part-owner  &UR; Roger Marino  &LR; with a $10,000 fine for comments
here three weeks ago critical of the league for not enforcing rules
better on obstruction. To wit: ``The game, in general, has slowed
to a crawl. We have to let our stars play, like the NBA lets its
stars like ( &UR; Michael &LR; ) &UR; Jordan  &LR; play. I've got twin 8-year-old boys,
and if I didn't own a hockey team, I'd never let 'em watch it.'' So
there's the lesson of the day: speak the truth, and pay for it. It
gets more bizarre out here, shift by shift ... Bertagna's
goaltending camps, now in their 25th summer and operating in five
rinks in Hingham, Burlington, Marlborough, Hamilton, and Hooksett,
N.H., still have a few openings (more info: 978-283-2662). ``We're
always looking for that next  &UR; Mike Richter &LR; ,'' said Bertagna.
``He's probably our most visible alum.'' ... Burke, who wants to
return to being a GM, a post he held in Hartford, has interviewed
in Atlanta and Vancouver, where he was the Canucks' assistant GM
prior to McPhee. ``I've had interviews in both places, but there's
been no followup, other than one brief conversation I had,'' said
Burke. One possible reason for the delay in both cities: Sather has
been recruited by both the Thrashers and Canucks. No one truly
expects Sather to leave the Oilers, but no one wants to hire anyone
else in the meantime. To wit: Anaheim's assistant GM,  &UR; David McNab
 &LR; (brother of  &UR; Peter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former Bruin), was a candidate in
Atlanta, until the Ducks got fed up with Atlanta's indecision and
withdrew permission for McNab to continue negotiations.

   ST.-DENIS, France _ The Netherlands entered the World Cup with
the recent play and confidence of potential world champions, but
settled for a disappointing 0-0 draw with Belgium Saturday night
after losing forward Patrick Kluivert to a red card for what
appeared to be an insignificant elbow late in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands had plenty of opportunities to score, but could
not convert. Striker Dennis Bergkamp returned in the second half
after being out for six weeks with a hamstring injury, but he
missed an opportunity in the 73rd minute, shanking a left-footed
shot from 10 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   With nine minutes remaining, Kluivert was shoved slightly by
Belgian defender Lorenzo Staelens, then wagged his finger and gave
Staelens a small retaliatory jab in the chest with his elbow.
Staelens appeared to take a dive, but Referee Pierluigi Collina of
Italy drew the red card and sent Kluivert off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Even a man down, the Dutch had a great chance to score in the
88th minute when Frank de Boer redirected a volley from the corner
toward the left post, only to have the ball kicked away by Belgian
defender Eric Deflandre.
</P>
<P>
   Deflandre saved two goals Saturday night after coming on in the
22nd minute to try to contain the speed of the Netherlands' Marc
Overmars on the left wing.

JAZZ NEED AN ENCORE

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The arrogance of Chicago is more than a
thousand miles to the east. The champagne remains corked in
Illinois as the NBA Finals return to this dry state populated by
disciples of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
</P>
<P>
   There is redemption in the fresh air here. Karl Malone has shed
the goat horns and answered critics who suggested he's a fraud _ no
better in the big games than Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The Utah Jazz didn't make any foolish declarations after their
narrow, party-spoiling Game 5 victory at the United Center Friday,
but it was clear that they took satisfaction in denying Chicago the
opportunity to win the championship at home.
</P>
<P>
   The final running of the Bulls has taken on a life of its own
and, frankly, it's getting a little nauseating. It is the American
sports equivalent of the last ``Seinfeld'' episode, and there has
been no allowance that the Bulls could lose.
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Chicago were supposed to be flowing with
champagne after Friday night's game, but Malone &AMP; Co. spoiled the
fun and stopped the hideous debate about which Bull star deserved
to be Series MVP (LA fans were debating this very topic in 1984 _
Magic or Worthy? _ right up until the Celtics won the Series).
</P>
<P>
   Malone scored 39 points Friday night, including several
``(expletive) you'' jumpers right in the face of Dennis Rodman, the
attention-starved nitwit who ridiculed Malone as ``an awkward
player.'' Rodzilla said Malone could not beat him off the dribble,
so Malone did that, too, scoring on a finger roll after blowing
past Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago may yet win the series, but Utah at least was able to
salvage its reputation. Just when it looked as if the Jazz were
emerging as the Buffalo Bills of the NBA, grizzled vets Malone,
John Stockton, and fearless Antoine Carr proved there is a pulse in
the Utah locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago guard Steve Kerr conceded, ``The Jazz players were
sitting in their hotel watching all the stories about Grant Park
(where a championship rally is planned) and the police telling
people not to riot. The whole city seemed to be poised for a
celebration and I'm sure it ticked them off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Karl was going to come out and play,'' said Carr, a man
who's been around long enough to remember Larry Bird going for 60
in New Orleans against Atlanta in 1985. ``He had that anger in his
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no anger in Malone's voice. None. He wouldn't go for
the bait after losing Game 2 at home, after the historic Game 3
42-point drubbing, or after the Game 4 loss that caused Hoop Nation
to question his heart and his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to read the paper,'' said Malone. ``And I realize
all the stuff that's being said. Unfortunately, you don't have the
game you want to have all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he relaxed on Thursday by going out in a State Police
cruiser and weighing some trucks. Such fun. And he wasn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went out and canned 17 of 27 shots, grabbing 9 rebounds,
and dishing out 5 assists. He scored 17 points in the third
quarter, when Utah had its best run of the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said, ``For all the criticism he's received in this
playoff, I think he put a lot of things to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone didn't want to field a lot of questions about himself
after the victory. At one point, he said he would leave the podium
if asked another Karl Malone question.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to remember this right here,'' he said. ``It's a
team game. No matter what an individual guy does on this team,
we're going to win it or lose it together. I know it sounds corny
nowadays, but that's what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a corny guy. The Jazz are a corny team. Utah doesn't have
a loathed owner bent on tearing the team apart. Utah doesn't have a
Zen-master coach who wants to head to the mountains. There are no
free agent superstars pleading to leave town, or teasing fans with
veiled hints at retirement. There's no childish idiot skipping
practice to break chairs over someone's head at a wrestling event.
And there's no debate about which Jazz player should be the series
MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the Jazz have just been the straight men for the
Bulls, setting up punch lines for Chicago's arrogant team and fans.
And the Jazz were downright bad in Games 3 and 4, and the first
half of Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is really nervous in Chicago. Not yet. Friday's loss was
just another interruption of the music for the last dance.
</P>
<P>
   But what if Malone and the Jazz win again tonight? What then?

OWNER PLAYING GAMES

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ The owner of the Chicago Bulls has, by my count
anyway, twice violated his own pledge to keep his mouth shut on the
topic of next year until, well, next year. He did it once a couple
weeks ago. He did it again Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jerry Reinsdorf, there is no plan to break up the
Bulls. According to Jerry Reinsdorf, there have been no
contingencies expressed by Michael Jordan. Gee, you mean all those
forests have been pillaged for no good reason?
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf did insert a nifty qualifier in his latest discourse
on the topic. He doesn't want to break up the Bulls as long as they
are winning championships. Not winning. Winning championships.
</P>
<P>
   They may well get No. 6 tonight, so does that mean all this talk
about the Last Dance and Michael's Last Stand is mere rubbish?
Apparently so. All those stories about the breakup of the Bulls are
fit to wrap fish if Chicago wins tonight or Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be Red on Roundball to see what's going on
here. The owner is doing his best Pontius Pilate imitation.
Reinsdorf, who makes the final decision in consort with his
henchman, Jerry Krause, is saying it's not up to him. If Michael
retires, that's Michael's decision. If Scottie leaves, that's
Scottie's decision. If Phil goes, well, it was he who requested the
one-year deal, not us. If Bill Wennington goes, well, so what?
</P>
<P>
   As Reinsdorf said, ``It hasn't affected me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And what to make of this gem? ``Michael has never said anything
has to happen for him to return.'' Huh? Reinsdorf should have his
most computer-literate employee do a search with the words
``Jordan,'' ``Jackson,'' and ``retire'' and see how many stories
pop up. Now, having said that, Jordan may well find a way to squirm
out of his oft-professed stance of not to play for anyone but
Jackson. He has been known to change his mind, too.
</P>
<P>
   We have to figure that several key relationships here are beyond
repair, because it makes no sense for Reinsdorf to make drastic
changes. He has a good thing going. Additionally, one would think
the players might feel the same way. Just how bad can it be to be a
member of the Chicago Bulls these days, anyway? They are treated as
royalty everywhere they go. They win.
</P>
<P>
   We'll all have to wait, and the wait may be extended because of
this summer's labor situation. Reinsdorf can bide his time in his
box at Comiskey Park and watch Albert Belle, Wil Cordero, and the
rest of his irrelevant White Sox. He should know more than anyone
what it's like to run a sports franchise that operates in a vacuum.
He has one. Does he want another? Oops, I forgot. It's not his
call.

   The ongoing saga of North Korean center  &UR; Michael Ri  &LR; has taken
another step in what he hopes will be the direction of the NBA.
United States and South Korean officials have agreed to meet next
month in Honolulu to discuss easing of sanctions against the North.
Any agreement out of those sessions could lead to Ri's
availability. Guess who's interested in the 28-year-old,
7-foot-8-inch center? The Celtics. General manager  &UR; Chris Wallace
 &LR; called Ri's lawyer last week. Wallace, who has seen just about
everyone on the planet, has yet to see Ri in person or on tape. But
he's intrigued. ``You have to take anyone seriously who's that
big,'' Wallace said. ``He falls into that
( &UR; Gheorghe &LR; ) &UR; Muresan &LR; -( &UR; Mark &LR; ) &UR; Eaton  &LR; category, and the hard part
is figuring out where he fits in. It's a little different even with
a European, but this is a first: No one has ever come out of the
Orient.'' Although Ri did hold workouts in Canada for some teams,
the Celtics decided to wait.  &UR; Rick Pitino  &LR; is a hands-on guy who
would want to be there to see it. And, Wallace said, it's always
preferable to see the player in a game or have him work out the way
you want him to work out. ``We'll take a look at him before it's
all said and done and see if it makes sense for us. I hope he's
legit.'' ... A foreigner both legit and available (we think) is
Germany's  &UR; Dirk Nowitzki &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who turns 20 Friday. He has applied for
the draft as an early-entry candidate _ the deadline to withdraw is
Wednesday _ and he could be a player. He's listed as 6-11 and was
supposed to work out last week in Chicago but had to decline
because of military obligations of which he was unaware. ``He's a
combination forward, young, raw, but with a lot of talent,''
Wallace said. The consensus seems to be that Nowitzki would be a
lottery pick. However, he instead may accept a scholarship to a US
college or take lots of lire to play in Italy. Would the Celtics be
interested in Nowitzki at No. 10? Wallace said it wasn't out of the
question, but, ``Rick has never had foreign players in college or
the NBA,'' he said, forgetting  &UR; Zan Tabak &LR; . ``The thing you don't
know is how they would fit into the system that he likes to play.
It's not like anything they are used to.'' There's also the
contract issue. Some Europeans weigh the NBA and opt to stay
overseas for more seasoning/dolce vita. ``We can't wait a couple
years simply to get a kid into a Boston uniform,'' Wallace said.
``We're not going to sweat the contract stuff.'' ... While we're on
the subject, two other foreigners merit a brief note.  &UR; Vladimir
Stepenia  &LR; is a 21-year-old Georgian (Soviet Republic) who is 6-11
and played center last year for a team in Slovenia. He also
participated in a European all-star game, and among his teammates
was  &UR; Dino Radja &LR; . Stepenia held a workout in Chicago and didn't
exactly leave everyone drooling. Plus, his contract situation for
next season isn't clear. ``He's maybe a couple years away,''
Wallace said. Another is  &UR; Radoslav  &LR; ``Rasho''  &UR; Nesterovic &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
played last year for Eurochampion Kinder Bologna (a team chasing
Nowitzki). He's a 7-footer too, a native of Slovenia, but,
according to Wallace, has a year left on his contract. ``He still
could go to a team with multiple picks (Orlando, Houston) or to a
team drafting in the 20s who can afford to wait.''

   If the NBA imposes a lockout July 1, the players selected to
participate in the World Championships in Athens (July 29-Aug. 9)
will announce the next day their intent not to go. Then it will be
up to USA Basketball officials to get another roster and try to win
the gold medal, which gets them a bye into the Sydney Olympics. If
they don't, they may have to play a zone qualifier during the NBA
season (assuming there is an NBA season). But that's USA
Basketball's problem. The player agents are upset that commissioner
 &UR; David Stern  &LR; has equated the situation with ``trashing their
country,'' and one agent said he had been told that some players
already had been pressured by NBA security to participate. Sounds
like it's going to be a thermonuclear summer ... &UR; Kevin
Garnett &LR; , &UR; Bryant Reeves &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Corliss Williamson  &LR; represent the
only players from the 1995 draft lottery still with their original
team. Among the casualties of that lottery are No. 9 pick  &UR; Ed
O'Bannon &LR; , &UR;  &LR; last seen in the CBA;  &UR; Shawn Respert &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who may join
O'Bannon there soon; and  &UR; Kurt Thomas &LR; , &UR;  &LR; whose career hasn't gotten
off the ground because of injuries (he broke the same ankle four
times in one calendar year) ... The 76ers have had a slew of people
in for workouts and interviews, and they're all the same ones the
Celtics will be considering.  &UR; Larry Hughes &LR; , &UR; Michael Doleac &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and
 &UR; Bonzi Wells  &LR; were in over the weekend.  &UR; Nazr Mohammad  &LR; is due in
this week ...  &UR; Pervis Ellison  &LR; is concerned about his ankle, which
hasn't fully healed. Considering that he sprained it early last
season, there must be something else in there. Ellison has resumed
his weight training sessions with the maniacal  &UR; Bob Whelan  &LR; in
Washington, and also is scheduled to work on his conditioning this
summer ... Curious about the way the NBA decides who referees the
big playoff games? So were we. Here's the process, according to
league operations czar  &UR; Rod Thorn &LR; . There are 58 regular-season
referees, of which 32 are selected to work the playoffs. The field
is narrowed to 25 for the second round, 17 for the conference
finals, and 11 for the NBA Finals. There is an ongoing evaluation
process during the postseason, but, suffice to say, if a veteran
ref such as  &UR; Dick Bavetta  &LR; or  &UR; Joey Crawford  &LR; has a horrible game,
it won't stop him from moving on. The officials are paid depending
on what round they work, not on the number of games. And officials
are assigned only to games that are certain to be played; e.g.,
when the Finals started, only the first four games were assigned.
When Chicago won Game 2, the crew for the fifth game was notified.
For the first time in a long time, Thorn said, the NBA opted to
have three crew chiefs referee one game, the Eastern Conference
final between Chicago and Indiana. Of the 11 officials in the NBA
Finals, eight are crew chiefs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the zebras, Thorn was asked if he expected the IRS
hammer to drop after the playoffs. ``The government doesn't give us
any advance notice,'' he said. ``We heard they were going to do
something on April 15 and they didn't. We heard they were going to
do something before the start of the playoffs. They didn't. We
don't know.'' Thorn did say that while Stern has said the ousted
referees do not necessarily face a ``death sentence,'' he has heard
nothing further about rehiring them ... The Pacers know they have
 &UR; Rik Smits  &LR; and  &UR; Travis Best  &LR; as key free agent signees this
summer. There was conjecture that they also might have to deal with
 &UR; Jalen Rose &LR; . But, according to the team, that is not the case.
Rose signed a six-year deal when he was drafted by Denver and it
included an interesting ``out'' clause. It stipulated that Rose
could exercise the clause this summer but only if it made him a
restricted free agent, not an unrestricted one. The NBA did away
with restricted free agency in the last round of bargaining, so
Rose's clause is moot. He will earn $2.145 million next year and
$2.4375 million in 1999-2000, which is not a bad deal for a player
who, until this season, was generally deemed to be without a
position and without a clue ... We can fully understand the Lakers'
desire to deal  &UR; Elden Campbell &LR; . He has five years and $35 million
left on his contract. (Why is it that no one mentions his deal when
the talk concerns the genius of LA general manager  &UR; Jerry West &LR; ?)
But why would anyone (a) want him, despite his numbers, and (b)
want that contract on the cap? If West can unload him, then he is a
genius. He's also trying to unload  &UR; Nick Van Exel  &LR; (one year left
at $1.9 million), which may not be as hard a sell, although Van
Exel has some history.

REVOLUTION AIMING TO DOUSE FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ Both teams are on streaks. For New England, it's a
five-game losing skid. For the Chicago Fire, it's a six-game
winning string. If the Revolution have their way, both streaks will
come to an end Saturday when the Major League Soccer teams meet at
3 p.m. at sure-to-be-soggy Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of injuries and red cards has spelled doom for the
Revolution over the last six matches. A combination of a renewed
offense and a rock-solid defense has fueled the expansion Fire's
recent success. Chicago owns the league's top defense, allowing
just 15 goals in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in this league is at the beginning of the season,
coaches look at what they thought was going to work and then
there's an adjustment period and you go from there,'' Revolution
assistant coach Renaldo Capobianco said. ``You see a teammate wind
up from 20 yards out and score, and that helps your confidence that
you can take a shot you normally wouldn't take.''
</P>
<P>
   Streaks are nothing new for these clubs. New England dropped its
first three games, then ran off four straight wins before hitting
its current drought. Chicago opened the season with a pair of
victories and lost five straight before starting its current streak
of good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think their defense is as good as people think,''
Capobianco said. ``I do believe that this league is very much _
with two exceptions, D.C., and Los Angeles _ this is a league of
streaks and when you're playing well, everybody plays with an
incredible amount of confidence. And when you play poorly, they
don't seem to go your way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fire's last loss was 3-1 against D.C. United May 2. Since
that time they have wins over Tampa Bay, Los Angeles (twice),
Colorado, Columbus, and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   With Fire goalkeeper Jorge Campos in France with Team Mexico,
Zach Thornton, a former MetroStar reserve, has started all of
Chicago's games, posting four shutouts. Former Boston University
and Revolution standout Francis Okaroh is one of Chicago's top
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're working hard and working well together,'' said
Revolution forward Raul Diaz Arce (7 goals, 4 assists). ``That's
where we have to match ourselves and play that same way, working
hard together, to match their intensity. To be successful, we're
going to have to be patient and we'll get our opportunities. We
just have to take advantage of those and be consistent in creating
good scoring oportunities because they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Peter Nowak (6 goals, 7 assists) is the Fire's best
scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win,'' said Revolution midfielder Edwin Gorter.
``We've had empty hands the last couple of weeks and also we didn't
play that bad, but we didn't win. Everybody's healthy now, we have
no more excuses. It's time to start scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   With both teams paying particular attention to protecting the
ball, the rain-soaked field could cause extra problems. In the
Revolution's favor is that midfielder Oscar Pareja is making his
first MLS appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oscar gives us another person who is very crafty, very
offensive-minded, very experienced and he can maintain possession
in the midfield,'' Capobianco said. ``And on the attacking third,
he can spring other people as well as take shots on goal himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a winning formula for the Revolution.

BELGIUM'S DUTCH TREAT IS A STALEMATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Belgium coach George Leekens decided not
to start playmaker Enzo Scifo against the Netherlands last night.
Predictably, Belgium made few plays. In fact, the Belgians arrived
at Stade de France in a mood to destroy, not create.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy paid off as they held the Dutch to a 0-0 draw. The
result was greeted as a victory by Belgian fans but the defensive
nature of this Low Country produced the low point of this World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the result,'' Leekens said. ``We tried to
play offensively but they pushed us. Now, we need to win the second
game, against Mexico, for me the most important game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch attacked and pressured, and had two shots cleared off
the line by Belgium's substitute defender Eric Deflandre. But by
the end, they were frustrated, and striker Patrick Kluivert paid
for it by being ejected in the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Belgians were in a defensive mood, they were
dangerous in counterattack. Danny Boffin and Marc Wilmots created
chances, and Luis Oliveira and Lakonda Mpenza seemed capable of
finishing. Luc Nilis missed their best chance, inches high 12
minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Bergkamp and Boudewijn Zenden entered for Jimmy Floyd
Hasselbaink and Clarence Seedorf in the 20th minute of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Zenden and Bergkamp nearly combined seven minutes after they
entered. Kluivert flicked on to Zenden, who pulled a pass back, but
Bergkamp left-footed over the net from 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Kluivert was ejected for a foul on Lorenzo Staelens in the 26th
minute. Kluivert and Staelens clashed, and Kluivert refused a
handshake with Staelens, who responded with a derogatory but soft
shove. Kluivert became more animated and elbowed Staelens, who went
down.

EX-TEAMMATES ON OPPOSITE ENDS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ramon Martinez stood in the Dodgers bullpen and
chatted with Pedro Astacio through a fence during the Colorado
Rockies' batting practice at Dodger Stadium on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the chain-link separation symbolized the pitchers'
relationship. The two close friends are trying to get used to
wearing opposing uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   When Astacio first made it to the majors with the Dodgers in
1992, it was Martinez, a fellow Dominican, who took him under his
wing, gave him a place to stay and told him about opposing batters.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the two will face each other for the first time
when the Dodgers meet the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez compared it to facing his brother, Pedro, who is now
the Boston Red Sox's ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard because this is a guy who is your best friend,''
said Ramon (7-3, 2.88), who had Astacio over for dinner at his home
Thursday night. ``It is like when I faced my brother. You want
(Astacio) to do good and you want to do good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I know it is going to be tough. But he also
understands that we are on different teams now.''
</P>
<P>
   After compiling a 48-47 record with the Dodgers from 1992-97,
Astacio was traded to the Rockies for Eric Young. Because of the
pitcher-unfriendly Coors Field, Martinez said Astacio believed he
couldn't have been traded to a worse place. Martinez also said
Astacio misses being a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Astacio is struggling with a 4-8 record and a 6.86
ERA. Aside from being hampered by Coors Field, Ramon believes
Astacio's mechanics need refining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just how the game is,'' said Astacio, who speaks
frequently with Ramon over the telephone. ``It is like facing Pedro
(Martinez) when he was with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I am in another city, I have to concentrate on where
I am at and win ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi in limbo: Dodgers center fielder Raul Mondesi was
scratched from the starting lineup shortly before the game because
of personal matters, according to a statement issued by executive
vice president Fred Claire. Mondesi, who hit his 15th home run on
Friday, was in the dugout during the game. He is expected to be in
today's contest and will also be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi took batting practice and sat in the Dodgers' dugout
during the Rockies' pre-game workout. Manager Bill Russell also
said that Mondesi, who was not available for comment after the
game, is not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.: For the first time in club history, the Dodgers will wear
their blue batting jerseys during games in their next homestand
(June 24-28) in honor of their annual Think Blue Week. On the road,
the 1944 Brooklyn team featured a pale blue uniform made from a
highly reflective fabric to improve viewing of the players under
the lights. . . . Three fans will have the opportunity to win $1
million if they can hit a home run at Dodger Stadium today. The
contestants, who have been receiving coaching from ex-Dodger Kirk
Gibson, will get three swings from a pitching machine beginning at
11:30 a.m.

NEW YORK MAYOR DEFENDS HIS BUNKER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended his plan to build a
$15 million emergency control center in the World Trade Center
complex Saturday, as emergency experts questioned its viability,
City Council members complained that they had not been consulted
and radio hosts turned it into a punch line.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the project was not intended merely to be a
bunker, where select city officials would be safe, as some critics
have suggested. Rather, he said, it would be a secure control
center where emergency operations could be directed in case of a
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really an attempt,'' he said, ``to put the city for
the next 20 years in a position where it can deal with the kinds of
emergencies that might be unique to America's biggest city, its
most densely populated city, and the best-known city in the world.
And I would think that even City Council members would refrain from
playing politics with this.''
</P>
<P>
   But council members could not resist. Calling the mayor's
actions increasingly bizarre, the City Council Speaker, Peter
Vallone, said, ``If he wants to build a bunker for the only people
he trusts, all he needs is a phone booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Other council members continued to accuse the mayor of
concealing his plans for the center and questioned the need for it
at a time when he has threatened to cut some city services for the
elderly, youth, and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor pointed out, however, that the center was plainly
listed on page 995 of the capital budget adopted on June 5. He said
the line items read: ``Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.
Design, $1.5 million. Construction, $15.1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in the capital budget for this year,'' Giuliani said.
``I know that there are some council members that don't read the
budget, but that's their problem. This money has already been
obligated in terms of contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor refused to provide details about the center, saying
such information could help those who ``want to take advantage of
victimizing the city.'' Administration officials, however, said it
would occupy 46,000 feet on the 23rd floor of 7 World Trade Center,
bringing together more than 100 representatives from city, state,
and federal agencies, as well as public utilities, in times of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, operations during all large-scale city emergencies
are directed from an eighth-floor room of police headquarters that
is lined with maps, television monitors and banks of phones for
city agencies. The mayor said Saturday that there ``were things
lacking'' at the center.
</P>
<P>
   While emergency management experts applauded the mayor's attempt
to upgrade the city's disaster preparedness, they questioned the
wisdom of placing the command center on an upper floor of a
building not owned by the city, particularly one in
traffic-congested lower Manhattan. The center will be in a building
jointly owned by Silverstein Properties and the Port Authority of
New York and New Jersey, costing $1.4 million a year in rent for
the 20-year life of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are talking about emergency management, I don't think
you want to be in an office building in the middle of Wall Street,
where you have to worry about your lease and the tenants above and
below you,'' said Edward Shaughnessy, a professor of sociology and
law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and an expert in
emergency management.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it may provide you with the opportunity to survey the
city,'' he said, putting the center on the 23rd floor not only
makes it hard to reach should the power in the rest of the building
be cut, but also ``leaves you open to a missile attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaughnessy praised the work of Jerome Hauer, director of the
city's Office of Emergency Management, but he added: ``I just think
the place they are choosing has the potential for too many problems
and they might need to re-examine it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauer has said the site would be able to withstand hurricane
force winds. Administration officials also said it could survive
some bombs, would be impenetrable to gunfire and have a closed air
circulation system to prevent the influx of gas. Its
telecommunications equipment, they said, could operate even after a
nuclear blast.
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations for at least 30 would include beds and showers,
while the mayor would have a private area to hold meetings and a
pull-out couch to nap on. Generators and a water tank on separate
floors would insure that those inside could continue working for as
much as a week if the city went black.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever its assets, the center was the butt of jokes on
radio talk shows and evening newscasts. One weatherman joked while
announcing a coming rainstorm, ``Tomorrow, you'll wish you were in
the Mayor's bunker.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day on WABC-AM, the lawyer and talk-show host Ron
Kuby said he took a call from Hauer. As he questioned Hauer about
who would be allowed into the center, sound effects of King Kong
and bomb blasts echoed over the air. Kuby also sponsored a naming
game, allowing callers to offer their favorite moniker for the
site. Among the best, he said, was ``Rudy's Nuclear Winter
Palace.''
</P>
<P>
   Some council members argued that if the center was such a good
idea, the mayor might have been expected to publicize it.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Leffler, chairman of the Council's Public Safety
Committee, said he still had reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunlight is the best disinfectant, and this project should be
subject to some public scrutiny so we can make the best decision,''
he said. ``What the mayor did was essentially try to slip this
thing through the budget in a subterfuge.''

ARUM THROWING JABS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Sometimes the pressure to produce mounts not
only on a professional fighter but also on the people around him.
Such is the case now for promoter Bob Arum.
</P>
<P>
   For Arum, these should be the best of times. He is handling the
affairs of the hottest commodity in boxing and, having realized
early the rising economic power of Hispanic fight fans, he has
catered to it with popular champions such as Oscar De La Hoya, Erik
Morales, and Genaro Hernandez as well as young prospects such as
Daniel Santos.
</P>
<P>
   But the 67-year-old promoter is facing a growing problem
satisfying De La Hoya, De La Hoya's father, adviser, and camp
followers, and his other champions, many of whom grouse that they
want ``De La Hoya money'' when Arum knows they will never see it.
</P>
<P>
   Discontent among those fighters over the obvious special
treatment De La Hoya receives from Arum is probably unavoidable,
but Arum now has a mounting and more serious problem because the
World Boxing Council welterweight champion and those closest to him
have grown weary of being criticized for the choice of opponents
like the one De La Hoya faced last night, a Frenchman named Patrick
Charpentier who will never make anyone in France forget the great
Marcel Cerdan.
</P>
<P>
   Charpentier was a mandatory defense forced upon De La Hoya by
the WBC, so neither Arum nor his fighter can be blamed; but since
De La Hoya won a controversial decision over Pernell Whitaker 14
months ago, he has not faced a single worthy challenge _ and he has
begun to hear about it in the media and in the streets. And he
seems to be looking for someone to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Like many great athletes, when such a time arrives, there are no
mirrors in their homes. The blame goes outward, not inward. De La
Hoya is not about to blame himself, and he can't blame his manager
because he manages himself, which leaves only one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I hurt my wrist and had the long (six-month) layoff, I
had time to ask myself what I wanted to do,'' De La Hoya said.
``Did I really want to fight or do something else? Did I really
want to prove that I'm the champion?
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose to fight, so I want to fight the best. I understand
Bob has a contract for Felix Trinidad but his Dad doesn't want to
sign it yet. (World Boxing Association champion Ike) Quartey is
having problems with his managers. I understand the promoters and
the negotiations, but those fights are out there and there's
pressure on Bob to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a choice to box or focus on other things. Boxing is what
I chose. I've got four or five good years left and I can create
history. It's true that Arum is being pressured to make those
fights.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence Thursday that for the first time since De
La Hoya turned professional, both his father and his adviser, Mike
Hernandez, were introduced at the prefight press conference and
chose to speak. When it was over, not only De La Hoya was signing
autographs but so was his father, a chilling sight for any promoter
who understands the sordid history of father-son teams in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Arum denies having problems with anyone but the company that
has paid De La Hoya millions to fight for it. In an odd manifesto
last week, Arum claimed his problem making a big fight for his
champion was not with the normal suspects _ rival promoters Don
King and Dino Duva _ but with his own partner in the De La Hoya
business, Time Warner's cable arm, HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put huge money on the table for those guys to fight
Oscar,'' Arum said. ``I've offered Trinidad $7 million and that's a
firm, firm offer. I've offered Quartey's people $3.5 million any
time they want it. I offered Whitaker $4 million to fight Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those offers are on the table and they can have them any time
they want. Whoever comes first gets the fight. But I can't even get
Trinidad's father to name a figure, and the people working against
me on the other fights are HBO. They're offering a lot more money
to Quartey-Whitaker because they want fights on HBO and know those
fights with Oscar are pay-per-view fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see HBO as my competitor now and it makes for a very
conflicted situation since Oscar is under a long-term contract with
them. Instead of helping us make these fights, they're bidding
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   While fight fans salivate over the idea of De La Hoya trying to
unify the title against Trinidad or Quartey, Arum has scheduled a
September rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez at De La Hoya's
insistence, followed by a fight with 154-pound champion Yory Boy
Campas in November. That would take De La Hoya through the end of
this year, and while Arum has been talking publicly about making a
match for next spring with one of the big three welterweights _
Trinidad, Quartey, and Whitaker _ he privately has already penciled
in such lackluster opponents as Oba Carr while accusing HBO of
working to block the big fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard of Bob saying that, I called and told him this is
a foolish spat and it's a one-way spat,'' said HBO Sports CEO Seth
Abraham. ``We have no argument with him. I really believe Oscar is
the best fighter in the world and Bob is the best promoter. Look at
what they did with Charpentier.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if Bob has an argument with someone, it's not with us.
It's simply not true that we blocked him from making De La
Hoya-Quartey, De La Hoya-Whitaker, or De La Hoya-Trinidad. This guy
is our bread and butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every fight we make at 147 and 154 pounds, I think about what
the implication is for Oscar. To us, he's Air Force One. He lands
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob never once even mentioned Quartey's name to us. The other
negotiations fell apart over money. HBO had no role in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum claims they fell apart because HBO was offering more money,
but other sources say he indeed never sought to make a deal with
Quartey until De La Hoya recently began asking about him, and he
lost a Whitaker rematch through his own reluctance, not because HBO
paid Whitaker more to fight Quartey. In fact, Duva, who promotes
Whitaker, agreed to take less to try for a Quartey fight in hopes
of getting Whitaker a piece of the title back and improving his
negotiating position if a De La Hoya fight came along.
</P>
<P>
   Arum, said a source, ``couldn't make a rematch because the first
fight did big business and he tried to cut Whitaker's purse in
half. He attacked the guy and said it was a stinking fight and then
he offers him barely 50 percent of what he made the first time ($4
million as opposed to $7 million). He wasn't trying to make a
Whitaker fight and he didn't want a Quartey fight. He wants every
fighter in the division to sit around and wait for Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those fighters was another one under promotional contract
with Arum, former champion Terry Norris. People familiar with the
machinations the past year or so say HBO tried to make a
Norris-Quartey fight and was willing to pay Norris $3 million, but
Arum allegedly never relayed that offer to Norris's handlers
because he hoped to save Norris for De La Hoya, a charge he denies.
</P>
<P>
   As for Trinidad, industry insiders say offering him $7 million
may sound like big money but it probably is no more than 25-30
percent of what the pot would be, a split Arum has to know Trinidad
would never agree to.
</P>
<P>
   With guaranteed big paydays _ because of De La Hoya's loyal
Hispanic following _ for no-risk opponents like Chavez and Campas,
Arum, many believe, is simply trying to stall the bigger fights for
as long as he can to maximize income while minimizing risk.
However, that is the job of a manager, not a promoter, although
Arum counters by claiming there no longer are any risks for De La
Hoya at 147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one guy is as easy as the next, then the biggest fights are
the ones to make,'' Arum claimed. ``Can he survive without them?
Yes, but in our opinion Trinidad and Quartey are as easy as Campas
and Chavez, so we'd rather have the bigger fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually they'll get made if we can keep HBO in check. I can
make a deal with King in a second for Trinidad. I can't pay
Whitaker $4 million any more because of the (drug) problems he's
had, but we'd pay him $3 million to fight Oscar. The fact is we've
got three offers out that are firm for big fights and whoever
accepts first gets the fight, but HBO is offering so much more to
Quartey and Whitaker that $3 million doesn't mean anything because
Seth wants some big fights on regular cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, HBO executives seethed at Arum's charge, but they
would say little beyond denying them. HBO Sports vice president for
programming Lou DiBella, who is usually effusive, would say only,
``That's Bob being Bob. There's no need to respond. He knows what
the truth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the truth is _ and historically it has seldom lain with
Arum in these situations _ the consequences of not making a big
fight for De La Hoya are what he soon may have to confront.
</P>
<P>
   If Arum is using HBO as a scapegoat for his inability or
unwillingness to make the major fights De La Hoya needs to make
history as well as money, he will pay for that down the road. As a
boxing insider said last week, ``HBO may not be saying anything
publicly but I know how they work. The sins of the father are
visited upon the son.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means to the future of Arum's other fighters is
speculative, but it is obvious what it will mean to him if De La
Hoya wakes up one morning and decides he has been forced to wait
too long to face his biggest challenges. His ironclad deal with HBO
will prevent him from blaming it, so he'll find someone else. Arum
knows that could be him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always want to blame the promoter when fights don't get
made, but it's really the networks like HBO that tie everyone's
hands and feet,'' Arum said. ``If we were free to do a big
pay-per-view show with anyone, Trinidad would have been done a long
time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong. I'm not mad at HBO. They're honest about
it. That's why I have no animosity about it. It's business. I can't
be angry. I can be chagrined. But we signed those long-term deals
with HBO because we wanted the money. We went for instant
gratification, so maybe Oscar and I got what we deserved. At the
time we signed, I wasn't in a position to tell him to forget the
immediate money because I knew we'd make more down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them options until he's 30 and now it's working
against us, but that's business. HBO is looking out for No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely it is, but it is not alone. So is Arum, a promoter who is
more in the Oscar De La Hoya business than the fight business these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya says the Chavez rematch came at his insistence
because he has grown tired of hearing his former idol make lame
excuses for why he lost their first meeting. ``Chavez is
personal,'' De La Hoya explained. ``That is my fight. He never gave
me the respect I deserved, so now I want to be the first to knock
him out. I'm very disappointed in the way he's acted, making
excuses. A lot of people are finding out the real Chavez. It's
terrible to find out my childhood idol is the way he is. I want to
punish him, actually. There'll be no more excuses for him.'' ... De
La Hoya claims his most dangerous opponent at 147 pounds is  &UR; Jose
Luis Lopez &LR; . ``He has fast hands and a good chin and he's very
powerful,'' De La Hoya said. ``He can really take a punch and he's
got the conditioning, too. I think he's the most dangerous opponent
for me in the welterweight division.'' ... A more confident De La
Hoya emerged last week, one that bordered on cocky for the first
time in his career. While talking to a packed press conference, De
La Hoya told his fans, ``As long as I'm in boxing, I guarantee I
will never, ever lose for you guys.'' ... De La Hoya's father,
Joel, was asked about the split between his son and trainer
 &UR; Emanuel Steward &LR; , &UR;  &LR; one insiders insist was forced by the father
over the son's objections. Smiling like a cheshire cat, the senior
De La Hoya said, ``We didn't have nobody (training De La Hoya)
before but Robert (Alcazar, his longtime friend). That was it, and
Roberto went to the Olympics with Oscar. We don't need nobody else.
We got the boxer. We don't need a good trainer.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are being explored once again to find a way to make
the  &UR; Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis &LR;  heavy-weight title unification
fight in the wake of the cancellation of Holyfield's bout with
 &UR; Henry Akinwande &LR; . The most immediate consequence of that
cancellation was that HBO withdrew its six-fight, $30 million
contract extension offer to Lewis when he didn't sign it by the
June 6 deadline. Abraham now says he's ``revisiting the landscape.
We didn't want to leave that deal on the table while we're figuring
out what to do next. We wanted to think about whether
Holyfield-Lewis can be made and then decide how to proceed. My
father-in-law,  &UR; Meyer Rubenstein &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is 76. He's a used-machinery
dealer. He always told me, `Time heals all wounds but time wounds
all deals.''' The words of Meyer Rubenstein had an ominous ring for
Lewis, who may have blown easy money by not signing the extension
when it was available ... Weirdness permeates all of boxing, so
it's nothing to find oddities abounding in the effort to make a
unification fight between  &UR; Roy Jones Jr. &LR;  and  &UR; Lou Del Valle  &LR; for
the light heavyweight title. Jones was stripped of the title when
he refused to defend it against No. 1 contender  &UR; Michael
Nunn &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but when  &UR; Graciano Rocchigiani  &LR; beat Nunn, Rocchigiani was
declared ``interim champion.'' Well, the interim period ran out a
few weeks ago when the WBC handed the title back to Jones after he
blew out  &UR; Virgil Hill &LR; . What that had to do with poor Rocchigiani
is anyone's guess, but such is boxing. Which brings us to Del
Valle. When  &UR; Reggie Johnson's  &LR; shoulder injury prevented him from
taking a July 18 date with Jones, Del Valle accepted a unification
fight for big money but the WBA threatened not to sanction the bout
or to strip Del Valle if he takes it. A vote of the WBA
championship committee was supposed to happen this week and Del
Valle could, in the end, fight without the title because he knows
his biggest payday lies with Jones, so HBO is confident it will end
up with the fight one way or another. Failing that, International
Boxing Federation super middleweight champion  &UR; Charles Brewer
 &LR; reportedly is ready to step in ...  &UR; Prince Naseem Hamed  &LR; now says
he will not fight  &UR; Kennedy McKinney  &LR; until Halloween, which leaves
an Aug. 22 fight date open.  &UR; Arturo Gatti  &LR; is likely to fill it ...
WBC super bantamweight champion  &UR; Erik Morales  &LR; (29-0) has agreed to
fight former champion  &UR; Junior Jones  &LR; Sept. 12 in a Tijuana bull
ring ... A second hepatitis B test taken by Akinwande last week
confirmed the positive result that forced the cancellation of his
bout with Holyfield ... Holyfield would be the last to say he's the
next  &UR; Muhammad Ali &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but he does compare his 35-3 record _ with
wins over  &UR; George Foreman &LR; , &UR; Riddick Bowe &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Mike Tyson  &LR; _ with
what Ali did. ``If you put it on a piece of paper, Ali fought all
what you would call the great fighters in his era,'' Holyfield
said. ``In my era, I fought them all. We both have come back and

BULLS OWNER IS REVILED IN CHICAGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There he stood, arms folded, champing a cigar in the
corner of luxury suite 31 as Game 5 of the NBA Finals ticked away
like a time bomb at the United Center. One of the most despised
people in sports _ certainly among the least trusted _ Jerry
Reinsdorf seemed oblivious to the approaching Bullmageddon.
</P>
<P>
   As judge and Jerry, the Chicago Bulls' chairman-owner says he
doesn't want to see the dynasty break up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not the end, of course it's not totally up to
me,'' Reinsdorf said. ``I don't want to be the person who breaks up
the Bulls while we're still winning.''
</P>
<P>
   As fans who have suffered from his past hypocrisy, Windy City
residents refer to that promise as ``Bull-loney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shame on us now if we believe him,'' said longtime
Chicago sports fan Alicia Venstedt of Glendale Heights. ``Don't get
me wrong, he's done a lot of good things. He just doesn't have any
credibility left.''
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons that Bulls fans believe they are seeing the
last of coach Phil Jackson, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and a
string of championships that could reach six in eight years tonight
in Game 6 against the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   It was Reinsdorf who, in the 1980s, voted against Edward
Gaylord's bid to buy the Rangers because he feared the new owner
would create a television superstation. Shortly thereafter, his
Chicago White Sox signed on with Chicago superstation WGN.
</P>
<P>
   It was Reinsdorf who, in the mid-1990s, pushed for a strike as a
way to halt escalating salaries. Shortly thereafter, he signed
Albert Belle to the richest contract in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   It was Reinsdorf who, last season, boasted of assembling a team
that would win the American League Central. Shortly thereafter,
with his team trailing Cleveland by 31/2 games, he traded four
top-flight pitchers for six minor-leaguers because, he said,
``anyone that thinks we can catch Cleveland is crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Reinsdorf who, this season, talked about how he hates
wife-beaters, calling them ``cowards.'' Shortly thereafter, he
signed Wil Cordero, who had pleaded guilty to beating his wife.
</P>
<P>
   It is Reinsdorf, on the brink of an unprecedented Repeat
Three-Peat, who says he wants to see one of the most triumphant and
entertaining dynasties in American sports history stay together.
Shortly hereafter, fans reason, he will rip the beating heart out
of the team's proud chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't believe him, they're skeptical,'' said Jackson's
agent, Todd Musberger. ``And who could blame them? Right now he's
busy trying to put the responsibility of keeping this thing
together on the players. Meanwhile, he's doing nothing but break it
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf, who has turned the Bulls into a $400 million empire,
has supporters.
</P>
<P>
   His main cheerleader _ Bulls vice president of basketball
operations/general manager Jerry Krause _ has been at his side for
16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take a bullet for him, because I know he'd turn around and
do all he could to save me,'' Krause said.
</P>
<P>
   Good friend and former Illinois State Sen. Bill Marovitz said
Reinsdorf's business acumen is misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the highest caliber person I know of,'' Marovitz said.
``A lot of people have a problem with the way things have been
handled, but look at his results. He is a shrewd businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to find a Reinsdorf fan at Jordan's restaurant,
where his image on a big-screen TV is greeted with the mute button
and boos. Or at Comiskey Park, where the lifeless White Sox are
struggling to attract fans. Or at Wrigley Field, where a Cubs sweep
of the Sox featured a sign that read ``Cubs Win! Reinsdorf
(Stinks)!''
</P>
<P>
   Said a Reinsdorf business associate: ``If Michael retires, I'll
be worried about Jerry's safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid criticism from people including Jazz owner Larry Miller and
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, Reinsdorf isn't flinching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't affected me at all,'' Reinsdorf said. ``Like
everybody else, I'm just trying to enjoy the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Marovitz: ``This isn't eating at him because he has a game
plan. He wants this team back as much as everybody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn in 1936, Reinsdorf is a lifelong Dodgers fan
with four seats from Ebbets Field in his office. A baseball fan at
heart, he made his fortune in real estate securities and as an
attorney before fulfilling a childhood dream of buying the White
Sox in '81. Adding the Bulls in '85, Marovitz said, was merely a
business venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd give up four of his basketball rings for just one World
Series,'' Marovitz said.
</P>
<P>
   He is a grandfather of six, but an ego-maniacal, cutthroat
businessman. He angered Chicago fans when he successfully
maneuvered to have Comiskey and the United Center built with public
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we took over the Bulls (in Jordan's rookie season) they
were in bad shape,'' Krause said. ``There was no marketing
department, an old arena and a bad team. Now look. But we get no
credit for what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the Jerrys get little credit, they are on the verge
of getting the blame for the biggest breakup since the Beatles.
Only the Jimmy Johnson-Jerry Jones divorce after consecutive Super
Bowls compares with Bullmageddon, but this breakup involves
possibly shoving the greatest basketball player ever into premature
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael is as endearing on our landscape as the Sears Tower,''
Daley said, adding that Jordan is by far the city's No. 1 tourist
attraction. ``And if given a vote, the people would probably pick
to save him.''
</P>
<P>
   The question on every fan's lips: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Why is Jordan being forced to seriously contemplate retirement
when he is at the top of his game and the Bulls atop the mountain?
</P>
<P>
   Egos. No doubt the Jerrys are salivating at the thought of
winning a title without this cast of characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to fall apart just because one player takes
his uniform off,'' said Krause, responsible for acquiring every
player except Jordan. ``When Red (Celtics general manager Auerbach)
lost (Bill) Russell, he went out and got (Dave) Cowens. When he
lost Cowens, he went out and got (Larry) Bird and he kept winning.
Players don't win championships, organizations do.''
</P>
<P>
   Money. Reinsdorf is apparently tired of having the league's
highest payroll (more than $70 million this season) and not seeing
a profit to match the on-court success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very reluctant to try to second-guess them, but
nevertheless, it is bizarre that a breakup might happen,'' Miller
said. ``They are a true dynasty. To me, if I'm the guy making that
decision, if I can keep the thing economically viable _ which to me
means breaking even _ for the championship run that may still come
while this talent pool is together, then I'm going to do everything
in my power to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   The path to apocalypse apparently goes directly through Pippen,
a free-agent-to-be whose animosity toward management is genuine and
long-standing. Tired of being underappreciated and underpaid, one
of the game's best defensive players is expected to entertain
lucrative offers from Phoenix and Houston this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any intention of coming back here next season,''
Pippen said last week. ``I'm looking forward to the opportunity to
go out on top, then throw my jersey in the trunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson: ``Scottie is the linchpin. A lot depends on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf said he will sit down with Pippen after the season,
but most are skeptical about him offering the four-year, $60
million contract it will likely take to sign Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Scottie is very, very important to Michael,''
Reinsdorf said. ``Scottie not returning could have an impact and an
effect on Michael's situation. We'll do everything we can to keep
it together. ... But it's not just my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who calls this season ``our last dance,'' said that
neither Jerry has congratulated him on advancing within one win of
the title and that the relationships have soured so that he rarely
speaks to either. After his contract expires in July, he will
likely be offered jobs in Denver, LA (Clippers) and Seattle, but
has often talked of taking a year off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this year is over, I'll probably break down and cry like
a baby,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who has won every individual and team award multiple
times, has said he won't play for a coach other than Jackson and
added last week that playing without Pippen would be ``a slap in my
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Although agent David Falk called the possibility of Jordan
playing for another team next season ``conceivable,'' not even
Jordan is sure of his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of unanswered questions,'' said Jordan, who
this season suggested that Reinsdorf sell the team. ``To make a
decision now would be like walking in the dark, and I don't like to
do that. But if there's no Phil and no Scottie, I don't want to do
that. That's a sign of rebuilding, and at my stage, that's not
something I'm looking to do. I'm considering this to be the moment.
I'm not trying to twist Jerry's arm, though it probably sounds like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, Jackson predicted that, ``All of us will
be forgotten in a few years, except Michael.'' Not so, according to
Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, who said the future will have a place for
Reinsdorf if this is the last running of the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they let this thing slip away, he'll be missing something
the rest of his life,'' Sloan said. ``He'll always be saying `Could
we have gotten one more, two more?' If you walk away from that it's
nothing but selfish. That kind of thing could haunt you in your
dreams.''

MEXICO LEAVES KOREANS SEEING RED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ How long could the nightmare continue? Ten, 15,
20 minutes the Mexicans had played a man up Saturday afternoon and
still they were losing to the South Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   How could ``El Tris'' explain this back home? Being held to a
scoreless draw by the 10-man yanquis and hooted off the field in
Mexico City last fall was bad enough.
</P>
<P>
   But losing to a country that had never won a World Cup soccer
match? Being all but out of the tournament before they were barely
in? Were the Mexicans, as their newspapers had been joking, really
the second sailing of the ``Tritanic''?
</P>
<P>
   Then Ricardo Pelaez shook them awake with a goal in the 51st
minute and Luis Hernandez, the blond angel, added two more and the
Mexicans, as their song goes, were singing, not crying inside the
Stade Gerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great moment of joy for Mexico,'' exulted
Hernandez, after his goals in the 75th and 84th minutes pushed his
countrymen past the game but exhausted South Koreans, 3-1. ``We
didn't lose our heads, and that's why we won.''
</P>
<P>
   One rash moment _ a sliding tackle from behind by Ha Seok-ju on
Jesus Ramirez in the 30th minute _ cost the South Koreans
everything. Once Austrian referee Guenter Benko sent Ha off, just
two minutes after he'd put them ahead with a deflected free kick,
time and numbers were against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three to one may seem a substantial difference,'' conceded
South Korean coach Cha Bum Kun, ``but obviously, with 10 on 11 we
were at a numerical disadvantage. Unfortunately, chance was against
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the South Koreans hung tough, clinging to the lead for 20
more minutes before Pelaez banged home a loose ball off a ricochet
from a corner. And until Hernandez volleyed home a Ramirez cross,
it seemed the South Koreans might be able to escape with a point.
</P>
<P>
   They may be 0 for lifetime in this tournament, but the South
Koreans are the team everybody hates to play. They run and tackle
for 90 minutes and they keep coming. So the Mexicans knew they were
in for a bruising and breathless go. And after the way they'd
played in their spring tuneups, they couldn't be sure of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Though they'd easily qualified for the Cup, the Mexicans
finished their regional matches with four draws that drew disgusted
howls from their fans and press and got coach Bora Milutinovic
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, when they watched Ha's kick bounce off the head of
defender Duilio Davino in the wall and past keeper Jorge Campos,
the Mexicans went into shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pep talk,'' said midfielder Jaime Ordiales. ``We said
that we were going to do everything in our power to get back into
the game. It was tough, but we rose to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as though the Mexicans hadn't been pounding on South
Korea's door all day. They had attacked with 10 men almost from the
opening whistle and had two gorgeous chances seconds apart in the
21st minute. But keeper Kim Byung-ji saved Hernandez's bid and
Cuauhtemoc Blanco's shot off the rebound was blocked by a defender
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   When Benko missed an apparent South Korean hand ball that would
have given them a penalty kick in the 50th minute, the Mexicans
began wondering if fate was overriding arithmetic. But Pelaez
pounced on the ball amid the hurly-burly after a corner kick
moments later, put it past Kim and slid on his knees, weeping and
thanking God.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Mexicans had only salvaged a point. They needed 3
if they hope to survive a group that includes perennial advancers
Belgium and the Netherlands, who tied, 0-0, Saturday. And as the
clock was running down, the South Koreans were still chasing the
Mexicans around the pitch like hounds.
</P>
<P>
   They could track down 10 of them, but not 11. Not indefinitely.
Finally, Hernandez slipped across the box and managed to tap the
ball just inside the post as he was running out of room. Ten
minutes later, with his back to the goal, Hernandez took a lovely
service from Blanco at the top of the box, whirled, and fired it
past Kim for the death stroke.
</P>
<P>
   When the whistle came, the depleted Koreans bowed their heads
and put their hands on wobbly knees. ``The red card was a harsh
decision,'' said midfielder Noh Jung-yoon. ``But that's the World
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexicans weren't complaining. The last time they played 11
on 10, their own fans mocked them and cheered for the Americans.
They'll take 3 points here any way they come, because most folks
have been settling for 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started very well, but it is only the first game,'' said
coach Manuel Lapuente. ``We've got to be very stable. Am I
confident? It is not a matter of confidence. It is a matter of
tranquility.''

CHAMPS HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ This isn't where Dennis Rodman wanted to be
Sunday. This isn't where any of his teammates wanted to be, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls couldn't close the deal at home Friday night,
so they'll try again tonight in the Delta Center. They may be upset
that they had to take an extra trip, but they have lost none of
their trademark confidence. They still like their chances against
the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   History, if it means anything, still is on their side. Well,
sort of. No team has ever extricated itself from a 3-1 deficit in
the NBA Finals. And of the teams who came back home trailing, 3-2,
in the best-of-seven format, two of them, the 1985 Celtics and the
1993 Suns, lost Game 6 at home. The 1988 Lakers and the 1994
Rockets won both Games 6 and 7 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan talked after Friday's Game 5, an 83-81 defeat,
about how the road can be less burdensome, less worrisome, less
stressful. He's hoping for the same room at the downtown hotel, the
one with the piano. He won't have to worry about tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty sure we don't have to worry about the traffic,
either,'' he said. (Several Bulls talked about the brutal traffic
Friday. The Chicago highways make Los Angeles look like a deserted
Nevada road.)
</P>
<P>
   Jordan went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let them deal with the scenarios that we just finished dealing
with,'' he said. ``Let's see if we can change places. It's tough. I
welcome the challenge. We've got a 3-2 lead. You know, sometimes
the body doesn't react to what the mind is telling you. You've just
got to go with the flow and forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah is not going away easily, which probably should surprise no
one. The Jazz already have looked elimination in the eye three
times this postseason and not blinked: twice against Houston in the
first round and again Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They had been humbled and humiliated in Games 3 and 4, but they
made the big plays to get the series back home. They play well
here. But they also lost once here to the Bulls and had to go into
overtime to beat them after having rested for nine days.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan pointed to a similar situation in 1993. The Bulls led the
Suns, 3-1, and everyone anticipated a Chicago win in Game 5. It
didn't happen. The series returned to Phoenix, where the Bulls
jumped to a big lead, lost it down the stretch, and then won the
game on John Paxson's 3-pointer and Horace Grant's rejection of a
Kevin Johnson drive.
</P>
<P>
   Playing on the road neither ruffles nor concerns them. They
realize they blew an opportunity Friday, but they also realize they
still have two chances left.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1993,'' Jordan said, ``I got on the plane to Phoenix with a
cigar and got everyone to relax a little bit. I don't know what I'm
going to do this time, but somehow, it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Scottie Pippen, ``It's going to be very hard because no
one wanted to make this trip, especially the players. But we have
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone actually asked Pippen _ and we are not making this up _
if he wanted to get the series over tonight or in a seventh game.
Pippen tried the comic approach _ ``How long do you want to stay in
Utah?'' _ and then addressed it more seriously, as if he needed to
state the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want them to tie the series up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls will look to resuscitate Luc Longley, who has been
alternately dreadful and invisible. They have to assume that Pippen
won't go 2 for 16 again. Then again, what are the chances Toni
Kukoc will go 11 for 13?
</P>
<P>
   Rodman, meanwhile, was barely a factor in Game 5 after coming up
huge in the pivotal fourth game. He had only three rebounds in 24
minutes and was, along with Longley, ineffective in bothering Karl
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls haven't stopped Malone from scoring but, until Game 5,
they had stopped him from dominating. If he has, indeed, found his
rhythm, that could spell bad news for the champs.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the Bulls want _ other than having to be here
Sunday _ is to be here for another three days. Rodman would get the
Vegas shuttle going again and Jordan might actually contemplate a
round or three of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Their reputation as the consummate, go-for-the-jugular closer
took a bit of a hit Friday. The Bulls didn't get it done in their
season finale in the United Center. They'll look for a different
ending tonight _ or face the prospect of yet another seventh game,
this one for everything.

HISTORIC OLYMPIC CLUB SOMETHING TO SAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Olympic Club. San Francisco. History. This will be the grand
tableau when the 98th US Open opens Thursday at the storied Lake
Course, where favorites such as Ben Hogan (1955), Arnold Palmer
(1966), and Tom Watson (1987) saw seemingly certain victory turn
into disheartening defeat. Jack Fleck beat Hogan in a playoff,
Palmer's seven-stroke lead with nine holes to go dissipated into a
playoff loss to Billy Casper, and Scott Simpson ran down Watson.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean on the eve of the country's national
championship? Maybe it's Chip Beck's turn to claw his way out of an
interminable slump. He qualified Tuesday at Canoe Brook CC in
Summit, N.J. All we know for certain is that Olympic is short and
beguiling, with insurmountable rough and incredibly fast greens.
There also will be tight fairways, and the air this time of year
can be dense and moist in the Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   When the final day rolled around 11 years ago, the skies over
Olympic were a deep blue and the Golden Gate Bridge was glistening
in the distance. Watson, who had won a dramatic US Open at Pebble
Beach on the Monterrey Peninsula five years earlier, seemed to be
in charge, but Simpson made three straight birdies in his stretch
run, and after Watson's shot into the treacherous 18th green spun
back, his putt to create a playoff died to the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started out on tour,'' said Simpson that day,
``my aim was just to make a living for my family. This is a dream
come true. It was one of the best putting rounds of my life. I was
just concentrating on making a smooth stroke and, for some reason,
they went in. It was tremendously exciting. To win the US Open, I
can't think of anything bigger than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan and Palmer have left their hearts at this course in San
Francisco. Fleck birdied two of the last four holes to end Hogan's
dream of a record fifth US Open. Fleck won the playoff, 69-72,
after Hogan got lost in horrendous rough on the 18th hole. Casper
caught Palmer chasing Hogan's record. Neither Hogan, Palmer, nor
Watson won another US Open after their Olympic disappointments, and
Palmer and Watson can claim just a solitary US Open title to
Hogan's four.
</P>
<P>
   The defender is Ernie Els, the South African with the graceful
manner and seemingly effortless swing who has won the championship
two of the past four years _ at Oakmont (1994) and Congressional
(1997). He's ranked the globe's No. 1 player at the moment and
played this course competitively in the 1994 PGA Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very tough golf course,'' said Els. ``I think the
wind is going to play a big part there.''
</P>
<P>
   Els's style of play should be suited to the course as much as
anybody's in the field, but he withdrew after nine holes of this
weekend's Buick Classic with back spasms, leaving his status in
doubt. He rates Olympic as one of the toughest courses he has seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't too many birdieable holes,'' he said.
``Especially when it is firm. We played it in October and it was a
little bit wet. You could keep the ball in the fairways a little
easier. It all depends on the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's wet, I can see the guys maybe shoot 1 or 2 under par.
If it's firm and the wind is blowing, I can't see a score under par
really winning. We say this every year going into the US Open: `The
course might be the toughest ever played.'''
</P>
<P>
   The course may resemble Valderrama, the Spanish tract where the
Europeans retained the Ryder Cup last September over a US team that
included Masters champion Tiger Woods, British Open winner Justin
Leonard, and PGA champion Davis Love.
</P>
<P>
   It may be Colin Montgomerie's turn to win the Open. He was in a
playoff won by Els four years ago at Oakmont, and was there until
the fateful 71st hole last year at Congressional, when he missed a
5-foot putt to save par after waiting interminably for the twosome
of Jay Haas and Tommy Tolles on the nearby 18th green to finish.
</P>
<P>
   If Montgomerie doesn't break through, watch for England's Lee
Westwood to surprise. He's destined to replace Nick Faldo as that
country's best golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Woods's name will come up, but Els doesn't think it's his kind
of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this golf course really suits his game,'' said
Els, ``but we all really know he can hit 2-iron as far as I hit my
driver. So he can keep it in play that way, but he has got to hit
his irons his distances.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods withdrew from the Kemper Open two weeks ago, citing
shoulder problems and heading to Las Vegas for treatment. Butch
Harmon, his swing guru and instructor, just happens to be in
residence there.
</P>
<P>
   The player to watch might be Leonard, whose closing 65 at Royal
Troon in the British Open was arguably the best round of the year.
He also won The Players Championship and rises to the occasion in
the big tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that the US Golf Association enjoys bringing its
national championship to the Olympic Club, where the historical
background whets the appetite. The names of Fleck, Casper, and
Simpson will come up constantly; Simpson, in fact, has been granted
an exemption to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Club. San Francisco. History.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Olympic Club has a heightened reputation because
of its setup, Augusta National's reputation suffered when Woods
dismantled it in 1996. Surprise, surprise. The course stood its
ground this past April, with the wind blowing in the faces of
golfers on the 13th and 15th holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was an unusual year,'' said Augusta National
chairman  &UR; Jack Stephens &LR; . ``The record was broken by one shot after
32 years. We don't think that's a great cause for alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens stepped down, though, and  &UR; William  &LR; ``Hootie''  &UR; Johnson
 &LR; became the new chairman. So what was his first move? Changes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said last week the changes came after consultation with
architect  &UR; Tom Fazio &LR; . The major alteration will be on the second
hole, a par 5 that is easily reachable in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting the fairway bunker back in play by moving the
tee back about 25 yards,'' said Johnson. ``The hole will continue
to be reachable in two but will require more accuracy off the tee.
We're shifting the fairway bunker to the right, making it a little
wider landing area. That area between the trap and the rough will
be about 40 yards. The spectators will be able to get back there
behind the tee. There is a road, and the tee will be fairly close
to the road. It's a beautiful spot, and I think that you're going
to find it very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Additional changes will be made to the 11th and 15th holes. The
11th green was washed out in 1990 by a flood that ravaged Rae's
Creek, so the green will be raised by 2 feet. ``We expect to pick
up some new pin placements on the back left of the green,'' said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The fairway mounds on 15 will be ``cut down 80-85 percent and
clusters of pines will be put in that area,'' said Johnson. ``Again
this will call for greater accuracy off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're removing the mound to the right of the 15th green. This
will provide for more challenging recovery shots and it also should
give us an area there to put in a spectator viewing stand.''
</P>
<P>

   The qualifier at Canoe Brook was a bittersweet experience for
New Englanders  &UR; Kevin Johnson  &LR; of Pembroke (and the Nike Tour),
 &UR; Brett Quigley  &LR; of Barrington, R.I., Marshfield native and
defending Massachusetts Open champion  &UR; Geoff Sisk &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and Salem CC
professional  &UR; Kirk Hanefeld &LR; . They were part of a seven-man playoff
for the last three spots. And they were the four who didn't make
it. Johnson, who will be married next month, bowed out on the fifth
hole of the playoff. He left for Cleveland and this weekend's Nike
tournament. ``I'm hitting it real good,'' he said, ``but my short
game's poor. I'm playing a lot better.'' It's time to take the next
step at age 31. ``The short game's usually pretty good, but it
isn't clicking yet,'' said Johnson. ``It's better being in the
middle ground than the bottom ground.'' ... Quigley shot 77-69_146
and was the last to leave, on the seventh extra hole. He was on the
PGA Tour last year, just missed retaining his card, and performed
poorly in Qualifying School. He has been in limbo this year, but
has earned nearly $100,000. ``It's tough planning your schedule,''
said Quigley. ``Fortunately I've been ready when I've gotten in. I
made seven of the last nine cuts at the end of last year.'' He is
the first alternate out of Canoe Brook, but the pecking order of
alternates from the various sites has yet to be determined. ``If
they call,'' said Quigley, ``I'll be there.'' ... Sisk, who bowed
out with a bogey on the first extra hole, has played 13 events on
the Nike Tour and will defend his State Open title at Oak Hill
beginning June 22. He went 64-69-69-76 in the Nike event that
wrapped up two days before the Open qualifier. ``I finally started
playing well last week,'' said Sisk. ``I finally started putting
rounds back to back, but I had a very disappointing Sunday. It's
frustrating, when you need to play well and make some money. I
threw a lot of money away on Sunday. That's the game of golf. It's
a learning experience. Sooner or later, if I'm patient enough,
it'll come around.'' ... Hanefeld, who basically puts in seven days
a week in the pro shop at Salem, put it in perspective for the club
pros who nearly made it: ``I'll be in the shop at 6 a.m. tomorrow.
Business as usual.'' ...  &UR; Joe Kelly &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Brighton Center's most noted
raconteur, delights in retelling this story from the storied past
of George Wright GC. It seems the late  &UR; Eddie Kavanagh  &LR; of
Watertown became frustrated when he lost a ball in the dried-out
rough several years ago, before the course was restored. ``He
simply lit the rough on fire until he found it,'' said Kelly ...
 &UR; Harry McCracken &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the ageless custodian of the New England Golf
Association out of Charles River CC, will preside over the
inaugural New England Senior Amateur (Sept. 21-22) at Metacomet CC.
It's appropriate that the winner will receive the Harry McCracken
Bowl ...  &UR; Casey Martin &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who qualified for the US Open, has
accepted a sponsor's exemption to participate in the Canon Greater
Hartford Open (July 2-5) at the TPC at Cromwell. It will be his
first appearance in a PGA Tour event.

HIGH OCTANE EMOTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; ufdrop &LR; T &UR; xr &LR; riumphantly, and almost tragically, Ernie Irvan's
career has been closely linked with one track on the NASCAR Winston
Cup circuit: Michigan Speedway, the 2-mile, banked superspeedway
that will stage Sunday's Miller Lite 400.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, driving the star-crossed No. 28 Texaco Havoline
Ford Thunderbird for car owner Robert Yates, Irvan almost lost his
life when he crashed into the wall during a practice run at
Michigan. Then last year, in his final campaign with Yates and the
28 car, Irvan gained a new lease on life when he recorded a victory
at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   It perfectly punctuated Irvan's miracle comeback and left him
with an indelible _ you might say life-altering _ impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt I've changed somewhat as a person,'' Irvan
said. ``My whole attitude toward life has changed. I'm a more
patient person. I really pay attention to my family because it's so
easy for your family life to all of a sudden be disrupted. With my
accident, obviously, my family life got disrupted. I know that it's
very important, especially because of my two kids and my wife, to
be able to take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Irvan, driver of the No. 36 Skittles Pontiac fielded
by MB2 Motorsports, would like nothing more than to pull off a
repeat victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a tough track to be able to win on,'' said
Irvan, who has not won a Winston Cup race since last year at
Michigan and is tied with Bobby Hamilton for 14th in the standings
with 1,400 points. ``I'd run second there before. But it never
crossed my mind that one of the places I was going to win at after
I came back was going to be Michigan. I probably thought that was
going to be a little far-fetched. I've been very fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he neared victory last year, Irvan said, ``There's no
doubt when I was going around the last four or five laps I heard a
lot of things going on (with the car). I felt like `Man, what's
going to happen now?'
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just come off a wreck at Dover not too long before
that, and were leading at the end of the race and slid in someone
else's oil and crashed. All those things were going through my
mind. I knew I was pretty lucky right there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't long before Irvan was out of a ride with
Yates, arriving at New Hampshire International Speedway as a
lame-duck driver. But he expressed no resentment over the split.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' he said. ``I feel like Robert did exactly
like he said he was going to do. He had a car for me to drive when
I was able to come back racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, I'm somewhat surprised how he actually maneuvered
and worked the whole thing'' _ taking on Dale Jarrett as a second
driver and then hiring rookie Kenny Irwin as Irvan's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as being bitter at Robert, I feel like he did
everything he had promised to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to bolster the sagging efforts of his two-car
Winston Cup team, car owner  &UR; Richard Childress  &LR; shook up his roster
last week, switching crew chiefs.  &UR; Larry McReynolds &LR; , &UR;  &LR; crew chief
for  &UR; Dale Earnhardt's  &LR; No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet, will now work
with  &UR; Mike Skinner &LR; , &UR;  &LR; while  &UR; Kevin Hamlin  &LR; will be Earnhardt's crew
chief beginning Sunday. ``It was a very difficult decision,'' said
Childress, whose drivers have combined for one victory, two top
five, and five top 10 finishes in 13 starts this season. ``It's the
toughest one I've had to make in quite some time. We were trying to
pick the pos-itives and negatives and see which would weigh out. I
think everyone, including the drivers, were ready for some type of
change. They were just sitting here saying, `What are we going to
do next?' Everybody ended up buying in on the change. It wasn't
what everyone wanted, but it's something that had to be done. It's
a change that had to be made.'' ... Jarrett, who made a quantum
leap in the last 10 races from 27th to a fourth-place tie with
 &UR; Mark Martin  &LR; in the Winston Cup standings, was fuming because he
felt a late-race red flag by NASCAR officials cost him a victory in
last week's Pontiac Excitement 400 at Richmond, Va. With 17 laps
left, Jarrett moved from fourth to first when the top three cars
pitted. Jarrett stayed out, gambling on making a victory gallop
with worn tires. But with seven laps remaining, NASCAR officials
unfurled the red flag and stopped the race to clear debris from an
accident. Instead of cruising around the track under yellow,
Jarrett was forced to wait for a restart with four laps remaining.
That enabled eventual winner  &UR; Terry Labonte  &LR; to bump his way past
Jarrett as the two drivers raced to the yellow flag when a last-lap
crash caused the race to end under caution. ``What hurt us most was
stopping with older tires and them having an opportunity to cool
off,'' Jarrett said. ``A used tire is not as good right there where
Terry and  &UR; Rusty  &LR; ( &UR; Wallace &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; had much fresher tires, so that kind
of threw our strategy out of the window.'' As for his run-in with
Labonte? ``I just think it's something you put in your memory bank
and at an opportune time, yeah, you may be a little bit rougher,''
Jarrett said. ``But it's not that I'm gonna go out and wreck Terry
Labonte. That's not the makeup of NASCAR at all. We're just gonna
race hard and, hopefully, one day I'll beat him.'' ... The
beneficiary of all the Richmond mayhem was  &UR; Jeremy Mayfield &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who
surged to the Winston Cup points lead for the first time in his
career. Despite not having a victory in 13 starts, Mayfield leads
Penske South teammate Wallace, 1,868-1,843 points. Mayfield has six
top five finishes and eight top 10s ... Lycos Inc., the
Waltham-based Internet company, is the title sponsor of Sunday's
Lycos.com 250 Busch Grand National race at Pikes Peak International
Raceway in Fountain, Colo.

   A year ago,  &UR; Billy Boat  &LR; stood in Victory Lane at Texas Motor
Speedway and had his celebration rudely interrupted by  &UR; Arie
Luyendyk &LR; , who, after a subsequent all-night audit of timing and
scoring, was proven to be the real winner of the True Value 500k.
Last weekend, there was no such challenge to Boat's victory in the
Pep Boys Indy Racing League event at Texas. Boat, who put  &UR; A.J.
Foyt's  &LR; car on the pole for the Indianapolis 500, recorded his
first career victory in Foyt's Oldsmobile Aurora-powered Dallara.
``You just have to be able to put it all together on that one right
night,'' said Boat, who took the lead for good from runner-up  &UR; Greg
Ray  &LR; with seven laps remaining. Ray, a native of Plano, Texas, who
recorded his best career finish on his home track, said, ``This is
second place, but it is a victory for us. I can't say enough about
this small team (Thomas Knapp Motorsports).'' ... Hard luck
continued to plague  &UR; Tony Stewart &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who dropped into a tie with
 &UR; Scott Sharp  &LR; for the IRL points lead at 115. Stewart, who finished
dead last in the Indy 500, suffered another engine failure after
177 laps. ``I'd like to act down, like I did at Indy, because
that's how I feel inside,'' said Stewart, who won the pole in
record fashion with a lap of 224.448 miles per hour. ``But I don't
want everybody calling me a crybaby and everything else.'' ...
FedEx CART driver  &UR; Alex Zanardi  &LR; delivered Target/Chip Ganassi
Racing its fifth victory of the season with last weekend's triumph
in the ITT Automotive Detroit Grand Prix. Zanardi, the reigning PPG
Cup champion who has won three races this season, and teammate
 &UR; Jimmy Vasser &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the 1996 series champ and a two-time winner this
year, recently became the first CART team to be pictured on a
Wheaties box. ``Coming from Italy, I was not as familiar with
Wheaties as people in the United States,'' said Zanardi, who leads
 &UR; Greg Moore  &LR; in the PPG Cup standings, 113-96. ``Since we found out
we were going to be honored by being on a box, I really have come
to understand what an honor this is. People tell me, `Now that
you're on a Wheaties box, you've truly made it!'''

ZEILE HOPES FOR BRIEF FLORIDA STAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Zeile always wished he could play for a
champion. He must have wished too hard.
</P>
<P>
   Here he was in the South Bronx, playing for a team the Yankee
Stadium marquee introduced as the ``World Champion Florida
Marlins'' but which was a world champion in name and uniform only.
Later that night, an electronic message board outside the ballpark
would report the score as ``Yankees 5, Tampa Bay 1,'' confusing the
1997 World Series winner with a 1998 expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins are that kind of club now, with a stripped-down
roster consisting of 14 rookies, a few cheap players and a $3.2
million veteran, Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pluses?'' the third baseman said in the dugout before the
game, talking about the effects of the May 14 trade that sent him
from the Dodgers to the Marlins, the trade Los Angeles knows as the
Mike Piazza deal. ``The pluses are what I'm trying to make right
now. I'm trying to !ital!make!off! this into a plus.''
</P>
<P>
   For Zeile, a product of Hart PONY League, Hart High in Newhall
(he played in the 1983 Bernie Milligan All-Star Game) and UCLA, the
best thing about his banishment to the worst excuse for a baseball
team is it shouldn't last long. The Marlins, who are downsizing,
will unload Zeile and his major-league-size contract just as they
unloaded four players to the Dodgers and just as they unloaded
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, 32, is confident he'll be traded to a contender, and
because his contract runs through 1999, he believes that contender
will really want him and not just rent him. In the meantime, he
tries to make the best of a bad lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in the last week, I've resigned myself to the fact I'm
going to be here until the (July 31 trading) deadline,'' Zeile
said, a bat in hand in the Yankee Stadium dugout. ``Now I'm feeling
better about the situation. It's not home, but it's more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The pluses?
</P>
<P>
   It's a low-pressure job, that's one good thing, probably.
</P>
<P>
   And it's kind of fun to be the old guy on a team, the one the
rookies come to with questions like, ``What's to do in Chicago?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be wrong, but I think it's important for them to see how
I handle some adversity,'' Zeile said.
</P>
<P>
   And here's another plus: With any luck, by August he'll get to
see his family again. Which is the thing that makes you feel sorry
for Zeile even while you believe Piazza brought this on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza turned down an $80 million contract offer (knowing he'll
get more this winter). Piazza is a single guy living a male fantasy
and if the worst thing about it is getting bounced from Los Angeles
to Miami to New York, well, poor him.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile accepted !ital!less!off! than his market value in December
1996 to play for his hometown team and to raise his son and
daughter with his wife, gymnast Julianne McNamara, in Westlake
Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the personal side of the game and the business that's not
often paid attention to, and most of the time for good reason,'' he
said, careful not to sound like a complaining millionaire.
``(Signing for less with the Dodgers) was my choice and I did not
have a no-trade clause. That's the team's prerogative (to make a
trade).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the irony of the timing. I put the best numbers of
my career last year,'' added Zeile, whose 31 homers and 89 runs
were personal highs, ``and I was off to an even better start this
year. That simple fact is probably what got me traded.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Dodgers' May 14 loss to Philadelphia, Zeile was about
to drive home to the house his family was living in temporarily
between the close of escrow on the their old house and the
completion of their new one. Fred Claire asked him to stick around
for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw Fred in the clubhouse, I knew something was
up,'' Zeile said. The players had expected something _ not only
because Piazza's contract stalemate forced the Dodgers to seek a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team was floundering and we knew something was going to be
done. We didn't have a lot of guys who were doing what they were
capable of doing. We were scuffling scoring runs. Eric (Karros) had
just gotten back in the lineup but wasn't having the kind of
production he's used to. In the past, Dodger front-office people
were willing to give it time....
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad, from the standpoint of a lifelong Dodger fan, that
the Fox influence showed in this trade. It was a move that would
never have been made in the O'Malley era. But Fox came in and paid
a lot of money and they want results.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse trainers' room, Claire told Zeile and Piazza
they'd been traded. They had expected something to be done _ just
not to them.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, the lifelong Dodgers fan, thinks it was a good trade for
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, a deal like that doesn't come along more than
once a millennium,'' he said. ``It remains to be seen, if you can
get two All-Stars (Gary Sheffield and Bobby Bonilla), a guy like
(Jim) Eisenreich and a guy like CJ (Charles Johnson). On paper it
seems like a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for the Dodgers. Bad for Todd and Julianne.
</P>
<P>
   He's in limbo. ``Dangled,'' as he put it. He waits for the night
Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski shows up in the clubhouse
and asks him to stick around for 10 minutes. Trades to St. Louis,
Chicago _ Zeile has played for the Cardinals and Cubs before _ or
Texas have been rumored. Any of those would be fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't be a Dodger, he wants to help somebody be a
champion. Not help somebody tear one apart.

FUNERAL OF MURDER VICTIM BECOMES PUBLIC EVENT TO DECRY RACISM
<TEXT>
<P>
   By RICHARD STEWART and T.J. MILLING
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
c. 1998 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JASPER, Texas _ In a private ceremony that became a public event
Saturday, the family of James Byrd Jr. buried the man whose brutal
murder just outside his hometown became a symbol for racism and
hatred everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's pastor, a high school classmate and other local ministers
shared personal memories. They also shared the pulpit with a
senator, a Cabinet member and nationally known preachers who never
knew Byrd before he was savagely beaten, chained to the bumper of a
pickup truck and dragged almost three miles along a winding country
road.
</P>
<P>
   While those inside spoke of peace, love and healing, an armed
group of black militants marched and swore that any future violence
done to African-Americans would be met with violence.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny church, Greater New Bethel Baptist, which had 59 in
attendance last Sunday on the morning Byrd's body was found, was
packed with almost 300 mourners. At least twice that many sweltered
outside under a large tent.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Byrd's photograph sat on a simple casket flanked with
some of the flowers that filled four rooms of a local funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Byrd's death so shocked the country
that it has caused all Americans to think about the ills of hate
and racism. ``This could very well change the state of the
nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson suggested that just as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier
stands for all those killed in war, a special memorial tomb for
Byrd should be erected. That tomb, he said, could serve as a place
``for blacks and whites to rally, a tomb that says choose
redemption over retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said racism is like glass in a wound suffered by the nation.
``We must heal the wound,'' he said, ``but we must get the glass
out of the wound.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson urged mourners to ``turn a crucifixion into a
resurrection.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas' U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, said Byrd's
murder and his family's way of coping with it should be an example
to others. ``We are diminished by this act, but from the depths of
our pain, the fog of all our disbelief, we are going to emerge
stronger,'' she said. She praised Byrd's family for asking for
healing and justice, but not retribution. ``We have seen a family
tested,'' she said. ``We are better today because we have seen a
family tested like no other family has been tested.''U.S.
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater read a letter to Byrd's
family from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``People across our nation have been shocked and saddened by
this tragedy,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence and hatred in our society hurt us all, but few have
had to endure its effects as personally as have you and your loved
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater said it is clear that Byrd was brought up in a Christian
family. ``No hate lives in that house,'' he said of the family
home.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Kenneth Lyons, pastor of the New Bethel church, said
that when he first took over as minister of the Jasper church more
than a decade ago, Byrd asked him, ``What do you preach?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I preach Jesus,'' he said, to the shouts of ``Amen'' by some
of the congregation. ``The gates of hell shall not stand against
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be the legacy of Mr. Byrd,'' Lyons said. ``Preach
Jesus, because we've tried everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Other dignitaries in attendance included Houston Mayor Lee Brown
and civil rights activist Al Sharpton of New York, as well as U.S.
Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., and Texas politicians, Sheila
Jackson Lee, D-Houston; Jim Turner, D-Crockett, and Nick Lampson,
D-Beaumont. Earlier this week Lee had announced that Chicago Bulls
forward Dennis Rodman had offered to pay for Byrd's funeral, but
the family had not fully discussed the offer. On Saturday, he added
that Rodman has now pledged $25,000 for a fund for Byrd's family;
Byrd had three children, one still in high school, and one
grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen too much hatred, too much killing,'' Jackson Lee
said in front of the jail where the three young white suspects are
being held. ``We must be better and not bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 state and local law enforcement officers,
including Special Weapons and Tactical teams, were stationed around
the city, plus a contingent of FBI agents. The day passed without
violence although there were some tense moments when a group of
black men from the Dallas area, toting shotguns and rifles, marched
through the city.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee called for the commission on race relations to hold
a town hall meeting in Jasper in the coming days and asked the
federal government to take over the prosecution of the suspects,
Shawn Berry, John William ``Bill'' King and Lawrence Russell Brewer
Jr. Congresswoman Waters, who chairs the Congressional Black
Caucus, said crimes like this one should automatically trigger
federal involvement to ``ensure there is swift and tough justice.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the FBI is heading a multiagency task force
investigation into the killing, and federal authorities are hopeful
that they will be able to prosecute the suspects for a hate crime
with civil rights violations. That would mean the federal death
penalty if a conviction is won.
</P>
<P>
   A phalanx of politicians and officials joined Jackson in calling
for healing and reconciliation while decrying Byrd's slaying as
reprehensible and demanding the severest punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, 49, was walking along Martin Luther King Boulevard when he
was picked up by three men in a pickup truck early Sunday. He was
beaten and chained by his ankles with a towing chain to the truck,
then dragged for nearly three miles and dismembered in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Brother Byrd's body was torn, America's spirit was torn,
and we need to reweave it with equal protection under the law,''
Sharpton said. ``We cannot allow these young men not to be a
national example. This was not a crime against a person. It was a
crime against a people.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston City Councilman Jew Don Boney said too many people have
died as Byrd did, and he demanded action, not just prayer and talk.
Jackson Lee, who compared Byrd to Jesus Christ, called for a
renewed commitment to affirmative action programs. And state Sen.
Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, while praising the city's handling of the
tragedy, said it is an indication that ``something is still sick in
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   By far the most provocative statements came from a group of
armed Black Panthers, street gang members and a Nation of Islam
leader wearing black military-style uniforms. State police stopped
the group of about 20 men at the edge of town, and two came to the
sheriff's department to negotiate. They were escorted to the jail
to address the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black power!'' Khallid Muhammad shouted, his lieutenant
punctuating his words by loudly cocking his shotgun. ``Violence and
racism by the white man in America is just as American as apple or
cherry pie.... The white man is a cold-blooded murderer by
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad condemned Jesse Jackson as a puppet of the White House
and called on blacks to arm themselves for self-defense. He said
his men came to teach local blacks how to patrol and control their
own neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The group marched from the jail to the church, where Byrd's
funeral had been held earlier, and back, outnumbered 3 to 1 by
police and Texas Rangers with the Jasper police chief and the
Jasper County sheriff in the lead. A helicopter circled overhead,
and scores of media representatives documented their every step, as
they shook hands with blacks along the road.
</P>
<P>
   The few locals along the route were polite, but after a week of
spectacle, they said, they wished the Panthers and the media would
go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they here?'' asked Charlene Renfro, who is black and
lives in Jasper. ``The (Byrd) family wants to heal. They need to
go, and let God take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the group from the lobby of the sheriff's department,
one of Byrd's cousins wept with frustration and said, ``He would
not have wanted this. He loved people. He would have said, `Let's
come to the table and work this out.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of Byrd's cousins, Pat Butler of Houston, said Byrd had
always said he would someday achieve greatness, but he thought it
would come as a singer. Byrd was known around town for his singing
voice and his trumpet- and piano-playing.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said he would be pleased, and also a little amused, to
find out that his death is causing such a great national reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fitting,'' she said, of the reaction of those who
want his death to help people turn away from hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the armed militants, however, she said, ``Our family
is not like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But many black residents from surrounding areas had come to
Jasper Saturday, and many of them seemed to feel a certain
solidarity with the armed marchers.
</P>
<P>
   Hazel Bolton from the nearby town of Center, thought the march
was a good idea that would ``wake up a lot of people.'' And Barbara
Cloudy, also of Center, said it was a racist assumption that where
armed black people were, violence would follow. She said the men
were just ready to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Barhitte of Jasper, who is white, said the march terrified
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an isolated incident that's got them stirred up,''
she said. ``When you see guns like that, it scares you.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad refused to divulge his group's future plans in Jasper,
calling the media ``white devils.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No wise general expresses his plans before the eyes of his
enemies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Police Chief Harlan Alexander said the militants have a
constitutional right to march as long as they stay peaceful. He
said they also have the right to carry legal firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is East Texas,'' he said. ``Almost every pickup you see
around here has a gun rack in it.''

METROSTARS BEAT MIAMI, 3-1  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK BELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a game that was soccer's equivalent of an Off Off
Broadway show, the MetroStars defeated the Miami Fusion Saturday
night for the second time in less than a week, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   With the World Cup in full swing in France, Major League Soccer
is left to play on the periphery. The MetroStars (8-6), who are two
games over .500 for the first time in their modest three-year
history, trusted that their fans would turn out at Giants Stadium
after three top-flight Cup games monopolized television for six
hours. Some 15,215 people satisfied their soccer craving, but the
crowd was well below the MetroStars' 22,935 season average, which
is second in MLS.
</P>
<P>
   The threesome of Eduardo Hurtado, Giovanni Savarese, and Mike
Sorber accounted for the MetroStars' goals. Savarese scored 17
minutes into the game after a pass from Sorber led Hurtado through
the Miami defense. Hurtado's hard shot from about 20 yards bounded
off the goal post and directly to Savarese for the easy tap-in.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes into the second half, Sorber sent Savarese down the
right side with another long lead pass. Savarese found Hurtado
unmarked on the left side of the penalty area and his hard,
left-footed shot beat Miami goalkeeper Scott Budnick low to the far
post.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese added his second of the game, and seventh of the
season, off a pass from Sorber 10 minutes later. Sorber's three
assists in a game tied the club record set by Roberto Donadoni in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   A goal in the 88th minute by Miami's Nelson Vargas deprived Tony
Meola of his 17th career MLS shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to have a comfortable victory for once,''
MetroStars Coach Alfonso Mondelo said. ``And, you know, it's really
helped us in a way having World Cup games to watch two or three
times a day. It keeps soccer on our players' brains. It keeps them
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami (5-10) has lost six games in a row while playing without
the Colombian international Carlos Valderrama, who is playing in
France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when we were learning to play with him, Valderrama left
the team to play for Colombia,'' Miami Coach Carlos (Cacho) Cordoba
said. ``We have lost him at a crucial moment. Things will change
when he comes back.''

IN NL WEST, KEEPING COOL PROVES COSTLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers have won seven of 11 after Saturday's
loss to Colorado, but they never have gotten really hot this
season. That is what separates them from the top two teams in the
National League West.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres ran away with the division early, then
dropped to second this past week when the San Francisco Giants won
11 straight. The streak ended Wednesday against the Seattle
Mariners and now the Padres are back on top after winning five in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   It also ended with Giants second baseman Jeff Kent on the 15-day
disabled list with a sprained right knee after Mariners shortstop
Alex Rodriguez made a rough slide into the bag on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez knocked Orel Hershiser out of Wednesday's game with a
line drive off the pitcher's right wrist. He also had a hand in
Barry Bonds leaving Wednesday's game because of tightness in his
calf shortly after being struck by a Bill Swift pitch. Rodriguez
was hit by a pitch in the top of the first, possibly in retaliation
for Kent. Swift reciprocated by hitting Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Real pennant race stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The streak matched the longest for the Giants in 32 years, since
the 1966 team won 12 in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants picked up four games and passed the Padres by going
11-0 while San Diego went 7-4. The streak was the longest in the
major leagues this season. The club batted .294, averaging 6.1 runs
and 10.2 hits per game. The Giants hit 12 home runs during the
streak, five of them by Brian Johnson. The pitchers posted a 3.03
earned run average, limiting opponents to a .242 average. The
starters were 9-0 with a 3.71 ERA. The bullpen went 2-0 with eight
saves and a 2.02 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was the Padres' turn. They lost twice to Texas to fall
out of first but rebounded with a 17-8 victory over the Rangers on
Sunday and a sweep of the Cincinnati Reds. The Padres sold 110,000
tickets for Friday and Saturday's games with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   They were in a position to take a dive. Injuries to third
baseman Ken Caminiti, right fielder Tony Gwynn and first baseman
Wally Joyner, coupled with early season slumps by center fielder
Steve Finley, shortstop Chris Gomez and catcher Carlos Hernandez
had helped the Giants wipe out the 6{-game lead the Padres held
over them little more than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Padres learned that Gwynn will probably be out a
week with a pulled calf muscle and that reserve catcher Greg Myers
could be out for as much as two months after chipping a bone in his
left wrist in a collision at Houston with Astros pitcher Sean
Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's slump overshadowed the fact that they're on a pace
to win 100 games and draw 2.36 million fans at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET HOMECOMING
</P>
<P>
   Jose Canseco, Toronto's 33-year-old veteran outfielder and Miami
resident, ruined the Marlins' chance for their first sweep of the
year when he hit two homers Wednesday. The second was a solo shot
in the top of the 10th inning off reliever Jay Powell that gave the
Blue Jays a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to show the crowd here in Miami that I still
have some pop left,'' Canseco said.
</P>
<P>
   The homers were his 18th and 19th of the season. The first was
classic Canseco, traveling over the 434-foot sign in dead center
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day here was very nerve-racking,'' Canseco said. ``I
had about 50, 60 friends and family here and it was the first time
they'd seen me play. So I was nervous, but I calmed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco had almost the entire Blue Jays' team and coaching staff
over for a pre-game barbecue at his 12,000-square foot house that
also includes a 5,000-square foot gym, ivory and Chinese art
collections and an iguana pit packed with four iguanas.
</P>
<P>
   WOEFUL WOHLERS
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox planned to limit Mark Wohlers to
non-pressure situations until his closer could regain command of
his pitches. He probably wishes he had followed through with that
plan Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux was three outs from becoming the National League's
first 10-game winner when Wohlers came in to pitch the ninth with a
5-2 lead over Montreal. But he walked the first hitter and was
pulled. Mike Cather came on and wound up allowing a game-winning
grand slam to Darond Stovall. Wohlers, eight for eight in save
opportunities but shaky for the past month, met with Cox before
last Sunday's game in Baltimore about the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll use him in certain spots and try to get the rust off,''
Cox said. Wohlers was angry Monday and said he should be treated
like any other player who's struggling. ``I've been in every save
situation possible since 1995,'' he said. ``I'm a closer, I'm going
to be a closer and I want the ball in the ninth inning. Since '91,
I've seen a lot of guys struggle. Guys in the lineup and guys in
the rotation, and they've been allowed to work through it.''
Wohlers' control has been so spotty, eight walks in 62/3 innings
since his return from the disabled list May 24, that Cox doesn't
feel comfortable using him in ninth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg, who replaced Maddux in the eighth inning, was
expected to receive most of the save opportunities until Wohlers
reclaimed his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's been struggling a little with his control. Maybe
if he's not in a pressure situation, it might be a better way to
get the kinks out,'' Ligtenberg said. ``I don't know if it's
mechanical or what. I think you've got to keep going to him because
he's certainly got the best stuff on the staff. He can be the best
closer in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   NO PUBLICITY STUNT
</P>
<P>
   Brad Radke out-pitched rookie phenom Kerry Wood in Wednesday's
8-0 Minnesota victory that snapped the Cubs' 10-game winning
streak. For Radke, it was his third complete game and first shutout
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But he was the forgotten one heading into this pitching matchup,
even though he won 20 games last year for the lowly Twins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That always happens. If you're a Minnesota Twin, you're going
to get overlooked,'' said outfielder Matt Lawton. ``It's like Todd
Walker. He's a great hitter (.335), but nobody talks about him. If
he was a New York Yankee, he'd be a poster boy all over town. Radke
is like that. I'm sure his day is going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Radke was so masterful that he actually had a three-pitch sixth
inning:
</P>
<P>
   Brant Brown lofted a fastball for an easy fly to right . . . .
Mickey Morandini skied another fastball into an easy fly to center
. . . . and Sammy Sosa, looking to homer in his sixth consecutive
game, was badly fooled on a hanging slider and grounded meekly to
third.
</P>
<P>
   Radke retired the final 14 Cubs in order, including Sosa on
another ground ball to third with the crowd standing to finish it
off.
</P>
<P>
   HE SAID, HE SAID
</P>
<P>
   Was there some bad blood last Sunday when Boston's Pedro
Martinez struck Mike Piazza on the wrist with a fastball? The two
were teammates with the Dodgers, and after last Sunday it sounds
like they never were very close.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was quoted in the Boston Herald saying, ``(Bleep)
Piazza,'' after Piazza questioned whether Martinez was throwing at
him.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza responded by saying: ``I thought it was pretty funny....
All the money in the world can't buy any class. I don't think
there's any excuse for language like that in the papers. Maybe he
should invest in some lessons in etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has a six-year, $75-million contract, then said,
``What class is he talking about? He's talking about class? He was
a millionaire since he was a kid. But I can tell you the fans can't
say anything bad against me. What class? Education? School? He's
not a better person than me. You can make your own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, insisting on the last word, said, ``I think it's
ridiculous for him to make it into a background thing.... If he's
got a problem with me, he knows where to find me.''

FURYK MOVES TO NINE-UNDER IN THE BUICK CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., eliminated earlier, this story is now restored)  
 (HLW)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ It was a long, rainy day at the Buick Classic,
the kind of day that tested everyone's patience.
</P>
<P>
   Players spent more time in the clubhouse than on the golf
course. Spectators spent more time watching rain than watching
golf. Twenty-seven golfers decided they had better things to do and
withdrew, while two others were disqualified for missing tee times.
</P>
<P>
   However, when second-round play finally resumed after a rain
delay of almost six hours, Jim Furyk took advantage of the soft
greens, firing at pins and seizing the lead before play was
suspended by darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a sizzling eight-under-par 63, the best round of the
tournament so far, Furyk moved to nine under for the tournament
(133) and took a one-stroke lead over Kevin Sutherland, the
first-round leader. J.P. Hayes was alone in third place at seven
under par, with five holes still left to finish in the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 26 players were still on the course when play was
suspended, and they will return to complete the second round at 8
a.m. on Sunday. A decision will be made Sunday on whether to
shorten the tournament to 54 holes. With the U.S. Open starting on
Thursday in San Francisco, players are eager to make the
cross-country trip, and they do not want to stay until Monday. And
with a possibility of more rain on Sunday, the tournament would
probably be fortunate to get 54 holes in.
</P>
<P>
   For Furyk, one of the game's most consistent players, it was
another example of how low he can go when he finds a groove. In
March at the Doral-Ryder Open, Furyk shot a 10-under par 62 in
windy conditions, one of the best rounds on tour this year.
Saturday's round was also impressive, as Furyk sustained momentum
and concentration despite the delays and miserable conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wake up in the morning, look outside and hope it's an
ugly day, but I've shot some good rounds in bad conditions,'' Furyk
said. ``I don't really complain or get a bad attitude. And when you
get a day like this, it's easier to pick up shots. When you get
perfect weather, everyone is shooting the lights out.''
</P>
<P>
   Furyk has six top 10 finishes this year, including fourth place
at the Masters and second place at the Mastercard Colonial. But he
has not won since the 1996 United Airlines Hawaiian Open, and he
hoped that his drought was about to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you win a golf tournament it helps your confidence,
but whether I win or not, I have a tough test ahead of me next
week,'' said Furyk, whose 63 was one shot off the tournament record
of 62 set by Jimmy Wright in 1976. ``But I'm not looking ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Fleisher, who will turn 50 in October, also enjoyed a
strong day, shooting his second consecutive 68 to move to six under
par, just three strokes off the lead. Fleisher is preparing for the
Senior PGA Tour, which he referred to as ``life after death.'' And
while his only victory on the PGA Tour came in the New England
Classic in 1991, he proved Saturday that he can still compete with
the younger generation when he is sharp.
</P>
<P>
   After a half-hour fog delay in the morning, play was stopped by
rain and lightning at 11:35 a.m., and did not resume until 5:30
p.m. The first delay occurred when Furyk was about to tee off on
the first hole, and the second delay came when he was on the eighth
green. But when he returned to the course, he was in a zone. His
bogey-free round included eight birdies, and he shot a 31 on the
back nine. He made a 50-foot putt for birdie at No. 11 to keep his
momentum going, but for the most part, he relied on accurate drives
and approach shots that left him short putts for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   While Furyk is not one of the tour's longest hitters, he
consistently hits fairways, and his putting stroke is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sutherland shot a one-under-par 70 Saturday after
opening with a 64. So while Sutherland is still in contention,
Furyk will start Sunday as the man to beat, no matter how many
holes are left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure guys don't want to play Monday, but I have to do
whatever the tour decides,'' Furyk said. ``I can't really control
that. I just have to keep concentrating on my game.''

LYON, France _ They began the show about seven hours before the
5:30 p.m. World Cup kickoff _ thousands of them, all over town,
``warming up,'' as the fellow standing in the middle of the
Bellecour plaza and holding a half-empty bottle of tequila called
it.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast with Jose Cuervo.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable turnout of Mexican faithful here was nothing if
not enthusiastic. It was nothing if not truly faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican fans were an awesome sight around town and at scenic
44,000-seat Stade Gerland, loudly singing the national anthem in
unison, chanting, screaming and filling probably 35,000 of the
seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so happy seeing my Mexican people in the stands,''
midfielder Alberto Garcia Aspe said. ``To hear them and see them
when we're so far from home, it was something I won't forget my
entire life. They probably broke open their wallets to get here.
They came a long way for this game.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mexico's team, seemingly embattled and beaten in recent
weeks, came a long way during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's stunningly impressive 3-1 victory over South Korea in
a Group E opener was nothing if not appropriate compensation for a
legion of Mexican fans expecting the worst, but hoping for the
best.
</P>
<P>
   They got Mexico's best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a big step forward today,'' said forward Luis
Hernandez, who scored two of Mexico's goals. ``To walk out there
and see the stands in nothing but red, white and green was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did they all come from?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mexico's fans seemed to attack Stade Gerland from every
direction, much like the previously struggling Mexican team did in
an unexpected show of force and cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks preceding Saturday's game, which some expected
South Korea to win, Mexico looked frustrated and in disarray,
losing to a pair of Under-23 teams and being routed 5-2 by Norway.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican team also seemed to fall into a state of transition
at the worst of times, after firing coach Bora Milutinovic and
replacing him with Manuel Lapuente, who caught more criticism than
Milutinovic ever did.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, everything turned out beautifully for the
Mexicans, who turned a 1-0 halftime deficit, which came thanks to
an unlucky bounce off one of their player's head, into domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We improved today,'' said Lapuente, whose team gained three
points with group matches remaining against Belgium and the
Netherlands. ``We can't be confused because it was just one step.
But I'm happier today than I was yesterday. I'm happier today than
I was last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it would have been difficult to find anyone who could
believe the Mexican team would so control a South Korean squad
known for tough defense and protecting leads.
</P>
<P>
   And because South Korea took a 1-0 lead in the first half when a
free kick from 30 yards away bounced off Mexico's Duilio Davino's
head and into the net, South Korea seemed to be in perfect shape to
pack the defense and take the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they scored that goal, it was difficult on all of us,''
Hernandez said. ``We felt our hearts fall. We were disappointed
because we were playing better than them, but the good thing was we
didn't lose our heads. We stayed determined.''
</P>
<P>
   And two minutes after the goal, Mexico caught the break that
seemed to launch it into high gear. Ha Seok-ju, who scored South
Korea's goal, tackled Jesus Ramirez hard from behind and earned a
red card from referee Gunter Benko of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico immediately began pushing the ball forward with the
one-man advantage. From that point, Mexico outshot South Korea 12-3
and scored all three goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're losing and playing better than the other team, you
can go crazy trying to score and tie it,'' Hernandez said. ``But we
stayed in control and we gained confidence after (the red card).
That's what did it for us. Offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The tying goal came off a corner kick, when substitute Ricardo
Pelaez nicked the ball on a header attempt but snared the rebound
and slammed it into the net in the 51st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Next came an impressive ad-lib goal by Hernandez, who trapped a
pass too close to the right post to get off a strong kick but
managed to chip the ball with his heel between the upright and
Korean goalie Kim Byung-ji in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to win the Cup, there's no other reason to come,''
Hernandez said. ``That's why we're here, to win. You do whatever it
takes so long as you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's second goal, in the 84th minute, provided the
insurance that sent the Mexican faithful into a frenzy again. It
was more of a conventional blast from outside the box the keeper
could not handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't played this well in a while,'' Hernandez said.
``(Friday) we talked about playing our best game and we had high
expectations. There are some people who don't think we have a very
good team. But we know we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has Mexico looked better than it did Saturday. Besides
the 12-3 shots edge over the final 60-plus minutes, Mexico
dominated ball possession even before the red card, earning more
corner kicks, more shots and getting two nice saves from goalie
Jorge Campos.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also was Mexico's first in a World Cup tournament in
Europe. In eight previous World Cup games on European soil, Mexico
had lost five and tied three. They had been outscored 18-4.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday was a different show _ in more ways than one.
</P>
<P>
   After the victory, many of Mexico's fans waited outside the
stadium doors to cheer their heroes even more. In the train
stations, the subways, the plazas, the cheering went through the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a day that all of Mexico needed,'' Hernandez said.
``You could tell when we were struggling that we had it in us to
play better. Today we played very good. Maybe our luck is
changing.''

Jazz tries to take Bulls by the horns
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SALT LAKE CITY _ It's funny how the road to immortality can be
marred by the occasional pothole of imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls will go down in history as
the greatest sports dynasty of the '90s and one of the best ever.
But even Jordan isn't immune to failure.
</P>
<P>
   Or doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And, rest assured, doubt is precisely what is creeping into the
heads of Jordan and the rest of the Bulls as the NBA Finals
switches back to Utah's Delta Center tonight. The Great Salt Fakes,
as they had been called in Chicago before Game 5, now have more
than a glimmer of hope.
</P>
<P>
   There's no denying that Chicago still has control of the series,
leading 3-2. The Bulls have two chances to win one and even though
they have to win their sixth title in eight years on Utah's court,
it is there series to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz would have to do what no team has done before in the
NBA Finals _ come back from a 3-1 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, trying to keep their reputation as a confident,
too-cool-to-lose squad, believes the 83-81 hiccup in Game 5 was
just that _ a one-time aberration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody should remember it was a two-point win by the
Jazz,'' Chicago coach Phil Jackson said. ``You don't want to throw
out the baby with the bath water. We're fine. It's not a dramatic
thing that we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic? No. Surprising? A little. Momentum-shifting? No doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to make the trip back to Utah,'' said Scottie
Pippen, who came up 2-for-16 small in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Too late. The Bulls were beaten convincingly in the second half
of Game 5 and therefore will have to prove their greatness again on
somebody else's court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still kicking,'' John Stockton said. ``We're going back
home, something we worked hard for all season long.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is no place in the NBA more difficult to play at than
the Delta Center. It's louder, more raucous and hungrier than any
other arena, even Chicago's United Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz is 8-2 at home during the playoffs, although it bungled
Game 2 there against the Bulls. Now that Utah has kept its foot
wedged between the Bulls and the door to the throne room, Sloan's
troops expect more from themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go home now with the home-court advantage,'' Utah center
Greg Ostertag said. ``We've played pretty well at home this year. I
think we're kind of anticipating a different attitude there.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if Ostertag would have a little different
attitude. He was benched in favor of Antoine Carr in Game 5,
basically because Carr ``can catch the basketball,'' coach Jerry
Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the third quarter, they started Carr and he really was the
difference in the game outside of Malone,'' Jackson said. ``He was
their fourth option coming off the bench, and they finally found
one that did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr's contributions helped. But the two things that made the
biggest difference in Game 5 were Malone's 39-point eruption and
the Jazz's ability to confound Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Bryon Russell, who has been a misfit on offense this series,
handled Jordan virtually throughout the game and he did a nice job
of keeping a hand in his face. Jordan shot 9-for-26 in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They switched and put him on me continuously,'' Jordan said.
``No (Jeff) Hornacek at all, which was one of the adjustments they
made. Now we'll make adjustments going into the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's will to win was, for one night, matched by Malone. He
torched Luc Longley and Dennis Rodman with equal disregard.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has been known for his ability to hit hot streaks that
last for weeks. And since there's only a maximum of four more days
left in the Finals, the Bulls have to be concerned that Malone took
an initial step into a zone on Friday and will continue there
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when we're good, that's what we do,'' said Stockton of
Malone's big Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Pippen had been a legitimate MVP candidate in the
series before he laid his big egg Friday. His shooting was pitiful,
although he did have 11 rebounds to go with 11 assists. If he had
made a few shots, the Bulls would have been crowned by now.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Pippen has to hope he's not starting a stretch where he
can't find the basket. His career has been peppered by stretches
where his shooting deserts him.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, however, said he will demand that his team not panic,
that the Bulls remember that they played the Jazz well in both
games in Utah to start this series. All they need is one more
supreme effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough night (in Game 5),'' he said. ``They were very
good with their hands, stripping the ball. They were quick to the
ball and Malone got going. But we were game. And we had our
opportunities right to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They matched us small ball, so to speak, with Malone starting
at center and Carr playing a lot. And we got a little enchanted
with the 3-point line. Twenty shots is a little much for us as a
team from the 3-point line.''
</P>
<P>
   The 3-point line has been a strong ally for the Bulls throughout
the series, not only because they've been able to make those shots,
but because the Jazz hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5, the Jazz fired up only five shots from downtown,
making one.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. Maybe Utah has stumbled onto something.
</P>
<P>
   Playing smart. Playing sensational, helping defense. Fighting
every step of the way. Not settling for the easy way out, like
shooting 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a do-or-die situation, you have to scratch and
claw,'' Hornacek said. ``We can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes they can.

 &HT;    Mazzone sits down with Wohlers, Cather
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone didn't waste any
time doing some damage control after Friday night's bullpen fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mazzone spoke privately with both Mark Wohlers and
Mike Cather, the pair making a mess of the ninth inning as Montreal
overcame a three-run deficit to win 7-5. Wohlers opened the inning
with a walk, was pulled and Cather came on and eventually gave up a
grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Mark that we're not giving up on him,'' Mazzone said.
``Mike answered his own question. He said he was out there trying
to strike everyone out and as long as I have known him he has been
a guy that tries to get ground balls. When you are trying to strike
everyone out, you are putting too much pressure on yourself, trying
to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers is the biggest concern because it's doubtful this club
can win it all without a dominant closer Mazzone said the problem
with Wohlers is he can not get comfortable with his release point
of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying different things,'' Mazzone said. ``I'm not smart
enough to give you a timetable on when he will feel comfortable. It
might be overnight, it might be a couple of weeks. I just know that
the key is to get Mark in there and get him doing well so he walks
away feeling good. This is difficult emotionally on him.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the problems of the bullpen, it doesn't appear the
Braves are going to make any moves outside the organization to
improve it. At least not now.
</P>
<P>
   When general manager John Schuerholz was asked about the bullpen
Saturday, he said, ``It's a question that comes after a bad night
... it's like the vultures. I think they will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he has been talking to other clubs about bullpen help,
Schuerholz said emphatically, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   That may change if there are a few more nights like Friday. One
player the Braves might be able to get is Reds closer Jeff Shaw,
who is third in the league with 17 saves.
</P>
<P>
   Announcer DL
</P>
<P>
   Braves announcer Skip Caray remains at his home with a back
injury and could be out for a while. The Braves replaced Caray
Friday night with TNT basketball studio announcer Ernie Johnson
Jr., but on Saturday they had to make another addition because Joe
Simpson missed the game to attend his daughter's high school
graduation. So Daron Sutton, the son of Braves announcer Don
Sutton, joined his father in the radio booth while Johnson and Pete
Van Wieren did television the entire game. Speaking of Johnson, he
has a busy schedule ahead of him with the NBA draft on June 24 and
next month's Goodwill Games. But listening to Johnson Friday, it
was hard to tell he hasn't done baseball in a while. Like his
father Ernie Sr. he is the consummate professional. As far as the
Suttons, it was their first major league game together and said the
veteran Don, ``So why am I nervous?''
</P>
<P>
   Interleague numbers
</P>
<P>
   The first segment of interleague play is over and the National
League won 43-41. The Braves, which split their six games, led all
teams in homers with 11 while Texas had the best batting average
(.318). Interestingly, the Diamondbacks scored the most runs (41)
while the Mets had the best ERA (2.13). Braves first baseman Andres
Galarraga hit four homers in interleague games as well as Sammy
Sosa for the Cubs and Mo Vaughn for Boston. Galarraga was also tops
in RbIs with 11 along with Albert Belle of the White Sox. The best
average was Anaheim's Darin Erstad (.625).
</P>
<P>
   Neagle the TV star
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle, who is doing a 30-minute television show with
Dothan (Al.) media personality David Meckley, is drawing good
reviews. Currently, the show can be seen just in Alabama, but
Meckley said that Atlanta-based cable outlet Media One has asked
for tapes which means it may be on the air here later this season.

 &HT;    Jeff Gordon: The man nascar fans love to hate
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- This was supposed to be a treat for Winston Cup fans.
The drivers in last weekend's NASCAR race at Richmond were
introduced and paraded slowly around the track in an open
convertible.
</P>
<P>
   As Jeff Gordon reached the backstretch, David Watson cupped his
hands to his lips and let out a prolonged, ``Boooooo.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's a jerk,'' Watson explained. ``Because he wins too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the 103,000 fans at the track echoed those
sentiments. By the time Gordon reached pit road, he had been booed
in every section of the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, Gordon's race ended early, when Rusty Wallace
bumped Gordon's car and sent it spinning into the wall. When Gordon
climbed out of his crumpled vehicle, the fans went wild, gleefully
jumping up and down with fists in the air, as if their team had
just scored the winning touchdown in the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon claimed he didn't hear the boos. After two years of this
kind of treatment, he has become numb to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really notice their reaction,'' Gordon said several
days later. ``I wouldn't pay any attention to it, if I did. Dale
Earnhardt once told me, 'Just listen for the noise, wave and
smile.' There are some drivers who don't get any reaction. I look
at it as the price of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Success has never been a problem for the 27-year-old Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   He won his first Winston Cup title at age 24. He added another
championship last year. In fact, since 1995, Gordon has become a
dominant figure in the sport, with 30 victories and 67 top-five
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   That type of success in any sport normally breeds hero-worship.
But not in NASCAR. Fans boo his introduction; they boo his frequent
victories; they cheer his misfortune. They attack him from the
Internet, where 10 Web sites are devoted to Gordon-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   So what has Gordon done to deserve this? Fans say he wins too
often; he's too young to dominate NASCAR; he whines too much; he's
reckless on the track; and he's too clean-cut for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they want any new, young guy to dominate,'' said
veteran driver Darrell Waltrip, who went through a similar
experience in the 1970s, when he began winning big on the NASCAR
scene. ``When somebody comes in and starts to beat their heroes,
they're basically beating that fan. It's like he's going up and
beating that fan up real bad. So they react to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as the boos began to grow, Gordon seemed mystified.
``In a way, I feel like I understand it,'' he said, ``and in other
ways, I feel like I don't.'' In 1998, he has become all too
familiar with the sounds.
</P>
<P>
   He said he isn't hurt by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if somebody comes up to my face and I'm with my wife,
then I think that's taking it a little too far,'' he said. ``But
that doesn't really happen very often, if any. You just grit your
teeth and say, 'Hey, it's not personal.' They don't even know me or
my wife. These fans are very unique, very loyal to their driver,
their sponsor, to their manufacturer. Sometimes they have strange
ways of showing it. I don't think there needs to be a reaction by
me. I just kind of let it roll off my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon takes solace in the fact that he does have support in
some circles. But that support group often is dwarfed by the
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who cheer for me, because I know the
numbers in my fan club, about 20,000,'' Gordon said. ``I know a lot
of people are buying T-shirts and hats and things. But there are
people out there who don't pull for me, too. I don't expect
everybody in the grandstand to be a fan. As long as I'm winning
races and we're doing what we're doing on the race track, I'm
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And the anti-Gordon fans are miserable.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's qualifying in Richmond, Travis Womble wore his
special T-shirt, made by a friend. It had the No. 24 (Gordon's car
number) on the front with a circled banned sign. ``Anybody But
Jeff!!'' was written on the back. Womble was one of several
volunteer firefighters from nearby Mechanicsville, who were sitting
high in Turn 4 to cheer their favorites, Rusty Wallace and Dale
Earnhardt. They also came to vent on Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hate Gordon,'' Womble said. ``We just can't stand him.
He wrecks our favorite drivers. He cries about every little thing
that happens to him. He's a dirty driver. Not all the time, but a
lot of times, yes. Last year or the year before at Bristol, he ran
into the back of Rusty just to pass him. Plus, I just can't stand
the fact that he wins every race.''
</P>
<P>
   Mention Gordon to these firemen, and you fan their flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon was a Ford man all his life,'' Steve Phillips said.
``Ford was going to set him up in Winston Cup, and he jumped to
Chevrolet. I don't think that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to the scanner,'' Chris Goodman said, ``he
complains the whole race about how bad the car is. Then the last
10-20 laps, he'll come back and win it. So people will think he won
the race with a bad car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got an awesome team,'' Mike Bohannon said. ``If you put
him in anybody else's car, he couldn't do anything. Plus, everybody
on the track has earned the right to be there; they've flipped end
over end. He hasn't even had a bad wreck yet and gotten hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if Gordon had a house in Mechanicsville that was on
fire? ``Legally, we'd have to put it out,'' Womble said, ``but I
don't think we'd want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason the anti-Gordonites are more obvious these
days is the communal nature of fans. Most races draw more than
100,000 spectators. They arrive 12 hours early for a convenient
parking spot. They need something to pass the time, besides eating
and drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Before last Saturday's race, Jay Faison walked through the
Richmond Fairgrounds parking area with a crude anti-Gordon sign.
``I think people hate him 'cause he's just too good,'' Faison said.
``Have you seen the guy with the Gordon toilet seat?''
</P>
<P>
   That would belong to John Denbek, a truck driver from Richmond,
who wears an earring in his left ear bearing a miniature No. 6 and
a tiny Mark Martin car.
</P>
<P>
   Denbek has carried a toilet seat with Gordon's picture in the
middle to races at Darlington, Rockingham and Richmond. He's poking
fun at Gordon's 1996 championship loss. Last weekend, Denbek
created a new display, a cardboard cutout of Gordon, with a
pacifier in his mouth, painted tears coming from his eyes and a
plastic diaper fastened at his waist. Gordon is holding a taped-on
trophy shaped like a gas can. It's a knock on his loss at Dover the
week before when he gave up the lead late to stop for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The cardboard Gordon carries a sign: ``Nobody likes a crybaby. I
should know.'' For most of the afternoon, it became a photo
opportunity for fans. At times, the waiting line was 20 deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a hate thing,'' Denbek said. ``It's just something we
poke fun at. NASCAR fans are probably the best fans, next to
baseball and football. But in our society, everybody hates a
winner. Like the Bulls, they look at it as, `When are they going to
lose?' We do this just to have some fun. I've only heard one person
disagree. He said, 'There may be a fight here tonight.'''
</P>
<P>
   The parking-lot critics are tame compared to those on the
Internet. Some of the Web pages are downright vulgar, with gutter
humor and drawings. The commentary sounds like it comes from
``Jerry Springer'' rejects. A favorite feature includes photos of
the Gordon car in various wrecks and on fire.
</P>
<P>
   There are essays on ``Why I Hate Jeff.'' There are jokes (``Why
does Jeff Gordon never hit the wall? The wall ain't got no numbers
on it''). and top-10 lists (``Why Gordon Won't Repeat As Champ'').
The tamest of the 10 is NFAJG, the official ``NASCAR Fans Against
Jeff Gordon'' page. It includes jokes, photos, messages from
non-fans, a running soap opera and merchandise (T-shirts for
$19.50; stickers of a devilish-looking kid urinating on the No. 24
for $5).
</P>
<P>
   It is the work of Barrett Bonnar, a high school student in Nova
Scotia, Canada, who claims the site gets 2,200 visitors a day. He
started the site a year ago as a joke. He didn't think it would
become so popular.
</P>
<P>
   Among his visitors were some legal folks from DuPont, Gordon's
sponsor, who objected to the doctored drawing of the car hood that
spells out, ``DuPunk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, I'm not real sure why I dislike him,'' Bonnar
said. ``Fact is, when he first came onto the circuit I kind of
liked him 'cause he had a cool car. Then he started winning and
with that came the attitude. That's the worst: 'Where's the money?'
Then he started driving dirty and got super cocky. I just hate his
car, wife, voice, car number and everything about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon contends that this backlash is all the price of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, our mistakes don't get overlooked,'' he said.
``They get brought up to the top. Some people just don't like
success. You look at Michael Jordan and the Bulls. When they went
to Utah, I guarantee you not everybody sitting in that arena was
cheering for Michael Jordan and the Bulls. NASCAR is unique. There
are no home fields; we play on a floor that has 43 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if people boo me because they think I win too much, I can
live with that.''

 &HT;    Elliott looks to get back on track at Michigan
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Saying ``there's a Ford in your future'' is no
wild exaggeration when it comes to racing at Michigan Speedway
where a Ford driver has won 11 times in the last 15 races.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder then, that another Ford is odds on to be driven into
Victory Lane at the end of today's Miller Lite 400 . Six of them
start in the top 10, including Bill Elliott's, who leads all active
drivers with seven career victories here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan's been very good to me in the past, and I think it
can be again if we can just continue and not have any more
problems,'' said Elliott, referring to back-to-back, bone-jarring
accidents at Talladega and California that totaled good race cars
and beat him up physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Dover (two weeks ago) was a good accomplishment
for us because I had a better car there than what the driver was.
The driver gave out and that's all there was to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was seventh in Winston Cup points before crashing at
Talladega and slipped to 11th the next week as a result of the
California disaster. He's since dropped to 11th, several times
turning the wheel over to standby drivers midway through the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Michigan will be good for us if we can just continue
on and not have any more problems,'' Elliott said Friday after
qualifying sixth with a speed of 180.764 mph, his best start since
a seventh at Martinsville six races ago.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's last victory came in the 1994 Southern 500 at
Darlington, more than 100 races ago. He finished second behind
Ernie Irvan last year and has been one of the fastest cars here
this week in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good, raceable track even though it's gone through a
lot of change over the years with pavement, the radial tires and
all that stuff,'' said Elliott who last won here in 1989. ``It's
got a little bit of speedway and a little bit of short track on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott will have formidable competition within the Ford Taurus
brigade. Dale Jarrett, who starts second, has two victories here;
third-place starter Rusty Wallace is a four-time winner; and Mark
Martin has three.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton starts on the pole in a Pontiac, which has been to
Victory Lane here only once, in 1989 by Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   The last General Motors car to win was Bobby Labonte, who swept
both races in 1995 in a Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't overlook Jeff Gordon,'' Elliott said. ``Looking at
Dover, he led the whole race and it didn't seem like there was
another Chevrolet even close. He ran out of gas at the end, but man
he was strong.''

 &HT;    Jarrett finds his comfort zone
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. -- For Dale Jarrett, it has been a long, long
way from Daytona to Michigan. Three races into the season, he was
27th in the Winston Cup driver standings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 14 races, he's tied for fourth with Mark Martin, 53
points behind leader Jeremy Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on a pretty good run of late,'' said Jarrett in the
understatement of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Since finishing 40th at Las Vegas, Jarrett has two victories _
Darlington and Dover _ and added seconds at Atlanta and Richmond to
go with four other top fives.
</P>
<P>
   He had a chance to add another victory last Saturday if Terry
Labonte hadn't rooted him out of his groove on the last lap at
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``As upset as we were with not winning the race, after we had
time to calm down and look at everything, we made quite a jump for
a short track,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett hasn't spoken to Labonte since the incident, but when he
does there will be no altercation. It's over and done with as far
as he is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen Terry and didn't have the opportunity after the
race,'' Jarrett said.''We were getting ready to go home, while he
was celebrating and going to the pressbox afterward. We'll go on
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've raced against each other for a lot of years, and I have
a tremendous amount of respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett can afford to take that attitude. He expects this year's
points race will be somewhat like the 1992 battle, which came down
to the final laps, when the late Alan Kulwicki beat Bill Elliott by
10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got six of us within 100 points of each other now, and
then you've got Bobby Labonte not that far back where he can still
be a factor,'' Jarrett said. ``A number of us have a lot of top
fives and top 10s out of the 13 races, but we've got some DNFs in
there also, except for Jeremy (Mayfield), who has finished every
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he doesn't have a victory yet and Rusty (Wallace) has been
sort of the same way,'' he said. ``So you have people going about
it in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a great battle, going to be a lot of
fun for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's down the road. Jarrett has turned his attention to
today's Miller Lite 400 on a track where he's won twice. But he
hasn't won the Miller Lite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This track is more of a handling track than one of
horsepower,'' said Jarrett, who won the DeVilbiss 400 in 1991 and
'96. ``I've been here with cars that maybe didn't have the best
engines there, but you could get through the corners. And that's
the key because the corners are so sweeping here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have the best engines in the world, and I've been here
with some, but not gotten through the corners and not been a
front-running car. So to me, handling is a lot more important.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be key.''

 &HT;    Nashville's NASCAR Cafe sets blood to racin'
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- You don't have to go to Talladega or Daytona
to wallow in the sights and sounds of NASCAR racing. The mother of
all venues is sitting here on Lower Broadway, in the heart of the
country music district. And like a beer-drenched Hank Williams Jr.
show, it's loud, it's garish, and pure heaven for fans of the
Southern-born-and-bred motor sport.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's new NASCAR Cafe (the second of several planned
across the country) is the latest entry in the world of theme
restaurants. Like Planet Hollywood or the Hard Rock, it's a
combination restaurant-museum-arcade dedicated to one subject _ in
this case, NASCAR racing. Found in an old warehouse just a stone's
throw from Ryman Auditorium, historic home of the Grand Ole Opry,
this place is as subtle as the roar of a fuel-injected engine. From
the garish neon facade to the orange pimento cheese spilling out of
the Thunder Road Burger ($7.99), the spot is the same exercise in
excess that makes stock car racing so appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Out front, Jeff Gordon's orange and blue Monte Carlo, dressed up
in DuPont decals, sits on the sidewalk beckoning tourists to pull
out their wallets and come inside. If that wasn't enough, a
loudspeaker spits out announcements like a carnival barker:
``Remember _ life's a race. The best times win.''
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, the race begins. Literally. The three-story
restaurant is designed like a track, with huge open lobby
surrounded by tiered balconies of dining tables, arcade racing
games and glass cases enclosing NASCAR memorabilia. In the center
of it all, a huge bar serves as the main pit stop, built on bright
blue, green and yellow oil drums. The whole thing is illuminated by
lights made out of racing helmets, suspended from the ceiling on
black cables that look like the bell cords at gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of this monument to motor sports sits Darrell
Waltrip's Budweiser Chevrolet. At the top of each hour, one of the
wait staff (dressed in a black and white official's uniform with a
microphone headset), climbs on a platform overlooking the scene and
waves a flag, unleashing a rumble not unlike seeing a movie in
Sensurround. TV monitors overhead light up with video of an actual
NASCAR race, with a thunderous noise that nearly shakes the salt
off your fries. Then the big moment: Waltrip's car starts rising on
a hydraulic lift, soaring higher and higher above the bar like a
carnival ride. Whew.
</P>
<P>
   In between races, there's plenty of food straight out of the
grandstand. Specialties include the Pit Pig Sandwich (pulled pork
barbecue for $7.99), Superclash Catfish (with fries and coleslaw
for $8.99), and Collision Chicken ($9.99). You can top off your
meal with dessert, such as Chocolate Fudge Tire cake, or one of a
dozen ``high octane'' drink concoctions, such as the Spark Plug
(Crown Royal and Pepsi) or the Kahluadega 500 (Kahlua and
cappuccino). When the race isn't on, you can dine to nonstop
country music videos, including Lee Greenwood's flag-saluting ``God
Bless the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   For the hard-core NASCAR enthusiast, there's plenty to gawk at.
One wall is dedicated to the first family of NASCAR, Mr. and Mrs.
Bill France Sr. You can check out racing outfits worn by Michael
Waltrip, Davey Allison, Rusty Waller and Bill Elliott. The Winston
Cup trophy is on display. You can have your picture made sitting in
Gordon's car. If that's not enough, $5 will get you a ride in the
Virtual Reality Race Simulator, a big metal box that tosses fans
around like they were strapped to the hood of a souped up Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the NASCAR Cafe is designed to appeal to the racing
crowd. If you're not into motor sports, you might find yourself a
bit lost as to what the ruckus is all about. And if you don't like
boisterous crowds or burgers, you might want to avoid it
altogether. But if you're into NASCAR, this can be one wild ride.

 &HT;    Drivers eager for Pepsi night run
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- ``Incredible.'' That's the response from Winston Cup
drivers who have tested under the lights at Daytona International
Speedway in preparation for the inaugural night running of the
Pepsi 400 on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights are fantastic,'' said Rusty Wallace, who is
searching for his first Winston Cup victory at Daytona
International Speedway. ``Night racing is here to stay. The cars
like it, the fans like it, and the track surface remains
consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics expressed a concern that on a two-mile track, there
will be long spaces of shadows that could be dangerous. But Wallace
doesn't believe it will be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars run so close together at Daytona that you won't be
able to get much light between them, no matter what type of
lighting system you use,'' he said. ``Let's face it, it's going to
be a great one, one we'll all remember.''
</P>
<P>
   In two practice sessions, Mike Skinner posted the fastest speed,
189.873 mph, followed by Wallace's 189.394 and Loy Allen's 189.277.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be fantastic,'' said Daytona Beach resident Mark Martin.
``The feeling that you get at night is more exciting _ it's the
whole atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Roush No. 1
</P>
<P>
   With Jeff Burton's Busch series victory in Richmond last week,
Jack Roush has accumulated 181 career victories as a car owner,
more than any other owner in the modern era. He has 29 Winston Cup
victories, 29 Busch victories, seven in the Craftsman Truck
division, 69 Trans Am and 47 IMSA since 1984. Only Roger Penske
comes close to Roush, with 133.
</P>
<P>
   Jetting around
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Jet Motorsports is on the move without Darrell Waltrip.
Phil Hammer has been named crew; they've added the June 28 Sears
Point event to the schedule with Ron Hornaday at the wheel; the
team roster has grown from 22 to 37 since late March, and the team
is on course to meet its target of having 13 complete cars by Aug.
1, in time for the Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   Around the tracks
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt was the keynote speaker at the National Press
Club's newsmaker luncheon earlier this week. It was the first time
a NASCAR driver has been invited. . . . Jimmy Spencer has four top
10 finishes this year, three more than a year ago at this time. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Busch
</P>
<P>
   Upside, downside
</P>
<P>
   Now that Pikes Peak is on the Busch circuit, Shane Hall said,
it's good and bad. ``There's an upside and a downside in running on
a new track the first time without the Winston Cup teams around,''
Hall said. ``The upside to having them around is their experience
and their willingness to share knowledge. On the downside, they
usually have some pretty good race cars of their own, and that
makes good runs by the Busch guys even more difficult. So, it's
pretty much a guessing game when they're not around at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome
</P>
<P>
   The welcome mat was out for the Busch teams at Pikes Peak.
Several local residents served as Good Ambassadors, making sure the
teams had everything they needed. Towns people were ready with
suggestions for the best places to eat, the best entertainment and
general directions.
</P>
<P>
   Craftsman trucks
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Two Craftsman Truck drivers, Scot Walters and Mike Bliss, were
injured in the Pronto Auto Parts 400k at Texas Motor Speedway on
June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Walters suffered a severe cut on his chin, requiring three
layers of stitches to close the wound. He also underwent a series
of tests and X-rays on his head and neck, all of which showed only
deep bruising.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss broke a shoulder on the third lap, when he hit the inside
retaining wall. He'll be out four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Off week
</P>
<P>
   The truckers take a break this week before gearing up for a
grinding week at Bristol on June 20. Jack Sprague holds the points
lead with 1,300, 77 ahead of Ron Hornaday. Joe Rutman is third, 107
behind the leader. ... Tammy Jo Kirk finished 15th, a lap down, and
collected $10,575 last week.

 &HT;    Honeymooners love Richmont Inn
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOWNSEND, Tenn. -- Browsing the comment book in each Richmont
Inn guest room, you might start to think they were putting Viagra
tablets instead of chocolates on the pillows at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrating our third anniversary here was a perfect way to
rejuvenate and reaffirm our love for one another,'' wrote one Texas
guest.
</P>
<P>
   Penned a honeymooning Pennsylvania couple, ``The best thing is
to share a place like this together ... not far from heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Page for page, Harlequin romances don't have more heavy
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Which is especially remarkable given that the Richmont Inn looks
like a barn, at least on the outside. A cantilevered barn, to be
precise _ an unusual type found in East Tennessee in which the
second story overhangs the first. In times past, farmers would
store as many as 4,000 bales of hay upstairs and use the downstairs
for cattle and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The barn motif stays outside at the Richmont, a casually elegant
bed-and-breakfast with 10 guest rooms on three floors, many
featuring intimate balconies looking out at Rich Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Owners Jim and Susan Hind chose the barn design as a tribute to
their Tennessee roots. ``The Appalachian heritage is a beautiful
thing _ there's so much substance there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The historic theme continues in the rooms, each decorated to
honor an eminent mountain figure. The Francis Asbury Room, for
instance, is a tribute to the life of a church circuit rider who
tirelessly spread the gospel in the late 1700s and early 1800s,
crossing the Smoky Mountains on horseback some 65 times. Among the
special touches in the room are religious artworks, a 125-year-old
stained-glass church window and crosses delicately cut into the
paper lampshades. The motifs in other rooms include folk art,
botanical, log cabin and country parlor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gourmet breakfast, served in a dining area
with floor-to-ceiling windows with a mountain view, a stay at the
inn includes candlelight dessert for two every evening.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the guest rooms have wood-burning fireplaces or spa tubs
for two. Lounging robes are provided, and swoony music, including
Frank Sinatra torch songs, is piped into the rooms until late each
night.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, who needs Viagra?

 &HT;    So what's so bad about the spice girls?
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- We strive for enlightenment, plan to read great
books. We listen to NPR and speculate about the future of Social
</P>
<P>
   Security and peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   And in spite of it all, we can name the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chilling thought: Baby. Posh. Sporty. Scary and the
recently departed Ginger. You can't pick up a magazine, flip on the
radio or even surf the Web without stumbling across their perky
faces, blabbering on about Girl Power (``Gul Powah'' as it sounds
tripping off their south London tongues) or prancing to lyrics such
as ``ziga-zig-aaaah.''
</P>
<P>
   As distasteful as it is to admit, the very triviality of these
gals has somehow mesmerized (some might say numbed) our collective
consciousness. It's similar to stopping the remote control on late
night infomercials about the Miracle Mop or the Banjo Minnow
fishing lure _ we can't believe we're watching, but we stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Like a big bowl of potato chips, the Spice Girls are what they
are: junk food. They're a cheap thrill, a shallow romp in sequins
and skintight dresses whose only mission is to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   As long as you keep it in perspective, not a thing.
</P>
<P>
   When they roll into Lakewood Amphitheatre on Thursday, the
Spices are well into their 15 minutes. They've had two huge albums,
a string of state-of-the-art videos, a movie and more media
attention than when man landed on the moon. Little girls adore
them. Parents chuckle and remember cutting out pictures of Bobby
Sherman and David Cassidy. In its very meaninglessness, the group
serves a purpose _ a fleeting diversion from the realities of
day-to-day life.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples: In the best-selling Pocket Spice books, Ginger
Spice shares her thoughts: ``My favorite word is existentialism.
But I don't know what it means, and I can't even pronounce it.''
Calling from Oslo, Norway, to promote the Atlanta show, the first
of 30 phone interviews she was doing that morning, Baby Spice
chants her well-rehearsed lines like a mantra: ``We're such great
friends. We wanted to show that we're strong and independent.'' At
the Virgin Records Web site (www.virginrecords.com), it's possible
to pull up individual interviews with the Spices. Ginger, who's
still featured on the site despite quitting the band two weeks ago,
trumped up like a tart with bright orange hair, dangling her 4-inch
heels over the armrest of a chair, says, ``Imagine, me, going to
all these pahr-ties meeting people like Lahra Dern.''
</P>
<P>
   What's really amazing about the Spice Girls is that this group
of giggly, working-class waifs has managed to take mindless dance
music and turn it into a platform for perhaps the biggest exercise
in celebrity for celebrity's sake that we have seen in decades.
They are pet rocks and Sea-Monkeys for our time. Fame isn't the
byproduct for these girls, it's the goal. As they said themselves
in their vanity film ``Spice World'': ``It's not any good, but it's
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ignoring the hype, the Spice Girls embraced their
manufactured nicknames to the point they have become cartoon
characters of these personas. It's a concept straight out of the
Mattel marketing department, each Spice becoming a living/
</P>
<P>
   breathing Pocket Pal that little girls can dress up and hang
their budding self-images on like dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, the music became secondary. The first
album, 1997's ``Spice,'' was actually a fun exercise in
unapologetic pop, spawning the hit singles ``Wannabe,'' ``Say
You'll Be There'' and ``Two Become One.'' The girls have
tenaciously claimed all along that they really, really did write
all the tunes themselves, which were as good as anything Madonna
has ever churned out. And let's face it: At least they admit they
are poseurs, unlike U2's Bono or the ubiquitous pop queen Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   The real magic of this goofy group isn't in their glitzy,
Vegas-style stage show or their inane prattle. (We all know Sporty,
Scary, Ginger, Posh and Baby are going to fade into pop obscurity
as our daughters grow up and get on with the serious business of
life.) It's on the faces of the little girls who have decided to
hop on the Spice Girls like a quick carnival ride. Of course, it'll
be over in a couple of minutes. It has no particularly redeeming
social value. But, like childhood or a spend-the-night-party, it's
over fairly quickly _ and it sure can be a lot of fun.

 &HT;    Timeless Townsend
 &HT;    By Howard Pousner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOWNSEND, Tenn. -- Morning is breaking over the Smokies, and for
collectors of sunrises, this one's a real promise keeper.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton ball clouds shrouding the endless gray peaks gently start
to lift as the fireball sun inches its way up in the east. Soon, a
tangerine glow stretches across the horizon, highlighting
curvaceous ridge upon ridge upon ridge.
</P>
<P>
   We're 2,200 feet up at Look Rock, one of the highest observation
points in these mountains, peering out over a dense forest tree
cover. And though the leaves mostly shield signs of stirring below,
momentarily we hear a daybreak chorus warming its vocal cords. The
roosters, of course, are first to greet the dawn. Then the
woodpeckers put their chisels to work, and other fine feathered
friends sing out. Even hounds speak up, perhaps if only to test how
far their baying will echo across the ridgetops.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sound of the Smokies rising and shining. And if you
prefer your mountains sunny side up _ as opposed to two
tourist-loving towns nearby where nature is scrambled with outlet
malls and neon-drenched nightclubs _ you've come to the right
place.
</P>
<P>
   Townsend bills itself as ``The Peaceful Side of the Smokies.''
It's a polite way of saying that if your idea of mountain fun is,
oh, an indoor go-cart track or the Comedy Barn (a corn pone humor
showplace where the star attraction is ``Arnold the Mind Reading
Pig''), you'd be more at home up the highway in Gatlinburg or
Pigeon Forge.
</P>
<P>
   In Townsend, the western entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park, nature's the star attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5 million visitors who enter the park annually from this
sneeze-and-you-may-miss-it town of 400 come to hike, bike and ride
horses. Explore a cavern or identify wildflowers. Fly-fish in, tube
down or even cannonball into the startlingly clear Little River
(which rushes merrily along right beside the town's main drag, U.S.
321/Lamar Alexander Parkway). Or seek solitude and spot wildlife in
Cades Cove, the 1,800-acre outdoor museum of pioneer mountain life
tucked into the national park near the Townsend entrance.
</P>
<P>
   It was along Cades Cove's 11-mile loop road at another sunrise
that we encountered Liliane Jevey, a Belgian-born legal secretary
from suburban Orlando who makes a Smokies pilgrimage twice a year
on her Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   She reported that just before dawn, ``Two white-tail does with a
yearling went right by my tent!''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the white clapboard Methodist church, binoculars in hand,
she strode through tall fescue in search of more wildlife. Perhaps,
if she were lucky, she'd bag a glance at the cove's most popular
beast: a black bear, preferably with a cub or two.
</P>
<P>
   She stood still for a few minutes until she saw something stir _
a deer, it turned out. ``There's one,'' she said, pointing deep
into the dewy pasture. Then, in a blink, it bounded into nearby
woods. ``Oops, gone.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to her hog, she revealed that she plans to
return here one day _ for eternity. ``Believe it or not, I have in
my will that my ashes be scattered on that hill (above the
pasture). The last time I was here, I said, `This is it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The longer we spent amid the deep forest, meadows and old
homesteads of Cades Cove, remote Indian land taken over by white
settlers in the 1820s and purchased by the government for the park
a little more than a century later, the better we understood
Jevey's wish.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's the austere graveyards behind the cove's churches.
Or maybe it's the stillness enveloping the surviving cabins, mills
and barns. Whatever, the cove feels like sacred ground. Everyone
who visits seems to realize it. Even strangers comparing notes on
wildlife sightings speak quietly, as if in a library. That alone
may be the best testimony: Here, strangers speak.
</P>
<P>
   At one nature stop, we got the Cades Cove scoop from brothers
Chris and Jeremy Dubois, ages 13 and 11, who were enjoying a kingly
view from plastic patio chairs on the back of their grandparents'
Toyota pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of a half-dozen Smokies campouts, the siblings from
Perry, Ga., said they'd seen a copperhead chase a bear here once,
and learned that when a skunk visits the best thing to do is sit
absolutely still.
</P>
<P>
   Chris sported a Notre Dame cap; his kid brother professed being
a New England Patriots fan. But on the topic of favorite Smokies
campfire food, they were in accord: ``S'mores!'' To which grandma
Pam Thomas shouted back from the cab with mock indignation: ``What
about pancakes and scrambled eggs?''
</P>
<P>
   Later that morning we came across plenty of folks on the Little
River who were working up mountain-man-sized appetites, including a
couple of fishermen who were trying to do something about theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Texan Kelly Barbee and his future father-in-law, Buster Garrett,
who runs a drywall business in nearby Wears Valley, were slipping
from rounded boulder to boulder amid the rushing rapids while
fly-fishing for rainbow trout. Nothing was biting, but at least it
was about 10 degrees cooler in the water than on the nearby
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, I'd rather be doing this than anything,'' Barbee
said. ``I love it up here.''
</P>
<P>
   And how would they fix the fish if they caught some?
</P>
<P>
   Garrett looked at his city-slicker questioner as if the question
itself was fishy. ``Just put a little meal on 'em,'' he grumbled,
``and throw 'em in the skillet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, simple small-town pleasures ... can't beat 'em.
</P>
<P>
   That's what we were thinking when we came across 10 teens
downriver, doing fancy flips and an occasional belly-flop off the
River Road bridge. The short-haired 16-year-olds, dragging on cigs
between acrobatic dives into the water some 30 feet below, seemed
straight out of a '50s yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, Heritage High School had just let out the day before
_ cause for celebration, for sure. Even the park ranger who pulled
over to tell them to stop sprinting across the busy road (building
up momentum for their dives), cut them some slack: He didn't halt
their bridge Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if their Blount County school was located in Townsend, one
retorted as only a high-school wiseacre could, ``Nah, it's in a cow
pasture.'' To which another added dismissively, ``There's nothing
in Townsend.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the truth hurts. There really isn't much to do if you're
staying in this modest town beyond exploring the mountains and
valleys _ or, if you're feeling particularly unambitious, examining
the insides of your eyelids. But so what if Townsend isn't exactly
the SoHo of the Smokies? Or if too many of its restaurants dish up
greasy ``home cookin''' that you wouldn't want in your home?
</P>
<P>
   Barry Wright, keeping an eagle eye on 8-year-old daughter Kacey
and 4-year-old son Landon as they erected a rock fort in the
currents at the Little River area known simply as ``the Y,'' sure
had no complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The Knoxville computer salesman said Townsend brings back happy
childhood vacation memories of when his parents took him to
Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, now famed as the town Dolly Parton
overbuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the big landholders sold out to the developers and now
they're so crowded and traffic-y,'' he lamented. ``Fortunately,
Townsend is still pretty commercial free. Everything's a little
quieter here.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Wright had nonetheless proposed to his two sisters
and their rental cabin full of children that they do something
different that night and motor up to Pigeon Forge for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody quickly said `ix-nay' to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some locals fear that an upcoming expansion of U.S. 321 _ from a
pokey two-lane to a parkway of four or five lanes, with three
roundabouts at intersections that are especially congested during
the tourist months _ smacks of creeping Pigeon Forge-ism.
</P>
<P>
   But Linda Eaves, tourism chief for the Smoky Mountain Visitors
Bureau in Townsend, says she believes the town won't have to give
up its ``Peaceful Side'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody agrees on one thing here, it's that we want to
maintain the beauty and pristineness,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Eaves also points out that the town's lack of a sewer system
(septic tanks are used instead) limits the likelihood of a
commercial boom. Rather than seeing gold in Golden Arches and other
franchises, town leaders are pushing locally owned businesses to
add folksy log-cabin facades, in keeping with the area's
Appalachian heritage.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, it's safe to assume that if you visit you'll likely
find Larry Morgan beside the main road, selling hand-stripped
walking sticks perfect for a hilly hike. For 2 1/2 years, he's been
setting up shop on the shoulder, leaning a long row of the dogwood,
sassafras, maple and red oak sticks against his Chevy pickup, and
waiting for easy touches like us to stop by. And you can also rest
assured that if you want to fly-fish beneath the recently rebuilt
Little River suspension bridge, Earvel Boyd won't crowd you, no
matter how bad he wants to hook some supper.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting another fisherman one recent afternoon, Boyd, who
drives a Dodge van with a ``Christ is the Answer'' license plate,
waited patiently by the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get down there in that boy's pocket,'' the
retiree explained, looking to the sky to read how much time he had
before sunset.
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet town like Townsend, visitors and home folks alike
sure appreciate a little elbow room.
</P>
<P>
   If you go
</P>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   It's a 250-mile drive. Take I-75 north to the Lenoir City exit
(if you reach I-40, you've gone too far) and go east on U.S. 321
through Maryville and Walland into Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   Lodging
</P>
<P>
   Cabins: With more than 325, Townsend's got plenty. They're a
good bet for extended families and, given the shortage of great
eateries here, visitors who like to cook. The bigger rental
agencies include: Bearly Rustic Cabin Rentals, 1-888-448-6036;
Dogwood Cabin Rentals, 1-888-448-9054; Laurel Valley Cabin Rentals,
423-448-6697; Old Smoky Mountain Cabins, 1-800-739-4820.
</P>
<P>
   Inns: Misty Morning Bed &AMP; Breakfast (423-681-6373) in nearby
Walland and Terrapin Point Retreat Bed and Breakfast (423-448-6010)
both feature mountain vistas. Twin Valley Bed and Breakfast and
Horse Ranch (1-800-872-2235) in Walland offers opportunities for
horse lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Chain hotels: Several are represented along U.S. 321, including
Hampton Inn (423-448-9000) and Best Western (423-448-2237).
</P>
<P>
   Camping: Numerous campgrounds, including one in Cades Cove, open
May 15-Oct. 31 (1-800-365-2267).
</P>
<P>
   Hiking
</P>
<P>
   Spruce Flat Falls waterfall is an easy 2-mile hike from Great
Smoky Mountains Institute at the Treemont area.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams Falls in Cades Cove is a moderate 5-mile hike.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut Top trail is an ambitious 9-mile wildflower walk,
starting near the Townsend ``Y.''

 &HT;    Rugged rough at Olympic rewards straight shooters
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Relentless, rugged rough and a tender back. Not a
pleasant combination at any time. At a U.S. Open, it could be
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Fed by more than 100 days of rain from El Nino, the Olympic
Club's overseeded ryegrass rough is destined for a major role at
this year's U.S. Open, which begins Thursday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Golf Association is said to be considering
limits on high-tech equipment. Hope the deep-faced, titanium
weed-whacker won't be eliminated. Getting a blade through Olympic's
rough, let alone a sand wedge, has been a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And how are a few of golf's major stars preparing for the
agronomical nightmare? Not ideally, by any means. When U.S. Open
defending champion Ernie Els withdrew from the Buick Classic on
Thursday, he joined a disturbing list of players treating back
problems so close to the season's second major championship.
</P>
<P>
   If Justin Leonard is smart, he's already on a preventive
exercise program. Of 1997's four majors winners, he's the only one
still unscathed. Tiger Woods, Davis Love III and now Els are either
hurting from or treating back ailments. Throw in two-time 1998
winner Fred Couples, who herniated a disk in 1994, and Paul
Azinger, who missed 55 days this year with a back ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for those in spasm, this is a week for hoping, not
healing. Olympic is, after all, the same place where a player lost
his ball after a free drop during the 1957 U.S. Open. Olympic's
rough will be seven inches deep in spots and almost as dense as the
grasses that made up Congressional's off-the-fairway stuff last
year. San Francisco is always a cool, damp area prone to fog, which
adds to the heaviness of the grass. A good forecast for next week _
sunny in the mid-70s, for a change _ could help dry things out.
</P>
<P>
   Nasty rough is nothing new for Olympic, which isn't overly long
for an Open course (6,797 yards) and must be protected. During a
practice round in 1987, Andy Bean gave superintendent John Fleming
an ovation when he saw his mowers chugging through the rough. ``I'd
never seen anybody cut the rough during a U.S. Open,'' Bean said.
</P>
<P>
   Players nursing back problems would be wise to maintain caution
in the rough. In the past, Woods has not demonstrated a tendency to
chip out and accept a bogey. This week, he might not have a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the difficulty of the course set-up are the bunkers.
Filled with new, fluffier sand _ not the thin, packed-down stuff
that Olympic's members usually see _ the bunkers will be prone to
buried lies and widespread grumbling. With deep-faced bunkers and
tiny greens, sand saves will be coveted.
</P>
<P>
   Tight and tough, like any Open course, Olympic will place those
straight drivers of the golf ball _ such as Leonard, Colin
Montgomerie, Jim Furyk and Mark O'Meara _ in improved positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USGA requires you to play smart golf, control golf,'' said
O'Meara, the Masters champion. ``In 1987 the rough was very penal.
I think the players understand that and look forward to that
challenge.''

 &HT;    Exploitation in a `fishbowl' existence
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- On a recent visit to Atlanta, Australian director
Peter Weir shared a few thoughts on his hit film, the comedy-drama
``The Truman Show,'' starring Jim Carrey as a man who realizes his
entire life has been a TV show and everyone he knows is an actor.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Among the many interesting ideas in this movie is the notion
of one man's life as public commodity. That certainly reverberates
with our culture of celebrity and gossip, and the way people are
forced to live in fishbowls.
</P>
<P>
   A:It's extraordinary, the way it's accelerated in the last five
years. Last year, during the cutting period, the horror of
(Princess) Diana's death caused you to realize that even if you
hadn't bought all those magazines, you couldn't get away from it.
Just going to the local store, you'd see her on the magazine cover
with whatever her latest episode was _ as if it were a soap opera
with a spectacular end episode: the death of a princess.
</P>
<P>
   So it was interesting to me to have the audience cut into ``The
Truman Show,'' to see their reactions, and then their shock toward
the end. It was only then that they began to think, this man might
die. There was a reality here that had not been acknowledged, which
was the whole lie of his existence and his dreadful exploitation.
You were reminded, that was Diana. We're the very people who had
bought all the magazines and newspapers, who were very angry with
the paparazzi. But they were working for us. There were so many
ironies there.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You're right, Diana was like a long-running character in our
lives since we first heard of her.
</P>
<P>
   A:Even the Gulf War I think had that quality because of the
curious nature of the images we were seeing from gun cameras and so
forth. It was like a strange game. The idea that people were being
killed was pretty remote. It was a world event. We were all
watching, and (Gulf War commander Norman) Schwarzkopf became the
star of that. It was like a successful war series. Then came the
O.J. trial.
</P>
<P>
   Q:So considering how media-ized we are, ``The Truman Show''
isn't such a big jump.
</P>
<P>
   A:That's also why the town was photographed the way it was, and
the clothing very carefully thought about. It's all stylized, the
best of '30s and '40s clothing. So (Christof, the producer, played
by Ed Harris in the film) is also trying to teach the world a
better way to be, which is part of his vanity.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What about this story resonated with you?
</P>
<P>
   A:It seemed to be a totally fresh story, with old elements
combined in a very new way. You can't really come up with new
emotions. ... Someone said to me the other day, ``It's a really
strange film.'' And I said, ``No, it isn't.'' The emotional strands
are very traditional: love, the search for truth, the search for
freedom. But the context is bizarre. It's the times we're living
with. That's its newness as a film. It's one of the first films to
deal extensively with the rapid change in information technology
essentially, and the disturbance to our concept of the difference
between what is real and unreal.
</P>
<P>
   Q:It must have been a headache to the Paramount marketing
department.
</P>
<P>
   A:Yes, it's almost impossible. ... To just roll it out among all
the summer films (without extensive word-of-mouth screenings) would
have made it an unfortunate question mark: ``What is that? Is it a
comedy? I hear it isn't.'' It would have gotten lost in a confusion
that would seem to be coming off the film itself.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Did you have any concern about restraining or modulating
Carrey's performance?
</P>
<P>
   A:Yes, but I didn't want to inhibit him. He was looking for
change. He felt that ``Liar Liar'' would be one step, and ``The
Truman Show'' would be the next one in terms of his constituency,
demonstrating a broader range than the farcical comedies.
</P>
<P>
   I'd had some experience with Robin Williams (in ``Dead Poets
Society''). But I don't want to get the reputation of being the man
who removes the comedy from comic actors. (``Truman'' screenwriter)
Andrew Niccol said, ``You'll become a sort of directorial
chiropractor for comics _ he sort of straightens them out and sends
them on. One price for tragedy, another price for a drama.'' But,
as with Robin, I didn't want to deny Jim's talent for humor.
Sometimes Jim would say, ``I think I could try this in a bigger
way.'' And I'd say, ``Great, it's only film.'' Every other time, it
was useful, but just as often it was too much. But the worst thing
in the world for an actor is to pretend that there are some rules
that the director knows and you have to confine yourself to it,
instead of saying, ``Who knows? We have the blueprint of the
script, we can always go back and shoot the scene as it's written.
But what if we try something else?'''
</P>
<P>
   Q:(The film was shot in Seaside, the planned development resort
city in the Florida panhandle) What time of year did you shoot?
</P>
<P>
   A:Just the turn of the year, winter, which is why we could get
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Q:It's a strange town. It does look like a nutty film set.
</P>
<P>
   A:Robert Davis, its developer, compares it to Bath, (England).
He says a resort town really benefits from a degree of
theatricality. You leave your more mundane world behind, including
your problems.

   ATLANTA -- Way back _ when your eyes were infantile and blurry _
dear old Dad saw enough good in you to think one of your
gas-induced smiles was thanks enough.
</P>
<P>
   But by now he's burped you, babied you, berated you, befriended
you and bailed you out so many times that your usual, ``Oh yeah,
thanks'' gifts on Father's Day just won't cut it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   So before you go (last-minute) shopping, think about how he
bottle-fed you, taught you how to make Kool-Aid, counseled you
against drinking and driving and proposed a toast at your wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Then resolve to give something significant in return.
</P>
<P>
   This Father's Day, buy him some time. Or a bottle. Or both.

   ATLANTA -- The more the merrier. That's the sentiment of women
all over town who are slipping into something cheap and slinky: the
newly popular guitar string bracelets that you buy _ and wear _ by
the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   At stores such as the Limited, these gold-and silver-toned
bracelets sell at $10 for a pack of 20. That's the going rate for
them as well at the Beth Ann Image and Accessory Boutique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you put on, the stronger the statement they make,''
said the boutique's owner, Beth Ann Taratoot. ``The rage among
those customers of mine who can afford it is to buy 50 or more.''
</P>
<P>
   The guitar string bracelets _ alternately referred to as
``slinkies'' _ come in a thicker version that costs $1 each.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Limited and Beth Ann's, they're also sold at
Saks Fifth Avenue and Erika Reade Ltd.

 &HT;    The healing art of stories
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Robert M. Coles strides across the Emory University
campus, on his way to give a lecture at the venerable Glenn
Memorial United Methodist Church, when his steps bring him to a
steep gully, cut by a swift, murky creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's swim it,'' he says, with an impish grin. ``I'd love to
arrive dirty and disheveled.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the first time that the Harvard University
professor, a recipient of this year's Presidential Medal of
Freedom, has departed from the beaten path.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he was headed toward a low-key life as a child
psychiatrist when Coles encountered a white mob trying to scare the
life out of a little black girl named Ruby Bridges. The civil
rights movement loomed in front of him. He jumped in.
</P>
<P>
   As he followed Ruby and other students who were integrating
Southern schools in the 1960s, he abandoned his career and found
his life's work. His stated plan was to study how children handled
the stress of integration. His real focus, however, became the
psyche of the country, as America went through what his mentor Erik
Erikson would call an identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children of Crisis,'' the monumental series of books that
sprang from Coles' experiences in the South, won the Pulitzer Prize
in 1973 and anointed Coles America's counselor at large.
</P>
<P>
   Through his writings on the moral, spiritual and political lives
of children, and his books about migrant workers, Eskimos, Indians,
teen parents, the elderly and many other subjects (more than 60
books at last count), Coles became the conscience of a generation
and one of the most significant social historians since James Agee,
author of ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.'' Catholic priest and
writer Andrew Greeley has called him a ``secular saint'' _
terminology that makes Coles distinctly ill at ease.
</P>
<P>
   This is a confirmed Yankee, with a honking Boston accent to
prove it. (In Coles' mouth, ``Harvard'' rhymes with ``avid.'') But
he never left the South completely behind. For 20 years, he has
taught part time at Duke University, and in 1988 he co-founded
Duke's Center for Documentary Studies, with Atlanta photographer
Alex Harris and William Chafe, now Duke's dean of arts and
sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Among the publications created by the center is the visually
stunning magazine DoubleTake, a large-format quarterly collection
of photography, reportage, fiction and poetry that is Coles and
Harris' special brainchild. Established in 1995, it has won raves,
including a National Magazine Award for general excellence this
year for featuring work such as the photographs of Helen Levitt,
the poetry of Seamus Heaney, and writing by John McPhee and Joyce
Carol Oates.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's 60,000 readers _ roughly the same kind of folks
who tune in to National Public Radio _ expect an earthy mixture of
the well-known and the obscure. Early issues balanced a newly
discovered short story by Flannery O'Connor with a remarkable essay
and drawings by a 7-year-old named Kristin Graves, who explained in
heartbreaking language the story of her mother's death in an
automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTake, says Coles, is an extension of his Duke classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an old teacher; I've got a new classroom,'' he says. ``How
many can come to a lecture, 400 or 500? And DoubleTake reaches
60,000. It's a wonderful educational opportunity. I used to write
for The New Yorker under William Shawn, and he said, `I regard
myself as a teacher, principally.'''
</P>
<P>
   He teaches documentary work not by handing his students a tape
recorder, but by shoving them into a new world. It could be a
public housing project, or a migrant labor camp or a mountain
shack, but it's probably someplace where undergrads paying $25,000
a year in tuition rarely go. He shows them how to get lost in
someone else's story.
</P>
<P>
   Coming South
</P>
<P>
   It happened to Coles. The tale is one he repeats for all of his
classes, at Duke and Harvard, and he tells it again to a group of
faculty and graduate students during this same Emory visit in May.
</P>
<P>
   Disheveled, if not dirty, Coles, 68, radiates a Peter Falkian
charm as he paces before the audience assembled in the Emory
student center: His shirt sleeves are rolled up to reveal hairy,
muscular forearms, his face bristling with permanent 5 o'clock
shadow. He seems to have combed his unpredictable salt-and-pepper
mane with a Mixmaster.
</P>
<P>
   The voice is as cranky as a New England winter, softened by a
set of flannel vocal chords. The jacket and tie are missing. (His
children forced this self-described slob to buy a new suit in
January so he would look presentable at the White House while
receiving the Medal of Freedom from President Clinton.)
</P>
<P>
   He tells the group about being drafted as a young psychiatrist
and stationed at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss., when he
first realized that there was a revolution going on under his nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been in the Force for a year, and I had paid no attention
to any of this stuff, even though I was a reasonably well-educated
person from all these snotty schools up North,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then one Sunday afternoon in 1960, Coles rode his bicycle home
along U.S. 90 in Biloxi, where he saw whites attacking blacks who'd
trespassed on ``their'' beach. The incident riveted him, as did the
experience during a visit to New Orleans, when he saw the
6-year-old Ruby Bridges kneel in the midst of a mob and pray for
her attackers.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't get these moments out of his mind, and he was
desperate to do something about them. ``Something was happening to
me, some kind of moral crisis, not to mention personal crisis, as I
was trying to figure out what to do with my life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The moments became a touchstone for him. The moral courage of
the little girl in the starched white dress was a central image of
``Children of Crisis,'' and an image that Coles returns to
frequently in his writings. He spun the tale again in 1995 with a
popular children's book, ``The Story of Ruby Bridges,'' the
proceeds of which benefit the Ruby Bridges Education Foundation.
(Disney made it into a TV special this year.) As Ruby changed his
life, so did his attention change hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have kids all over the country that see me as this great
role model,'' says Ruby Bridges Hall, now a mother of four in New
Orleans. ``It humbles me.''
</P>
<P>
   An active observer
</P>
<P>
   Coles also studied the children who integrated Atlanta schools
in the early '60s, while he lived in the Vinings area and attended
All Saints Episcopal Church in Midtown. He says that he learned
much from Atlanta news papermen Gene Patterson andRalph McGill.
``Never mind all this social science crap,'' he says, with typical
bluntness. ``They taught me how to go talk to people and interview
them in their homes, where they lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from acting the detached observer during those years, Coles
put his own life on the line. In the summer of 1964, he and his
wife, Jane Hallowell Coles, were staying at a safe house in McComb,
Miss., when a bomb destroyed the structure. ``Then the police came
and arrested us all, like we were the ones who dynamited our own
house,'' says a laughing Coles. He and his wife were shaken but
unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   And if he hadn't been sent to Biloxi? ``If that hadn't happened
to me, I'd have an office somewhere on Brattle Street,'' he says.
Then adds, with a curl of the lip, ``I'd be treating gifted,
troubled, Harvard students.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Coles didn't seem destined for the conventional
career arc. He remembers when his mother, Sandra, a hard-headed
descendant of Yankee abolitionists, took him out of elementary
school one day to see her hero Franklin D. Roosevelt as his
motorcade came through Boston. Little Bobby's teacher objected, but
his mother was firm. ``He'll remember this long after he forgets
everything he learned in school,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Boston Latin, Coles studied literature at Harvard,
writing his thesis on the doctor/poet William Carlos Williams.
Coles sent him a copy, and Williams was impressed (``Not bad, for a
Harvard student,'' he wrote) and suggested Coles try medicine:
``Lots to keep you busy, and lots to make you think.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coles was a mediocre medical student; he was ready to quit
when his mother chided him for his selfish ennui. ``Why don't you
go work in a soup kitchen?'' she asked. ``That will be one way for
you to see what a lucky life you've had.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, working two summers during the early 1950s at a shelter
operated by Catholic activist Dorothy Day. She inspired Coles to
write her biography (``Dorothy Day: A Radical Devotion'') and
showed him the kind of life that he would strive toward, a life
consumed with service.
</P>
<P>
   Coles completed the training to become a pediatrician but
changed to psychiatry. Like his mentor, Williams, Coles became
better known for his writing than his work in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Real stories
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston, Coles is sometimes referred to as Robert ``Never
an Unpublished Thought'' Coles. Certainly his literary output, all
written in ballpoint pen on yellow legal pads, is prodigious.
</P>
<P>
   His writing, Coles freely admits, is a device to keep him out of
faculty meetings, which he abhors. Though he is perched at the top
of the university heap, Coles has a thinly veiled contempt for the
stuffy world of the academy. (Just ask him about intellectuals: ``I
hate the word! I hate the people!'' Or about Ivy League professors:
``Stuck-up big shots.'')
</P>
<P>
   He especially holds suspect the rhetoric of social science.
``Such abstractions as `ghetto neighborhood' or `culturally
deprived child' or `socially marginal this' and `something else
that,' I'm trying to rescue myself and the people I write about
from these overwrought and sometimes fatuous generalizations,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   His role models are Dickens, Tolstoy and Steinbeck,
documentarians who portrayed their societies in complex,
contradictory detail. ``I favor their leadership rather than the
leadership that populates our universities in the name of social
science,'' he says. ``Novelists and short story writers do it out
of their imagination. The only difference is, I do it in connection
with the concreteness of real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles, the James Agee professor of social ethics at Harvard,
draws on these novelists in his popular Harvard course, ``A
Literature of Social Reflection,'' which students jokingly call
``Guilt 105,'' because of its emphasis on ethics and morality.
Undergrads hellbent on careers in law and business are treated to
the writings of George Orwell, Ralph Ellison, Flannery O'Connor and
others, and some find their goals changing.
</P>
<P>
   Former student Tom Kelley, now a director of community programs
at the Center for Documentary Studies, took Coles' courses as a
Harvard undergrad. ``I was mystified by his approach. He gets up
and he just tells stories. What's the theme? How can I critique
this? That's not how aggressive young pre-med students are taught
to think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I blame Bob Coles for my mediocre grade point
average,'' says Jay Woodruff, a former DoubleTake staffer and
currently a senior editor at Esquire magazine, who studied with
Coles in the early 1980s. ``I was very affected by his perspective
on the world. It gave me a convenient excuse to care a lot less
about things like midterms.''
</P>
<P>
   William Chafe, a historian and chronicler of the civil rights
movement, has observed Coles' ability to create believers, to move
young people toward idealism. ``I've known Bob for 15 years,'' says
Chafe. ``He is a charismatic figure. He inspires people, makes them
want to do exciting work, with a passion that's all-consuming.''
</P>
<P>
   A life of service
</P>
<P>
   The center at Duke has given Coles access to a new group of
followers, in particular, the readers of DoubleTake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those genius people who needs to have a challenge
at every turn,'' says Isabel Geffner, DoubleTake's associate
publisher. ``That's a wonderful lesson in how to grow up and grow
older: When you're in your 60s, by God, start a magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning awards and getting large infusions of cash from
donors _ including a $10 million grant from the Lyndhurst
Foundation of Chattanooga _ DoubleTake is losing about $2 million a
year. ``I think we've got a year or two,'' says Coles, whose office
is, aptly, decorated with wall-size blowups of children's drawings.
``If we pull it off, we'll continue. If we don't, it will be a
noble experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's not in Durham, N.C., Coles directs the magazine from
his Harvard office (in FDR's old room at Adams House), running up a
heavy Federal Express bill as photos and proofs are shipped back
and forth. During the early hours he works on his next two books,
editing a collection of the writings of German theologian Dietrich
Bonhoeffer and writing a book to be called ``Moral Leadership,''
about the character of such exemplars as Bonhoeffer and Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   That he lets his associates run the Center for Documentary
Studies when he's not around is in keeping with his laissez-faire
organizational style. Harris remembers an early collaboration, when
Coles invited him to New Mexico and Alaska to shoot photographs for
what would become two books, ``The Old Ones of New Mexico'' (1973)
and ``The Last and First Eskimos'' (1978). ``I had just heard him
mesmerize a room, and I thought, `This guy is going to show me the
way.' It turns out he was interested in what I was going to find
there,'' Harris says. ``Not what he was going to teach me.'' While
the center still doesn't offer a degree or even a major, it offers
what Coles believes is a powerful tool, useful to students in all
disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   And that is, he says, ``first-hand awareness of how people live,
uncluttered by jargon, unmediated by high-falutin' theoretical
talk. They'll remember voices, they'll remember sights, they'll be
able to pull together portraits of individuals, be able to think in
reasonably clear language about fellow human beings, how they live,
what they want out of life.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll be able to hear the stories that are all around them.
It's Coles' prescription for a good life.

 &HT;    Center at Duke University documents people behind the problems
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. _ The teenagers hanging out on Franklin Street have
that scary look. Pierced noses. Strange haircuts. Grungy clothes.
They're panhandling pedestrians and smoking cigarettes and
otherwise acting like a bunch of punks. ``Nobody's happy here,''
says regular scene-maker Jessica Turner, 16.
</P>
<P>
   But Claire Trask sees something different. The Duke University
senior has been photographing these Chapel Hill kids for eight
months. She's had them over to her house, fielded distraught phone
calls from their parents, visited their crash pads. She has spied
the little children hiding behind the tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   And you can see it in the photo essay she has assembled for a
class with the Center for Documentary Studies. Of choosing music
for her slide show, she says, ``I could have put it with the
Beastie Boys, and people would have said, `These kids are going to
pot.' But I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Trask, 22, chose Nat King Cole, singing ``L-O-V-E,''
and the street scene became a love story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veil dropped,'' says Alex Harris, co-founder of the
center. ``You carry in your mind a picture of what you're going to
do. How do you get rid of those pictures and really react to what's
in front of you? It takes time; it takes forming a relationship
with
</P>
<P>
   people.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1988 with support from the Lyndhurst Foundation, the
center has been training future Walker Evanses in its classes for
undergraduates, while pursuing a titanic research project on the
lives of black Southerners during the Jim Crow years.
</P>
<P>
   That project, called ``Behind the Veil,'' draws on 1,800 hours
of interviews in 25 communities and 10 states, completed over eight
years with the help of 50 graduate students from several North
Carolina schools. From it will flow several books and a special
archive of material at the John Hope Franklin Research Center,
which should support doctoral research for years to come, said
project leader William Chafe.
</P>
<P>
   Connected with the Veil undertaking is a service program called
Community Stories, through which summer interns train young people
in inner-city neighborhoods to also become documentarians, to take
oral histories from elders in the community. ``We want to teach
kids to be better thinkers,'' says coordinator Delia Gamble. Adds
Harris, ``They find it helps strengthen community identity,
strengthens bonds between young and old.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is also a publishing house. In addition to DoubleTake
magazine, it has produced a dozen high-quality books that
concentrate on the kind of personalized social inquiry favored by
co-founder Robert Coles. Recent titles include the 1998 book
``Closing: The Life and Death of American Factory'' _ the story, in
words and pictures, of the death of a Mebane, N.C., furniture
factory and ``The Youngest Parents,'' a 1997 Coles book about
teenagers with children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The first in what is to be a series of yearly documentary film
festivals, sponsored by the center in May, attracted such noted
filmmakers as Ken Burns and Albert Maysles.
</P>
<P>
   This interlocking web of activities operates out of a homey
19th-century country manor just off the Duke campus, with rocking
chairs on the porch and _ small wonder _ gorgeous photographs on
every wall.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the door and down the uneven boards of the front
hall are ghostly black-and-white images from the hills of Chiapas,
Mexico. In a new $1.5 million wing connected to the house are
classrooms, lecture halls and an impromptu gallery of
self-portraits from patients at a mental health facility.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTake magazine is the center's best-known product. The
spring issue's interview with rocker Bruce Springsteen, by Will
Percy, had an unusual genesis. Percy's uncle, the late novelist
Walker Percy, had a lasting influence on Coles with his 1961 novel
``The Moviegoer.'' (Coles even uses the protagonist's name as his
e-mail moniker.) It turns out that Walker Percy was also a fan of
Springsteen's. The elder Percy wrote to Springsteen in 1989 and,
though the musician didn't respond at the time, he began reading
the novelist's work, eventually corresponding with Percy's widow.
(Percy died in 1990.) In the interview, Springsteen talks about
populism, folk culture and how books, including Percy's work, have
affected his music.
</P>
<P>
   Often the outreach, teaching and publishing arms of the center
work in synergy. Wendy Ewald, a MacArthur Prize-winning
photographer based in New York, offers a course sponsored by the
center called ``Literacy Through Photography,'' which gives cameras
to Durham school kids and then prompts them to write about their
images. Ewald's work has also been featured in several issues of
the magazine, including a haunting series of images that resulted
when she asked youngsters to take photographs of their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name another magazine that would publish that,'' says Esquire
magazine senior editor and former DoubleTake staffer Jay Woodruff.
``They're almost the conscience of the culture out there, doing
God's work.''

 &HT;    These shoes are beauties but no beasts on the feet
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Stuart Weitzman designs ``killer'' shoes that are
actually quite harmless.
</P>
<P>
   The New York designer, who counts Cindy Crawford and Tipper Gore
among his clients, puts foam padding in his stilettos, rubber soles
on his loafers and suede linings in his pumps. Another fan, Rosie
O'Donnell, wore his comfy black heels to last week's Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent appearance at Phipps Plaza's Bob Ellis Shoes
boutique to showcase his $150-$200 shoes for fall, Weitzman said:
``My firm is known for making pretty, comfortable shoes that fit. I
would not risk my reputation by making a fabulous-looking shoe that
hurts.'' Between fittings with customers, the designer chatted with
Style:
</P>
<P>
   Q:Any innovations in the footwear business?
</P>
<P>
   A:High-tech materials. This fall, I'm designing with Gore-Tex
that's been a staple in outerwear for a number of years. It's a
man-made fabric that breathes and is waterproof, making it ideal
for footwear. Also I'm using suede that's been laminated with
Lycra. It stretches and fits like a glove.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How do you feel about being copied by other designers?
</P>
<P>
   A:On one hand, it's discouraging. On the other, it forces me to
be more creative. Also, if other shoe manufacturers don't copy my
designs, I'm not doing my job.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How many collections do you produce each season and where are
your shoes made?
</P>
<P>
   A:I design three lines a year for a total of 550 styles. I spend
half the year in Spain, where my shoes are made in my own
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Q:About how many shoes do you sell each year?
</P>
<P>
   A:I sell over 1 million pairs a year, in store boutiques and in
six free-standing stores. The Bob Ellis store sells the most
Weitzman shoes _ 10,000 pairs a year.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Do you visit Atlanta often?
</P>
<P>
   A:Atlanta is my adopted home, since my wife's family, the
Gershons, live here.

<P>
   ATLANTA -- Way back _ when your eyes were infantile and blurry _
dear old Dad saw enough good in you to think one of your
gas-induced smiles was thanks enough.
</P>
<P>
   But by now he's burped you, babied you, berated you, befriended
you and bailed you out so many times that your usual, ``Oh yeah,
thanks'' gifts on Father's Day just won't cut it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   So before you go (last-minute) shopping, think about how he
bottle-fed you, taught you how to make Kool-Aid, counseled you
against drinking and driving and proposed a toast at your wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Then resolve to give something significant in return.
</P>
<P>
   This Father's Day, buy him some time. Or a bottle. Or both.

TRIPLE PLAY CAN'T SAVE DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hey, Dionne Warwick and your psychic friends. Make
room for Jose Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers shortstop wisely picked his spots by making one
astonishing prediction and refraining from another Saturday at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino predicted a triple play right before the Dodgers
remarkably pulled one off in the fifth inning for just the second
time in Los Angeles Dodgers history. However, he did not mention
foretelling a victory as the Dodgers fell 4-2 to the Colorado
Rockies in front of 38,417 to end the possibility of a season-best
four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   In order, pitcher Darren Dreifort, Vizcaino, second baseman Eric
Young and third baseman Bobby Bonilla combined for the trifecta,
which was the first by the Dodgers at Chavez Ravine. It was also
the first time the Rockies have been involved in a triple play. The
San Francisco Giants' triple play May 8 against the host Chicago
Cubs is the only other in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't laugh, but I called it before it happened,'' said
Vizcaino, who has not previously been involved in a triple play.
``When (the Rockies' Jamey Wright) was on second base and E.Y.
(Young) was talking to him, I said `Hey watch ... get ready, we're
going to turn a triple play right here.' That is why I was jumping
(afterward).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know (if I'm psychic). Sometimes, I just say those
type of things. And when (Kurt Abbott) hit the ball, I was just
ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Juan Castro, Delino Deshields and Eric Karros turned the first
triple play in Los Angeles Dodgers history on June 15, 1996 at
Atlanta. The only other known triple play in Dodgers history came
on April 26, 1949, when Gene Hermanski, Jackie Robinson and Gil
Hodges turned one for Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were down 3-0 and the Rockies had a man on first and
second and no outs in the top of the fifth inning when Abbott
stepped to the plate. In the back of the Dodgers' minds was a play
about two weeks ago, in which starter Ramon Martinez had a man on
first and second with no outs and caught a short popup that ruined
a triple-play possibility. (The umpire had not invoked the
infield-fly rule).
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Abbott's bunt attempt resulted into a popup
to the right of the mound that Karros and Dreifort let fall to the
ground. After Dreifort threw the ball to second for out one,
Vizcaino threw the ball for to Eric Young, covering first, for the
second out. Young threw to Bobby Bonilla at third for the tag on
Wright, who began the play at second.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Vizcaino's prediction, Young said, ``Did he say
that? Well, we'll go along with that. Yeah, he did say that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a psychic on that. He says that kind of stuff all the
time. `Psychic' Vizcaino, we should get a hotline for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright (5-6) limited the Dodgers to just two runs on four hits
in 51/3 innings. Down 4-0 in the bottom of the sixth, the Dodgers
scored two runs when Young scored on Karros' bases-loaded walk and
Vizcaino followed with a run on a fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   While the victory snapped Wright's losing streak at two games,
the talk after the game was his baserunning blunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was caught, so I went back to second,'' Wright
said. ``Then I saw it drop in, so I started to run to third. It
came down to a pitcher not having baserunning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (4-6) squandered a chance to reach the .500 mark for
the first time in his career as a starter. The right-hander lasted
just six innings, ending a streak of five consecutive games in
which Dodgers starters lasted at least seven frames.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first inning (stunk),'' Dreifort said. ``After that I was
all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort allowed three runs off three hits in the first inning.
Pitching coach Goose Gregson said Dreifort, who also allowed a home
run to Larry Walker in the sixth, overthrew and opened up too much
on his delivery in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, there is hope for the Dodgers today.
</P>
<P>
   Vizcaino has predicted a victory over the Rockies.!end! &QL;

MCCAIN'S UGLY JOKE IS ON US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get ready to laugh. Those rib-tickling yuk-meisters of the
Washington press corps are about to apply several coats of
monkeyshine on the tarnished shell of their preordained prince of
presidential candidates _ John Sidney McCain III.
</P>
<P>
   War hero.
</P>
<P>
   Father.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senator.
</P>
<P>
   Comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at a Republican party fund-raiser, McCain decided to
tell a joke. He's always fancied himself a funny man. This time, he
chose to take the art form back a few centuries, tilting toward
harlequin. Toward jester. Toward fool.
</P>
<P>
   The gist of the senator's knee-slapper was:
</P>
<P>
   Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly? Because Janet Reno
is her father.
</P>
<P>
   Nice, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Just recently, CBS' Mike Wallace said of the man who told this
``joke,'' ``I'm thinking I may quit my job if he gets the
(Republican presidential) nomination. I'm impressed by his
independence, by his willingness to take on the tough ones. By his
honesty about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   By his sense of humor?
</P>
<P>
   McCain is a politician and a father. As a politician, he
probably expects to be the butt of a joke now and then. Certainly
Clinton does. And Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a man with daughter, though, how much would McCain laugh if
his child were ridiculed by a national figure?
</P>
<P>
   How funny would you find if it were your kid? &QL; 
`HE FEELS AWFUL' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCain's press secretary told the Republic, ``He feels awful,
and he regrets that he said it . . . I just can't repeat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect the national press to criticize him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been crowned.
</P>
<P>
   He can do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this from a Boston Globe columnist: ``I like him
because he's gutsy. I like him because he's an interesting person.
I like what he did on campaign finance. I like what he's done on
tobacco. I like his war record. There's an army out there waiting
for this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   From a Wall Street Journal columnist: ``(McCain) is the most
courageous and one of the most admirable men I've ever known in
American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Another syndicated columnist sings the praises of ``McCain's
against-the-grain leadership coupled with his riveting personal
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you laughing yet?
</P>
<P>
   You should be.
</P>
<P>
   The joke is on you, or could be in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For months, now, the senator has been on the rubber chicken
circuit playing David to the tobacco industry's Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad thing to take on tobacco, to fight an industry
that markets death to young people. &QL; 
THE ALCOHOL CONNECTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But why haven't any of his media tent-followers pressed the
senator about alcohol?
</P>
<P>
   Why he doesn't attack that industry, which also produces a
deadly and dangerous product aimed at young people?
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't one reporter from outside McCain's home state ask if
maybe he's reluctant to take on the beer barons because he married
into a family made wealthy by distributing brewski?
</P>
<P>
   The senator wrote an apology to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Post, ``Yes, I made a very unfortunate and
insensitive remark. It was the wrong thing to do, and I have no
excuse for it.''
</P>
<P>
   He need not worry.
</P>
<P>
   His Beltway buddies will forgive him, as they've forgiven his
other gaffes, his temper, his membership in the Keating Five. I'm
sure they're already making excuses for him.
</P>
<P>
   Boys will be boys, they'll say. Lighten up, it was only a joke.
Like that.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I can't, and won't, say anything about John Sidney
McCain III's children.
</P>
<P>
   I know this, however, Admiral and Mrs. John Sidney McCain Jr.
sure had one ugly boy. &QL;

METS BEAT MARLINS, 7-4  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Mike Piazza has helped the Mets win consistently since
his arrival three weeks ago. Now, it seems, they can do it all on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   With the All-Star catcher sitting out Saturday night's game
because of a mild right shoulder strain, the Mets had to find a way
to win without him. And they did, unleashing a seven-run third
inning and cruising to a 7-4 victory over the Florida Marlins
before a crowd of 31,887 at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are now 37-26, with victories in three of their last
four games.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's neck stiffened after a collision with Gregg Zaun on a
tag play at the plate on Friday night. The soreness ultimately
settled in his right shoulder, and he was examined by the Marlins'
physician, George Caldwell. Piazza is listed as day to day.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets reacted as if they now are in a winning groove, Piazza
or no Piazza. Especially against these cellar-dwelling Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   On the Mets' last visit here, they produced a nine-run inning
and a six-run inning. Saturday night, the magic number was seven.
</P>
<P>
   The third inning began with Rey Ordonez's double to the
left-field wall. Alberto Castillo, the fill-in catcher, walked, and
pitcher Rick Reed sacrificed them up a base. Next, Brian McRae
missed a home run down the right-field line by several inches
before walking.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo then singled in two runs, and Carlos Baerga and
John Olerud followed with run-producing singles of their own to
make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   With two men on, Butch Huskey ended any suspense this game might
have by riding Brian Meadows' first pitch 440 feet over the
center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had fallen behind in the first inning when Edgar
Renteria singled with one out and Mark Kotsay sent a 1-0 fastball
from Reed 368 feet into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   That two-run bulge held up until the Mets' third-inning
explosion, which included five hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reed (8-3) survived the rocky beginning to win for
the seventh time in his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   And he came within two outs of his second straight complete
game. He retired the first Marlin in the ninth inning but then
walked Todd Zeile and allowed a run-scoring double by Cliff Floyd.
After walking Derrek Lee, Reed was replaced by Manager Bobby
Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   On came the venerable save specialist John Franco in a
history-making appearance. This was his 401st game as a Met, tying
the record set by Tom Seaver.
</P>
<P>
   Franco induced Zaun to pop up to Alfonzo at third base, and then
he struck out Dave Berg on a 2-2 pitch to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, which had been vocal in wishing for a Florida
comeback, let out a loud ``whoosh'' when Franco blazed the final
pitch by Berg.
</P>
<P>
   It was Franco's 15th save of the season and the 373rd of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Reed allowed seven hits and walked two while striking out eight,
and he was particularly sharp for the four innings preceding the
ninth. The victory means he will be sending another $2,000 to the
Diabetes Association of America _ an agreement he made before the
season for each victory.
</P>
<P>
   Reed has become the iron man of the Mets' staff, pitching at
least 7 innings in 11 of his 13 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to expect good things of him every time out,''
Valentine said. ``He keeps us in games.''
</P>
<P>
   For Huskey, this was a continuation of his hot hitting against
the Marlins. He had driven in five runs in an inning during the
last trip here.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have won four of five games here against the Marlins.

LA POSADA RESTORATION AIMS TO PUT WINSLOW BACK ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSLOW, Ariz. _ This little desert town, famous as an outpost
on Route 66 and immortalized in a pop song, is a community whose
life is hanging in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, business folk and sen timental fools are hoping the
ghosts of the Harvey Girls will tip the scales toward rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Winslow is La Po sada, a luxury hotel built in
1930 to accommodate passengers of the At chison, Topeka and Santa
Fe Rail way. Once the town's very soul, the resort welcomed
well-heeled visitors from as far away as New York City, fed them,
lodged them and intro duced them to the Wild West.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the many Harvey Houses that dotted the countryside, it
was staffed by a bevy of hard-working women nicknamed for Fred
Harvey, the hospitality baron whose empire served America's
railroads.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s and '40s, the glamorous La Posada enjoyed a
whirlwind love affair with its neigh bors, serving as a community
center and point of pride for the city that was supposed to be
northern Arizo na's boomtown.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, the hotel welcomed the rich and famous: Clark
Gable and Carole Lombard, Douglas Fair banks and Mary Pickford,
Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, Gary Cooper, Jimmy Durante, John
Wayne, Howard Hughes, Will Rog ers, Harry Truman, Franklin Roose
velt and Japanese royalty.
</P>
<P>
   But La Posada was not just for tourists. To the good people of
Winslow, it was a showplace where they could don their finery, dine
in elegance, have their photograph taken in front of a wishing well
and watch strangers pour from the trains that thundered into town.
</P>
<P>
   It must have been magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   Then fate turned cruel. Time and neglect devastated the
community. Like many a small town (population 10,000), Winslow
began to sustain the ravages of progress.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, upstart neighbor Flagstaff, home of North
ern Arizona University, surpassed Winslow and became the state's
gateway to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Winslow's airport, in 1948 the largest commercial airport in Ari
zona _ three major runways and nine TWA transcontinental flights
landing every day _ was displaced by airstrips in bigger cities.
</P>
<P>
   Although La Posada's charm was undeniable, it was never much of
a moneymaker. With railway transpor tation on the decline, it
closed as a hotel in 1957, a scant 27 years after it opened.
</P>
<P>
   Route 66 once burrowed through downtown, drawing traffic and con
ferring celebrity status on cities along the famous cruiseway. In
1978, newly built Interstate 40 by passed the main streets of
Winslow, scuttling tourism and traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The town was nearly given over to the drunks who flopped outside
cowboy bars and dozed in the streets. Winslow seemed destined to go
the way of so many moribund hamlets stationed along Route 66.
</P>
<P>
   But like another famous Arizona city, Winslow was a town too
tough to die. A spark of life remained. Two women fanned that
spark, and flames ignited. Today, the commu nity again is poised to
take its place among choice Arizona destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The ghosts of the Harvey Girls have become guardian angels. Led
by a $5 million restoration of La Po sada, Winslow is being
rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the renaissance,'' says Marie LaMar, one of
the two women credited with helping to re vive Winslow. ``It's all
part of this huge effort to take back our town.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Bill Elzey, mayor at the time, asked Janice Griffith,
curator of the town's Old Trails Museum, to save La Posada.
Griffith was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know it was in danger,'' she told Elzey.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, who has lived in Wins low since childhood, discovered
that the venerable property was indeed in danger. Headquarters of
the Santa Fe Railway since shutting down as a hotel, it had been
consigned to the company's ``disposal list.''
</P>
<P>
   A death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Its beauty faded, the former fa vorite of Hollywood stars had
fallen from grace _ lawns as dry as the desert, interior archways
filled in to create office space, splendid fur nishings long since
sold to buyers in Albuquerque. Even the wishing well was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith panicked.
</P>
<P>
   La Posada, she says, is ``the best thing we've got. It's a
landmark. It's a glorious place. We need it.''
</P>
<P>
   With four other concerned citi zens, including LaMar, Griffith
formed the La Posada Foundation. With help from a lawyer, she won
the hotel a spot on the National Registry of Historic Places. &QL; 
WINSLOW'S WHITE KNIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Then she began to look for a white knight. She found Allan Af
feldt.
</P>
<P>
   The energetic young man from Ir vine, Calif., had an
all-but-disserta tion doctorate in cognitive sciences, a background
as an international peace activist and an eye toward his toric
preservation. He had met his wife, artist Tina Mion, when she was a
member of an American peace delegation in the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   He was also chairman of the board of EOS, an architectural think
tank concerned with eco-architec ture and sustainable resources.
When the National Registry pub lished its 1993 list of most endan
gered buildings, one entry, La Posada, caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Affeldt knew it had been de signed by Mary Elizabeth Jane
Colter, a reknowned architect who became Fred Harvey's lead
designer. She also had created such Harvey properties as Hopi
House, El Tovar and Phantom Ranch at the Grand Canyon, and La Fonda
in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was Affeldt's turn to panic. How could a Colter design
be marked for destruction? He and Mion jumped on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   In Griffith's eyes, Affeldt arrived in Winslow on a white horse.
She and her foundation had already fended off unsatisfactory offers
to turn La Posada into a military school, a college, a public
health service hospital and even _ gulp _ a casino.
</P>
<P>
   She met with and dismissed sev eral developers who didn't share
her vision of preserving La Posada's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid they'd turn it into a sushi bar,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But although she was wary of the worldly man from California _
``He was different from us'' _ she found his respect for La Posada
comforting.
</P>
<P>
   And, she says frankly, ``He was the only game in town.''
</P>
<P>
   With the promise of a $500,000 Department of Transportation-ad
ministered grant and an historic re habilitation tax credit,
Griffith welcomed Affeldt's decision to buy the property from the
railroad and restore it to its former glory. &QL; 
RETURNING TOWN'S SOUL
</P>
<P>
   As Affeldt began to implement his plan, the town held its
breath. Could La Posada become what it had once been _ the heart
and soul and livelihood of Winslow?
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this has always been the thing that has been the
catalyst for resurrection,'' Griffith says. ``La Posada was a large
piece of Wins low's soul. As a historian, I'm con scious of what it
takes to sustain people. . . . What it takes is a sense of
community and pride.''
</P>
<P>
   When La Posada died, she says, ``The city lost a major chunk of
its soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Affeldt was determined to restore Winslow's soul. If he didn't
yet have all the money needed to complete the four-year project _
an esti mated $5 million, or five times that of its original
construction cost _ he certainly had the passion. He loved
beautiful buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's art,'' he says. ``I don't care if it's new or old.
There's no reason something you live in can't be art. We need that
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Posada is an extraordinary treasure. There's nothing like
this in northern Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   He embraced Colter's concept. For each property she designed,
she created an imaginary history. La Po sada, she fancied, had been
an 18th-century hacienda owned by a wealthy Spanish don. Guests of
the 75-room hotel were guests of the family.
</P>
<P>
   She established a carpentry shop on the premises where craftsmen
hand-fashioned the hotel's furniture. The interior was decorated
with reli gious icons _ not only Catholic symbols but artifacts
from the Ana zasi and Hopi cultures, tokens of pagan and Wica
worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very spiritualistic place,'' Affeldt says. ``There is a
sense of benevolence here. It's full of spiri tual energy.''
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing more than a dozen architectural firms,
Affeldt chose van dijk Pace Westlake, a Cleveland-based company
with of fices in Phoenix. The firm's exqui site renovation of the
Orpheum Theatre in downtown Phoenix im pressed him.
</P>
<P>
   The architects in turn were im pressed to find the hotel of
sound construction, thanks to Colter's in sistence on a sturdy
support system of reinforced concrete. What's miss ing is
compliance with some por tions of the Americans With Disabilities
Act. That will be cor rected. &QL; 
OPEN FOR BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   With about a third of its renova tion completed, La Posada is
trading in her railroad coveralls for her old party dress. Open for
business, the hotel boasts a remodeled lobby and public areas in
the Colter style. Lawns are green again. Furniture is once more
being crafted on site _ by Affeldt's brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   China used for the hotel's conti nental breakfast is a
reproduction of that used on the old AT&AMP;SF line and is inspired by
1,000-year-old Hopi designs. Along with other high-quality items
such as Indian crafts and T-shirts, pieces of the china are
available in the tiny hotel gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   Six guest rooms _ including doubles and suites _ now welcome
guests. Within two months, an addi tional 17 will be available. By
the end of the year, a total of 40 rooms will be open.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy travelers can take advan tage of La Posada as a
work-in-progress: Current rates range from $65 to $85 per night.
The whole ho tel can be rented for special events for $1,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   When restoration is complete, and La Posada becomes a boutique
hotel of 50 rooms, rates will reflect its luxury status.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, La Posada's din ing room catered to soldiers
heading across country on troop trains. Ci vilians were left to
forage at the nearby snack shop, where they could get a Spam
sandwich and chips for 25 cents, coffee for a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   When Santa Fe officials took over the property, they gutted the
dining room. Because an in-house restau rant is vital to any
upscale hotel, Affeldt is seeking a chef-restaura teur who could
fashion a kitchen to his own liking. Affeldt plans to have it
operating by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith and LaMar are hoping to bring back some of La Posada's
lost treasures. After the hotel closed, most of its furnishings
were sold in Albuquerque _ a quicker destina tion than Phoenix.
Their return would be appreciated, Griffith says.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith also has taken on the task of establishing a park,
Standing on the Corner Park _ at Second Street and Kinsley, just a
few blocks from the hotel. The park will commemo rate Take It Easy,
the song Jackson Browne wrote with Glenn Frey after a stopover in
town. It was recorded in 1972 by the pop group the Ea gles, of
which Frey was a member.
</P>
<P>
   The catchy opening line, ``Stand ing on a corner in Winslow,
Arizona . . .'' has drawn visitors from all over the world and
inspired the T-shirts Griffith sells at Old Trails Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Browne has promised to help dedicate the park when it opens.
</P>
<P>
   With two years to go before La Posada is fully restored, the
people of Winslow are already feeling pride in the possibilities it
brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the big thing happening in town now,'' says Affeldt,
who has hosted such on-property events as antique-car shows,
elder-hostel pro grams and crafts classes. ``It's not just
marketing. We want it to be a community center again.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith sees Affeldt as a friend and savior who has endeared
him self to the residents of Winslow. Side by side one balmy night,
they chow down on home-cooked food at a potluck supper honoring a
woman born at La Posada 67 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Repelled by the misguided buyers she feared would destroy her be
loved resort, Griffith is gratified that Affeldt has not tried to
foist un conventional ideas on a town steeped in tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really is giving us the bene fit of his experience,'' she
says. `We've seen our landmark come back. We're pleased with what
we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The potluck that honors Patricia Dooms Flanigan welcomes back a
woman who lived for seven years at La Posada as the daughter of the
first general manager, Omar Dooms. When her father died in 1938,
she moved away but returned every summer until she was 14. She now
lives with her husband in Carthage, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   On a nostalgic visit to La Posada in 1965, she was dismayed to
find that her beautiful home had gone corporate. Lovely murals were
ob scured by dropped ceilings. Railroad clerks were working where
Harvey Girls once coddled guests.
</P>
<P>
   Crushed, Flanigan vowed never to return.
</P>
<P>
   Then she heard about the work Griffith and LaMar were doing. In
trigued, she told her husband she had to see for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to come back, and I had to come back now,'' she
says. ``It was pulling me.''
</P>
<P>
   Her eyes sparkle as she looks around at the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredible what has hap pened,'' she says. ``I can't
begin to tell you what joy I've seen in what is happening. It's
been an epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   Epiphanies do not come cheap. Affeldt is still seeking investors
to foot the bill for the remainder of his project. He promises that
time will reward their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He is negotiating to buy and ren ovate the old opera house in
down town Winslow. And the former headquarters of the Hubbell
Trading Post, also downtown, is being pur chased by Winslow, which
will run it jointly as a museum with a Native American cooperative
and the origi nal donor of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Such urban renewal would cer tainly turn Winslow into a major
tourist destination, Affeldt says, ac commodating visitors headed
for Canyon de Chelly, the Painted Des ert, Monument Valley, the
Grand Canyon and Meteor Crater.
</P>
<P>
   The Sante Fe (now merged with the Burlington Northern) continues
to operate out of a wing at La Po sada and runs 90 freight trains
through town every day. Amtrak op erates a passenger line that
stops twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a city on the slide for many years,'' Affeldt says.
``We had to convince people that not only La Posada but the city
was worth sav ing. If this all gets done, this real estate
quadruples in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMar, a retired real-estate bro ker whose mother was a Harvey
Girl at the Havasu in Seligman, finds her town's rebirth something
of a miracle. Once despairing, she feels Winslow's soul is now in
safe hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision is coming back. La Posada is an example of how a
com munity wants to feel good about it self and how the people have
supported it,'' she says. ``We are the stewards of what we have.'' &QL;
