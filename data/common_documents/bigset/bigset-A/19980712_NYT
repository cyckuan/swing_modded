<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Mulan didn't just save China, she's saving The
Walt Disney Co. as well.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's latest animated movie, ``Mulan,'' has revived the
fortunes of its most precious division following several years of
less-than-stellar performances. With $84.8 million in domestic
grosses in its first three weeks through Thursday, ``Mulan'' has
outperformed expectations and should be hugely profitable for the
entertainment giant.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe ``Mulan'' could wind up with $140 million by
the end of its run _ far better than the $100 million final grosses
for 1996's ``The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' and last summer's
``Hercules.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's early performance also reinforces the widespread
belief that rivals like Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox and
DreamWorks SKG face a rough road in challenging Disney's lock on
animated movies, dating back to its 1937 release of ``Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact remains that no other studio has ever been able to do
anywhere near Disney's business in animated movies,'' said analyst
Stewart Halpern of Furman Selz. ``If you asked most parents what
they want, they'd say they were looking for more animated Disney
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Halpern estimates every dollar in domestic ticket sales for a
Disney animated movie translates to three dollars of operating
profit due to enormous markets for merchandise, home video and
overseas theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern's estimate is conservative, with many analysts using a
multiplier of four to calculate animation profits. In the case of a
worldwide hit like 1994's ``The Lion King,'' Disney's operating
profits have gone past $1 billion, according to Jill Krutick of
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animation is the most lucrative venue for the company, as it
sparks a rainbow of related product sales over a period of years,''
said Krutick, who has a ``buy'' rating on the stock. She estimated
``Mulan'' would generate up to $350 million in operating profit
with foreign box office of $125 million to $175 million, U.S. home
video sales of 11 million to 13 million units and video sales of 8
million to 9 million units overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Krutick, who had originally predicted a domestic gross as low as
$80 million for ``Mulan,'' said its unique story helped widen the
audience beyond the core of young girls to include boys and more
sophisticated moviegoers. She also noted that although ``Mulan''
production costs were higher than ``Hercules,'' Disney's total
costs were about equal because it spent less on marketing
``Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   For Disney, the success of ``Mulan'' also represents a bit of
redemption following 1994's departure of Jeffrey Katzenberg as
studio chief a few months after ``The Lion King'' became a
worldwide blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though `Hunchback' and `Hercules' had respectable
numbers, people's expectations were so high because of `Lion King,'
'' said Linda Bannister of Edward Jones. ``You can't hit a home run
every time, but I don't think that it meant in any way that Disney
had lost its touch in animation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan's'' success is timely because Disney's other recent
films _ ``Armageddon,'' ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' and ``The Horse
Whisperer'' _ have failed to meet expectations. Even though
``Armageddon'' managed to gross an impressive $76.3 million in nine
days, this weekend's openings of ``Small Soldiers'' and ``Lethal
Weapon 4'' are expected to rob much of the disaster film's
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, ``Mulan's'' solid numbers come with Disney facing
upcoming incursions in animation likely to be more formidable than
recent entries by 20th Century Fox's ``Anastasia'' and Warner
Bros.' ``Quest for Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount will open ``Rugrats'' in November and a ``Beavis and
Butt-head'' sequel next year. Katzenberg, meanwhile, has maneuvered
the openings of DreamWorks' ``Antz'' and ``Prince of Egypt'' around
the November release of Disney's ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street favors Disney. Shares of Pixar Animation, which
co-financed ``A Bug's Life,'' have soared recently on positive
forecasts about the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very optimistic about `A Bug's Life,' '' Bannister
said. ``I'm of the mind that there are Disney films and then
there's everyone else. The name is synonymous with good quality,
and parents feel comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan'' and the buzz over ``A Bug's Life'' validate Disney's
recent strategy of cutting back the number of live-action products
while boosting its animated operations. It plans to release four
animated movies next year _ ``Tarzan,'' ``Toy Story 2,''
``Dinosaur'' and ``Fantasia 2000,'' set for New Year's Eve.

REDS' REMLINGER BLANKS DIAMONDBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There was no place like home for two members of the
visiting Cincinnati Reds on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chaparral High graduate Paul Konerko homered in his first start
for his new team, and Mike Remlinger, who lives in Scottsdale
during the off-season, pitched his best game in more than seven
years as the Reds beat the Diamondbacks, 8-0, at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Barry Larkin, a true out-of-towner, homered twice, had
three hits in all and drove in five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko, part of a trade that sent relief pitcher Jeff Shaw to
the Los Angeles Dodgers last week, started in left field and hit a
solo homer off Diamondbacks starter Willie Blair in the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   That made it 2-0 at the time, and it was more than enough for
Remlinger, a lefthander who pitched a three-hitter for his second
career shutout. His first happened on June 15, 1991 while pitching
for the San Francisco Giants, shortly after he was promoted from
the Triple-A Firebirds.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into the game, Remlinger, who struck out seven and walked
five, was 5-9 with a 4.50 ERA. One of the losses was to the
Diamondbacks, last month.
</P>
<P>
   Blair took his 13th loss, tops in the majors. He also gave up a
pair of homers (Barry Larkin added one in the eighth) and now has
been taken deep 23 times, highest in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who won their sixth straight and 11 of their last 12,
took a 1-0 lead in the second inning when Willie Greene led off
with a single and Bret Boone walked. Konerko to hit into a double
play, Greene moving to third. Pokey Reese then hit a grounder wide
of first base. Travis Lee got to it, but Blair, covering first,
dropped the toss just as Reese was arriving with a head-first
slide. Reese got an infield hit and an RBI out of it as Greene
scored.
</P>
<P>
   As in the first eight innings of Friday's 5-4 loss, the
Diamondbacks offered little resistance. Yamil Benitez sent Reggie
Sanders back to the wall in center field, more than 400 feet away,
for long out in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller led off the third inning with a double, but stayed
at second as Blair struck out, Devon White hit a lazy fly ball to
left and Danny Klassen was robbed for the second time by shortstop
Barry Larkin. In the first inning, Larkin went far to his left,
whirled and barely got Klassen at first. This time, Larkin went to
his right and threw Klassen out by a fraction.
</P>
<P>
   Blair appeared to be in command after the Reds' run in the
second. He gave up a two-out double to Larkin in the third, then
got Eddie Taubensee on a soft liner to second baseman Klassen.
</P>
<P>
   But with two out in the fourth, Blair grooved an 0-2 pitch to
Konerko. Delighted over such an offering, Konerko sent it into the
overhang under the scoreboard in center field. The blast, his fifth
of the season, was measured at 436 feet. The Reds led, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Lee walked with one out in the fourth and Jay Bell sent a
momentary thrill through the crowd of 47,323. But his long fly,
like Benitez's, settled into Sanders' glove near the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Blair provided a re-run of the third inning when Sean Casey
doubled with two out, then stayed at second when Larkin flied out
to right.
</P>
<P>
   White led off the sixth with a walk and after Klassen flied to
left, Matt Williams singled. There was one out, runners on first
and second and Lee, who leads all National League rookies in hits,
home runs and RBI, coming up.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee swung at Remlinger's first offering and grounded into a
double play started by second baseman Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, Benitez was hit by a pitch with one
out. But Dellucci grounded to Larkin, who started another double
play.
</P>
<P>
   It was still 2-0, but all of Blair's good work came undone in
the eighth. After Sanders struck out for the fourth time, Casey
doubled. Larkin then hit his seventh homer of the season. The
two-run shot gave the Reds a 4-0 lead and knocked Blair out of the
game. Alan Embree came in and immediately surrendered a pair of
singles and a wild pitch for the Reds fifth run.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Olson pitched the ninth for the Diamondbacks and
surrendered a three-run homer to Larkin. &QL;

EVENTUALLY, SMITH WILL PAY FOR TKACHUK'S EXTENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -  &UR; Keith Tkachuk won't come to Coyotes' training camp
without a contract extension. That should be a foregone conclusion
by now, about as obvious as  &UR; Lucy pulling the football from
 &UR; Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if Coyotes General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith
continues to play hardball and refuses to negotiate a new
three-year pact _ a $33 million package that he pulled off the
table two weeks ago?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Smith will pay what it takes to keep one of the
NHL's top power forwards in a Phoenix uniform well into the next
millennium. Why? Because trading him isn't an option. Not after
dealing another proven 50-goal scorer,  &UR; Teemu Selanne, just over
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, only a handful of teams can afford Tkachuk. Few of them
have anything the Coyotes want in return.  &UR; Pavel Bure and Vancouver
Canucks are out. So is  &UR; Adam  &UR; Graves and the New York Rangers.
Ditto with  &UR; Eric
 &UR; Lindros and Philadelphia (though don't ask me why).
</P>
<P>
   The only deal that would remotely make sense is a two-for-one
with the New York Islanders: Tkachuk for sizzling  &UR; Ziggy Palffy and
one of two top young defensemen,  &UR; Bryan Berard or  &UR; Kenny Jonsson.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't happen, either. Smith, like it or not, has proven
it. In the end, he will strike a bargain with Tkachuk and agent
 &UR; Bob
 &UR; Murray, just as he did with  &UR; Jeremy  &UR; Roenick two years ago after
JR's trade from Chicago. Just as he did last season after one-third
of the season with  &UR; Oleg Tverdovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Both players virtually got what they wanted after contract
disputes. So, too, will Tkachuk, whether or not you believe he
deserves between $33 million and $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what's going to happen?'' Tkachuk said. ``Obviously,
that would be nice. But he's got to do what's best for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   What's best for the Coyotes, barring the perfect trade, is
facilitating Tkachuk as soon as possible. Yes, pay him the big
money. Even if he has two years remaining on his contract, which he
should _ but probably won't _ honor.
</P>
<P>
   Do it now and save face. Do it after 30 or 40 games, and the
Coyotes might as well kiss the playoffs goodbye. &QL; 
Bowman back?
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with him in Buffalo during the NHL entry draft, it
didn't appear likely that Red Wings Coach  &UR; Scotty Bowman would
return for another season.
</P>
<P>
   That may have changed. Bowman, concerned about his health after
the death of his younger brother, Jack, underwent a comprehensive
medical examination Thursday at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal
Oak, Mich. Afterward, he said he would be back for at least one
more season if the tests showed he was healthy enough to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are due back Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took most of the day,'' Bowman told the ``Detroit News.''
``They let me out, so I guess that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, who turns 65 in September, would like a chance to break
 &UR; Toe
 &UR; Blake's record for the most Stanley Cups won as a head coach.
Bowman tied Blake with eight crowns after winning back-to-back
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman will undergo knee-replacement surgery this summer,
regardless, which will keep him on the mend for at least two
months. &QL; 
Goalie go-around
</P>
<P>
   Toronto goalie  &UR; Felix Potvin apparently is off the trading block
after Edmonton refused to take him. The deal that would have been
preceded by the Maple Leafs signing Oilers goalie  &UR; Curtis Joseph to
a free-agent contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Potvin deal also was contingent on Toronto getting
defenseman
 &UR; Boris Mironov and rookie center  &UR; Boyd Devereaux in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of the Felix Potvin fiasco,'' said Mike Smith,
Toronto's associate GM. ``He's one of the best goalies in the
league, and yet we received nothing but poor offers from other
teams. . . . We have no intention of trading him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no one knows what will happen with Joseph and fellow
free-agent goalie  &UR; Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation hasn't changed for Curtis or Richter,'' Oilers
GM
 &UR; Glen Sather said. ``They're still trying to hold out for as much as
possible. It doesn't seem like it makes any difference where they
play, as long as they get the money they're asking.''
</P>
<P>
   If Richter doesn't re-sign with the Rangers, who tendered him a
three-year deal last week worth $5.4 million a season, he could be
out of luck. Florida and Vancouver, the two main clubs interested,
can't afford it.
</P>
<P>
   Slap shots
</P>
<P>
   Not including backup goalie  &UR; Jimmy  &UR; Waite, an unrestricted free
agent who may not be back, the Coyotes have jettisoned the most
core players from their roster among the 26 established clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has purged at least 11 part- or full-time contributors
from last season, three more than the next-closest team. Among
those who won't be back:  &UR; Mike Gartner,  &UR; Jim McKenzie,  &UR; Craig
Janney,  &UR; Murray Baron,
 &UR; Darrin Shannon, &UR; Jim  &UR; Johnson,  &UR; Norm Maciver,  &UR; John Slaney and
 &UR; Michel
 &UR; Petit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a 13-year veteran who has spent two years with the
Coyotes, has been approached about the team's radio analyst job,
made vacant when  &UR; Tom Kurvers moved to West Coast scout for
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who missed most of last season after suffering a
serious concussion, is expected to notify the club with his
decision sometime this week. Don't be surprised if Johnson moves
into a pro coaching career if he turns down the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olie the Goalie,'' Washington's  &UR; Olaf Kolzig, will be getting
married in Arizona next month. An off-season resident, Kolzig's
best man will be Bruins goalie  &UR; Byron Dafoe, formerly of the
Roadrunners. &QL;

NEW COMMISSIONER TAKES WELFARE OF GAME TO HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It became official last week:  &UR; Bud Selig is now the ninth
commissioner in the history of the game. There are those who
believe this is the worst possible news baseball could have
produced.
</P>
<P>
   The reality of it all is that baseball has now joined the other
three major sports. Major League Baseball was the last of the major
sports to hold out on the thought of a truly independent
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The current landscape of professional sports, which have gone
from family-run franchises to being held by billion-dollar
corporations, has drastically changed. The NBA recognized this long
ago and  &UR; David
 &UR; Stern, generally regarded as the best of the commissioners, is not
the independent head of the sport he makes himself out to be, but
instead, someone whose agenda is geared completely toward the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Selig will forever be linked to the canceling of the last six
weeks of the 1994 season, the single biggest black eye the game has
ever suffered. Even though Selig stood alone on the podium that
September day and canceled the World Series, every player in the
major leagues stood next to him. Both parties were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Selig has nothing but the goodwill of the game
in his heart. Now that he is through juggling the Milwaukee Brewers
and the office of the commissioner, it's time for Selig to, in his
words, ``give every ounce of energy in his body to this job.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who has deep passion for the great game of
baseball. He just needs to remember that, which he should have no
trouble with, and Selig will be remembered as one of the people who
helped save baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there has been a dramatic change in Selig's stance, he
will do the right thing and help bring baseball back to its
standing as the crown jewel of the major sports. It can be done,
and Selig is not a bad choice to help get it done. &QL; 
Renewing acquaintances &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Albert Belle, now with the White Sox, played for Cleveland
Manager
 &UR; Mike Hargrove for five years while in Cleveland. Belle felt
slighted when Hargrove selected  &UR; Ray Durham over Belle as the White
Sox's All-Star representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hargrove was his own man, I think I would have been
picked,'' Belle said.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove, who often tangled with Belle when the two were
together, denied he was pushed to select Durham over Belle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nobody in my ear about this,'' Hargrove said. ``I
made the decision based on the fact that Albert was picked last
year and didn't participate in anything. He didn't take the (team)
picture, he didn't take batting practice, nothing. And I'm not
going to waste a spot with somebody who doesn't want to play. It's
that plain and simple. I'm not so sure that Albert's numbers are
any better than anybody we picked.'' &QL; 
Orel's goals &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's  &UR; Orel Hershiser, who greatly enjoyed beating his
former club Los Angeles last weekend, now has 186 career victories,
leaving him 23 short of where he wants to wind up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My ultimate goal is to win a world championship with the
Giants,'' Hershiser said. ``My secondary and personal goal is to
win 200 games and then win 209 games to get where  &UR; Don Drysdale is
at.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Drysdale, who befriended Hershiser during his many
years with the Dodgers, was 209-166 during his Hall of Fame career.
Hershiser, who is wearing No. 53 to honor Drysdale, is 186-129.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cy Young Award winner in 1988 is under contract for
$3.45 million this season and has an option for $3.25 million next
season. However, Hershiser can become a free agent if he pitches
176 innings. He's at 110. &QL; 
A red summer &QL; 
Cincinnati has lowered its payroll to the point where it can live
with it. Now the Reds want to go all the way with their plan to be
competitive by the time their new stadium is scheduled to open in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are no longer making deals for payroll reasons,'' GM  &UR; Jim
Bowden said. `Our payroll is the fourth lowest in baseball. That is
no longer an issue. The issue is to get to what our ownership
wants, which is a winner in 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden has warned  &UR; John Allen, who has taken over the Reds in
 &UR; Marge
 &UR; Schott's absence, to not expect the Reds to compete in the coming
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I informed him that if in fact we start to trade the rest of
these key pieces, you can't come back in 15 months and say, `OK,
now we want to win,' '' Bowden said. ``Once you do this, you have
to be totally committed to what your direction has been. John Allen
was very emphatic. He said our game plan has not changed, and we
will not deviate from that.'' &QL;

LASORDA SHOULD LEARN TO READ FINE PRINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first I-told-you-so could be landing any
second now. Lobbed by the Dodgers employee who, in the dizzying
hours after Tom Lasorda became the club's general manager,
described a worrisome scenario that sounded very much like what
just took place in the Jeff Shaw trade.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was that Lasorda, as impulsive as he is inexperienced
in his new job, might pull a trade or some other player move
without regard for the complicated rules that govern major-league
transactions. The mistake might cost the Dodgers a player or a
bundle of money.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in keeping with his reputation for shifting blame (``It's
not my fault, Campanis is the guy!''), he might try to pin it on a
subordinate who could have prevented the error if only Lasorda had
given him the chance.
</P>
<P>
   In the for-instance, the employee proposed, a player might be
shipped to the minors for the third time, which the rules say would
make him a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Lasorda's oversight in trading Paul Konerko and
Dennis Reyes to the Cincinnati Reds for Shaw on July 4 might be
nothing more than a minor embarrassment, a missed homework
assignment in the education of a GM. Or it might turn into
something worse, allowing the relief ace the Dodgers traded two top
prospects to acquire to leave in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported Saturday that Lasorda didn't realize
that under the Basic Agreement between players and owners, because
Shaw has at least five (actually six) years in the major leagues
and was traded with at least a season (actually three) left on his
Reds contract, he has the right to demand the Dodgers trade him in
the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   The rule is designed to give some leverage to players who agree
to multi-year contracts, perhaps signing away a chance for free
agency, to achieve stability. Shaw liked playing in Cincinnati,
where he could live in his hometown: Washington Court House, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about Shaw actually wanting out of Los Angeles. He
laughed about the report before the game against the San Diego
Padres Saturday night. ``I've been here two days, and they're
already talking about me leaving!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's agent, Joe Bick of Cincinnati, said there's no reason to
think Shaw would request a trade. ``We hope this isn't an issue at
all,'' Bick said on the phone. ``Jeff wants to go and do a terrific
job for the Dodgers and be a part of the ballclub for a long time
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Shaw and Bick will hold onto the right, because it could
be the lever that pries more money out of the Dodgers. Teams often
make such deals to persuade players to waive their right when this
rule comes into play, which it does frequently when a veteran
player is traded. Like every summer.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets to the heart of the matter. This rule isn't exactly
obscure. It's quite a boulder to stumble over.
</P>
<P>
   And the mistake was completely avoidable. Apparently, Lasorda's
mistake was in making the trade. Rumors of it he had denied for
days before running it past Dodgers baseball operations
administrator Robert Schweppe, whose job includes reading the fine
print.
</P>
<P>
   The 174-page Basic Agreement is too complex for any GM to carry
around in his head. That's why Lasorda _ like Fred Claire before
him, and Al Campanis before him, and all but a handful of other
big-league GMs _ has people to double-check his work.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Lasorda's boss, Dodgers president Bob Graziano,
declined to comment because he didn't want to appear to
second-guess Lasorda's player-personnel decisions. Other Dodgers
people were quick to defend Lasorda. They painted this as a rookie
mistake, probably inconsequential in the long run. He'll learn a
valuable lesson about communication.
</P>
<P>
   And Shaw's agent also downplayed the matter by saying of
Lasorda, ``I don't think it's a mistake at all. I think this deal
was going to happen whether he was aware of this particular issue
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else to note in Lasorda's defense: The Basic
Agreement, which brought to a close the 1994-95 baseball strike,
couldn't be much more difficult to fathom if the IRS had written
it.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Sports Illustrated spoofed the legalese of the
player-personnel rules in all the pro sports with a quiz that
began, ``So you think you could run a professional team ... ?''
This was question 26: ``What was the final holdup in the trade that
sent Chuck Knoblauch from the Minnesota Twins to the New York
Yankees for four minor leaguers and $3 million? (a) Any deal
involving $1 million or more is subject to the approval of the
executive council. (b) A major league player who has five years'
experience with the same team can't be traded for a player (or
players) who has no major-league service unless all parties clear
waivers. (c) Knoblauch would deal only with George Constanza.''
Answer: (a).
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's another complication with the Knoblauch deal:
He, like Shaw, can demand a trade this winter. At least the Yankees
knew that before they got him.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda probably will get lucky and none of this will make a
difference. The perception of the trade will rise or fall on the
performances of Shaw, Konerko and Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   But the same oversight under different circumstances could have
spelled disaster. It could have guaranteed that ``interim'' would
never become ``permanent.'' And it would have been too late to
blame Campanis.

SHEFFIELD UNDERGOES NEAR-DEATH REBIRTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield seemingly had it all by the age of
27. There was a batting crown, two All-Star appearances and a big
contract.
</P>
<P>
   What Sheffield didn't have, however, was stability in his
personal life. Among the problems were charges of resisting arrest,
a restraining order against him, abuse accusations and concerns by
Major League Baseball about substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But before things became better, Sheffield's life took a turn
for the worse on Oct. 30, 1995. It fact, it almost was ended.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seemed fine when Sheffield, then with the Florida
Marlins, was driving through his old neighborhood of Belmont
Heights in Tampa, Fla. As his Mercedes reached a crawl near a stop
sign, a teen-ager dressed in a T-shirt and jeans walked up from the
rear of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling comfortable in his old confines, Sheffield thought it
might be a buddy. It was quite the opposite. Sheffield began to
roll down his window when a shot rang out from a .25-caliber gun,
wounding him in the left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The shooting) caused him to ... really look at life in the
long term,'' said Keith Jacobs, Sheffield's longtime friend and
chief operating officer of his companies. ``A lot of people look at
just the moment, (rather) than realize there is much more to life.
I believe he is looking at life through a different set of eyes
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Sheffield began reading the Bible almost daily,
started cutting ties with shady acquaintances and hired a New York
publicist to help reshape his image. And, while his public image
was being restructured, his inner thoughts were being altered by
Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who had met Holyfield previously, became reacquainted
with the heavyweight boxing champion during the 1997 All-Star break
in Cleveland. Soon after, Sheffield had a phone conversation with
Holyfield, a deeply religious man, about building faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradually, (Holyfield) was doing all the talking. And then he
just cut the conversation off and said he had to go train,'' said
Sheffield, who came to the Dodgers in a blockbuster seven-player
trade on May 15. ``But I did ask him a couple questions about why
he moved to the Lord. He said it was his only way for peace and
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get into it too much, but I brought it up. I felt
that nobody has to call you to give you messages about the Lord. It
just so happened that the guy that called happened to be in the
Lord. God sends you signs in all kinds of ways, and I thought that
was a sign.''
</P>
<P>
   While others had been whispering into Sheffield's ear about
taking his faith more seriously, hearing it from a fellow sports
star made a much stronger impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary needed to hear that from someone at the same level of
temptation,'' said Jacobs, who has been involved in Christian
ministry for 12 years. ``Money can be the root of all evil. A
person whose face is the same is easier to respect. It carried a
lot of legitimacy. Gary knew (Holyfield) could relate to his
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know in (Sheffield's) society, no one is going to give you
a break. But Holyfield attested to him that none of his physical
treasures can give him what God can.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who will earn $10 million this year, said, ``It
amazes me when celebrities see me and say, `I am a fan of yours. I
like the way you play and swing the bat.' It's like, `You watch
me?' But I watch Evander Holyfield.''
</P>
<P>
   After his conversation with Holyfield, Sheffield said, he became
more serious about his faith. He began having frequent Bible
studies over the phone with Jacobs. He started attending chapel
services before games on Sundays. And he also began to look at his
life in a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looked at me kind of funny,'' Sheffield said of his
first appearance at chapel. ``But I was so deep into it that I
didn't see other people. I was there to hear the word and not to
see who was looking at me. I know I was there to receive a
blessing, take it in and apply it to my life. After coming from
where I come from, that was a big step.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sheffield adopted a new view on life, there were skeptics
in baseball who wouldn't forget about his bad-boy image. When the
four-time All-Star came to Los Angeles, there might have been some
people in the Dodgers organization who wondered whether the
negative reputation was warranted.
</P>
<P>
   But first baseman Eric Karros said he kept an open mind and has
since learned that Sheffield is a positive influence for the
Dodgers, on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you meet somebody for the first time, you may have
some doubt,'' Karros said. ``But I form my own opinion and I never
go with what is said, written or reported. From my experiences, he
is a great guy to have on the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield admits he used to have an I-don't-care attitude. He
didn't have much respect for the media and many people in baseball,
many of whom he believed treated him unfairly. He also never
thought fans really cared about him. But with rejuvenated religious
faith came a much different outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows where he comes from and that he has been given a
pretty good walk in this life,'' said Dodgers utility man Jim
Eisenreich, who came over from Florida with Sheffield in the trade.
``He's respecting that and he is not taking for granted what has
been given to him. You can tell when you have a conversation with
him that he is very spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure (many people) would be surprised about (my
spirituality),'' said Sheffield, 29, who often wears a cross on his
silver necklace. ``But while the negative stuff was going on, I was
praying for people who were talking bad about me. When I look back
on everything that has happened bad towards me, I've been blessed
twice for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say I'm not worth anything and I'm getting double what
they say I'm worth. I've overcome all the odds. And the only way I
have done that is because God is looking out for me.''

KLASSEN ALREADY OPENING EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Diamondbacks Assistant General Manager Sandy Johnson
has a saying: ``You can't mess up the good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, in Danny Klassen, it appears that the Diamondbacks have
one of the good ones. Who knows, Klassen could even wind up being
one of the rare great ones.
</P>
<P>
   While it's far too early to talk about Klassen and greatness
together _ which may very well be there _ it is not too early to
talk about the future of the Diamondbacks, of which Klassen is
being counted on as a big piece of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   With Klassen all but up from the minors for good, joining first
baseman Travis Lee, Matt Williams at third and Jay Bell at
shortstop, the club will display its infield for the next five
years throughout the final 70-odd games.
</P>
<P>
   Only one questions looms: When do Klassen and Bell swap
positions? It is inevitable that the younger and more agile
Klassen, who doesn't turn 23 for another two months, will be moved
to shortstop with Bell, 32, switching to second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows, eventually they may switch us,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   The bet is that the switch will take place during spring
training next year, allowing each to be comfortable with each other
and the switch. It's a scenario Bell, realizing the club will be
better in the long run, is aware of and will not fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great option to be able to think about,'' General
Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``Jay is such a pro, he'll do
whatever helps the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Klassen has already generated a small fan club among his new
teammates, who remember being impressed with the natural shortstop
during his stay with the big-league club during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``You root for a guy like this,'' Andy Benes said. ``He reminds
me of Travis Lee. He's low key, and nothing really phases him.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Klassen looks the part of a big-leaguer. Even when
he's standing still, he looks like he belongs. It's a gift some are
simply born with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch his actions and the way he handles himself and you
realize the kid's got a chance to stay here for a long time,'' Bell
said. ``He's certainly in a position to be a solid everyday and
reliable player. He's one of those guys that you'll look at in 10
years and ask him, `Are you going to manage?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Funny. Those are the exact kind of statements that were made
about Bell when he broke into the majors in the late 1980s. As it
turns out, there's an awful lot of Bell in Klassen, which can be
viewed only as a very good thing for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works very hard, and whatever weaknesses he perceives about
himself, he relentlessly works at getting rid of them,'' Manager
Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen has few weaknesses. His defense, which came into
question after making 50 errors at Double-A El Paso last season,
has been nothing short of brilliant since being called up. Don't
forget, he's been playing second base for less than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen made a spectacular play on a grounder to his left
Saturday night. Looking very much like perennial Gold Glove winner
Roberto Alomar, Klassen slid to his knees, snagged the grounder and
flipped to Lee for the out at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, Milwaukee Brewers General Manager Sal Bando is
hitting his head against a wall. It was Bando who decided to leave
Klassen exposed in the expansion draft not once, but twice. Barely
able to believe their good fortune, the Diamondbacks picked Klassen
with their fifth pick in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting side note, then-Brewers owner Bud Selig walked
up to Bando at the Brewers' conference table after the second round
and the two had a lengthy discussion. You can bet Klassen's name
was mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, heck, even somewhat publicly, the Diamondbacks are
gushing over Klassen's potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``That they consider me this kind of player thrills me,'' said
Klassen, who has shed the No. 65 he wore in spring training for No.
7. ``It's an honor to be mentioned in the same sentence as Travis
Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Get used to it, kid. It's going only going to continue. &QL;

BONILLA MOVES TO LEFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The kid has pushed the 35-year-old veteran to the
outfield. And if it helps the Dodgers, that is just fine with Bobby
Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night against visiting San Diego, rookie Adrian Beltre
received his first start at third base since Bonilla, the usual
third baseman, came off the 15-day disabled list on July 3. The
last time Bonilla, who started in left field Saturday, played in
the outfield was Sept. 28, 1996, for Baltimore at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being sent to the outfield because of a 20-year-old,
Bonilla revealed no animosity about the change. Ironically, Dodgers
manager Glenn Hoffman previously said Bonilla was too big to play
left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a third baseman .. I'm a left fielder ... I'm player. It
doesn't matter,'' said Bonilla. ``It doesn't matter where I play as
long as we win. This kid is good and he can help us. I told Hoff to
put me wherever he needs me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla's stint in left didn't last long, however. He was thrown
out of the game in the second inning by home-plate umpire Bill Hohn
for arguing a called second strike. Beltre had a rough first
inning. He had a throwing error to home plate that helped the
Padres score two runs and he was also thrown out at the plate at
the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre has probably the best throwing arm in the organization
next to Raul Mondesi, has above-average tools and was ranked as the
third-best prospect by Baseball America entering the season. He
batted second Saturday and entered the game batting .308 over his
previous six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what is best for the ballclub,'' said Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon a no-show: Since new Dodgers pitcher Brian Bohanon was
not put on the roster before the game, he was not in uniform.
However, the left-hander, who was traded from the New York Mets for
reliever Greg McMichael on Friday, will be activated in time to
start against the Padres this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers pitcher Dave Mlicki, who was Bohanon's teammate with the
Mets, said the Dodgers' new fifth starter has four or five pitches
and usually throws in the middle 80s. Bohanon (2-4, 3.15) has made
only four starts this season and has never been a consistent
starter in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bohanon) will give us a chance to win a lot of games,''
Mlicki said. ``I have no idea whether he is a better reliever or
starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggs checked: Dodgers second-base prospect Adam Riggs, who is
out for the season with torn cartilage in his right shoulder, had a
positive examination at Dodger Stadium on Saturday. Riggs, who was
ranked as the Dodgers' seventh-best prospect by Baseball America,
said he expects to start throwing again in four months and playing
in six. He also plans to play winter ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the first two weeks (after surgery), I couldn't tie my
shoes,'' said Riggs, 24, who had surgery June 2. ``I never felt so
helpless. It makes you appreciate having two arms.''

NEAR-ABORTION WAS SECOND INCIDENT FOR DOCTOR
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS and SUSIE STECKNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
PHOENIX _ The doctor who two weeks ago delivered a baby he was
trying to abort was admonished by the state medical board eight
years ago for trying to abort another full-term infant.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Records also reveal that the Phoenix abortion clinic where the
baby was born, the A-Z Women's Center, has been the subject of
several lawsuits and at least seven allegations before the Arizona
Board of Medical Examiners.
</P>
<P>
   The June 30 attempted abortion has added fuel to the national
debate over late-term abortions and prompted investigations by
police, prosecutors, and the board.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990 case, the medical board scolded Dr. John Biskind for
trying to abort a full-formed baby he said he thought was just 10
weeks old.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old mother had told Biskind that she had her last
menstrual cycle about a month earlier, and she didn't appear to be
pregnant because she was seriously overweight, according to board
testi mony.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind told the board that as he began suction during the
procedure, he realized he was drawing too much fluid and stopped.
He ob served the woman for the rest of the day, then sent her home
with antibiotics. She delivered the baby hours later.
</P>
<P>
   The board faulted Biskind for misdiagnosing the pregnancy and
sending the woman home instead of to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley said that he had not heard
of the 1990 case but that his office would look into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course that would be rele vant to our investigation. We
would want to look at the pattern of his practice,'' Romley said
from his home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Romley added that he has heard from officials and citizens all
over the country but won't let the politics of the case determine
whether he charges Biskind with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key, we feel, to this one, is just to keep it as objective
as possible,'' Romley said.
</P>
<P>
   No one from the medical board could be reached for comment
Saturday. A woman who answered an Ohio number for Biskind said he
wasn't available, and a woman who answered the phone at the A-Z
clinic on Saturday refused to com ment.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic has also taken some shots from the medical board.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Moshe Hachamovitch, the president of the A-Z Women's Center,
in 1992 received a letter of concern from the board for failing to
adequately document the age of a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The board also issued a letter of concern in 1991 for failure to
file fetal death certificates. No other details were available
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Hachamovitch has medical licenses in Texas, Massa
chusetts and Pennsylvania as well as in Arizona. He had a license
in Nevada, but it was suspended be cause he did not renew it, the
board there said.
</P>
<P>
   The case that sparked the current firestorm took place on June
30, when Biskind delivered a 6-pound, 2-ounce girl while performing
an abortion on what he thought was a 23-week-old fetus, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the child suffered skull fractures and deep
lacerations from the procedure. She shows no signs of brain damage
and will be adopted by a Texas couple, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical board has reportedly asked witnesses for sworn
testimony and documents and is considering holding an emergency
hearing to revoke Biskind's license.
</P>
<P>
   It is illegal, under Arizona law, to perform an abortion on a
viable fetus, unless it is ``necessary to preserve the life or
health of the woman.'' The statue says a doctor needs to have a
written statement justifying such a procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Biskind has per formed two abortions on Arizona
women who bled to death. He was censured in 1995 for one death, and
the medical board is still investigat ing the other, which occurred
in April.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind graduated from an Ohio medical school in 1954 and still
holds a license in that state. A spokesman for the board there
refused to say whether or not Ohio officials were investigating the
doc tor.
</P>
<P>
   He also holds a California li cense. Officials in that state
said they are taking no disciplinary action against him. &QL;

LABOR KEY TO SELIG'S FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bud Selig was criticized for being indecisive during his six
years as acting commissioner of baseball. Now that he has accepted
the job full-time, Selig's legacy will come down to one issue:
labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are other problems _ interleague play,
realignment, revenue sharing. But baseball was devastated by the
1994 job action and knows it cannot absorb another financial and
public-relations pounding.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is the question how Selig, who owns the Milwaukee
Brewers, can provide an even hand in baseball matters when he
answers to other owners. Too many teams took a hit during the
strike to let that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot more contact and cooperation,'' said
Donald Fehr, director of the Major League Players Association.
``Memories are still sharp enough to make everyone a little
cautious, but I certainly think there's a much greater possibility
of a better relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he will spend most of his time in Milwaukee, Selig has
savvy major-league president Paul Beeston working the room in New
York. Beeston is the former president of the Toronto Blue Jays, who
appeared at one time to be a front-runner for the job Selig now
has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not underestimate the presence of Paul Beeston in the
future of baseball,'' Yankees owner George Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's best ally, however, might be baseball itself. Fans are
turned on by the home run chases and thinking much more about the
possibility of players they know breaking Roger Maris'
single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is only one decent division race, although Tom
Lasorda would beg to differ. But with four players and possibly
more taking a swing at Maris' mark, late-season attendance could
stay strong. Mark McGwire's St. Louis Cardinals are well out of the
NL Central race, but most of September is sold out at Busch
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   THE UNTOUCHABLES
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be only three players who the Orioles would be
absolutely unwilling to trade: Mike Mussina, Scott Erickson and Cal
Ripken. B.J. Surhoff probably is untouchable, too, but he remains
unsigned for next year. He is very well-liked in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Armando Benitez and left-hander Arthur Rhodes also would
be hard to acquire. Everyone else is available.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Rafael Palmeiro would figure to be next in line
behind Roberto Alomar leaving Baltimore unless progress is made
toward a contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   After being cool on signing Palmeiro all season, the Orioles are
looking at his recent hot streak and now talking with agent Jim
Bronner. Predicted price: Four years at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday, Palmeiro is batting .327 with 11 homers and
27 RBI in his past 26 games. Despite the production, Palmeiro might
not find much of a market at the end of the season. There are a lot
of teams with power-hitting first basemen.
</P>
<P>
   It could be hard to get five years at $10 million per out there,
but you never know. Last year, the Red Sox gave Pedro Martinez $75
million when no team had awarded a contract for more than $60
million to that point.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, however, might find themselves in a philosophical
bind. They have had an unwritten rule that no one can make more
than Ripken, who is earning $7 million this season. Baltimore might
have to pay Palmeiro $8.5 million per year to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF PEDRO
</P>
<P>
   Martinez improved to 11-2, holding his ex-team, Montreal, and
the pitcher for whom he was traded, Carl Pavano, to two hits over
six innings in a 15-0 win recently. Martinez said he's happy in his
first season in Boston, but not as happy as he could be. ``I'm not
as happy as I thought I was going to be,'' Martinez told a group of
reporters, the majority of them members of the Montreal media. ``I
have a great team behind me. I'm playing for a great town _ a
little bit pushy sometimes _ very pushy sometimes,'' he said. ``I'm
doing my job. I'm having fun with the team. But I thought it was
going to be a bit different in some ways. But I'm not concerned.
I'm not regretting it. I'm fine here.''
</P>
<P>
   Come again?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some personal things _ personal life off the field _
that's a little bit hard for me,'' he said. ``I'm used to a little
bit more privacy. It's a little hard.... I wouldn't say (Boston) is
difficult to live in. Boston is a very polite city. At least where
I live (Cambridge).''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez declined to get specific but indicated the intensity of
the fans is more than he anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I didn't expect was to have it in every game I stepped
out there,'' Martinez said. ``That was kind of a little surprise. I
thought they would understand that in some games I would have to
give it up and some games would go wrong. They don't take any of
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very demanding. Believe me, the first ones to let you
know will be them. I hope that I can have every game from now on
(be) a nine-inning perfect game, where I can please everybody. But
I know it's not going to be that way, so I'm ready for my little
boos whenever I give up more than three (runs).''
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested that Martinez should not take the scrutiny so
personally _ that most fans ``love'' Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say that,'' Martinez said. ``They `love' me only
until I screw it up out there. You have to go out there and give it
up and see how much they love you. I think they love me when I'm
doing my job. If I'm not doing my job, they don't love me nothing.
It's the way the fans are here. Bill Buckner cannot step in Boston.
He can't come back to Boston. They hate him forever.... It's going
to be hard for a city like this that eats and sleeps baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CLASS OF '98
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's Ben Grieve, the most impressive offensive rookie in
the American League this year (.311, 12 homers, 55 RBI), and Tampa
Bay pitcher Rolando Arrojo (10-5, 3.06) were the only ones to make
the All-Star team from this year's potent rookie class.
</P>
<P>
   But Grieve, 22, and Arrojo, 29, are likely to have company in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie class of '98 also includes such talents as the Reds'
Sean Casey, Mike Frank and Paul Konerko, Detroit third baseman Gabe
Alvarez and fire-balling reliever Matt Anderson, Dodgers third
baseman Adrian Beltre, Arizona first baseman Travis Lee, Colorado
first baseman Todd Helton, Florida first baseman Derek Lee, Chicago
White Sox outfielder Magglio Ordonez and Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry
Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played against most of those guys in the minors,'' Grieve
said. ``It's nice to watch and see how they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all those youngsters are playing well right now, but they're
all expected to put up big numbers. The question: Will this go down
as one of the best recent rookie classes?
</P>
<P>
   ``It just depends how everyone does,'' Grieve said. ``If Kerry
Wood lives up to everything, it'll be remembered just for him.''
</P>
<P>
   DON'T TINKER WITH BELLE
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox's Albert Belle said last week he will use his
no-trade clause to scuttle any potential trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (manager) Jerry Manuel, `I'm going down with the ship,'
'' Belle said. ``I made a choice to play for the Sox, and I'll do
that until the end of the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem? Belle's contract has a no-trade clause only through
1998. Belle can be traded after this season. He also needs only one
more player to sign a long-term contract (three years or more)
worth $11 million a year and he can demand the last-place White Sox
give him a raise or let him become a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Belle says he'll try to make the best of this miserable
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much (resigned to) suffering through this year,''
he said. ``I wasn't really projecting a rebuilding process, but
you've probably got to give it three years. You have to find guys
and run them out every day and let them learn from experience.''
</P>
<P>
   FIRST AND LAST?
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel said Tuesday's All-Star game might be his ``first
and last'' since young shortstops Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter and
Nomar Garciaparra figure to dominate the league for years.
</P>
<P>
   So Vizquel wanted to make his trip special. He brought a video
camera with him and filmed his own highlight film.
</P>
<P>
   When he got into the cab at the Denver Airport, he turned the
camera on and interviewed the driver. ``I asked him, `What do you
think of Omar Vizquel?' He said, `Who is that?' I was having a
ball. I knew he'd have no clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel interviewed his AL teammates during the home run hitting
contest. He filmed manager Mike Hargrove talking during a team
meeting. He filmed the front desk of the hotel when he was checking
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a ball,'' said Vizquel, who went 1 for 2 and started a
neat double play to get the AL out of trouble in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he picked Vizquel over Garciaparra, Hargrove
said, ``To me, he's the best shortstop to ever play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vizquel, ``That was nice. He's seen me for five years. Him
saying that overwhelmed me.''

 600 DARE TO RUN WITH THE BULLS  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESQUITE, Nev. _ The testosterone-charged crowd of young males
had been drinking for hours, some for days, in anticipation of the
big moment when man would finally run with bull on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   The samba beat emanating from the loudspeakers at Oasis Ranch
gave way to more than 100 decibels of Van Halen's ``Running With
the Devil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good day to DIE, huh?'' screamed promoter Phil
Immordino into the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   That was greeted with a roar as hundreds of clenched fists
pumped skyward into Saturday's broiling desert air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me at them,'' gushed one bearded man who was seen minutes
before taunting the penned cattle, prodding one animal &UR; that had
3-foot horns to charge into the corral siding. He took one final
gulp of beer and headed off for the starting line.
</P>
<P>
   With all the formalities out of the way, about 600 entrants got
their adrenaline flowing in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   At least, those who tried to run with the bulls straight down
the 40-foot-wide corridor over a quarter-mile course. The bulls had
been conditioned for a month to sprinting down the corridor, for
which they received generous amounts of hay in a corral near the
finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the bull-running In the first heat, 12 bulls were
released at the same time. Only a handful of runners felt the need
to evade them by climbing the retaining fence.
</P>
<P>
   In the second heat, the promoters of Running of the Bulls
America Inc. mixed it up a bit by turning loose three different
groups, seven bulls at a time, which caught many of the runners off
guard.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the heats, a man zigged to the middle, right in front
of the second group of animals, and got trampled underfoot near the
midpoint of the run. The unidentified man suffered possible broken
ribs and numerous cuts and bruises. He was treated and released at
a Mesquite clinic, run promoters said.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of about a dozen people fell in a pile and a cloud
of dust, but the bulls ran around them. In all, three participants
were hospitalized or treated at the scene for injuries. Forty-one
spectators had to be treated for heat-related illnesses,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had us at their mercy,'' said Craig Williams, a Las Vegas
disc jockey, who was a wearing a hard hat with a camera lens taped
to the top of it. ``We were all down on the ground. It should make
great video.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he is very fortunate that the bulls weren't of the
fierce Iberian breeds that are used in the Running of the Bulls in
Pamplona, Spain, which this event was modeled after. Organizers
used a cross of Brahman and Angus breeds, which see service on the
rodeo circuits. Runners said that none of the bulls actually
charged after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulls looked like they were afraid of us,'' said Chris
Wahl of Las Vegas, who was near the release point on the first run.
``They went back in the pen and had to be prodded out by the
cowboys. They really weren't any problem in getting out of the way
since when they finally did get going they made a beeline to the
feed area.''
</P>
<P>
   John Ingalls of Las Vegas, at 66 the oldest man in the race,
said the fact that he has lost more than a few steps almost cost
him big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a group of five bulls that went right by me and I
got a touch out of one of them,'' said Ingalls, who said he
competes in marathons and runs 10 miles a day. ``It was a little
too close for comfort. But this is definitely a day I will never
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the bull-running event, Mohave County deputies
arrested Immordino, who organized the event.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities tried to cite Immordino, 40, of Phoenix, for failing
to obtain a use permit for the special event, a misdemeanor.
Immordino refused to sign the citation and was booked into jail in
Mesquite, Nev., police said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of animal rights groups who monitored the event said
running with the bulls is something they would like to forget. They
said they hope that it doesn't increase in popularity. Event
organizers and Mohave County sheriff's deputies estimated that
about 6,000 people attended the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing was just ridiculous. It's for thrill seekers who
must really have boring lives,'' said Jane Garrison of People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals. ``But at least they didn't use
electrical shock on the bulls when they were so terrified of the
crowd at first.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Pacelle of the Humane Society said the bull run is far
from the cruelest thing involving animals that he has witnessed but
``it's definitely the stupidest thing I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in Pamplona, there's a tradition attached to it,''
Pacelle said. ``Here, this thing is pure hucksterism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Lansford, a co-promoter of the event, said that
Mesquite's Running of the Bulls won't be going away any time soon.
He said Lansford said his group signed a five-year contract with
Mesquite and plans to honor it. &QL;

PADRES BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After the boys in Dodger blue became frustrated
with the men in blue, they never found a way to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's game against San Diego wasn't even two innings
old before Bobby Bonilla was thrown out after his teammates had
previously showed some frustration with the umpires. And while the
Dodgers lost their cool, the National League West Division-leading
Padres stayed calm during a 4-1 win in front of 48,950 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped a two-game winning streak for the Dodgers and
pushed them 12{ games behind the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires began to made their presence known to the Dodgers in
the first inning. The Dodgers thought San Diego leadoff hitter
Steve Finley was out after Eric Karros went wide to pick up his
ground ball and feed it to Ismail Valdes getting over to first base
late. First base umpire Angel Hernandez, however, thought
differently to Valdes' chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Ken Caminiti overran first after a single and
Eric Young thought he caught the Padre napping with the relay
throw. Again, Hernandez disagreed and Young showed his
disappointment by saying something to the umpire and then staring
at him.
</P>
<P>
   After Greg Vaughn walked to load the bases, Wally Joyner hit a
grounder to rookie third baseman Adrian Beltre. In trying to get
the easy force at home, Beltre tossed a high throw that tipped off
the top of catcher Charles Johnson's glove and two runs scored to
give San Diego a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried my best to stay on the plate, but the ball just
flipped out of my glove,' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers cut the deficit in half when Karros hit a one-out
homer off All-Star Andy Ashby in the second inning. Karros, who had
only three extra base hits in his previous 51 at-bats, reached just
the nine home run mark this season when he hit the ball into the
left field seats.
</P>
<P>
   But right when the Dodgers seemed to be on their way back, a
very questionable call ruined the momentum and sent Bonilla to the
showers. Following Karros' home run, the left-handed batting
Bonilla became livid when home plate umpire Bill Hohn called a
second strike on a pitch that appeared to be about a foot outside.
After they exchanged words, Hohn threw Bonilla out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The disgruntled Bonilla then met Hohn face to face before being
restrained by manager Glenn Hoffman. While Hoffman was arguing with
Bonilla, three Dodgers coaches had to restrain him from getting to
Hohn. As he departed, Bonilla tossed his shin-guard a few feet
short of Hohn and then threw some catcher shin-guards on to the
field when he was in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey guys, write what you saw,' a much calmer Bonilla dressed
in street clothes told reporters outside the Dodgers clubhouse
before visiting with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Hohn declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby was upset,'' said Hoffman. ``I just tried to keep them
apart. It was over the called strikes. I was glad to see (coaches
Mike) Scioscia and (Mickey) Hatcher out there. Bonilla's a strong
guy.'
</P>
<P>
   From then on, the Dodgers never seemed to locate any type of
spark and went the remainder of the game scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 3-1 lead in the fifth when Finley's RBI single
off Valdes scored Chris Gomez. And in the sixth, the Padres went up
4-1 on a Joyner RBI double off Valdes that scored Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (6-9) lost his second straight game and allowed four runs
(three earned) on six hits in six innings. The right-hander, who
dropped to 4-2 at home this season, is just 2-4 in his last nine
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was superb as he allowed just Karros' homer, four hits and
struck out four in eight innings. And after Ashby left, he was
followed by All-Star closer Trevor Hoffman, the younger brother of
the Dodgers' manager.
</P>
<P>
   The NL save leader finished off his sibling's squad by striking
out three of the four batters to earn save No. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The game also fittingly ended with Hohn calling Karros out
looking at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to pick him apart to see if I could tip his
pitches,'' said the elder Hoffman about his brother. ``I haven't
seen him up close in a long time.''

   &UR; BENJAMIN'S CROSSING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jay Parini. Owl/Holt, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This elegant biographical novel probes the life, death and
paradoxical character of the social critic Walter Benjamin, who was
both the beneficiary and the victim of the theorist's exile from
reality before his suicide in 1940. ``Parini's story is at once
painstakingly researched and dramatically recounted,'' Robert
Grudin wrote in the Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WHOLE SHEBANG: A STATE-OF-THE-UNIVERSE(S) REPORT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Timothy Ferris. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14.
</P>
<P>
   As the title suggests, the author of this arresting status
report on cosmology, which was selected by the editors of the Book
Review as one of the best books of 1997, has a lot on his mind.
Starting with the Big Bang theory and finishing with reflections on
God and humanity's role in the grand scheme of things, he works on
a breathtakingly wide canvas, offering chapters on everything from
the shape of space, the riddle of dark matter, quantum weirdness
and the inflation of the universe and all that implies. ``A skilled
and experienced popular writer, Ferris serves as one of the best
guides for the curious reader,'' Owen Gingerich wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNTOUCHABLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By John Banville. Vintage International, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of this antic hall-of-mirrors novel, which explores
the compulsive appeal of communism for Britain's upper classes in
the 1930s, is based on the distinguished art historian Anthony
Blunt, who was named as a Soviet spy during the Thatcher years.
``Contemporary fiction gets no better than this ... extraordinary
book,'' Patrick McGrath said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAN CRAZY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Joyce Carol Oates. Abrahams/Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid Boone is a sociopathic serial victim who is dehumanized
by a satanic motorcycle cult and its monstrously charismatic
leader. The violence in this perverse coming-of-age novel is
unrelenting, but ``there is no gainsaying the effectiveness of
Oates's writing,'' A.O. Scott wrote in these pages last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR: A MEMOIR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Doris Kearns Goodwin. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $13.
</P>
<P>
   The author recalls her feisty girlhood in the prefeminist,
prosperous 1950s on Long Island, and how she grew up in love with
both her family and the Brooklyn Dodgers. ``For
self-esteem-building female role models, for baseball lore and
inning-by-inning action and for a lively trip into the recent
American past, you could hardly do better,'' Ann Hulbert said here
last year. A classic account of those same Dodgers,  &UR; THE BOYS OF
SUMMER &LR; , by Roger Kahn (Harper Perennial, $15), has been reissued
with a new epilogue by the author, who covered the team when the
lineup boasted guys with names like Reese, Robinson and Hodges. In
1972 our reviewer, Grace Lichtenstein, called this ``a very stylish
piece of '50s nostalgia that puts us back in touch with our
heroes.'' In  &UR; CREATING THE NATIONAL PASTIME: BASEBALL TRANSFORMS
ITSELF, 1903-1953 &LR; , by G. Edward White (Princeton University,
$14.95), a historian describes the various factors -- including the
fortunate foolishness of many team owners -- that turned a marginal
urban sport into a national institution. In 1996 in these pages,
George F. Will praised the author as ``an affectionate but
agreeably dry-eyed student of the game.'' Meanwhile, down on the
field, the player who broke Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130
consecutive games played reveals a refreshingly old-fashioned,
team-spirited attitude in  &UR; THE ONLY WAY I KNOW &LR; , by Cal Ripken Jr.
and Mike Bryan (Penguin, $12.95). ``Cal Ripken provides one of the
best reasons for even the most jaded fan to keep on rooting,''
Diane Cole wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FALLING BOY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Long. Plume, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   When a young carpenter marries one of four sisters in a small
town in postwar Montana, he unwittingly adds fuel to a smoldering
sibling rivalry with disastrous results. The author of this ``love
poem for an era, a place and a people'' displays a ``calm capacity
for warmth and gentle humor,'' Robert Houston said here last year.
Big Sky country is also the setting for  &UR; NOTCHES &LR; , by Peter Bowen
(St. Martin's, $5.50), the latest mystery featuring the brooding
lawman Gabriel Du Pre, who here tracks down a couple of serial
killers who may have murdered thousands of young women over a
20-year period. Last year in these pages, Marilyn Stasio called
this a ``mesmerizing series ... informed by Western legend, steeped
in Indian superstition.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SISTERS IN ARMS: CATHOLIC NUNS THROUGH TWO MILLENNIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jo Ann Kay McNamara. Harvard University, $18.95.
</P>
<P>
   This mammoth history is both a lament for the sad state of women
in religious orders over the centuries and a positive record of
their formidable achievements in administration, nursing and
education. The result is an ``engrossing and challenging work,''
Antonia Fraser wrote in the Book Review in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAIL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mameve Medwed. Warner, $11.99.
</P>
<P>
   Katinka O'Toole is a youngish wannabe writer living alone in
Cambridge, Mass., whose spirits are lifted when a handsome new
mailman takes over delivery of her rejected short stories. Last
year our reviewer, Fran Handman, called this an ``off-the-wall
sendup of the take-charge-of-your-life novel.''

 &HT;    COCA-COLA SALES IN ISRAEL DROP AFTER COMPLAINTS OF FOUL SMELLS
IN BOTTLES
 &HT;    Moving in both the (I) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A few bad-smelling, family-sized Coca-Cola bottles,
along with confusing warnings from health officials, caused sales
of the popular soft drink to plummet throughout Israel this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli bottler of Coca-Cola recalled about 30,000 of its
plastic, 1.5 liter bottles and saw daily sales drop by about 25
percent in recent days, after four members of the same Israeli
family complained that a foul-smelling bottle of Coca-Cola had made
them ill on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The family was treated at a hospital and released within about
two hours, but Israeli health officials found about 15 bottles from
the same store that smelled of paint thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the bottles were stored near paint products
which corroded the plastic and soaked into the drink.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Health Ministry Friday said the soft drink was safe,
but another consumer at a different store later complained of a
foul-smelling bottle. It is not clear whether or not the consumer
became sick from the soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in the ministry Saturday advising consumers to
smell the family-sized bottles before drinking -- advice that made
the front pages of local newspapers. In addition, an Israeli
consumer group called on consumers not to buy the soft drink until
the end of a health ministry investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday afternoon, the health ministry released a statement
saying that Coca-Cola was safe to drink. And a health official, on
Israeli television, acknowledged the confusion surrounding the
ministry's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, it's not the Coca-Cola plant,'' said Yair
Nechmad, marketing manager for Central Bottling, the Israeli
Coca-Cola bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Nechmad said the cause of the second incident was not yet known,
but the traces of foreign chemicals in the soft drink were lower
than standards approved for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The company sells about 300 million of the 1.5 liter bottles a
year in Israel, a country of just 6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has enjoyed a favored status here. It continued
selling in Israel throughout the years that Arab countries
boycotted companies doing business in a country they refused to
recognize. Now, the boycott is over and both Coca-Cola, and rival
Pepsi, products are on the market.

 &HT;    COCA-COLA SALES IN ISRAEL DROP AFTER COMPLAINTS OF FOUL SMELLS
IN BOTTLES
 &HT;    Moving in both the (I) International and (f) Financial
categories.

   JERUSALEM _ A few bad-smelling, family-sized Coca-Cola bottles,
along with confusing warnings from health officials, caused sales
of the popular soft drink to plummet throughout Israel this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli bottler of Coca-Cola recalled about 30,000 of its
plastic, 1.5 liter bottles and saw daily sales drop by about 25
percent in recent days, after four members of the same Israeli
family complained that a foul-smelling bottle of Coca-Cola had made
them ill on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The family was treated at a hospital and released within about
two hours, but Israeli health officials found about 15 bottles from
the same store that smelled of paint thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the bottles were stored near paint products
which corroded the plastic and soaked into the drink.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Health Ministry Friday said the soft drink was safe,
but another consumer at a different store later complained of a
foul-smelling bottle. It is not clear whether or not the consumer
became sick from the soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in the ministry Saturday advising consumers to
smell the family-sized bottles before drinking -- advice that made
the front pages of local newspapers. In addition, an Israeli
consumer group called on consumers not to buy the soft drink until
the end of a health ministry investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday afternoon, the health ministry released a statement
saying that Coca-Cola was safe to drink. And a health official, on
Israeli television, acknowledged the confusion surrounding the
ministry's advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any case, it's not the Coca-Cola plant,'' said Yair
Nechmad, marketing manager for Central Bottling, the Israeli
Coca-Cola bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Nechmad said the cause of the second incident was not yet known,
but the traces of foreign chemicals in the soft drink were lower
than standards approved for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   The company sells about 300 million of the 1.5 liter bottles a
year in Israel, a country of just 6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has enjoyed a favored status here. It continued
selling in Israel throughout the years that Arab countries
boycotted companies doing business in a country they refused to
recognize. Now, the boycott is over and both Coca-Cola, and rival
Pepsi, products are on the market.

   ISRAEL-COKE _ JERUSALEM _ Is it the real thing? That's what a
Coca-Cola bottler here is trying to determine. The bottler urged
Israelis on Sunday to ``drink without fear'' despite the recall of
100,000 bottles following the discovery of chemical traces in the
soft drink in two towns. Central Bottling Co Inc began removing the
1-1/2-litre bottles of Coke from shops last week and Israel's
Health Ministry urged the public on Saturday to sniff-test the
bottles for possible contamination. The Israeli bottler insisted
its products and factories were safe. Moshe Wertheim, president of
Central Bottling, told army radio that an investigation would
determine whether the chemicals had seeped through the plastic
bottles because of improper storage or care. He said police were
also investigating the cause. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). EDs: To
move by 3 p.m. EDT.

   FLAFIRES-LOOKBACK _ In 1989, state foresters visited the woody
lots of Palm Coast and asked its residents: exactly how afraid of
wildfire are you? Going door to door, they handed out 200 surveys
to homes most likely to burn if a blaze broke out. Only 94 bothered
to answer. The survey came just four years after a deadly wildfire
season killed two firefighters, burned 443,816 acres and destroyed
131 houses in Palm Coast, a subdivision carved out of forests in
rural Flagler County. Less than half quizzed even knew about the
fires. So is there a lesson to be learned here? (Staletovich, Palm

   RYANWHITE _ POMPANO BEACH, Fla. _ Jeanne White knuckled a
teardrop from her cheek as she spoke about greed and exploitation.
``They called me greedy, but their homes would buy ten of mine,''
she said. ``There's nobody more greedy than the Steiners.'' White
believes that Joel Steinger and his brother Steven Steiner (who
altered his name) live in ocean-front homes and drive new Mercedes
Benz sedans because they capitalized on the familiar name of her
late teenage son, Ryan White. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)

   US-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had made no secret over the last several
months that they would like to have a summit in the fall. As
Clinton wound down his long trip to China, the word began spreading
that he was leaning toward just such a meeting. After confirming it
on Monday, the White House can expect a wave of criticism from
opponents near the level it received before the China trip. There's
plenty of ammunition: the sickly Russian economy; Kosovo upheaval;
India-Pakistan nuclear race; trade with Iran; NATO expansion; and
space cooperation. Clinton had been awaiting Russia's Parliament to
ratify the SALT II nuclear arms pact, but his decision to go seems
to be aimed at pressuring the Duma into such a ratification vote.

   JOURNAL-IRAN _ TEHRAN, Iran _ These are nervous times in Tehran.
I could sense the difference from my last trip in December, when
reformers were gleeful about the prospects for changing their
fundamentalist nation under newly-elected President Mohammed
Khatami. Now, reformers are channel surfing between World Cup
soccer games and the trial of a popular mayor, accused of
corruption by a justice system run by religious hardliners. Though
Tehran is full of articulate, informed people with a lot to say,
slightly fewer wanted to be quoted this time. The day after
watching a World Cup match with a group of young Iranians, one
called and asked that I not tell anyone I was with them. These
days, hanging out with foreign journalists can be controversial,
especially if the evening in question included cassettes of Western
dance music. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). MOVED.

   NIH _ WASHINGTON _ In the middle of fights over campaign

President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Senate
Republican leaders and congressional Democrats all agree on a

Institutes of Health should be dramatically increased, even doubled
over the next decade. To officials at Emory University in Atlanta,
which hopes to propel itself into one of the top 10 research
institutions in the country during that time, this is welcome news.

passed. Some ads even feature the majestic Capitol dome that for so
many years was viewed as too regal. The ads are the best evidence
thus far of a dramatically changed political climate this year. By

 &HT;    Lesson from Florida fires: Gain isolated success by utilizing
what is known
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In 1989, state foresters visited the
woody lots of Palm Coast and asked its residents: exactly how
afraid of wildfire are you?
</P>
<P>
   Going door to door, they handed out 200 surveys to homes most
likely to burn if a blaze broke out. Only 94 bothered to answer.
Those who did conceded fire was their biggest natural enemy. But
the chance of a fire actually occurring over the next 10 years,
they wagered, was less than fifty-fifty.
</P>
<P>
   The survey came just four years after a deadly wildfire season
killed two firefighters, burned 443,816 acres and destroyed 131
houses in Palm Coast, a subdivision carved out of forests in rural
Flagler County.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half quizzed even knew about the fires.
</P>
<P>
   So is there a lesson to be learned here?
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't take long to forget things,'' said Victor Buckles, a
retired timber man who managed 90,000 acres of forest in Volusia,
St. Johns and Flagler counties for the St. Regis paper company _
now Champion International Corp. _ until retiring in 1996 after 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Memorial Day fires that scorched over
495,000 acres and destroyed or damaged 337 structures, state and
local officials say they'll examine how to better predict, control
and fight wildfires. Technology has improved considerably in the
last decade, with computers to forecast fire and formulas to
determine how it burns. Meteorologists are more accurate and
foresters are getting creative, even using goats to tame their
woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   That said, most _ timber men, firefighters, even the scientists
_ agree wildfire is one force that will never be completely
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nature wants it to burn, it's going to burn,'' said Karen
Terrill, information officer for the Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection in California, the epicenter for wildfires in this
country. ``Nature is more powerful than we are. However, we can
have isolated successes by using what we know works.''
</P>
<P>
   Fires burn because of three elements: fuel, oxygen and heat.
This summer, Florida found itself with an abundance of all.
</P>
<P>
   In a normal year, summer rains help counteract the thousands of
fires ignited by lightning, trash burning and other things. But as
early as April, foresters realized they were in for a tough
wildfire season. The rains hadn't come and the drought index had
climbed to an alarming level in central and north Florida, one
usually reached in August when thunderstorms are more scattered,
said Greg Thayer, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service stationed
at the command center set up for the Florida wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem was something weather forecasters call the
Atlantic ridge, a weather system that typically blankets the state
in spring and leaves in time for June rains, Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   When the ridge persisted, foresters started worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to watch the Atlantic ridge. It would stay for
five, six, eight days and break down, then come back again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Crews with the division of forestry alerted to normal lightning
fires got a special warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (told) field units, out of 15,000 normal lightning strikes,
you're going to get a large percentage that will actually cause a
fire. And we were right,'' Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day weekend, thunderstorms ignited dozens of fires.
Fanned by high winds and feasting on dry vegetation, they streaked
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went instantly into fire threat situations,'' Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Perry area and Osceola and Apalachicola National Forests
burned first and fastest, he said. Waldo came next, forcing the
evacuation of most of the town's 1,000 residents. Then fires in
Brevard, Volusia and Flagler counties intensified, erupting in
fierce blazes that chased more than 70,000 people from their homes
last week, including all of Flagler County.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was with woods and fields so dry, foresters were
getting the worst kinds of fires.
</P>
<P>
   Brush fires spread to woods where thick ground cover created
ladders for fires to climb into trees. Once in the crowns, fighting
the fires is virtually impossible because they create their own
firestorm. The intense heat builds wind that whips the fires
around, one time shooting a fireball across a four-lane divided
highway. Worse, the kinds of pine that fill Florida forests have
highly flammable resins. So sometimes the trees just heat up until
they explode.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters finally got the upper hand this week when winds
died and they had enough trenches dug to contain them. (Fires won't
burn soil stripped of vegetation.) And Saturday, the drought index
finally fell, dropping more than 100 points. At its peak, it was
near dessert level.
</P>
<P>
   Now many want to know what exactly happened.
</P>
<P>
   On some levels, the answer is simple.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, state foresters and timber men set their own winter
fires to rid areas of palmetto shrub, thick layers of pine needles
and other fuel that feed fires. The fires also leave behind
nutrients that help the forests thrive.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy rains in October and November made many fires useless.
In March, Flagler County commissioners authorized state foresters
to burn their county's overgrowth, said county commissioner George
Hanns.
</P>
<P>
   The drought, however, made conditions too dry there and around
the state, Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approval (for burning) was in place, but only for perfect
conditions and we were far from that,'' Hanns said.
</P>
<P>
   The more complicated answer to controlling wildfires is how to
strike a balance in developing a state where fire is a beneficial
part of its ecology.
</P>
<P>
   Before the early 1980s, large tracts of land were routinely
burned, Buckles said. In fact, controlled fires go back to the time
American Indians used it to raze woods for planting or clear out
brush for easier hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Everglades routinely burned every two years and some
forests even evolved to survive fire. Longleaf pine, for example,
concentrates growing its roots during the first five years so it
can survive when leaves are consumed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Civilization, however, has put an end to much burning.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Palm Coast. When ITT purchased the land it was a
42,000-acre managed pine forest. ITT began building roads and
sewers and by 1982 was selling off houses, targeting out of state
buyers, according to the division of forestry study. The area was
planted with pines expected to mature before and during
construction. Before the fires, most were about 30 years old and
had not been thinned. Likewise, most houses had just 30 feet
separating them from heavy, flammable brush.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled fires in the past always prompted complaints from
residents, Hanns said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sunny Florida, they decide they don't want to be
inconvenienced by smoke unless it's from a barbecue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Laws have also become more strict for conducting fires, said
Rep. Kelley Smith, R-Palatka, a timber man for 30 years. Less than
10 percent of the forests once burned now get cleared by fire, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules and regulations have become so stringent and
liability so great that many fear controlled burning. And the cost
has increased,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Private landowners who want to burn their land must be certified
and follow state notification laws of nearby landowners. Foresters
have their own set of complicated guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually write a contract and provide a prescription and we
don't set it if the prescription isn't right,'' said Terrill, of
the California forestry department where 40,000 acres were
intentionally burned last year. Officials in Florida said Saturday
they are still researching the number set here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has to be right and some contracts are many, many
pages long. The first one I saw was 72 pages long,'' she said.
``It's very much a science and if we show up and conditions
changes, the wind, we go home. We don't set it.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are running into difficulty in many places . . . due to air
quality regulations and laws that have been passed for rare and
endangered species,'' Thayer said. ``It's shrinking down our window
of opportunity. You might go out and just in early, early spring,
it's moist and cool and a preferable time, but it's the nesting
time for some animals. What would happen if during the nesting
season of our birds we had those fires? We would have wiped out a
whole year's worth of nesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who helped write legislation in 1992 to ease rules for
burning permits, said legislators will probably look at changing
laws in the aftermath of the Memorial Day fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then (in 1985) the fire was kind of localized in the
Flagler area and it now runs across central Florida, the
Apalachicola Forest and into the Panhandle. So I think more members
of the legislature will have an interest than before. Plus, the
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the cost of fighting the fires has reached $104 million
with damages estimated at $276 million, most due to timber loss.
</P>
<P>
   Hanns said he will suggest hiring more firefighters to help the
nearly all-volunteer brigade in his county that has only 18 paid
members. He also wants brush trucks at every station.
</P>
<P>
   Besides setting fires, there are other ways to protect homes.
The city of Malibu, plagued by severe fires in 1993, keeps a herd
of brush goats that eat star thistle and other thick undergrowth
called chaparral, Terrill said.
</P>
<P>
   California also has strict building regulations in fire-prone
areas that require fire-resistant roofs and guards on chimneys.
Brush must be kept trimmed within 100 feet of houses and trees
planted at least six feet apart. Also, golf courses and parks are
used like moats to protect communities. Herbicides can also be used
to kill brush.
</P>
<P>
   Some western states use roads as barriers to fire, building them
perpendicular to prevailing wind patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest difficulty is putting houses in the middle of
wildlands where fire can and should burn because it is part of the
natural cycle, foresters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, a lot of people just don't think about it,'' said
Dave Tippets, public affairs officer for the U.S. Forest Service's
Rocky Mountain Research Center. ``They buy a home in a beautiful
forest environment, they love the trees and the vegetation and they
don't think what it's going to mean if a fire gets started.''
</P>
<P>
   What it will mean, at least for the next 30 years is a different
environment, Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Without a canopy of trees, different kinds of plants will grow
and young plants will attract more rodents, he said. Forests can be
replanted, but it is difficult and expensive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through this in many parts of the U.S.,'' he said,
``and we have a big job ahead of us.''

 &HT;    Jeanne White responds to greed allegations
 &HT;    By Gary Kane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMPANO BEACH, Fla. _ Jeanne White knuckled a teardrop from her
cheek as she spoke about greed and exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called me greedy, but their homes would buy ten of
mine,'' she said. ``There's nobody more greedy than the Steiners.''
</P>
<P>
   White believes that Joel Steinger and his brother Steven Steiner
(who altered his name) live in ocean-front homes and drive new
Mercedes Benz sedans because they capitalized on the familiar name
of her late teenage son. Ryan White became a young hero during his
struggle to attend school though diagnosed with the human
immunodeficiency virus. He died in 1990 at the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the Steinger brothers evoked the name Ryan
White to solicit cash from good-hearted people and HIV medications
from charitable pharmaceutical companies. They used the image of
the sandy-haired teen in pamphlets and on their internet site.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers promoted their Ryan White Foundation for Medical
Treatment as a new hope for those who couldn't afford the costly
treatments that combat the virus.
</P>
<P>
   They created the foundation to help those treated at Community
Healthcare of Broward, a non-profit clinic founded in 1996 by
Steiner and a few associates. The clinic featured an in-house
pharmacy, Commcare, a for-profit business started by Steinger and a
few backers.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation money paid for medications provided by Commcare to
the clinic's patients, according to Steiner.
</P>
<P>
   A Palm Beach Post investigation revealed last month that
Commcare generated large profits from one type of treatment when it
billed Medicaid and private insurers. The state agency for
Healthcare Administration, which oversees the program, is
investigating some of the pharmacy's bills.
</P>
<P>
   White responded by revoking the Steinger brothers' right to use
the Ryan White name.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers countered by telling area news reporters that they
had decided to drop the Ryan White name because Jeanne White
demanded a $150,000 salary, doubling her compensation. The
foundation had better uses for the money than to provide White a
fatter paycheck, they said.
</P>
<P>
   White felt stung by the remarks, particularly because she
thought of Steiner as a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   She had defended the brothers after The Post revealed in January
that they also worked in the viatical trade _ which promises
investors a profit when they buy into the life insurance policies
of AIDS patients and other terminally-ill people. She also had
overlooked the brothers' past business problems, including a
recently settled lawsuit that accused them of civil racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   To say that her salary demands prompted the Steingers to drop
the Ryan White name from their foundation was nothing but a
smokescreen, White said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the spin they're trying to put on this mess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   White had indeed suggested that her $75,000 salary be doubled.
But she did so after the Steingers urged a merger of their
foundation with the Ryan White Foundation, the Indiana organization
she founded in 1990 with the help of television celebrity Phil
Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was going to double my work, I felt I should be
compensated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indiana foundation hesitated to move toward a merger
(underscored by the fact that there was never even a link between
the two foundations' web sites on the internet). The proposal
aroused suspicions. After all, the Steinger brothers' foundation
had been using the Ryan White name for only a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of little flags went up,'' White recalled. ``My board
(in Indiana) was requesting a lot of things, like financial
information, and getting nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana board wondered what the Florida foundation did with
its money, she said. Board members also were confused about
Commcare and who profited from its operation. Steiner eventually
produced an impressive financial report, White said. But it
prompted other questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wondered how Steven could live in such a big house and say
that he didn't take a salary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Steiner co-owns a home with his friend Henry Fecker III
that sold for $530,000 in 1996. His brother Joel, whose name seldom
appears on financial documents, lives in a beach-front home owned
by the Oceanfront Revocable Trust. The trustee is Michael McNerney,
an attorney who represented the brothers' foundation, clinic and
viatical business. The home sold for $617,500 in 1996, according to
Broward County records.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, White was often troubled by the brothers' criticism
of the Indiana foundation and their obsession with raising money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pitched a story about how much money there is out
there,'' she said. ``I think money is the only thing the Steiners
think about.''
</P>
<P>
   White said she was embarrassed by some of the methods used by
the Florida foundation to solicit support. Olympic champion Greg
Louganis and actress Judith Light, who played Jeanne White in the
television movie about Ryan, were among several celebrities angered
by letters they received from the foundation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea they were sending out those letters. They were
using pressure tactics. I was very upset,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   She also had to soothe the outrage of several prominent AIDS
researchers who learned that their names were being used in
magazine ads promoting the Community Healthcare of Broward clinic.
The researchers had agreed only to lend their names in support of
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Doing business with the Steingers seemed like a good idea when
she signed a contract with them in 1996, White said. They were
paying the Indiana foundation $5,000 a month for the right to use
the Ryan White name, she said. And the influx of cash was welcome.
The Indiana foundation had been struggling financially for the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped us a lot, although they didn't like paying the money
to us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida group also offered the Ryan White Foundation a
chance to grow. The Indiana organization, which focuses on
educating youth about HIV, hoped to open offices in clinics the
Steingers planned to open nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made a lot of promises,'' Whites said. ``I was snowed a
lot of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, White planted a for-sale sign in the front lawn of
her Pompano Beach residence, a comfortable house with a backyard
pool overlooking the fleet of pleasure boats parked behind other
homes lining the nearby canal. She bought the home for $192,600 a
year ago after refinancing the family residence in Indiana, she
said. It allowed her to keep an eye on the Florida foundation, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   White doubts the Florida venture will damage the reputation of
the Ryan White Foundation in Indiana. But she views her experience
with the Steinger brothers as a painful lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very careful now about what I put my faith and trust in,''
she said.

   Barbara Eden, who played the mischievous genie on the
long-running TV series ``I Dream of Jeannie,'' is blinking her way
back onto television by appearing in commercials for Lexus and Old
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The spot promoting the 1999 Lexus RX 300 for the Lexus division
of Toyota Motor Corp. is centered on a heavyset, scruffy
archeologist who discovers a bottle in the sand, then takes it with
him as he travels across the desert in a generic sport utility
vehicle. Ms. Eden, inside the bottle, is tossed and tumbled because
of the vehicle's poor ride, so she blinks and transforms the
generic model into an RX 300 _ and the driver into a handsome hunk.
The spot was created by Team One Advertising in El Segundo, Calif.,
part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial for the Old Navy clothing chain, owned by Gap
Inc., Ms. Eden joins the Old Navy regulars _ Carrie Donovan, the
former fashion editor, and Magic the dog _ in a quirky tale set in
Morocco that includes snake charmers, jugglers, stilt walkers and
dancers. The spot was created in-house.

ADVERTISING: AD GIANT FORMS INTERACTIVE DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A giant agency is forming a division to specialize in
interactive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is Ammirati Puris Lintas, one of four worldwide
networks owned by Interpublic Group of Cos. Ammirati Puris, with
billings estimated at $4.4 billion, has opened a division named APL
Digital, which will seek to harness the new media ``to bring brands
closer to consumers,'' said Martin Puris, the chairman, chief
executive and chief creative officer at Ammirati Puris in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Internet began to assume prominence along Madison
Avenue three or four years ago, it would not be surprising if
people were to ask, to paraphrase a line from an old commercial,
``Ammirati Puris, what took you so long?''
</P>
<P>
   An in-house group, Ammirati Puris Lintas Online, has given the
agency ``interactive capability since the beginning of 1995,'' said
Brian Cauley, president at APL Digital, ``so it's not as if we've
just discovered it.''
</P>
<P>
   But about three weeks ago, he added, the Ammirati Puris
worldwide operating board decided ``to formally set up an Internet
capability and subbrand it as APL Digital.''
</P>
<P>
   APL Digital is the ``first subbrand ever for the Ammirati Puris
Lintas network,'' Cauley said. ``That's an indication of how
important this move to digital communications is.''
</P>
<P>
   APL Digital has 140 employees in offices in Hong Kong, London,
New York and Sydney, Australia; plans call for offices to be opened
in additional cities before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of APL Digital is indicative of the growing ardor
among traditional agencies to stake a claim to cyberspace. But many
involved in interactive advertising, electronic commerce and the
Internet continue to disparage the digital efforts of the Madison
Avenue mainstays, asserting that they are not as nimble or skilled
as the crop of fledgling independent agencies that were founded
recently to specialize in digital communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's baloney,'' Cauley said. ``We all know what the Web is
about: commerce, customer service and a more efficient distribution
of information.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the game is who's going to do those things better,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Puris took issue with the widespread belief that Madison Avenue
is, to quote the headline on an article last month in the trade
publication Brandweek, ``Missing the E-Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it represents a fundamental change,'' Puris said.
``And we've been in pitches with the independents _ and we've
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cauley acknowledged, ``there is some truth'' to
assertions that more than a few traditional agencies had tarried in
dedicating resources to the interactive realm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who work in new media are always a little bit
`Come on, let's move faster,''' he added.
</P>
<P>
   APL Digital is doing worldwide work for two clients, Compaq
Computer Corp. and Iridium LLC. In this country, the interactive
unit is handling assignments for Aetna Inc., Ameritech Corp., Lego
Group, the Nickelodeon cable television network owned by Viacom
Inc., Unilever and United Parcel Service of America.
</P>
<P>
   In a staff memo last week announcing the promotion of Cauley,
39, to president at APL Digital from executive vice president and
managing director, Puris projected the unit's revenue at $10
million; Cauley estimated billings at $20 million to $30 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cauley, as part of his promotion, joins the New York management
committee of Ammirati Puris and the worldwide operating board.
Other top officers of APL Digital include Mark Avnet, senior vice
president and director for production and technology; Lynn Bolger,
senior vice president and media director, and Bruce Ledbetter,
principal technical strategist.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of what APL Digital does ``is hard-core Web
site development,'' Cauley said. Examples include a 12-language
site for Iridium (www.iridium.com) and an e-commerce initiative for
Compaq (www.directplus.compaq.com). The remaining APL assignments
are centered on ads for Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the announcement of the formation of APL Digital
came a month after Compaq, a big technology account of Ammirati
Puris, moved the creative and media portions of its account, with
billings estimated at $250 million to $300 million, to DDB Needham
Worldwide in New York, part of Omnicom Group. Ammirati Puris
retained the direct marketing and interactive parts of the account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Internet clients at Compaq tend to be different from our
advertising clients,'' Cauley said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever manner in which interactive marketing is handled, Puris
said, one verity remains: ``You still have to go on the Internet
with an idea. Without one, it doesn't work any better than a
billboard outside of La Guardia Airport.''

TELECOMMUNICATIONS: JUSTICE DEPT. VS. THE BELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Multibillion-dollar mergers are the most glamorous events in the
telecommunications business. But potentially the most important
development in the industry continues to be the legal battle
between the Bell local phone companies and the Justice Department
over the soul of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The battlefront last week was in New Orleans, where the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in the government's appeal
of a December decision that would give the Bells what they most
desire: immediate entry into the $80 billion long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, issued mere hours before the end of the year by
Judge Joe Kendall of U.S. District Court in Wichita Falls, Texas,
never went into effect. For now, the Bells must wait for approval
from the Federal Communications Commission before selling
long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells' case may well end up before the Supreme Court and
remain unresolved for a year.
</P>
<P>
   But for communications regulators, carriers, investors and
customers the case will remain critical. That importance could be
seen in the identity of the lawyers who made the main arguments on
Thursday: Laurence Tribe from Harvard University for the Bells and
Joel Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   The Bells, led by SBC Communications Inc., have made a shrewd
argument. Basically, they contend that the U.S. Constitution does
not allow Congress to act as if it were a judge, namely U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Greene supervised the breakup of AT&AMP;T in the 1980s into a
long-distance company, now named AT&AMP;T Corp., and seven Bell local
phone companies. The split was part of a consent decree that the
old AT&AMP;T agreed to in an antitrust settlement with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The consent decree and Greene's rulings gave the Bells legal
monopolies on local phone service in their regions. The catch was
that the Bells were not allowed to sell long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   A main goal of the 1996 telecommunications act was to foster
competition in local phone markets. But the Bells had to be enticed
to give up their monopolies and to open their networks so that new
companies could come into the local market without rewiring
buildings across. So Congress provided a way for the Bells to get
into the long-distance arena.
</P>
<P>
   But the path is not easy. The law said that once a Bell had
convinced the FCC that it had opened its network, the Bell would be
allowed to sell long-distance service. (No Bell has yet passed that
test.)
</P>
<P>
   As the telecommunications bill became law, Greene vacated the
consent decree. So the Bells basically traded a regulatory regime
governed by the consent decree and Greene for one governed by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   That trade gave the Bells an opportunity, one they have
exploited. When the consent decree and Greene's orders were keeping
the Bells out of long distance, they had little real argument.
After all, through their former parent company, AT&AMP;T, they had
agreed to a court-supervised settlement that made their independent
existence possible.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Bells are arguing that the telecommunications act
unfairly singles them out. Barring the Bells from the long-distance
market until they satisfy the FCC is a punishment, they argue, and
Congress has punished the Bells without a trial. When a legislature
(like Congress) punishes someone without a trial, it is known in
legal parlance as a bill of attainder, and bills of attainder are
specifically barred by the Constitution.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Very few people expected SBC to succeed when it first made that
argument. After all, the Bells seemed to support the act at its
passage. And everyone knew the Bells were a special regulatory
case, right? Wasn't that the whole reason they were under the
consent decree?
</P>
<P>
   But Kendall agreed with the Bells that as a matter of law, the
history was irrelevant. The consent decree had been vacated. He
agreed with the Bells that it was fundamentally unfair that
Congress had allowed non-Bell local phone companies like GTE Corp.
into the long-distance market without restriction while the Bells
were forced to pass severe regulatory tests.
</P>
<P>
   Klein argues that the long-distance restrictions are not a form
of punishment, but rather a sort of regulation. With their sheer
size and geographic concentration, the Bells merit especially close
attention from Congress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, SBC is sparing no opportunity to paint itself as the
champion of constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never want a situation where Congress can single out for
penalties any single group,'' said James Ellis, the company's
general counsel. ``If it can happen to us, they can do it to
less-advantaged groups.''
</P>
<P>
   A difference, of course, between the Bells and less-advantaged
groups is that the Bells are one of the most formidable lobbies in
Washington. With employees and local ties in hundreds of
congressional districts across the country, they wield an influence
that by many accounts surpasses that of the long-distance giants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Kendall's ruling holds up on appeal, it will let
the Bells rush into long distance without necessarily giving up
their grip on local markets. They would take billions of dollars in
revenue directly away from the likes of AT&AMP;T and MCI.
</P>
<P>
   And they would be happy with no glamour at all.

MEDIA TALK: JOURNALISTS' METHODS UNDER SCRUTINY; AUTHOR DECLARES
INDEPENDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Ohio, Wash.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who? What? When? Where? Why? These are the questions journalists
are trained to ask. But the question that continues to haunt
journalists who are hauled into court is ``How?'' How did the
journalist get the information? How did he or she approach sources?
What did the journalist say to the subjects of the story?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's verdict by a jury in Bangor, Maine, against a
producer and correspondent for the NBC News program Dateline NBC is
the latest in a string of setbacks for news organizations
challenged not on their accuracy but their methods.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, NBC News had made no decision about appealing the
$525,000 verdict awarded Wednesday by the jury in Bangor. The jury
agreed with a trucking company and one of its drivers that the
producer and correspondent for a ``Dateline NBC'' report on
long-haul trucking failed to live up to assurances that their
report would be positive.
</P>
<P>
   This brings to three the number of pending cases that turn not
on the accuracy of journalists' reports but on their methods.
``Journalists ought to take note of the way juries react, not only
because of the risk of damages, but because of what it says about
what the American public thinks about journalism these days,'' said
Floyd Abrams, the prominent lawyer and expert on the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. District judge in Cincinnati is still considering a
charge of misrepresentation brought by the credit reporting firm
WDIA against Business Week. A Business Week reporter had filed a
form asking for information and _ although he said he worked for
Business Week _ also said his purpose in gaining the information
was related to ``employment'' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of a reporter's ethics was key,'' said John
Cobey, who represents WDIA in the suit, which is being brought
under the Fair Credit Reporting Act _ the very act whose
effectiveness the reporter was testing.
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket chain Food Lion won a jury verdict in 1996
against ABC News, whose producers had provided false information on
employment forms, then used hidden cameras to get video
documentation of shoddy food handling in one store. An appeal is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever comfort news organizations can take in this legal
climate comes from a federal judge who argued that it makes little
sense to trust a journalist's pitch. A 1995 ruling by Richard
Posner overturned elements of a lower court's finding that ABC was
guilty of fraud and trespass as a result of a Primetime Live
broadcast which sent test patients with concealed cameras into a
Chicago eye clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investigative journalists well known for ruthlessness promise
to wear kid gloves,'' Posner wrote. ``They break their promise, as
any person of normal sophistication would expect. If that is
`fraud,' it is the kind against which potential victims can easily
arm themselves by maintaining a minimum skepticism about
journalistic goals and methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspirational Author Founds Her Own Press
</P>
<P>
   Seeking more creative and financial control over her work, Betty
Eadie, a best-selling inspirational writer, has formed her own
press, Onjinjinkta Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed like the obvious next step to getting my books
out and getting them out the way I wanted them,'' Ms. Eadie said.
``Dealing with publishers isn't always so easy, and then they end
up owning your book. This is my life's work, and to be in control
of that is wonderful.'' Ms. Eadie's third book, ``The Ripple
Effect: Our Harvest,'' is due out in October, with a first printing
of 50,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   But the house expects to go back to press several times based on
the performance of Ms. Eadie's previous two books, which have sold
more than 7 million copies combined. Her first book, a near-death
account titled ``Embraced by the Light,'' was published by Gold
Leaf Press, while the second book, ``The Awakening Heart: My
Continuing Journey to Love,'' was published by Pocket Books; it
reprises the near-death theme she sustains through her third book.
</P>
<P>
   Onjinjinkta, which is based in Seattle, also plans to publish
books by other inspirational authors, issuing four to six titles
per season. (Onjinjinkta means ``rose in bloom'' in the language of
Ms. Eadie's Lakota Sioux mother.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Eadie said she had been offered her own imprint by several
publishing houses, the type of arrangement recently accepted by the
author Sarah Ban Breathnach, who will run Simple Abundance Press at
Warner Books. But Ms. Eadie wanted still more autonomy than an
imprint would have afforded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with your own imprint, you're working within their time
frame,'' she said. ``The work I'm doing requires my own time
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Next February, Onjinjinkta is planning to release a book by a
first-time author, Roy Mills, titled ``The Soul's Remembrance.''
The book is about ``Mills' pre-birth life,'' according to Peter
Orullian, one of three editors at Onjinjinkta.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Onjinjinkta Enterprises, which Ms. Eadie started three
years before, bought the rights to the hardcover version of
``Embraced'' from Gold Leaf Press, and plans to release a new
edition around the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The success of feel-good books like the ``Chicken Soup for the
Soul'' series, which has sold 30 million copies, shows that the
inspirational market holds promise. But Ms. Eadie's faith in the
market comes less from figures, she said, than from ``the knowledge
I received during my near-death experience.''

 &HT;    British Open may be turning point for amateur champ
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Matt Kuchar flies 4,100 miles to the 123rd
Open Championship at Royal Birkdale and signs as many autographs as
he might at The Varsity. Indeed, it could be a signature destined
for collectible status if this evolves as Kuchar's last major
championship as an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.S. Open, where the U.S. Amateur champion from
Georgia Tech tied for 14th and seriously contended for a while,
it's become one of the biggest questions in golf: When will Kooch
take the loot? If you thought he's been smiling broadly to this
point, imagine the grins if a pile of money replaces a pile of
school books.
</P>
<P>
   The more Kuchar speaks about when he will turn pro, the more it
sounds like he's going soon. Quite possibly, before the U.S.
Amateur Aug. 24-30.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a chance to go after my dreams, to play pro golf and to
see how well I can do as a professional,'' Kuchar said Sunday after
a windblown practice round at Royal Birkdale. ''The time is right
for me to really chase that dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Kuchar has proven his worth in a tie for 21st at the
Masters, a tie for 14th at the U.S. Open and a new outdoor record
for most marketing-friendly smiles by an amateur. The only question
is whether Kuchar goes now or waits a little longer. Doubtfully,
though, could his marketability improve. As Vinnie Giles of Pros,
Inc., a contender for landing him, says, ''Barring something
phenomenal like winning the British Open, he's pretty close to his
apex right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kuchar doesn't expect to match his other major
championship success at his first British Open, the questions are
sure to continue this week. Already, Kuchar has been tracked down
at the house where he and his parents, Peter and Meg, are staying.
Matt will remain overseas until the Palmer Cup the first week of
August to do some sightseeing, play some more famous courses and,
perhaps as an added bonus, be tougher to locate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody wants to know, especially after the U.S. Open, 'When
is Matt turning pro? Is this the best time?''' Kuchar said. ''I'm
just split right now. I don't know what's going to happen. There's
so many positives for getting my degree and so many positives for
turning pro, it just seems like one doesn't outweigh the other
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief positive is fairly obvious and minimizes the
aggravation of calls or meetings with ''hundreds of agents.''
Millions are available for Kuchar in an endorsement package as soon
as he says the word. Sometimes it appears he's already made up his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   While his father/caddie, Peter, said, ''You can be rest assured
nothing will happen prior to the Palmer Cup (the first week of
August), asked whether there could be an announcement between then
and the U.S. Amateur (three weeks later), Peter said, ''Maybe
then.''
</P>
<P>
   While it no doubt bothers Kuchar that leaving Tech would damage
another shot at an NCAA title, nobody would blame him for going.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a chance to set myself financially for a long period of
time,'' Kuchar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, it works out well enough where I will be set, that
this is the prime time for me to go and turn pro, and that sponsors
want me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar sounds very much like a young man wanting it to be over.
Although dizzied about ''going from a no-name to where people know
me almost everywhere,'' some of the fun has been removed from his
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really into it yet, dealing with agents,'' he said.
''It's flattering, but it's almost too much. Everybody has the same
promises they're making. It's been a battle as far as who wants to
do this and who wants to do that. It's been a lot to handle.''

THEATER REVIEW: A GRAB BAG OF PAINFUL MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If, at the end of ``The Race of the Ark Tattoo,'' you
feel you have to pick tatters of your own identity off the floor so
you can try to stitch it back together some day, you have
understood this profoundly threatening and vastly entertaining
episode in W. David Hancock's continuing campaign to create theater
that puts the audience onstage and the performers inside the
viewers' heads.
</P>
<P>
   You walk into a room at P.S. 122 large enough to hold only 25
people. It is a flea market run by one P. Foster (Matthew Maher),
who is delighted to haggle over his junk for some time until he
asks everyone to grab a chair and begins a tale of his life as a
violent youngster in foster homes. The best of them was the domain
of Homer Phinney, a sly Cape Cod type who ran a flea market in his
garage, numbered every item on sale, made up wild stories about
each one and collected them in a ratty old file, each with a number
corresponding to an item.
</P>
<P>
   As he talks, Foster, in voice, gesture and even in his glance,
is transformed into Phinney, who in turn is transformed at times
into one of Phinney's friends, his wife, Foster's friends or other
foster children. He fills an ``ark'' (actually a big toy Winnebago
camper) with flea market items that viewers at random, with eyes
closed, draw out, one by one, triggering a wild story. Thus
Foster's life and world unfold by chance, and Foster has such an
uncertain grip on his own personality that the randomness of the
evening generates real apprehension that he may disintegrate before
his hour is out.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no matter now funny some of the stories may be, each has
an undercurrent of menace and irredeemable loss. Foster's father
abandoned him at a drunken party. He and his fellow ``fosters'' at
Phinney's place exhaust themselves and their imaginations searching
for a band of Vikings lost on the Cape for a thousand years. (They
give the play its name, but it would be unfair to say how.)
</P>
<P>
   Foster's girlfriend, Jilly, with whom he learned sex and wonder
and his only burst of affection _ ``When I was with Jilly, it was
like I was waking up from life'' _ is in an asylum. For him the
past is not full of life, and memory is no healer. You want to
plead with him to stop the lottery and the stories.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock has an unerring ear and a huge vocabulary; characters
spring to life not in sentences but in phrases. Melanie Joseph, the
director, has shaped this performance into a constantly deepening
challenge to the audience's sense of reality.
</P>
<P>
   As for Maher, he is so engaging and so scary that the night I
went two groups of people leaving ahead of me got into serious
arguments about whether this could possibly be an act. It is, and
this terrific concoction calls up searing fear and pity. Whether
there is a catharsis depends on your strength; there is no chance
after the first few minutes that disbelief will insulate you from
the effects of this one.

 &HT;    Parnevik thrives on disdain for convention
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the game of life, Jesper Parnevik has
never aimed for the center of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   That becomes obvious at first glance. With his retro-style
clothes and a flipped-up bicycle cap, Parnevik looks more like he's
from the '60s than someone who's trying to shoot in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   And his sense of fashion is only the tip of his nonconformity.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a guy who believes in reincarnation, eats volcanic dust
to cleanse his system, has had his blood analyzed by radiation,
uses stroboscopic glasses, meditates as the sun rises over his
South Palm Beach home, has had his metal fillings replaced with
ceramic ones to reduce mercury levels and once drove to the wrong
city for a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Jesper (it's pronounced Yes-per) is called Spaceman on
the PGA Tour. It's somehow consistent that Parnevik, the son of
Sweden's most famous comedian Bo Parnevik, doesn't seem to care
that everyone thinks he's a little goofy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any image is a good one,'' Parnevik said. ``Maybe there isn't
that much to write about in the golfing world. I don't mind at all.
If anyone can have fun on my behalf, I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Parnevik has had another odd habit of almost winning the
British Open, which starts Thursday at Royal Birkdale. Twice in the
last four years, Parnevik has finished second in golf's oldest
major.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Parnevik had a two-shot lead on the 18th hole at
Turnberry _ until he did something silly. Thinking he was behind
instead of ahead, he tried to birdie the final hole and instead
made bogey. That enabled Jupiter Island's Nick Price to win the
claret jug after he eagled the 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Parnevik had to be devastated after he just failed to
win his favorite tournament, right? But that would have been the
normal response.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first chance to win a major, but I didn't deserve it
yet,'' Parnevik said. ``It would have been too soon. Besides, in
the long run it's just your name on something, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik also seemed poised to win last year's British Open at
Royal Troon when he took a two-shot lead into the final round. He
led for most of that Sunday, until Justin Leonard got hot on the
back nine and shot 65 to catch Parnevik (73) and win by three
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik said he was able to handle that defeat because he had
no illusion of winning when he showed up. In fact, he said his game
was in such disrepair when he arrived at Royal Troon that he had to
be thrown off the range the night before the first round because of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was almost in a state of panic because I didn't have any
game to turn up on Thursday with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik somehow held his game together and shot a first-round
70, finishing with three consecutive birdies. So in a vintage
Parnevik move, he inexplicably changed putters and started the
second round with a three-putt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after shooting a pair of 66s, Parnevik had a two-shot lead
over Darren Clarke. But like in '94, he felt he was behind instead
of ahead because of a questionable swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain how it feels to stand on the first tee with
about 15 different swing thoughts and you don't know where the ball
is going,'' Parnevik said. ``But even though I wasn't playing well,
I still thought I could shoot around par and win. That was probably
the toughest day I ever had on a golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Parnevik, 33, can laugh at his disappointments, a trait
he acquired from his dad. Bo Parnevik not only taught his son
humor, he used him in his act when Jesper was young and growing up
in Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Parnevik thought he would follow into his dad's
profession until he was introduced to golf when he was 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he stopped collecting jokes and started collecting golf
balls,'' Bo Parnevik said. Because the nearest golf course was 40
miles away, Bo helped his son learn the game by letting him hit
floatable balls in a lake behind their house.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Jesper stopped doing comedy, he still amused those
around him with his strange interests. Bo remembers when his son
became involved in music and put together an orchestra to go along
with his piano playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been interested in different things,'' Bo Parnevik
said. ``He was always a very curious boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesper didn't outgrow that trait, nor does he intend to. After
recently talking religion with fellow pro Bernhard Langer, he
immediately read the Bible and the Koran cover-to-cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am curious and I like to try different things,'' he said.
``But all those things started with a small thing and they have
been building up. You get really hooked on something and try it
out, but a few months later you don't want to do anything at all.
I've been quite normal the last couple of months.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of normalcy is confused by his unusual attire, the
stovepipe pants and the flipped-up lid he adopted while a student
at Palm Beach Junior College in Lake Worth, Fla., trying to get a
tan. He played well that day.
</P>
<P>
   His clothing continues to be a source of discussion on Tour,
both pro and con.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuff he wears is so retro that by the end of the day you
wind up digging brown and blue,'' says Brandel Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik's response? ``As far as my clothes go, if Tom Weiskopf
could win the British Open (in 1973) with the pants he had on, I
mean I can win wearing purple pants, no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik's unusual wardrobe and quirky lifestyle left him open
for some wisecracks from other pros when he first joined the PGA
Tour in 1994. But Parnevik soon proved his game was no joke as he
showed quick improvement on the Tour's money list _ from 120th in
'94 to 84th in '95, to 53rd in '96 and 12th last year, when he had
five second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I got to where I am playing well, I know they thought I
was crazy. Like, I didn't have a clue,'' he said. ``But if you're
doing OK, you can pretty much do what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik continued to impress when he was a captain's choice on
last year's European Ryder Cup team and played a key role by
winning two points. He finally won on the PGA Tour this year at
Phoenix, celebrating in his own unique fashion by lighting up a
victory cigar as he walked up to the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   And what would he do if he stopped his close-but-no-cigar
finishes at the British Open next week?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure you want to know,'' he said.

 &HT;    Cowboys will unveil changes during training camp
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ New coach. New training camp site. New offense.
New players.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dallas Cowboys prepare for training camp in Wichita
Falls, they can only hope a fresh start reverses the memory of last
year's 6-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   The mention of 6-10 still grinds on team owner Jerry Jones.
During his tenure at Valley Ranch, his teams have been judged by
his three Super Bowl trophies, not his three losing seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should have won just six football games last
season,'' Jones said. ``I have every reason to think we can compete
for a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The first step in rebuilding an aging franchise was dumping its
head coach, Barry Switzer, and hiring energetic Chan Gailey from
the Pittsburgh Steelers. During his first 100 days in office,
Gailey showed quiet confidence and an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the veterans, particularly quarterback Troy Aikman and
receiver Michael Irvin, said Gailey's no-nonsense approach might be
the tonic the Cowboys need to regain their stature as NFL bullies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newness is exciting,'' Aikman said. ``We're working hard,
but I can't say we're working any harder than we have in previous
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey installed about 80 percent of his offense during the
team's three mini- camp sessions in the spring. Fans who attend
camp at Midwestern State University will see a wide-open offense,
one that features up to four receivers on a given play.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from the team's grind-it-up-the-middle past,
but the players insist Gailey's offense is not laced with gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Receivers are all over the place,'' said Billy Davis, who once
likened the playbook to a Chinese menu. ``It doesn't look
organized, but once you look at the playbook it's very organized.
Everyone has structured assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who witnessed last season's disaster knows the Cowboys
needed to restructure an offense that ranked 20th in the league. An
offensive system that helped win three Super Bowls in the '90s had
become outdated and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure predictable is the right word,'' Irvin said. ``If
that were true I doubt that I'd have three rings in my closet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly,'' Irvin added, ``maybe defenses had been
catching on to what we were doing. That probably hurt us the past
few years. Maybe it was time for a change, time for us to explore
something new.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the dismissal of Switzer and hiring of Gailey should
provide. Something new. Something to worry opposing defensive
coordinators. And as the Cowboys prepare for the opening day of
practice in the 100-degree heat of Midwestern State University this
week, there will be other changes in the air:
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will showcase two new defensive ends. Greg Ellis,
taken in the first round of April's draft, replaces Tony Tolbert at
left end. He broke Lawrence Taylor's career record for sacks at the
University of North Carolina. The other side will be taken by
Kavika Pittman, a slow-developing player who was drafted two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line will have one new starter, former Miami guard
Everett McIver. He will play on the right side, next to tackle Erik
Williams. The other big change is left guard Nate Newton, who lost
about 80 pounds this year in an effort to salvage his career.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to give Aikman a few extra seconds to look for receivers,
Gailey has introduced a shotgun offense. The Cowboys haven't used
the shotgun with any regularity since Danny White was the
quarterback. When asked if he likes the new formation, Aikman said,
``If it helps us win games, I'll like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey will again utilize Deion Sanders as a two-way player.
Sanders was rarely used as a target in Switzer's system, but he'll
``be more than just a decoy'' this year, Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his career in Dallas, Emmitt Smith will
have a proven backup. Former Seattle running back Chris Warren
signed a three-year deal with the Cowboys and will be used mainly
as a third-down threat. Warren is one of only 14 players to rush
for 1,000 yards in four consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has emphasized a youth movement, cutting several of the
team's old reliables. Bill Bates and Herschel Walker are not under
contract _ although both could be re-signed this summer _ and Mark
Tuinei and Tolbert hope they can come back from major injuries.

 &HT;    Shortstops with big pop
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Omar Vizquel figures his highlight films should be in
black-and-white.
</P>
<P>
   That's about how outdated he feels. He looks at the guys playing
shortstop and he's almost glad he has nine major-league seasons
behind him and has already established himself as one of the game's
best defensive shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   Because lately, that's just not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when the little guy personified the position.
Now, it's become the glamour spot. Think of shorstops, and
Seattle's Alex Rodriguez, the Yankees' Derek Jeter and Boston's
Nomar Garciaparra are the ones who come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is batting .308 with 27 homers _ he had 23 last season
and 36 in '96 _ and 72 RBI. Jeter has already matched his home run
totals in each of the last two seasons with 10, while batting .310.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was the AL Rookie of the Year last season. His 56
RBI so far this season are more than half of the 98 he hit in '97.
He also hit 30 homers and batted .306 that season. He's now hitting
.313 with 13 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can dominate the game at that position,'' Vizquel said.
``It may never go back to having smaller defensive players who hit
.250 with no power. I belong to that era.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be just a coincidence that baseball has three
superstars at the same position who are basically the same age.
Jeter and Rodriguez are best friends; they met through a mutual
friend when Rodriguez was a senior in high school and Jeter was in
his first season of professional ball.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter stays at Rodriguez's house when the Yankees are in
Seattle. They even decided that whoever married first _ Jeter
recently broke up with pop diva Mariah Carey _ would give the other
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Graciaparra isn't as flashy as the other two. He hangs out with
utility infielder and Red Sox teammate Lou Merloni. He doesn't say
much, but according to Vizquel, he's the best player of the three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex Rodriguez is one of the best offensive shortstops, and
defensively, I like Jeter a lot,'' Vizquel said.``But Garciaparra,
he's got the whole package.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter said it's way too early to credit them with
revolutionizing the position. He named Cal Ripken Jr., Robin Yount,
Alan Trammell and Barry Larkin as guys who redefined what a
shorstop is.
</P>
<P>
   His manager sees it a little differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like catchers when Johnny Bench was playing,''
Joe Torre said. ``Especially when it comes to pop. Omar Vizquel
takes a backseat to no one defensively, but the offensive people
are the ones who get all the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he doesn't think kids who want to play shortstop will
start focusing more on their offense. Jeter was told very early on
defense is the priority in winning.
</P>
<P>
   But will a guy like the Mets' Rey Ordonez, whose defensive plays
could make up an entire SportsCenter highlight reel, but who's
batting .241, ever be named an All-Star?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still room for the guy who hits .240,'' Rodriguez
said.

 &HT;    Georgia Governor's race: Roy Barnes profile
 &HT;    By Charles Walston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Roy Barnes won't deny that he's made some mistakes
during his 24 years in state government and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The way he sees it, that's not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn from my mistakes,'' Barnes said recently. ``I've
gotten older, and hopefully wiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hard-won wisdom is evident in the effort Barnes is waging
to become Georgia's next governor. In 1990 he ran a gubernatorial
campaign that fell behind early in TV advertising and never managed
to connect with voters. Barnes finished third that year in the
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Barnes has raised more money than any candidate in
either party, and has conserved his resources for TV by tightly
limiting other spending. Most important, he has a message that many
voters seem to like. A poll conducted last week for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution showed Barnes leading among 365 likely
Democratic voters with 40 percent, compared to 24 percent for his
closest rival, Secretary of State Lewis Massey.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has hammered issues like school discipline, health care
reform, a property tax cut and incentives for businesses to open
on-site day care programs. The over-arching theme of his campaign,
though, is his experience as a lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was elected to the state Senate in 1974 at the age of 26,
and for years he was the youngest member in the chamber. He quickly
became chairman of the powerful Judiciary Committee, and beginning
in 1983 served as Gov. Joe Frank Harris' floor leader in the
Senate, helping to pass legislation including the Quality Basic
Education Act and measures to clean up Georgia's rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   As Harris' floor leader, Barnes also served as a member of the
Growth Strategies Commission, which looked for ways to manage
suburban sprawl, traffic and pollution. Many of the panel's
recommendations involved regional cooperation, and they have been
largely ignored over the last decade as growth-related problems in
metro Atlanta have worsened. Still, Barnes believes the Growth
Strategies Commission laid the groundwork for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``From being on the Growth Strategies Commission, I came to
believe that a regional approach is going to be necessary to deal
with the big problems on our plate today,'' Barnes said. ``If we
had followed some of those recommendations, we would already be a
long way ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes gave up his Senate seat in 1990 to run for governor, but
his effort was doomed from the start. Then-Lt. Gov. Zell Miller had
an issue that would prove unbeatable: a promise to start a state
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes opposed the lottery in 1990, and he learned the hard way
that voters agreed with Miller, not him. Today Barnes says the
lottery is here to stay, and points out that Miller, too, was once
opposed to state-sponsored gambling. Miller changed his lottery
stand late in 1988, just prior to his first gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes worked in the Legislature this year to pass a
constitutional amendment that, if voters approve it in November,
will permanently earmark lottery revenues for HOPE scholarships and
other education programs. Massey, one of Barnes' Democratic rivals,
originally proposed a similar idea, but the version that passed the
Legislature combined language from both of their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   After losing his first bid for governor, Barnes returned to the
Legislature in 1993 as a member of the state House, which he found
``more diverse and more rambunctious'' than the Senate. ``It helped
round me,'' he said of his move to the House. It also connected him
to a valuable political network; most Democratic House members,
including Speaker Tom Murphy (D-Bremen), are backing Barnes for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Among his fellow lawmakers, Barnes has a reputation as a witty
orator and a wily strategist, traits he honed in his career as a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Georgia law school,
Barnes began his career as a Cobb County prosecutor in 1972. Two
years later he went into private practice, and did mostly criminal
work until the 1980s, when the bulk of his business shifted to
civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   Today Barnes' civil clients are split almost evenly between
defendants and plaintiffs. Some of his major clients include
Kennestone Hospital, the Marietta Daily Journal newspaper and
trucking firms. He has successfully sued several strip clubs in
highly publicized cases involving fatal auto accidents caused by
patrons or employees of the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' work as a lawyer could be a liability with voters.
Massey and Republican candidate Guy Millner recently criticized him
for representing an accused child molester at a legal hearing three
years ago. Barnes said he was contacted by the defendant's employer
to help obtain a consent order, which prosecutors didn't oppose,
allowing the man to move out-of-state while he awaited trial.
</P>
<P>
   After the consent order was obtained, a different lawyer took
over the defendant's case, which resulted in a guilty plea and a
sentence of eight years on probation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Barnes is now worth about $10 million, he still practices
law in an unassuming building near the Marietta square, and lives
in Mableton, not far from where he grew up. He and his wife, Marie,
have three children.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has pumped at least $828,000 of his own money into his
campaign, accounting for about 20 percent of the total $4.2 million
he had raised as of last month. Other major sources of
contributions have been lawyers and health care firms. Prominent
supporters include former governor Harris, who is chairman of the
Barnes campaign, and Gwinnett County developer Wayne Mason. Groups
endorsing Barnes include the Georgia Sierra Club and the state
Police Benevolent Association.

that he has used in speeches and in a campaign ad promising HMO
patients more choice of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite theme: With all the Democratic candidates talking about
education, juvenile crime and the environment, Barnes has tried to
convince voters that his experience makes him the one who can best
deliver on promises.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign method: Barnes became the Democrat to beat when he
began his TV ad campaign six weeks before anybody else. He was able
to do it because he raised more money than his opponents, including
$828,000 of his own funds, and because he did a better job of
saving his resources for TV.

 &HT;    Georgia Governor's race: Mike Bowers profile
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a pounding thunderstorm on a night when all his
rivals were absent, Mike Bowers made good on a promise to speak at
a south Fulton forum.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cinder block basement, he waited patiently through
the potluck buffet and speeches by a half-dozen down-ballot
candidates for his turn at the podium. Exactly what you'd expect
from the man who built a reputation as Georgia's Boy Scout.
</P>
<P>
   That straight arrow image, honed during 16 years as the state's
attorney general, was supposed to be Bowers' ticket to the
governor's mansion, as the first Republican to live there since
Reconstruction. But after admitting to a 15-year adulterous affair
with his former secretary, Bowers' job now is convincing many
Georgia voters that he's still a good guy, and more importantly,
good governor material.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you called Guy Millner's temporary services agency and told
them you needed to fill the office of governor of the state of
Georgia, I'm the candidate they would send,'' Bowers says in a jab
at the Republican frontrunner, who made his fortune in the staffing
business.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bowers' political resume is complete. A West Point
graduate and retired Georgia Air National Guard reservist, he knows
government from the inside. In 23 years at the state Law Department
advising state agencies, he joined with the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation in a ticket-fixing probe that resulted in the firing
of the long-time Georgia State Patrol Commander, and he sued the
state's personnel board for open meetings violations.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he made plenty of enemies. His vigorous defense
of the state's sodomy law and withdrawal of a job offer to a
lesbian after she planned a public commitment ceremony with her
partner earned Bowers the enduring ire of gays and lesbians
nationwide. In light of his long-standing affair, a violation of
Georgia's sex laws, Bowers now admits he was a moral hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's powerful House Speaker Tom Murphy (D-Bremen), an ally
of the former patrol commander, makes little secret of his disdain
for Bowers, likening his tactics to the ``Gestapo'' in probing the
ticket-fixing scandal. Repeated run-ins with the House leaders
often resulted in clipped pay raises or overlooked budget requests
for Bowers and his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think Mike killed a gnat with a sledgehammer,''
said House Majority Leader Larry Walker (D-Perry, Ga.), who says he
nonetheless likes Bowers. ``Everything is black and white to him.
In the political world, everything is not black and white. There
are shades of gray.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bowers also made lots of friends, especially among the law
enforcement sector. In spite of Bowers' conversion to the
Republican Party, Gov. Zell Miller hailed his resignation last year
as the departure of an ``honest, able and hardworking'' man. ``I
like the way he operates,'' Miller said. The media frequently
exalted Bowers as a champion of open records and clean government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says duty, honor, country. I believe in that,'' retired
Kennesaw, Ga. teacher Duane Young said, proudly wearing a T-shirt
with a picture of Bowers and his wife walking out of the Capitol on
qualifying day. ``The Democrats are so entrenched, it's going to
take somebody with experience to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   But some voters are looking at a different set of job
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I can trust Mike Bowers,'' Ralph Bradley, a parts
technician from Albany, Ga. said, echoing the concerns of many
social conservatives who have backed away from Bowers' candidacy.
``If a man can't respect his vows to his wife, how can he respect
one to the state?''
</P>
<P>
   A contrite Bowers disclosed the affair, and apologized, more
than a year ago. Both he and his wife of 35 years, say they've
rekindled their marriage and kept their family together. They're
constantly on the campaign trail together and have mortgaged the
farm _ literally, placing a note on their 47-acre spread in Jackson
County _ to help finance the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe we are almost being penalized because we
stayed the course and kept our family and our marriage together,''
Bette Rose Bowers said as her husband's former mistress renewed the
controversy with a series of media interviews earlier this spring.
``If he'd decided to run for governor as a divorced man, none of
you would be asking these questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters, like Susan Rutherford, a pastor's wife from
Paulding County, Ga. say their decided to back Bowers because of
how he handled the incident. ``I see the heart of this man and I
say this is someone I can get behind,'' she said. ``To have the
heart to say I messed up and want to do right, I can appreciate
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But political scientists give Bowers' campaign little chance of
rebounding from the scandal enough to win the GOP nomination,
especially since more than a third of the primary voters are
Christian conservatives. He lags significantly in the polls, and
his disapproval rating is the highest among all candidates for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of his personal life, Bowers is urging voters to focus
on what he plans to do in office. He continues to attack areas he
was familiar with as attorney general _ crime and punishment.
Speeding up the death penalty, cutting crime rates on Atlanta's
streets, which he once compared to war-ravaged Sarajevo, and
forcing prisoners to serve 85 percent of their sentences are at the
top of his agenda. He also advocates a statewide grand jury system
to prosecute government corruption and an end to affirmative action
programs anywhere in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   And add the city of Atlanta to his list of political foes.
Bowers vows to wrest control of airport operations from the city
and force a state takeover of the city's antiquated sewer system if
it isn't immediately brought into compliance with environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   All those are subjects, Bowers says, that GOP frontrunner
Millner isn't equipped to tackle because he won't debate them in
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's got what it takes to govern?,'' Bowers asked. ``It's
that simple. Part of that is just showing up.
</P>
<P>
   Michael ``Mike'' Joseph Bowers
</P>
<P>
   Age: 56
</P>
<P>
   Party Affiliation: Republican
</P>
<P>
   Residence: Stone Mountain, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Education: Bachelors degree, West Point; masters degrees,
Stanford University and University of Utah; law degree, University
of Georgia
</P>
<P>
   Profession: Lawyer
</P>
<P>
   Political experience: Sixteen years as attorney general; seven
years in U.S. Air Force; 27 years Georgia Air National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Personal: Wife, Bette; three children.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Line: (Directed to GOP rival Guy Millner) ``The
Republican primary probably won't be decided on questions of crime,
education or public policy. The issue is: Can you buy Georgia? It's
just that simple. Who's got what it takes to govern?'' Part of that
is just showing up. You may be able to hide in an election, but you
won't be able to hid in governing.''Favorite Theme: Experience
money can't buy.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign method: Divides his time between fundraising and
criss-crossing the state meeting voters. Uses some TV advertising,
but is most effective in front of a crowd. Has appeared at numerous
forums and debates to point out that his chief GOP rival, Guy
Millner, has refused all but two invitations to share the stage
with the Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign tidbits: Served 16 years as Georgia's attorney general,
most of that as a Democrat, before switching parties. Dropped
quickly from GOP frontrunner and party-favorite status after
admitting to a 15-year adulterous affair with a former employee.

MAJOR STEPS FORWARD FOR STREAMING TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The streaming technology that allows music and video to be sent
over the Internet to personal computers is still a curiosity as a
medium and a puzzle as a business.
</P>
<P>
   But Real Networks Inc., the leader in streaming software, is
making announcements Monday that represent steps toward developing
both the medium and its business model further, industry analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The company is releasing a test, or beta, version of its desktop
and network server software that employs a new standard for
streaming technology, Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language,
or SMIL (pronounced smile.)
</P>
<P>
   In the industry, the hope is that the new format, recommended by
the World Wide Web Consortium, a nonprofit arbiter of technical
standards for Internet software, will open the way for a flood of
streaming-media programming _ as did agreement on Hypertext Markup
Language, or HTML, the document format for the Web.
</P>
<P>
   SMIL should allow Web programmers to put video, audio, text and
charts into an integrated presentation that can be broadcast live
or on demand to Internet-connected personal computers. Until now,
streaming technology has tended to be used to send standard radio
or television programming over the Internet, like video of a sports
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Real Networks' deployment of SMIL is an important step
toward moving streaming technology to become a real new media,''
said Jae Kim, an analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a research firm
in Carmel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks' latest version of its desktop software for
receiving streaming media, Real Player G2, has ``channels'' to link
users to Internet broadcast sites of more than 60 media companies
including CNN, ABC, Fox, ESPN, CBS Sportsline, Sony CMPnet and The
Wall Street Journal. Real Player is distributed free from the
company Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The channel feature is the Seattle-based company's effort to
become a gateway, or portal, for steering users to other
programming. The steering strategy, if successful, will bring in
added revenues and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks software is used on more than 80 percent of the
Web pages with streaming media, and Real Networks said it had more
than 26 million registered users, up from 7 million in April 1997.
``After the Web browsers, we have by far the largest base of
users,'' said Rob Glaser, chairman of Real Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. bought a 10 percent stake in Real Networks last
July, before the company went public in November. Under securities
law, Microsoft has to hold onto its shares for a year, meaning it
can sell at the end of this month. Glaser declined to comment on
whether Microsoft, whose Netshow product competes with Real
Networks, might sell off its holding.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks' stock closed last week at $34.75 a share,
compared with its initial public offering price of $12.50. The
company will lose $10 million on revenues of $54 million this year,
estimated David Readerman, an analyst at Nationsbanc Montgomery
Securities. By 2000, he projected, the company will earn $12
million on revenues of $100 million.

SOUTH KOREA ON ALERT AFTER COMMANDO'S BODY DISCOVERED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ South Korean military commanders put troops on the
country's eastern coast on alert Sunday and declared a curfew in
the area after finding the body of a diver who they said was a
North Korean commando.
</P>
<P>
   The diver, whose body apparently washed up on the beach, was
carrying a Czech-made submachine gun, a hand grenade, radio
transmission gear and an underwater camera, the military said.
Nearby, investigators found a cone-shaped aluminum submersible boat
that could carry up to five commandos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging from the objects found, it has been proven that the
dead diver was an armed infiltrator,'' said Kang Jung-kwon, a
Defense Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   If further investigation backs that up _ and if other armed
North Korean infiltrators are caught _ a result could be serious
new antagonisms between North and South Korea. More broadly, the
incursion could be a major setback for efforts to engage the
Stalinist state in the North and bring it out of its isolation.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea President Kim Dae-jung has pushed a ``sunshine''
policy intended to build ties with the North and ease sanctions
against it. But that is proving difficult to promote because of
evidence that North Korea is still sending armed commandos into the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, a furor erupted when a South Korean fisherman
caught a North Korean submarine in his drift net. The North Korean
commandos on board apparently killed the crew and then themselves,
but South Korean officials said that some of the commandos had
recently been on South Korean soil.
</P>
<P>
   That incident aroused only limited outrage in the South Korea,
in part because the submarine was 12 miles offshore when it was
caught in the net. North Korea said it had lost power and suggested
that it had drifted south.
</P>
<P>
   A much more serious episode occurred when a North Korean
submarine ran aground on the South Korean coast in October 1996 and
19 crew members and commandos slipped ashore. Some 70,000 South
Korean troops were deployed to hunt them down, and in the end all
the North Koreans were killed or committed suicide except one who
was captured and another who was never found.
</P>
<P>
   That incident nearly destroyed efforts to promote peace on the
Korean peninsula, and it also led to strains in relations between
South Korea and the United States as officials argued about how to
handle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The body discovered Sunday morning was found by a South Korean
man walking along the beach near the city of Donghae, 110 miles
northeast of Seoul. The dead diver was wearing a wet suit, goggles
and two oxygen tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Ministry doctors examined the body and said that the man
had died of a heart attack and had been dead between 24 and 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea had no immediate comment on the discovery of the
diver. In the past it has denied that it engages in armed
infiltration.
</P>
<P>
   Some overseas Koreans sympathetic to the North have said that
infiltrators are the only means the North has of gathering military
intelligence. The South can get intelligence from satellite
pictures, they say, while the North has to send in commandos.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has military bases in the area, and there are sure
to be intensive efforts to track down any other spies who might
have been with the one who died.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The obvious question is why North Korea would risk another
humiliation by dispatching commandos into South Korea, particularly
so soon after its submarine was snared in the drift net.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Jong-chan, head of South Korea's intelligence agency, warned
last week that North Korea might step up spying and terrorism
against South Korea in the next couple of months before the
inauguration of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il as his country's
president. Lee had said that North Korean agencies would redouble
their efforts against the South in a show of loyalty to Kim.
</P>
<P>
   While North Korea has not formally announced that Kim will
become president, the betting is that he will be named in August or
September. On Sunday, North Korea announced that he had accepted a
nomination for the Supreme People's Assembly, an apparent step
toward assuming the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory that some North Korea experts have offered is
that the North Korean leadership, or at least elements within it,
are embarrassed by South Korea's efforts to promote peace. Only if
hard-liners prevail in the South, so the argument goes, will North
Korea have a good scapegoat for its closed-door policy with South
Korea and for its own economic mess.
</P>
<P>
   So, according to that theory, some elements in the North Korean
forces may be just as happy if an incursion causes rage in the
South and harder-line policies toward the North.
</P>
<P>
   A final explanation is simply that North Korea infiltrates spies
all the time, and that lately it has simply had bad luck.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will drench parts of the
Southeast on Monday as low pressure aloft lifts sultry air near the
ground into towering thunderheads from Arkansas to the Florida
peninsula. Damaging winds, hail, and heavy rain are likely in some
of the storms. Spottier thunderstorms will also percolate by late
afternoon in the increasing warmth and humidity over the central
Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Light southerly breezes in combination with developing high
pressure aloft will provide ample sunshine and burgeoning warmth in
the Middle Atlantic States and most of the Northeast. High
temperatures will be about 5 degrees warmer than recently in most
areas.
</P>
<P>
   A front preceding the surge of warmth will support clouds and a
few thundershowers over interior northern New England while a line
of strong thunderstorms ignites ahead of a cold front in the late
afternoon heat over parts of Michigan and eastern Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Blisteringly hot and humid air will expand northward from Texas
to South Dakota. High temperatures will exceed 100 degrees in much
of Texas, while highs in the middle 90s torment the rest of the
Plains states except North Dakota and eastern Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a cold front invading the Pacific Northwest will lead
to a few thunderstorms over the valleys east of the Cascades, while
low clouds and spotty showers plague the coast. Ample sun and
seasonably warm temperatures will prevail in California and Nevada
while afternoon thunderstorms develop in the afternoon over the
southern Rockies and intermountain plateaus.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Streak Ends
</P>
<P>
   The streak of 31 consecutive days of reaching 90 degrees or
higher came to a halt in Memphis, Tenn., this past weekend. Before
Saturday, the last time the daily high temperature failed to reach
at least 90 was on June 9. Rain-cooled air from thunderstorms and
persistent cloud cover was the primary reason for the streak's end.
During the past month, the ascending air currents that breed clouds
and precipitation were absent across the Deep South as a stubborn
high-pressure zone at 18,000 feet held steady over the region. The
longest streak of days exceeding 90 degrees in Memphis was 54, in
1980.

confidence hit a 29-year high last month. Whew! Talk about a
terrifying development. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How's that? Historically high consumer confidence is bad news?
If this puzzles you, it's time for a history lesson. Just because
the animal spirits of consumers are at their most salubrious since
1969, this isn't necessarily a good thing. Not for the stock
market. Not for the bond market. And not for the economy. At least
it shouldn't seem so if you're old enough to remember what the
economic future held for Americans about this time 29 years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   June 1969, you see, was a time when it seemed things just
couldn't get any better. And, sure enough, they didn't. In fact,
although most Americans were as happy as pigs in slop, the country
was about to enter the most dismal decade of the postwar period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The '60s had been a gangbusters time for the stock market, and
in 1969 the Dow Jones industrial average topped out at 969 on May
14. Just as the magic 1,000 plateau seemed attainable, though,
things turned nasty. The stock market plunged, and by year's end
the Dow was at 800. On May 26, 1970, the blue-chip indicator
bottomed out at 631, which represented a 35 percent loss in a
little more than a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The market began to recover, but it was slow going. The Dow
didn't regain its May 1969 level until late 1972. It subsequently
did breach 1,000 and hit 1,052 in January 1973, but it would be
nearly 10 years before it got that high again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The '70s were marked by stock market wallows, hyperinflation,
political crises, stratospheric interest rates, economic blahs,
energy shortages and frequent fits of national malaise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1982, signs of recovery had emerged, and the Dow
Jones industrial average closed the year at 1,047. This was only 8
percent higher than the 1969 peak. Inflation, meanwhile, had sent
the Consumer Price Index soaring 165 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To give you an idea of the differences between 1969-1982 and
1983-1997, here are some numbers beyond what happened to the Dow
Jones industrial average: Gross domestic product rose about $2
trillion, to $3 trillion, between 1969 and 1982. Since 1983,
however, it has expanded $5 trillion, to about $8 trillion.
Meantime, job growth from 1969 to 1982 was only about half the rate
of the 1983-1997 period. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given the euphoria that marked the '60s, anybody daring enough
to predict in '69 that a 13-year period of stagnation and woe was
just ahead would have had his prognosticator's license revoked.
Nevertheless, that's what happened. You can look it up, as Casey
Stengel liked to say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean history is about to repeat itself? Nobody knows,
but this walk down memory lane isn't meant to imply that 1998 is
1969. Rather, the purpose of reviewing economic history is to
remind anyone interested that nothing is dead-solid perfect, even
though it has tended to seem so for just about the entire decade of
the '90s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being cautious isn't fashionable these days, which explains why
the surge in consumer confidence is perceived as good news. It
tends to validate the view that happy consumers mean more happy
times ahead. As the dreadful years from mid-1969 to late 1982
remind us, however, it doesn't always happen that way. &QL;

   Their daughter balked (``I'm tired of water!''), so they waited
until she graduated from high school in 1996. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now Verdot mans the wheel of their boat as the family glides
through the glassy calm of the Osage. ``This makes it all
worthwhile,'' he said, squinting toward the sunset. &QL;

   Downstream in Rhineland, Steve Wehrle enjoys a splendid view
from his remodeled kitchen. He'll enjoy it even more the next time
the Missouri bloats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be tickled to be where I'm at,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, he and his family lived in the flood plain. The
whole town lived down there. Then came that manic July, when
Rhineland went underwater three different times. ``We knew that if
nothing was done, this would've turned into a ghost town,'' said
Wehrle, the mayor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Rhineland stepped up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency provided $10,000 to each
homeowner willing to truck a house up the hill overlooking Missouri
94. Or, residents could use the money to build anew. Grassy parcels
where cattle grazed were awarded in a lottery, and the Wehrles were
the first of many to put their home on wheels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People would be sitting for dinner and a crew would come in.
`House coming through. Could you move your car off the street?' &UR; ''
Wehrle recalled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been doing so much work on their homes, getting
situated, they haven't had much time to sit on the porch and relax.
When they do, it'll feel more like home again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today about 140 people live on the hill. Only one old-timer
chose to stay in the valley. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wehrle still runs Gosen's Cafe, rebuilt on the north side of the
highway _ a precious 4 feet higher than the south side. He grows
watermelons on the lot where his home stood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some would consider Portage des Sioux _ its face to the
Mississippi River and its back to the Missouri _ to be in an
unlucky spot. But people have always known you can shape your own
luck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JoAnn Meyers and a sister had taken out a $50,000 loan to launch
Red's Again Restaurant &AMP; Bar. The establishment had been run by
their father under the name Red's 30 years earlier. Meyers wanted
to show him that she could bring the old place back to life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It opened July 1, a week before 4 feet of water filled the joint
and swept all the meat from the refrigerator. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The easy option for Meyers was to give up and cut the family's
losses. She instead applied for an emergency federal loan _ this
one for $125,000 _ and worked feverishly to reopen so she could
start paying off the loan. Six months later, with a lot of
volunteer help, Red's Again was Red's Again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Friday nights the town crams in for catfish. On Saturday,
ribs. People laugh and drink and, as a rule, they don't ramble on
about the flood. Thirteen persons now work there to handle the
crowds, and virtually every afternoon, old Red himself eases into a
chair so his daughter can serve him dinner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes quite a lot of pride in what we were able to do,''
Meyers said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She speaks for so many upstream, who know this: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the Missouri River shows us how strong it can be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And it shows us how strong we can be. &QL;

   Steve Shirley of the Hardin Cemetery Association points to the
new pond. ``Some people think the cemetery looks prettier with the
lake here,'' he says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five feet deep in parts, it resulted from the Missouri
River's gouging a new channel through the cemetery's heart,
disturbing 793 grave sites and sending caskets and vaults into the
hole, or as far as 15 miles downstream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The damage in Hardin far surpassed the physical. Today it is
spelled out on a marker just erected: ``In Remembrance of Those
Displaced and Unidentified'' with 525 names. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ed Wolfe still grieves. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The casket of his infant son _ Christopher, who died in 1975 _
drifted a mile east and lodged in a ditch beside a gravel road.
Christopher's casket was reburied in October 1993. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd have been 22 years old now,'' said Wolfe, a jeweler in
nearby Richmond. ``To go through it again was just devastating.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Wolfe's father never were recovered. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of remains does make a difference. I used to talk
with my father when I visited the cemetery'' he said before his
voice choked. ``But this is something we just all have to get
through. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not for us to question God; the reason this happened is
that a man-made levee gave way.'' &QL;
</P>

<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   The currents roll on east toward Marvin Casner's modest
farmhouse in Carroll County, where his family has lived since the
1920s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see _ 1946, good season,'' recalled Casner, 76, ``1947,
flood; 1948, good season; 1949, wetter than heck, but it never
flooded; 1950, good; 1951, flood &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a flood one year and figure you make it back the
next.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the '93 flood, some soil experts predicted that
the sand would render the land surrounding Casner worthless for 10
years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Today, lush green cornstalks reach the top of Nelson Heil's car
as he drives the back roads near the river. The Carroll County
commissioner scoffed at the way outsiders size up the hazards of
flooding: ``I hate that term `flood plain' with a passion. We call
it a river bottom. Great ground.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heil bumped across the Norfolk Southern railroad track and
stopped his car near another cornfield. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Wakenda _ or what's left of it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only the folks who run Womack's Garage remain. All other
residents in 55 homes accepted emergency buyouts by the federal
government, which turned the land over to the county. A local
farmer is growing 20 acres of sweet corn between the rubble of
street grid, which marks where a town, already withering before
1993, once stood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the homes were bulldozed, the former town council erected
a monument beneath a bell that long ago clanged in the Walnut Grove
Baptist Church. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wakenda,'' the inscription reads. ``Incorporated 1869.
Unincorporated 1996.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The view near Interstate 70's Rocheport exit is different from
what motorists saw before the flood. Gone are the clean rows of
soybeans that seemingly stretched forever. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of acres of the Overton Bottoms now are managed by the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a wetland preserve. Saplings now
poke up from deep silt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the sight of manicured crops, but I also
appreciate what the natural world offers,'' said J.C. Bryant of the
Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge. ``That area is like a
young bird _ looks pretty ragged at first. But in 15 years you'll
see a young forest. It'll be beautiful.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harold Verdot decided three years ago that life was too short to
spend it in fear of the next monster flood. So he and his wife took
out a $55,000 loan and built a home on the very spot in Taos where
the Verdots were forced to swim in 1993. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Verdot and his daughter, Crystal, earned a measure of national
fame during the flood when a photographer for /{The Kansas City
Star/} captured them retrieving personal effects in a submerged
trailer belonging to Verdot's mother. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The family took a chain saw to the trailer after the Osage and
Missouri rivers receded. In its place stands a tasteful,
three-bedroom house on a concrete foundation 8 feet high. Their
furnace, air conditioner, satellite dish and even electrical
outlets are at least a foot above the 1993 water line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That old river teaches you stuff _ things to do and not to
do,'' Verdot said. ``Some people might think it foolish. I guess
you have to experience life out here to understand.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 death of a downstream neighbor, oddly, was the
catalyst. He had just finished adding two stories to the top of his
riverside home when a heart attack struck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to thinking,'' said Verdot, who then lived near a busy
street in Jefferson City. ``I don't want to die before having a
chance to enjoy being here on the river.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beverly agreed on one condition _ that the house have stairs on
the /{outside/} to prevent snakes from swimming into the living
room during a flood. &QL;

REVISITING VICTIMS OF THE 1993 MISSOURI FLOOD, FIVE YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, water. Belligerent, brown water everywhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Hamburg, Iowa _ a couple of miles from where the Missouri
River claws south into the state that shares its name _ the water
rose to the windows of the Pizza Hut. They called it the Great
Flood in Hamburg. They called it the Great Flood everywhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last month the water came back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eight hundred people were evacuated at night. Their cars and
pickups clogged Main Street, just as they did in 1993. Once again,
they jerked to a halt and made U-turns to fetch a favorite toy or
heirloom left behind. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This time the recurring nightmare boiled up from the Nishnabotna
River, which flows into the Missouri. Most of Hamburg, including
the Pizza Hut, was spared. But the scare was enough to get
residents wondering. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a generation, you can handle it,'' said farmer Glenn
Stenzel, whose boyhood home got 3 feet of water. ``Twice in a
generation, people leave. Twice in five years?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The water was receding one recent Sunday when a weary Stenzel
rose to sing in the First Baptist Church choir. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hymn begins: ``We are often tossed and driv'n on the
restless sea of time.'' And it ends, ``We'll tell the story how
we've overcome. For we'll understand it better by and by.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here in the deepest valleys of the Mighty Mo _ of quiet towns
and stubborn factories, of spectacular crops, tiered bluffs and,
wherever you turn, freshly sided homes _ longtimers such as Stenzel
do understand. At least they understand better than folks on high
ground. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They understand that this churning channel, like God, giveth and
taketh away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Downstream in St. Joseph, Brenda Reed doesn't live in a flood
plain and can't even see the river from her home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1993, in their seventh year of marriage, she and Chuck
were beginning to enjoy security. They had bought a new Saturn.
After almost 10 years at Sherwood Medical Industries Inc., Brenda
had risen to quality-control inspector, pulling $11 an hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rains didn't bother her until that first week of July. On
her drive to the plant, she passed National Guardsmen stacking
sandbags. She only stayed at work until noon, when the water
reached 3 inches up the tires of her Saturn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard on the 6 p.m. news that day that the second shift
should not report,'' she recalled. ``That's when all our lives
started to change.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood was one of two St. Joseph employers that closed for
good because of the flood. The shutdowns displaced more than 1,000
workers, and local unemployment jumped to 12 percent. Reed was
rejected for a job at Wal-Mart because she had no high school
diploma, so she spread textbooks on her kitchen table and took six
months of adult education classes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Chuck was laid off from the state transportation
department. The washer and dryer broke down before Christmas.
Brenda turned to Catholic Charities for help in paying a month's
rent and utilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of families I knew split up. My husband and I just stuck
together,'' she said. ``We found out from the flood that we were a
lot stronger than we thought.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Brenda Reed got her GED. Today she is putting in her
fourth year at a tanning company, cutting leather. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   St. Joseph is recovering, too, thanks to a high-powered campaign
to attract new companies with grants, loans and tax credits.
Unemployment has ebbed below 4 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city ``has pulled itself out of the muck,'' /{The Washington
Post/} declared last fall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for Reed, she admits she'd take her old job at Sherwood in a
heartbeat, though she remains bitter. How bitter? One day her
12-year-old son needed stitches after cutting his head, and Reed
made sure the needle wasn't made by Sherwood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A small garden occupies the spot where the home of Lewis and
Clark State Park Superintendent Richard Klein used to stand. He
moved to higher ground. Pointing to a dozen houses remaining on the
north side of Sugar Lake, Klein said, ``You couldn't pay me to live
there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lux is staying on the north side, and the new house he's
building is perched atop 15-foot I-beams. Frankly, he's glad the
others left. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You had these suburban types who moved in, chasing a rainbow,
wanting to live on a lake,'' he said. ``First time it floods,
they're out of here. They're devastated. Like, they didn't know
this was a flood plain?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lux's son turns 5 late this month. Born just as the rains began
to ease in 1993, he was named Sky. &QL;

   ISRAEL-COKE _ JERUSALEM _ Is it the real thing? That's what a
Coca-Cola bottler here is trying to determine. The bottler urged
Israelis on Sunday to ``drink without fear'' despite the recall of
100,000 bottles following the discovery of chemical traces in the
soft drink in two towns. Central Bottling Co Inc began removing the
1-1/2-litre bottles of Coke from shops last week and Israel's
Health Ministry urged the public on Saturday to sniff-test the
bottles for possible contamination. The Israeli bottler insisted
its products and factories were safe. Moshe Wertheim, president of
Central Bottling, told army radio that an investigation would
determine whether the chemicals had seeped through the plastic
bottles because of improper storage or care. He said police were
also investigating the cause. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). EDs: To
move by 3 p.m. EDT.

   FLAFIRES-LOOKBACK _ In 1989, state foresters visited the woody
lots of Palm Coast and asked its residents: exactly how afraid of
wildfire are you? Going door to door, they handed out 200 surveys
to homes most likely to burn if a blaze broke out. Only 94 bothered
to answer. The survey came just four years after a deadly wildfire
season killed two firefighters, burned 443,816 acres and destroyed
131 houses in Palm Coast, a subdivision carved out of forests in
rural Flagler County. Less than half quizzed even knew about the
fires. So is there a lesson to be learned here? (Staletovich, Palm
Beach Post)

<P>
   RYANWHITE _ POMPANO BEACH, Fla. _ Jeanne White knuckled a
teardrop from her cheek as she spoke about greed and exploitation.
``They called me greedy, but their homes would buy ten of mine,''
she said. ``There's nobody more greedy than the Steiners.'' White
believes that Joel Steinger and his brother Steven Steiner (who
altered his name) live in ocean-front homes and drive new Mercedes
Benz sedans because they capitalized on the familiar name of her
late teenage son, Ryan White. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)

   NAACP-SPOTLIGHT _ ATLANTA _ Religion's role in civil rights
movement today (e.g. how receptive religious leades are to NAACP's
efforts to mobilize mass religious support for voter registration

   US-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin had made no secret over the last several
months that they would like to have a summit in the fall. As
Clinton wound down his long trip to China, the word began spreading
that he was leaning toward just such a meeting. After confirming it
on Monday, the White House can expect a wave of criticism from
opponents near the level it received before the China trip. There's
plenty of ammunition: the sickly Russian economy; Kosovo upheaval;
India-Pakistan nuclear race; trade with Iran; NATO expansion; and
space cooperation. Clinton had been awaiting Russia's Parliament to
ratify the SALT II nuclear arms pact, but his decision to go seems
to be aimed at pressuring the Duma into such a ratification vote.

   IRAN-BACKLASH _ TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's conservatives are fighting
back. A year after the election of the moderate but not powerful
President Mohammed Khatami, concerned fundamentalists have arrested
and impeached key supporters. The political climate seems to swing
daily between reform and backlash. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

<P>
   JOURNAL-IRAN _ TEHRAN, Iran _ These are nervous times in Tehran.
I could sense the difference from my last trip in December, when
reformers were gleeful about the prospects for changing their
fundamentalist nation under newly-elected President Mohammed
Khatami. Now, reformers are channel surfing between World Cup
soccer games and the trial of a popular mayor, accused of
corruption by a justice system run by religious hardliners. Though
Tehran is full of articulate, informed people with a lot to say,
slightly fewer wanted to be quoted this time. The day after
watching a World Cup match with a group of young Iranians, one
called and asked that I not tell anyone I was with them. These
days, hanging out with foreign journalists can be controversial,
especially if the evening in question included cassettes of Western
dance music. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). MOVED.

   NEWDEMS _ From millionaire Michael Coles in Georgia to noted

   APRIL-OLIVER _ WASHINGTON _ Her career has been spent behind the
cameras, but her highly public firing by CNN has thrust April
Oliver into the media spotlight. The 8 1/2-month-pregnant Oliver
now spends her days trying to persuade the journalism world that
her firing was unjustified and her story about the U.S. military
using nerve gas to kill defectors in Southeast Asia is true. (Dart,

   NIH _ WASHINGTON _ In the middle of fights over campaign
finances, tobacco legislation and other bones of contention,
President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the Senate
Republican leaders and congressional Democrats all agree on a
fairly major initiative: that the research budget of the National
Institutes of Health should be dramatically increased, even doubled
over the next decade. To officials at Emory University in Atlanta,
which hopes to propel itself into one of the top 10 research
institutions in the country during that time, this is welcome news.

glasses, meditates as the sun rises over his South Palm Beach home,
has had his metal fillings replaced with ceramic ones to reduce

GRASS-ROOTS EFFORT CAN'T SAVE GRASS-ROOTS BRIDGE IN ALLEN COUNTY,
KAN. 
</HEADLINE>
 _ KANSAS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (HUMBOLDT, Kan.) _ Today it's called Slack Creek, but a century
ago, when strong, skilled men gathered on its banks, it had a good
German name, Schleicher's Branch.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of backbreaking work, it had a good German
bridge, too. Those men had assembled seven graceful arches, a
wondrous rock structure held together not by mortar but the simple
physics of compression.
</P>
<P>
   And now, because of simple economics, the Allen County landmark,
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, will be
demolished next year.
</P>
<P>
   Its replacement will be a no-frills, $150,000 box-culvert span
of concrete, wider for the big farm equipment that moves around the
countryside, safer for motorists and a quicker link to Humboldt,
Iola and Chanute.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of what locals call the Seven Arch Bridge saddens
Martha Hagedorn-Krass, architectural historian at the Kansas State
Historical Society in Topeka. She said the register designation
would simply come off when the bridge comes down.
</P>
<P>
   ``A grass-roots effort there to save the bridge was not
enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge itself was a grass-roots affair. In 1898, the year
it's thought the construction began (there are no exact records),
it was a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Then, most folks farmed, so moving crops and commodities to
market meant survival. The creek, which occasionally ran amok, was
a barrier. Allen County said it had no money. So the men _
no-nonsense farmers _ built the span themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb Roehl led the work, with help from William Mueller,
their four sons, and two men named Fred Crane and Fred Fisher. The
crew used the material at hand _ limestone. They quarried it,
shaped it precisely by hand, fitted it together without mortar, and
allowed gravity to tighten and strengthen the structure.
</P>
<P>
   What resulted was a graceful, 156-foot-long, 16-foot-wide bridge
that looks as if it were lifted whole from deep in some German
forest or an isolated Scandinavian dell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always too narrow and carried too low a load limit,''
said William King, Allen County's director of public works. ``But
it did its job.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, King said, a trench for a telephone line was cut
right down the middle of the bridge. The ditching machine sent
vibrations through the structure, which caused a rapid
deterioration of its structural integrity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after inspecting the bridge's deterioration, county
officials closed it by piling boulders at each end. Since then,
residents have been making a three-mile detour and complaining
about the inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   King said the county had four choices:
</P>
<P>
   Do nothing and risk lawsuits; build another bridge next to it,
effectively spoiling the view, and still hazard litigation with a
nearby ``attractive nuisance''; renovate it for at least $300,000
with no guarantee anyone could do the work; or carefully document
the bridge through photographs and measurements, then tear it down.
</P>
<P>
   That last option was the one taken by Allen County
commissioners. King said that he'd had a couple of letters in
opposition to the decision but ``that most people understand this
county just doesn't have the money to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be different if this bridge was downtown in Iola,'' King
said. ``Say, over a creek there. Where it could be quaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``But out here in the country, with all the big farm equipment
and vehicles moving around, it's just too small. Even if we did
restore it _ and who says we could find people who'd have the skill
those old-timers did? _ we'd have to put a new deck on it. And
that'd ruin its looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that about 50 vehicles a day will use the new
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Hagedorn-Krass said her office had pointed out to King's office
that some federal funds were available for restoration of the
bridge, ``but that didn't seem to interest them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need is a commitment to save the bridge, and that was
never strong enough in the local area,'' she added. ``So now we're
doing mitigation _ large format photography and measurements so we
know exactly what has been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that the bridge would have been torn down eight years
ago without a local effort to place the bridge on the National
Historic Register.
</P>
<P>
   Charley Roehl, 76, Gottlieb Roehl's grandson, also is
disappointed the old bridge will come down. Born 18 years after his
grandfather died in 1903, he said his father, Fred Roehl, worked on
the structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing was that he never really talked about what it
was like when they did it,'' said Charley Roehl. ``They just built
it. Period. That's the way they did things then.''
</P>
<P>
   Roehl said his grandfather spoke German and was a stonemason in
the old country. After immigrating here, he bought 320 acres of
rocky land just south of the bridge. The family story was that old
Gottlieb, who died soon after the bridge was completed, just had
too much stonemason in him to buy any other kind of land.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Gerken, 77, a Humboldt resident who's taken an interest
in the bridge, thinks most of the work was done in the winter when
the farmers had time on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people forget is that the creek where the bridge is runs
over solid rock,'' Gerken said. ``Without that footing, that old
bridge would have sunk into the muck years ago. And it helped make
it as strong as it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerken said the lack of mortar in the bridge didn't surprise
him, even though nearby Iola, Humboldt and Chanute became huge
producers of cement at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roehl and Mueller were both skilled stonemasons,'' Gerken
said. ``Cement was almost brand new. I doubt if they even thought
of it. First, they likely didn't have any money for it. More
important, they knew stone. They didn't need it. Not to build a
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   King said there had been discussions of offering stones from the
bridge to anyone who might want them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Souvenirs,'' he said.

LINDA GERMANO: STRUMMING THAT STRIKES EMOTIONAL CHORDS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN:Ind.) (js) 
By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was story time at the Knitting Factory on
Wednesday night as Lisa Germano came onstage to find a roomful of
people perched cross-legged at her feet. ``I like this place with
you sitting on the floor,'' she said. ``You could actually lay
down. I would be honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Germano encouraged her audience to assume the therapeutic
position as a joke, but a telling one. The Indiana-born singer and
songwriter has relentlessly focused on the processes of denial and
justification that allow people to go on loving their neuroses. She
could be branded a confessional artist, but she does not offer
finished explanations of herself; instead, she picks apart such
arguments, using repetition and fragmentation to reproduce the
mind's defense mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   Singing as if to herself, playing rudimentary chords on the
piano or electric guitar, Ms. Germano pulled at a tangle of mixed
emotions. ``All my mistakes, woven in a rug, black, blue and
dusty,'' she sang in ``No Colors Here,'' from her fifth album,
``Shine'' (4AD), to be released this month. `Is there a beauty
there?'' This question has been raised by artists before,
especially within the female modernist tradition that started with
Virginia Woolf and extends to writers like Carole Maso and
songwriters like Jane Siberry. What Ms. Germano brings to this
genre is a Midwestern plain-spokenness and a musical sense that
isn't as amateurish as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   In this solo performance, Ms. Germano mostly stayed at the
piano, where her playing recalled the sounds of childhood, nursery
rhymes and ice cream trucks. Juxtaposing music that invokes
innocence with lyrics that reveal self-hatred and doubt, Ms.
Germano's songs revealed just how comfortable familiar assumptions
can be, even when they drag downward. ``He knows my love runs
deeper than my feelings,'' she sang in one of her many examinations
of dysfunctional relationships. Such love, the song suggested, is
more a bad habit than a true emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shine'' suggests that Ms. Germano is ready to move on to the
risky ambiguities of hope. Although she answered the question in
``No Colors Here'' with a resounding ``no,'' and ``Guillotine''
chronicled the shock of emotional loss _ ``After you're gone, where
are my arms?'' she sang _ other songs tentatively explored
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Her fans laughed at ``Wood Floors,'' a suspicious glance at
domestic contentment, as if they were having as much trouble
believing Ms. Germano's new mood as she was. The songs on ``Shine''
are more convincing when fleshed out on record; Tchad Blake's
delicate production adds much that wasn't clear from this sometimes
monotonous show. But for all her skepticism about the promise of
happiness, Ms. Germano's tiny steps in that direction offered her
compelling new psychologies to deconstruct.

   It was the West's earliest victory in the Cold War and an
exhilarating hour in the long face-off between communism and
democracy. ``The Berlin Airlift'' takes us back 50 years to when a
defeated and divided Germany was the main arena of confrontation
between the Soviet Union and the Western allies. It may be only a
historical footnote now, but as Monday night's spirited documentary
confirms, the West's stand with the people of Berlin against a
Soviet takeover still brightens the memories of those who delivered
the goods.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was set by the post-World War II splitting of Germany
into Western and Eastern sections. Berlin, stranded in the Eastern
zone, was itself divided among the four victorious powers: the
United States, Britain and France on one side and the Soviet Union
on the other. Soon, with the collapse of the wartime alliance,
Moscow stepped up the pressure on its former allies to leave
Berlin, mounting a blockade of the city that left only air routes
open to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The allies, led by Harry Truman and the U.S. commander Gen.
Lucius Clay, resisted, and the story is told mainly by the American
and British pilots who were pressed into a round-the-clock supply
airlift that moved from what one calls a ``hasty, helter-skelter
beginning'' to an astoundingly smooth operation. Despite bad
weather and buzzing Soviet planes, the shipments built steadily
from basics like coal and dried food (the transports were filthy
and stank of fish) to everything from heavy equipment to cigarettes
to toys and candy. One pilot, Gail Halvorsen, was known to German
children as ``the chocolate bomber.'' Another pilot says of the
demanding schedule (one plane took off every three minutes), ``You
became like a bus driver.''
</P>
<P>
   With Berliners pitching in to unload the planes, self-interest
created a new alliance between the former enemies. ``We were
buddies now,'' a pilot says, and West Berlin became a symbol of
democratic aspirations behind the Iron Curtain. When the harsh
winter of 1948 stirred uncertainty over whether the planes could
continue fulfilling their mission, president Truman reportedly
overruled his skeptical advisers. He said, ``We're going to stay in
Berlin,'' and stay they did.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit was catching. There's Irving Berlin entertaining the
troops in occupied Germany with a song called ``Operation
Vittles.'' By the spring of 1949, when the Soviet Union ended the
blockade, the transports had flown 277,000 flights. Casualties,
mostly from accidents, were light. A pilot sums up the achievement:
``We saved a city without firing a shot.''

FAMILY BURIES AIRMAN WHOSE REMAINS WERE IN THE TOMB OF THE
UNKNOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ America's unknown soldier from the Vietnam War was
buried Saturday, surrounded by family, friends, dignitaries and
some who simply wanted to show they cared. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1st Lt. Michael Blassie _ 26 years after death and 14 years
after his remains were placed in the Tomb of the Unknowns _ was
finally laid to rest by his family and country. He was hailed as a
hero, role model and symbol of hope among families of this nation's
missing in action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blassie died in Vietnam after his plane was shot down during a
1972 bombing run. In 1984, his remains were placed in the Tomb of
the Unknowns to symbolize the unidentified dead from that war.
High-tech DNA testing this year gave those remains a name and led
to Saturday's burial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a cool morning, beneath thick gray clouds, an estimated 3,000
people turned out at the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery to
bury Blassie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt and military leaders, as well as
old friends and old soldiers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wrinkle of St. Louis showed up in a black POW T-shirt and
camouflage pants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know him, but I'm a Vietnam vet and I thought it was
important to pay my respects,'' he said. ``I never got over to the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. I came here seeking some closure.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony began with the song ``Amazing Grace'' and Blassie's
family stepping from black limousines to take seats under a tent
and surrounded by headstones commemorating 130,000 other war
veterans. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The family was followed by six Air Force pallbearers, who slowly
carried the flag-covered coffin from a hearse to the burial spot.
As they set the coffin down, four F-15s in formation screamed
above. The front fighter jet, which peeled up and away to symbolize
the lost soldier, was quickly lost in the clouds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's sister, Air Force Reserve Capt. Pat Blassie, said that
because of the circumstances of her brother's long-overdue return
to St. Louis, the family thought it was essential to share his
burial with the public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Tomb of the Unknowns, he didn't belong only to us, but
to everyone,'' she said. ``We are so thankful you wanted to join us
here in a celebration of his life.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other siblings spoke of the pain of losing him in 1972 and how,
until his remains were identified, they still dreamed he lived. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they also spoke about their feelings after he was
identified. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked myself what's so important about just six bones,'' Pat
Blassie said. ``Well, it was important because he was my
brother.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But she said she also turned to the Bible and found meaning in
that Joseph had insisted his remains be taken out of Egypt for
burial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an important promise we make to all those who risk
their lives for our freedom,'' she said, ``that we won't forget
about them and leave them behind.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The family also spoke of the overwhelming support and
condolences they received, especially letters detailing memories
from their brother's old friends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two old friends from the Air Force wrote to say they had named
sons after Blassie. A third told how Blassie had introduced him to
soccer, and how he had now gone on to run a soccer program for
2,000 children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And family members spoke of the importance of God to them at
this time, and how they believed his identification was a sign that
Americans should work hard to bring peace to other families still
waiting for the remains of a loved one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We give all the glory to God for bringing Michael, an American
hero, home at last,'' Pat Blassie said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the ceremony closed to the strains of a mournfully slow
version of ``Taps'' and seven rifles were fired three times each in
a 21-gun salute, Blassie's mother accepted an American flag, folded
into a triangle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's remains were buried among a group of graves for World
War II veterans, only a dozen yards from a headstone for three
young fliers who died in a bombing run over Germany. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery officials said that the spot of his headstone was
traditionally the site of their Memorial Day services and that,
beyond family memorials, he would be remembered each year with a
small American flag placed by local Boy Scouts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blassie was 24 when he died. He was a recipient of the Silver
Star for gallantry in action, the Distinguished Flying Cross, a
Purple Heart for wounds received in action and an Air Medal with
Four Oak Leaf Cluster for meritorious achievement during flight. &QL;

CRANKO'S `ROMEO AND JULIET': HARD ON PERFORMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Cranko and Kenneth MacMillan seem to have a
corner on the ``Romeo and Juliet'' market, at least so far as dance
in New York is concerned. The Cranko production, presented by the
Stuttgart Ballet at the New York State Theater on Saturday
afternoon and evening, is less theatrical than the MacMillan
staging, created three years later, in 1965. Cranko's characters
also tend to be more recognizably human and less prone to
larger-than-life bursts of passion and pyrotechnical display.
</P>
<P>
   The small touches of extra humanity are endearing, but Cranko's
simplicity places a special burden on the performers. There is very
little for them to hide behind as actors. The Stuttgart's powerful,
wrenching performance of ``Onegin'' on Friday night promised much
for these two closing performances of the company's Lincoln Center
Festival season. But though well danced, ``Romeo and Juliet,'' set
to the Prokofiev score, was for the most part dramatically bland on
Saturday. And this is a ballet that cries out for identification
with the characters, from the performers and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Kramer and Ivan Cavallari, the matinee leads, were
affecting in the sheer youthfulness of their interpretations.
Cavallari's Romeo was a puppy whose playful, heedless exuberance
had not yet been trained out of him by life. Ms. Kramer was a
little more knowing, as ballet Juliets tend to be, but empathic and
pretty enough to be convincingly alluring. Their youthful sweetness
brought extra color to the balcony pas de deux, with its exquisite
airborne, sharp-angled lifts.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Tewsley and Sue Jin Kang, the evening's leads, were most
affecting in the desperate bedroom pas de deux, when Romeo must
leave Juliet after their first night together. Ms. Kang suddenly
came to dramatic life, suggesting that this Juliet, alone and
entrapped, knew she would never see her love alive again. But while
Ms. Kramer and Cavallari never grew enough as characters to reach
the necessary tragic grandeur, Ms. Kang and Tewsley failed to
prepare one for that climax.
</P>
<P>
   The scrappy Mercutios were a touchingly innocent Thomas Lempertz
(matinee) and a more playful Krzysztof Novogrodzki (evening). Both
Benvolios, Filip Barankievicz (matinee) and Alexander Zaitsev
(evening), had something of Tewsley's creamy amiability. Marcia
Haydee, the company's former prima ballerina and director, once
more nearly stole the show as Lady Capulet, a mama not to be messed
with.
</P>
<P>
   Ludmilla Bogart, Juliet's sensible, loving nurse at both
performances, embodied Cranko's human touch, in a lead cast
completed by Lior Lev and Ugur Seyrek as the surly matinee and
evening Tybalt, Douglas Lee as a weedy young matinee Paris, and
Ivan Gil Ortega as the evening's more calculating fiance. Kanako
Sakamoto stood out in the corps for her juicily articulated
dancing. James Tuggle conducted.

 &HT;    Atlanta plays host to National Black Arts Festival
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar and Sonia Murra
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shortly after 10 a.m. Friday in the Atlanta
Renaissance Hotel downtown, the first panel of the ten-day National
Black Arts Festival was already taking notice of this gathering's
importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is history,'' began author Barbara Smith, the moderator
of ``Conversation: The Direction of Gay and Lesbian Literature.''
``You'll be telling your grandchildren that you witnessed this.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment Smith was referring to a panel that included
million-plus seller E. Lynn Harris (``Invisible Life''), James Earl
Hardy (``B-Boy Blues''), recent two-time Lambda Award winner Lisa
C. Moore (``does your mama know '') and Kathleen E. Morris
(``Speaking In Whispers'').
</P>
<P>
   But hers was a sentiment being echoed throughout the various
sites of the sprawling biennial festival on the opening weekend of
its tenth anniversary event.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Levy was one of the few in front of the main stage at the
Roots and Branches Folk Art &AMP; Vendor Market in Atlanta's Piedmont
Park Saturday who was not beating the heat under a tree. She said
she stumbled on the event as she and two friends were walking
through the park. She took a seat as the Praise House Shouters of
South Carolina, whose members are all over 70, began their
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just out here to share in this great experience and be a
part of the community,'' said the 29-year-old. ``I mean, we are all
one community.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a community that has gathered in large numbers, noted Allen
Grose of Washington, D.C. His wife Doris sold their wood sculptures
at the 1996 Roots and Branches festival, which was staged on Auburn
Avenue. ``The people came, and bought, but many mentioned they
didn't really like the area it was in,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we're here in the park this time, even though the
crowd seems to be moving in slowly, but surely.''
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon Saturday, a few hundred people had been drawn
to the free event, which opened with a ceremonial drum procession
and continued with hour-long sets from blues and zydeco acts. The
site made a more appealing public space than Sweet Auburn, where
the music was too easily overlooked. At Piedmont Park, the stage is
front and center, even if much that surrounds it is the usual
kitsch and corndogs.
</P>
<P>
   The heat index made air-conditioned Greenbriar Mall an almost
uncomfortably crowded place all weekend. ``Any Saturday is a busy
Saturday in a mall,'' said Travis Davis, supervisor of the
southwest Atlanta mall's Peppermint Music. ``But this is
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   This was also different. Along the length of the mall, the
NBAF's Artists' Market was set up, offering mostly paintings,
jewelry and clothing from across the country. Luckily, Durham,
N.C.'s John Keith didn't have to drive that far to pick up his
print of Atlanta artist Maurice Evans' ``Trio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be back at work on Sunday so I came down Friday to
try to take in as much as I could,'' said the 30-year-old, who had
also been to Friday's opening ceremony at the Atlanta Civic Center
and to Underground Atlanta _where the Doll Exhibition &AMP; Artists'
Market is being held.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just aren't many opportunities to take in so much,''
Keith added. ``So it was worth the time on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Painter Wayne Manns of Bloomington, Ind. could have stayed at
home and offered his wares at the Black Expo. ``But I had heard
about the crowds that come to the National Black Arts Festival, I
believed it, I came, and now I'm seeing it,'' said Manns, who had
sold two pieces in the first few hours. ``There's a lot of people
looking and expressing interest, but cash registers are ringing all
over and I am overwhelmed. It is so great to see our people
supporting the arts and supporting each other.''
</P>
<P>
   A week before the kick-off of this year's festival, budgeted at
$2.6 million, NBAF marketing director Carlos James reported sales
of nearly 3,000 tickets. But nearly 5,000 people packed the opening
ceremony that featured poet Maya Angelou, signaling a robust start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we're pleased,'' said James in the crowded lobby of the
festival's main venue, the Renaissance Hotel. The NBAF hopes to
attract 1.5 million people by the time it closes Sunday . ``We seem
to be on pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of space is what the festival was late Saturday, as Sunday
morning approached. By 12:05 a.m. organizers were turning
ticketholders away from the midnight performance by monologuist and
Performance Art program curator Phyllis Yvonne Stickney. The
150-capacity hotel meeting room was oversold. A 1:30 a.m. show had
to be added.
</P>
<P>
   Among the attendees for the second show was comedian George
Wallace, who remarked: ``Look around, (there's) old and young black
people hanging together, supporting one another. With the NAACP
(convention) in town this is the blackest city in the country at
this moment. And it's a beautiful thing.''

 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service PASADENA, Calif. _ Ted Turner has just
<TEXT>
ordered lunch, slipped off his suit jacket and confessed
matter-of-factly that he wants to save the world.
<P>
   He seems to be referring to the the whole world, mind you, not
just the parts he owns outright, which is a pretty good-sized
chunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more money than I can spend intelligently, so what else
should I be doing with my life?'' he wonders aloud _ and loudly _
while waiting for his chicken quesadillas to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   World-saving, or at least Turner's version of it, drove him to
spend nearly four years on ``Cold War,'' a 24-part documentary that
will debut Sept. 27 on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that younger people would rather watch
'Seinfeld' but they don't understand the Cold War,'' says the CNN
founder and co-chairman of Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most expensive war the world has ever seen and it
was the most dangerous because it endangered every man, woman and
child on the planet. If they don't understand the past, they won't
know where they're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who arrived here Friday to unveil his pet project to a
convention of television writers, called the documentary ``the most
important piece of television in the past decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But he spent much of his visit apologizing profusely for
the ill-fated story of the moment: The Tailwind report on CNN's
newsmagazine ``NewsStand'' that had alleged deadly nerve gas was
dropped by U.S. forces on Laos during the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tailwind was just an unfortunate thing that happened in the
last couple of weeks,'' Turner says during lunch. ``But it's old
news, and everything that can be said about Tailwind has been said.
Tailwind is ending, the Cold War is the new news.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's idea for the massive ``Cold War'' was inspired by
British filmmaker Jeremy Isaacs' ``The World At War,'' a landmark
1974 documentary about World War II. Turner says he was so
impressed, he handpicked Isaacs to produce ``Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   The globe-trotting documentary examines the 45-year long
struggle from the perspective of those who shaped it, and lived
through it. They include Mikhail Gorbachav, Fidel Castro and U.S.
presidents Gerald Ford, George Bush and Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   At its exhaustive length, Turner says he's aware viewers may
consider that watching the ``Cold War'' will be the television
equivalent of eating their broccoli. But even if they don't devour
it in one sitting, he hopes they will nibble on it over time and
ultimately digest its importance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the telecast, there's a companion book, a CD-ROM,
and a website on CNN Interactive (CNN.com/Cold War). Turner says
video copies of ``Cold War'' will be made available to schools and
unversities here and abroad, and will be sold as a boxed set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people are going to buy the videos, and we'll
have to figure out how to run it again and we'll keep running it.
The one thing about this is that it's timeless. People will be
interested in it 100 years from now.''

   Standup comic and ubiquitous MTV personality Bill Bellamy will
lend his voice to the title character in ``Skeeter's Show,'' a new
kid's program that combines puppetry and live-action next season on
Nickelodeon. Bellamy's felt-and-styrofoam character uses hip-hop
phrases like ``getting jiggy'' and has a crew of high-profile
friends who will make guest appearances, including Los Angeles
Laker Shaquille O'Neal, R&AMP;B singer Usher and former ``Martin''
co-star Tisha Campbell.

   TV Land will bring Norman Lear's ``All in The Family'' to its
prime-time oldies schedule this fall. On Oct .5, fans of the sitcom
will see one of three lost pilots filmed for the show that never
aired. The episode features Archie Bunker (Carroll O'Connor)
insulting his Irish son-in-law, before Rob Reiner joined the cast
permanently as the lovably liberal loser Mike ``Meathead'' Stivic.
TV Land will kick off the show's launch with a marathon Oct. 12-16.
Also being added to the reto network's lineup are square-jawed cop
dramas ``Dragnet'' and ``Adam 12.''

   Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys will be featured in ``Endless
Harmony: The Beach Boys and Their Music,'' a documentary by VH1 set
to debut Aug. 23. Wilson, the only surviving brother who formed the
core of the band whose feel-good music brought out the surfer in
all of us, appeared at the Television Critics Association
convention in Pasadena. Moving stiffly and looking pale, Wilson
said he has overcome the problems with drugs and a ``nervous
breakdown'' that nearly ended his life and career. He's recorded a
new album and expects to be touring again soon.

SWEET, DELICIOUS WALLA WALLA ONIONS HAVE ARRIVED TO TEMPT TASTE
BUDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GBREGORY ROBERTS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So sweet, you can eat them like apples!
</P>
<P>
   So sweet, they won't reduce you to tears!
</P>
<P>
   It's Walla Walla onion season again, a time when the juicy
regional treasures stream into grocery-store produce bins in the
Pacific Northwest and consumers snap them up for topping burgers or
bolstering salads. And if not quite as sweet as a ripe Red
Delicious, they certainly are milder than their garden-variety
cousins.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that is the high water content of Walla Wallas
and other sweet onions, which dilutes the pungent, tear-producing
sulfuric compounds in the pulp. The flip side of succulence is
shorter shelf life: Sweet onions bruise more easily and spoil far
more quickly than ``dry'' onions, which are bred for durability.
</P>
<P>
   Authentic Walla Wallas grow only in Walla Walla County in
southeastern Washington and adjoining parts of Umatilla County in
northeastern Oregon. Harvest of the early varieties begins in
mid-June, and the season stays strong till late July. Some late
varieties are picked in mid-August and may be available into early
September.
</P>
<P>
   One way to extend enjoyment of Walla Wallas is through proper
selection and storage. Start by picking onions that are round, with
elongated necks, and with dry, paper-thin skin without bruises. If
kept in a cool, well-ventilated spot, they can last up to six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The stored onions should not touch one another. They may be
spread on chicken wire or mesh. Another technique puts worn-out
pantyhose to good use: Drop an onion down a leg, knot the hose
above the onion, then drop in another onion, knot the hose, and so
on; hang the hose and snip beneath the lowest knot to use.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet onions also may be wrapped in foil in the refrigerator to
prolong their life. And they may be frozen: Chop the onions and
spread them on a cookie sheet in the freezer; when frozen, seal
them in bags or containers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nature of a sweet onion argues for eating them as
fresh as possible, cooks may incorporate them in relishes or sauces
to summon up the onions' savor out of season. Refrigeration will
keep those preparations for a few weeks; freezing or canning can
preserve them for months.
</P>
<P>
   Walla Walla sweet onions trace their lineage to the island of
Corsica, a French possession in the Mediterranean Sea near Italy.
In the late 1800s, a French soldier took the seeds of an Italian
sweet onion from Corsica to Walla Walla.
</P>
<P>
   Growing in rich, well-watered volcanic soil, the onions
flourished in the warm days and cool nights of the region and
developed an identity ultimately protected by a federal
agricultural regulation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Walla Wallas are not the only sweet onions, and Corsican seeds
are not the only source. Seeds from a given onion variety will
yield a crop with different characteristics in different growing
regions, and other onions with above-average levels of water and
sugar and below-average levels of sulfur have earned sweet
reputations of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are Vidalias from Georgia, Mauis from Hawaii,
Carzalias from New Mexico, Texas 1015s, OSO Sweets from Chile and
Sweet Imperials and Italian Reds from California. Seasons vary, and
availability and distribution may be limited.
</P>

IN DES MOINES, ART IS SERVED MAINSTREAM, NOT SUBVERSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ It was a bit of Americana, stirring and
sincere. Sockless, in baggy shorts and a tennis shirt as though
fresh from a holiday barbecue, the governor himself, Terry
Branstad, stood on the Capitol's steps and introduced the Des
Moines Symphony to some 20,000 Iowans gathered on the lawn and in
the parking lot. This was the night before Independence Day, the
occasion of an annual concert here. Rain clouds sprinkled a few
drops on the crowd, but didn't dare spoil the party, dispersing as
the evening darkened.
</P>
<P>
   In the fading light, the gold dome of the Capitol glinted, even
under its scaffolding. And by the time the orchestra rendered a
George Cohan medley; a tone poem by its guest artist, Mark
O'Connor, a country fiddler, and reached the climax of the ``1812
Overture,'' many in the audience were cheering the musicians and
waving tiny flags. Des Moines takes ardent pride in both its
cultural institutions and its mainstream values.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, therein lies a conflict. Although audiences in Des
Moines, a city of 400,000 people with a healthy corporate base,
have supported their symphony, their well-regarded opera company,
their world-class art museum and their community theater for more
than a quarter-century (and dozens of others for not quite so
long), no one is claiming the city as a hotbed of experimentation
or even as terribly tolerant of art that leans to the subversive.
It was only a decade or so ago that a patron stood up at a
performance of ``A Chorus Line'' at the Civic Center of Greater Des
Moines, demanded that the profanity be halted immediately and had
to be escorted from the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ```Angels in America' would not play well here,'' said Jeff
Chelesvig, the general manager of the Civic Center, which is the
city's only site for professional theater. ``I'd love to do it, but
I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the role of the arts in Des Moines is a curious one,
characterized by cultural officials as both a strength and a
weakness of a community that is generally enthusiastic if narrowly
focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think there's a general perception here that the arts are
supposed to be entertainment,'' said Kenneth Hopper, the executive
director of the symphony, who, like other cultural officials in
town, sees himself as an educator of a sort. The symphony featured
seven world premieres last season, well received, Hopper said,
though he added that it thrills him when people applaud between
movements of a Beethoven symphony, because it means the audience is
full of new members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera is not indigenous to Iowa, but I've felt proud of our
audiences,'' said Jerilee Mace, director of the 26-year-old Des
Moines Metro Opera in Indianola, a dozen miles to the south, which
has 1,500 subscribers. ``They're growing into an appreciation of an
unusual repertoire.''
</P>
<P>
   That would apply to a current production, Lee Hoiby's adaptation
of ``Summer and Smoke.'' After each performance, delighted patrons
swarm the lobby to meet the performers, still in costume, a company
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Most people acknowledge that, unlike the two major university
towns nearby _ Ames, home of Iowa State, to the north, and Iowa
City to the east, where the University of Iowa (and the renowned
Iowa Writers Workshop) is located _ Des Moines is more a center of
capitalism than intellectual ferment, an indistinct place that
struggles with the image of blandness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from Des Moines,'' Bill Bryson wrote at the beginning
of his dyspeptic travel book, ``The Lost Continent''
(HarperCollins). ``Somebody had to.'' And though Bryson may not be
held in particularly grand repute in his hometown, he isn't
disputed much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just like the rest of the country,'' said Louise Noun,
an art collector who specializes in work by women. ``Same crime,
same culture, just in smaller quantities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Noun, it must be said, however, is pretty distinctive
herself, having turned 90 in March, just after serving as curator
for a show of an early 20th-century Iowa painter, Agnes Weinrich,
at the Des Moines Art Center. (It travels to the Provincetown Art
Museum in Massachusetts next month.)
</P>
<P>
   Preferring Poetry to Auto Racing
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, other local residents who defy the
mainstream cultural stereotype. One is James Autry, a former
president of the Meredith magazine group here (Meredith Corp.
publishes Better Homes and Gardens and other magazines), and the
author of several management books and a book of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, irritated that a group of businessmen had
sponsored a Grand Prix auto race in town, Autry helped found the
Des Moines National Poetry Festival, which has brought poets like
Galway Kinnell, Carolyn Forche and Czeslaw Milosz for weekends of
readings and workshops. More than 800 people took part in the
eighth annual event in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm pleased to say, as a postscript, that the Grand Prix
is out of business,'' Autry said.
</P>
<P>
   Another offbeat arts entrepreneur is John Gaps III, an
Associated Press photographer and the author of ``God Left Us Alone
Here'' (Lone Oak Press), a collection of his photos from war zones
with accompanying poems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Des Moines is,'' Gaps said. ``It doesn't
have enough of any one influence to be any one thing. There's not a
preponderance of pain here, but there is a preponderance of
introspection.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaps is plumbing that introspective vein; he has started both a
small publishing house and a literary magazine, Stand Alone,
devoted primarily to Iowa writers. ``The most prestigious literary
publication in Iowa is The Iowa Review,'' he said, ``and there's no
one from Iowa in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The main influence on the culture of Des Moines, however, is
commerce. A center of insurance and agribusiness, the city has a
downtown where 65,000 people go to work every day, more than in
Kansas City, Detroit or Phoenix. Companies like Meredith, Principal
Financial Group (which commissioned a sculpture by Maya Lin for its
corporate headquarters) and Pioneer Hi-Bred International are the
primary benefactors of the city's cultural institutions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Cultural Groups as a Selling Point
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer, for example, the world's largest seed-corn producer,
endows a string quartet, the only four salaried players in the Des
Moines Symphony. Part of this is enlightened self-interest,
perhaps. Recruiting executives and technically trained workers has
become difficult in Des Moines, where unemployment is less than 2
percent, so many companies are reaching out nationally. A local
study showing that Des Moines has more cultural organizations per
capita than cities like Austin, Texas, and Portland, Ore., is
regarded as a selling point.
</P>
<P>
   The arts scene, said Eric Fogg, the program manager for
community development at Pioneer, ``comes up in most interviews,
and if it doesn't come up, we'll bring it up, because we're pleased
with the quality and quantity of the arts in Des Moines.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as in many other cities that have expanded away from the
center, downtown more or less clears out after dark. And though
situated prettily at the junction of the Des Moines and Raccoon
Rivers, the city has acres of riverfront that have gone
unexploited.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the city has only just begun to address the
lifelessness at its heart at night, with proposals pending before
the local government to create a downtown arts district, establish
incentives for converting abandoned warehouses to residential
lofts, and build an entertainment center that would include a
24-screen movie complex, restaurants, shops and nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resources are here to invest in culture and
entertainment,'' said David Feehan, president of the Downtown
Partnership, an organization of businesses. ``The likelihood is
that we'll build $750 million worth of stuff downtown in the coming
years.''
</P>
<P>
   This is encouraging talk, given the relative noninvolvement of
the government; frustrated by the lack of support, the city's
cultural institutions have recently formed an alliance to begin
seeking funds from the suburbs. On the state level, Iowa ranks 42nd
among 56 states and territories in arts dollars spent per capita.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government support is terrible, pathetic,'' said David
Kruidenier, 77, the former chairman of Cowles Media Co., which
owned The Des Moines Register before it was sold to Gannett in
1985. ``Iowa is kind of an odd place. It's been so agriculturally
oriented that I think the arts have been viewed as frivolous. But
there has been a change among business leaders, a recognition that
we haven't paid enough attention to esthetics.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruidenier was among those who selected I.M. Pei, in the 1960s,
and Richard Meier, in the '80s, to create new wings for the Des
Moines Art Center, whose main building was designed by Eliel
Saarinen in 1948. The first museum built in the United States after
World War II, it stands on a rolling, city-owned greensward west of
downtown. Most residents consider it the city's cultural jewel,
though it seems to be appreciated by a remarkably insular group; of
its 110,000 visitors a year, 90 percent are Iowans, said Jessica
Rowe, the acting director.
</P>
<P>
   What others are missing is a collection that holds, among dozens
of works by 20th-century masters, the Edward Hopper painting
``Automat,'' which is featured on a 32-cent stamp; a white square
by Robert Ryman much like the bone of contention in the Tony
Award-winning play ``Art,'' and ``Amazing Juggler,'' by Kuniyoshi
Yasuo, which Nikita Khrushchev once stood before in Moscow as he
denounced modern art.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable Art With a Dash of Humor
</P>
<P>
   The Pei wing, a contemporary sculpture court, is particularly
lively, with arresting pieces by Donald Judd and Claes Oldenburg
(whose giant umbrella in front of the Civic Center downtown makes
him well represented in Des Moines).
</P>
<P>
   An installation by Red Grooms, depicting a booth at the Iowa
State Fair, includes busts done in vegetables of native Iowans like
John Wayne and Herbert Hoover, and indicates that, if anything,
Iowans will tolerate a little humor about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A current exhibition of Iowa artists is an eclectic group of
works, including paintings, kinetic sculptures and photographs. But
at least one artist featured in the show, Sarah Grant-Hutchison,
seemed a quintessential representative of Des Moines. An abstract
painter who has had exhibitions in many regional museums, she was
asked 12 years ago by a Meredith publication, Weekend Woodworker,
to design a wooden nativity scene. She balked at first, but agreed
when she was told her fee would be $500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her painting, she now runs Sticks, a company that
makes original furniture with wood-burned and painted designs,
employing 55 people and represented by 125 galleries around the
country. Sales last year were $2.5 million, and the company, having
outgrown its studio, is putting up a new building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to love the business end of things,'' Ms.
Grant-Hutchison said, as mainstream an American artist as perhaps
there is. ``It's as creative and challenging for me as my
painting.''

TINA BROWN EDITS HER CAREER TO MATCH THE ZEITGEIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER with GERALDINE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of all the documents that passed over Tina Brown's
desk in June, two received particular attention. One was the
proposed five-year contract that would ensure she remained The New
Yorker's editor through mid-2003. The other was Brill's Content,
the ballyhooed new magazine about the press.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was an invitation to continue to edit the magazine
whose words had set it apart as an intellectual arbiter and whose
balance sheet _ over which she had little control _ had set it
apart as a financial sinkhole. Brill's Content was proof that
alternatives existed, that a high-profile editor with well-endowed
backers could create a magazine with instant impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of intrigued by the Brill label and the things he
had been able to do,'' Ms. Brown said in an interview. ``They did
give me additional impetus'' to think about alternatives. And
Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of the film production company
Miramax, was aggressively seeking to enlist her to create a
magazine and a company, which she would partly own.
</P>
<P>
   At Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications, she remained
close to the chief executive, S.I. Newhouse Jr., but her influence
no longer matched her ambitions. To the outside world, The New
Yorker's editor was winning the public-relations battle with Conde
Nast's chief executive, Steven T. Florio, over who deserved the
blame for The New Yorker's financial woes. But within the company,
Florio increasingly got his way. She did not, and she felt
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   And Weinstein wanted her to do something she had never done, to
shape a magazine _ ``put down the editorial DNA,'' in Ms. Brown's
phrase. She would be both an owner and a participant in the profits
of the individual films or books spun off from the magazine
articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why be the owned star, if you can be the star owner?'' asked
Stephen Schiff, a screenwriter who is a friend of the editor.
</P>
<P>
   That may be an easier question to answer than the questions of
the entertainment executives who admire Ms. Brown, but do not
admire magazines. Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom Inc.,
said: ``Entertainment companies are moving away from print. They
are simply not that interested.'' But he added that if anyone could
pull off such a venture, it would be Tina Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Others who attended this weekend's annual Sun Valley meeting of
media company executives asked what good ownership is, when quality
magazines can cost $10 million, $20 million, $30 million or more to
start and often lose money for five years.
</P>
<P>
   And among journalists, eyebrows were raised about the up-front
effort to tie the fact-based craft of nonfiction to the
fantasy-based world of film. ``If the stated purpose of this is to
develop entertainment packages, that's not what journalism is,''
said Bill Kovach, the curator of the Nieman Foundation.
``Journalists survey the world to inform the citizen, not with the
idea of creating a property to entertain the citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of skepticism did not deter Ms. Brown, who said: ``I
certainly don't intend to ever compromise the journalistic
integrity of the magazine for an end game with Hollywood. If I did,
it would have a short life.''
</P>
<P>
   What she intends is to recreate the successes of her 20-year
editing career. At Tatler, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, she
constantly put new geist in the Zeitgeist. Last week, she edited
her career with the same instinct for emerging trends. Like Brill,
she is setting out to defy the odds that a new magazine will get
lost in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Like Geraldine B. Laybourne, the leading force in children's
television programming who left Walt Disney Co. and ABC last month,
Ms. Brown is leaving a large corporation to work for herself.
(Although it is also true that Ms. Brown's new company, as a unit
of Miramax, will ultimately fall under the large corporate umbrella
of Walt Disney Co.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Martha Stewart, the multimedia arbiter of all things
tasteful, Ms. Brown and her partners hope to make a magazine the
core of a lucrative empire encompassing books, movies and
television productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been an editor in chief for 20 years,'' Ms. Brown said.
``If a job was what I was going to be doing, this was the best job
in the world. But I had reached the point in my life when I wanted
to do more than a job.'' She added: ``Just thinking about this
week's magazine, fun and exciting as it was, wasn't enough to keep
me intellectually challenged. I wanted to grow in a more lateral
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, whose resume contains little in the way of financial
background, sought out Ron Galotti, the publisher of Vogue, to talk
to Weinstein. ``I said I really need to have a business partner
with me to ascertain that this isn't just high-concept without
having its feet in nitty-gritty land,'' she said. In the end,
Galotti decided to join her as a part owner of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that was so unique about this was that it made sense
right away,'' he said. ``It's not some far-fetched idea that
required exaggerated thinking. You create a high-quality magazine
and give young writers a place to start. Tina has the sensibility
to do that more than anyone else. She has an instinct for it.''

<P>
   And, he said, ``the editorial aspect of the magazine will have
no commercial overtone at all,'' and advertisers will not influence
the content of articles. But, he said, working for Miramax, a film
company with its own publishing arm, could give advertisers wider
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one of the larger cosmetic companies,'' Galotti
said. ``They are looking to move our tentacles into the Hollywood
area.''
</P>
<P>
   A shot in a Miramax film, he said, could include such an
advertiser's products: ``I would immediately see a bathtub
surrounded by the Elizabeth Arden product or Clinique.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added, ``I think clients are looking for new
out-of-the-box ideas and ways to position products and brand their
concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the magazine might do an article on Italian
automobile executive Gianni Agnelli, while Miramax produced a
companion biography to run on the Arts &AMP; Entertainment cable
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was unfazed by business executives' predictions of
five years of losses before a magazine could be profitable. ``I
have never followed a traditional formula in my life, and I don't
believe in them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galotti and Ms. Brown gave no details about the extent of their
ownership stake or the amount of backing Weinstein has committed to
the publication. Weinstein said only that Galotti and Ms. Brown
would have salaries and would participate in the profits from
individual films or books as well as have an ownership stake in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said in an interview that she and Weinstein ``have
been friends for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the kinds of movies he makes are the kind of
journalism we try to do,'' she said. ``He has this incredible gift
for making good things commercial. I found myself asking, surely
The New Yorker can't be harder to market than `The English
Patient?'''
</P>
<P>
   The remark underscored her continuing frustration at the
financial strategies employed by Conde Nast at The New Yorker.
Although she remains discreet about any direct criticism, dwelling
mostly on the closeness of her relationship with S.I. Newhouse Jr.,
her partisans on the staff of The New Yorker are scathing about
Steven Florio and dismissive of his brother, Thomas Florio, who
served as The New Yorker's president until last month.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to both Florios, Tom Florio asked his brother
for a new job, saying the presidency was far less attractive when
many of the management and production functions would be melded
into the larger Conde Nast structures. Steve Florio agreed and
suggested Tom Florio take over as publisher of Conde Nast Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown was not consulted about that move, nor about Tom
Florio's successor, David Carey. Though she repeatedly praises
Carey as ``a terrific hire,'' she also confided to friends that the
magazine would be in better financial shape if some of her
suggestions for increasing circulation revenue had been heeded a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker lost $11 million last year. But that loss masked
the steady improvement of the magazine's performance since 1993 _
when Steven Florio was the president and Tina Brown the incoming
editor. That year, it lost $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's failure to gain any authority over the business side
rankled, particularly when her name was juxtaposed with reports of
the magazine's financial losses. Her suggestions about tying The
New Yorker to new publishing or film ventures were also ignored,
although 20 of the magazine's pieces had been optioned for films
during her tenure, and at least as many were becoming books.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had made such a success editorially, and to have all the
business problems dragged across the papers and everything with it,
it was extremely dispiriting,'' said one of the magazine's editors,
speaking on condition of anonymity. At a dinner for her staff on
Thursday, Ms. Brown said, ``Sometimes in the last six months I have
felt so vulnerable and exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite this, and despite the increasing irritations
associated with the move into the new Conde Nast tower being built
in Times Square (staffers were constantly complaining about their
new accommodations, she confirmed), Ms. Brown had planned to sign
the contract as recently as mid-June, although she would have
preferred to have a shorter-term agreement.
</P>
<P>
   She never got around to asking for that, she said. Weinstein got
there first. As Ms. Brown tells it _ an account confirmed in
general by Weinstein _ he read about her coming contract renewal,
and he reminded her of conversations they had had months before
about the prospects for a new magazine. Then, feeling she had not
taken him seriously, he called her agent, attorney Morton Janklow,
during the last week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown heard him out, but had other worries. Her mother, who
had been suffering from cancer for about a year, was fading
rapidly. Telling Janklow to work out some details with Weinstein,
she spent her time with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother died on June 30. Five days later Ms. Brown called
Weinstein and asked him to meet with her and Galotti in New York.
``The Monday after the Fourth of July, I surfaced after this
terrible five days,'' Ms. Brown said. ``I felt strangely strong at
the end of that experience. My head began to clear for the first
time in a long time, and I began to feel a tremendous desire to
have my motors raced.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday they met at her Manhattan brownstone and later at her
lawyer's office. The deal was completed after more than 40 hours of
discussions and contract drafting.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 that morning, Ms. Brown called Newhouse and asked to
meet with him. She walked from The New Yorker's offices to Conde
Nast and told him of her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   A Conde Nast executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that there is a long list of possible candidates to succeed Ms.
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse has promised a selection by midweek. Among those on the
list, the executive said, were James Truman, the company's
editorial director; Peter Kaplan, the editor of The New York
Observer; David Remnick, a New Yorker writer, and Dominique
Browning, the editor of the Conde Nast magazine House &AMP; Garden.

DISCOVERING THE ROOTS OF JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ron Chernow's editor at Random House, Ann Godoff, first
suggested the idea for a biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr.,
Chernow thought it was a very bad idea. To Chernow, author of ``The
House of Morgan,'' which won a National Book Award in 1990,
Rockefeller was a ``ghostly'' figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed impenetrable,'' Chernow said last week.
``Secretiveness was at his very essence. He spent his life trying
to evade the notice of the press and politicians and others.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there had been relatively few full-scale biographies
written about the man who founded Standard Oil and went on to
create one of the century's great fortunes. Most books on the
Rockefellers had been family sagas, and ceased their accounts of
Rockefeller's life around 1897, when he essentially retired from
Standard Oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no confidence I could penetrate his masks and
disguises,'' Chernow said. ``You can't write a biography of someone
you hate. I had heard too many times of people who had pulled out
of a biography after a year'' because they were unable to penetrate
the Rockefeller mask, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But to appease Ms. Godoff, Chernow went to the Rockefeller
Archive Center in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., where he found a
biographer's gold mine: 1,700 pages of interviews with Rockefeller
done by William O. Inglis for an unpublished biography.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something about him that repelled me,'' Chernow
said, ``his sanctimoniousness. But he had an extraordinary passion
and intelligence. As soon as I saw the interviews, I saw that he
had a powerful voice. It was a rare opportunity for a biographer to
write about a subject both very well known to posterity but also
very unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was Chernow's 676-page book ``Titan: The Life of John
D. Rockefeller Sr.,'' which was praised by Jack Beatty in The New
York Times Book Review as ``a triumph of the art of biography,''
and has been on the nonfiction best-seller list for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In researching the book, Chernow discovered some of what he
believed were the reasons for Rockefeller's extreme reticence and
his rigid puritanism. The key to his personality, Chernow said, was
the figure of his father, William Avery Rockefeller, a snake-oil
salesman and adulterer who left his family penniless. A sexually
profligate figure, William brought his mistress, Nancy Brown, to
live in the house with his wife, Eliza, who was John D.'s mother.
Nancy bore William Avery two illegitimate children.
</P>
<P>
   In Chernow's view, William Avery's behavior was a source of
unending shame to his son and resulted in John D.'s penny-pinching,
puritanical personality. ``John D. defined himself in opposition to
his father,'' Chernow said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernow, who is 49, had originally wanted to be a novelist. He
spent five years working on the Rockefeller book in the rented
two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn Heights that he shares with his
wife, Valerie, a retired teacher and a sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller family cooperated fully in his research, Chernow
said. ``It is a family which on certain topics is riddled with
strange silences,'' Chernow said. ``John D. Jr. was never able to
ask his father directly about the accusations about Standard Oil.
There were always unanswered questions about the legitimacy of John
D. Sr.'s half sisters. It produced an uneasy conscience in the
family. A couple of the Rockefellers said to me, `We want to know
more about William Avery.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no one in the family seemed to know where William Avery
was buried, Chernow said. He was eventually able to solve the
mystery, discovering the grave site in Freeport, Ill., where he was
buried under an assumed name, Dr. William Levingston.
</P>
<P>
   Chernow said his task as a biographer was to humanize
Rockefeller, a man who had become almost a cartoon character, a
Dickensian figure: tiny, mummified and bald, leeringly handing out
dimes to schoolchildren.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Rockefeller was the great corporate criminal of his age,''
Chernow said. He was a ruthless competitor, devouring smaller
businesses as he built Standard Oil, conspiring with the railroads
to get rebates not only when he gave them his own oil to transport,
but also when they transported his competitors' oil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, his operatives opened fire on striking miners in
Ludlow, Colo., killing several of them. In addition, two women and
11 children were asphyxiated as they hid in an underground bunker.
In 1902, Rockefeller was ``humbled, but not impoverished'' by the
crusading journalist Ida Tarbell, whose father had been put out of
business by Rockefeller. The government began investigating
Standard Oil, which led to its breakup in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockefeller always claimed that much of what happened with
Standard Oil had either never happened or had been done by
underlings,'' said Chernow. ``I was able to show that he
masterminded it. To that extent, he comes off worse.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Chernow said, Rockefeller was also a devoted husband who
did not marry into inherited wealth. He was a good father who got
down on his hands and knees to play with his children and arranged
free afternoons to be with them.
</P>
<P>
   Chernow also documents Rockefeller's widespread philanthropy.
His money was responsible for the founding of Spelman College, for
black women, in Atlanta. He also involved himself in other issues
affecting freed blacks. ``For moguls of that era, he was quite
devoid of prejudice,'' Chernow said.
</P>
<P>
   He financed the founding of the University of Chicago, and
established Rockefeller University in New York. ``He funded the
development of a vaccine against yellow fever,'' Chernow pointed
out. ``Rockefeller University developed a serum for cerebrospinal
meningitis.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller embodied the best and worst in the American
character, Chernow said, ``all the money madness, the grasping for
power and riches and also its fundamental decency.'' Like the
Puritans, Rockefeller both worshipped money and feared money.
</P>
<P>
   ``William James, who was one of the few people Rockefeller
opened up to, once said of Rockefeller that he was `so complex,
subtle, oily, fierce, strongly bad and strongly good,''' Chernow
said. ``I leave it up to the reader to decide if the world would be
a better place if this man hadn't lived.''

FISH DISHES, RICE WITH MONTANANS' FLAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the same week, two generally unfavorable reviews of the movie
``The Horse Whisperer'' appeared in newspapers published in
Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Both were written by relatives of mine. Both felt Robert Redford
was guilty of stereotyping Montanans.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have to agree, even though I have not yet seen ``The Horse
Whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   My argument with Redford (not endorsed by my wife or any other
woman I have met) concerns the film ``A River Runs Through It.''
His stereotype of the Montana fly fisherman varies wildly from my
childhood memories.
</P>
<P>
   It was my experience that the ``art'' of fly-fishing consisted
of slapping mosquitoes with one hand and trying to rescue line from
a bush with the other, while making sure your struggles and
frustrations didn't cause you to step on a rattlesnake. Oh yeah,
and in parts of Montana the post-fishing experience consisted of
nude ``tick checks'' to deliver you from often-fatal Rocky Mountain
Spotted Fever.
</P>
<P>
   My father was an avid fisherman, but he thought a fly was
something that buzzed in your ear while you were affixing a worm to
your hook.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't wildly crazy about worms. I actually preferred to fish
with a fly. But the places I chose to do it were far away from
mosquitoes and, usually, far removed from trout. I would stand in
midstream away from bushes, wildly whipping my fly line around for
15 or 20 minutes. Then I would go back to the cabin to eat some of
the fish my father caught on worms, in mosquito heaven.
</P>
<P>
   That was long before people flew from New York City to Montana
for the opportunity to catch, and release, a few trout. That, of
course, is a completely idiotic pursuit. Do the mosquitoes give
back the blood? Do the airlines refund your fare if you are skunked
on the Blackfoot River? Blame it all on Robert Redford.
</P>
<P>
   I now do my angling in reliable fishing holes like Costco, where
you can often buy enormous farm-raised trout for about $1.25
apiece. Since they often come four to a package, I sometimes
smoke-cook them on a Weber. The leftover fish are still good the
next day, cold or reheated.
</P>
<P>
   Weber BBQ Trout
</P>
<P>
   Trout (you pick the number)
</P>
<P>
   Garlic salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary sprigs, enough for two per trout, or dried rosemary
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle inside of each trout with garlic salt and pepper. Lay a
couple of rosemary sprigs in the cavity or sprinkle lightly with
dried rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   Light coals in covered barbecue and soak some hickory or other
wood chips in water. When the coals are ready, distribute them
around the outside of the barbecue and toss on the wet wood chips.
Lay a sheet of foil over the rack and top with the trout (I have
cooked four medium trout at a time). Cover the barbecue and let the
fish smoke-cook for 20 to 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Serve one trout on each plate. The top layer of skin should peel
back easily.
</P>
<P>
   If the ``old fishing hole'' yields some farm-raised salmon
instead, I might cook up some:
</P>
<P>
   Salmon in Cider
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 serving-size salmon fillets
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup chopped ham
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sweet red pepper, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup apple cider
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup apple vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Spread onion slices in oiled oven dish slightly larger than
needed to lay out the fish. Top with the fillets, skin side down.
Spread with the mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a small skillet and saute the ham and red pepper
pieces briefly. Stir in the bread crumbs. Distribute this mess over
the salmon fillets.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the cider and vinegar and pour around the fillets.
</P>
<P>
   Shove the dish into a preheated 350-degree oven, uncovered, for
30 to 40 minutes or until the salmon is no longer dark red inside.
Serves two.
</P>
<P>
   I like fried potatoes with trout. This rice dish from Joanne
Booth goes great with any kind of salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne's Rice-Peanut Pilaf
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup raw long-grain rice
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half cups water
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped salted peanuts
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon curry powder
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated lime rind
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Simmer the rice in one-and-one-half cups water or according to
package instructions, until soft and fluffy. Remove from heat.
</P>
<P>
   In a skillet, melt the butter and add the onion, peanuts, salt,
curry, mustard, pepper and bay leaf. Stir-cook until lightly brown,
then remove and discard the bay leaf. Stir in the cooked rice. Just
before serving, add the lime juice and rind. Serves four.
</P>
<P>
   As for the subject of Redford's latest film, I once asked Hall
of Fame jockey Eddie Arcaro whether he had particular affection for
any horse he had ridden. Arcaro just looked at me, mouth ajar, as
though I had asked him if he had ever dated a goat. He knew what I
know.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pilobolus Dance Theater turned the Beauty and the
Beast story into a bit of monkeyshines on Saturday night at the
Joyce Theater, when it offered ``Orangotango,'' a new comic duet
choreographed by Alison Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A costume designed by Angelina Avallone made Matt Kent resemble
an Argentine gaucho. But the way the choreography required him to
lurch and fumble suggested that this fellow was a decidedly gauche
gaucho. The impression of clumsiness was intensified as Kent put an
ape mask on his right hand and stared at it quizzically. Moments
later, he slipped it over his head. But the fact that he had now
become a facially hairy ape seemed to embarrass him, and to hide
his appearance, he pulled his sombrero so far down that it obscured
the features.
</P>
<P>
   When Rebecca Anderson entered, he tried to dance with her to
recorded tangos by Astor Piazzolla. Yet the character Kent
portrayed was obviously maladroit, and Ms. Anderson had to give him
a few dancing lessons and guide him through the steps. She also
became curious about why his sombrero concealed his face. Raising
the hat, she gazed at him. Far from appalling her, what she beheld
made her decide that she liked this big ape.
</P>
<P>
   Kent gained confidence after that. Animal passion sometimes
threatened to overwhelm him as he partnered Ms. Anderson. But she
managed to tame any attempts at rough stuff, and he eventually
carried her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orangotango'' was a pleasant diversion, even though the
choreography tended to run out of jokes as the duet proceeded. In
fact, several dances by Pilobolus, which are often created through
a collaborative process, share the fault of being more inventive in
their first scenes than in their later ones. Even so, they do get
off to remarkable starts.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, ``Untitled,'' which ended the evening. It
has been surprising people ever since it was choreographed in 1975
by Robby Barnett, Martha Clarke, Moses Pendleton, Michael Tracy,
Jonathan Wolken and Ms. Chase. What causes the gasps of wonder are
the opening episodes in which demure damsels in long 19th-century
dresses suddenly rise to the height of giants, as if, like Alice in
Wonderland, they had swallowed magic potions that made them grow.
The women (Tamieca McCloud and Ms. Anderson, at this performance)
proceed to give birth to nude men who emerge from under their
skirts.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the work shows attempts to preserve decorum, and the
choreography is entertaining throughout. But nothing that follows
those astonishing first moments quite equals them, and they cast
their spell once again at the Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   The program also included works from the repertory. The oldest
was Mr. Wolken's ``Pseudopodia,'' a solo from 1974 that turned Ms.
Anderson into a ball and sent her rolling across the stage.
Although Ms. Anderson's body remained on the ground, her giddy
tossings and turnings made the dance light and airy in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Pilobolus began as an all-male group, and its productions often
feature male dancers. The present company's men (Gaspard Louis,
Trebien Pollard, Mark Santillano and Kent) were admirably virtuosic
as they scurried and swirled and then did flip-flops over one
another in ``The Particle Zoo,'' a swift-paced ensemble, which
Barnett, Tracy and Wolken created in 1990. And the troupe's two
women and four men got together to form friezelike groupings at a
more deliberate tempo in ``Elysian Fields,'' which Ms. Chase and
Tracy choreographed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``The Particle Zoo'' and ``Elysian Fields'' have a tendency
to ramble. Nevertheless, the action does take the dancers through
some technically spectacular territory.
</P>
<P>
   Pilobolus keeps tumbling through July 25 at the Joyce Theater.

`LUCKY BASTARD': WEASELING A MOLE INTO THE WHITE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Truth may be stranger than fiction, but in his darkly
entertaining new novel, ``Lucky Bastard,'' Charles McCarry has
taken the American political scene of the past half-century or so
and made of it something considerably stranger than the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky individual of his title is John Fitzgerald Adams, a
young man from working-class Ohio who may well be the love child of
John F. Kennedy, if certain souvenirs of his mother's experiences
in the Navy during World War II are credible evidence. Whether they
are or not, Jack Adams has the irresistible smile, the remorseless
sexual drive and the gift for politics of his namesake.
</P>
<P>
   As Arthur, a Soviet agent who teaches political science at
Columbia, explains to his handler, Dmitri Alexeyivich, the narrator
of McCarry's novel: ``The point is, Jack has a great natural gift.
Since childhood, he has studied people, found out what they wanted,
and made them believe he was giving it to them even when he wasn't.
Without money, without influence, without connections, he has risen
to the top every time. He has this uncanny gift for making others
like him. Trust him. Want to help him. It's like a spell he can
cast at will.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jack may be just the young man to be recommended to Dmitri's
superior, Peter, a lieutenant general of the KGB so capable that he
``could make Andropov laugh and Brezhnev think,'' which, Dmitri
adds, was ``enough to make anyone fear him.'' As Dmitri explains,
Peter believes that the future of the revolution lies in America,
which, thanks to the Vietnam War along with ``pathological fear and
loathing for that nemesis of the faithful, Richard Nixon,'' history
had turned upside down. ``Golden opportunities were falling out of
its pockets,'' Dmitri adds.
</P>
<P>
   What Peter and Dmitri intend to do is befriend and compromise
Jack, underwrite a political career for him, turn him into an agent
of influence and then get him elected president. As Peter tells
Dmitri, referring to Alger Hiss: ``The same people who beatified
Alger will discover and love Jack _ the Jack we are going to design
for them. They will invest every kopeck of their moral and
political capital in him as soon as they hear him speak in
parables. To them, Jack's weaknesses will be strengths, his lies
truths, his crimes miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how this plan is carried out is far too byzantine to be
summed up in this space. Nor is it fit for a family paper because
it exploits Jack's outsized sexual drive through the use of
``Swallows, as girls and boys who provide operational sex were
called by our organization,'' Dmitri explains.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that the plot thickens as intriguingly as in
any of McCarry's recent novels (``Shelley's Heart,'' ``Second
Sight'' and ``The Bride of the Wilderness,'' among others), with
Jack graduating from Harvard Law School, setting up a practice in
Ohio, winning a highly publicized police-corruption case and
beginning his clamber up the ladder of elected offices.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, McCarry displays the inside scraps of knowledge he has
picked up presumably from working in the CIA and writing memoirs
with the likes of former Secretary of State Alexander Haig and
former Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan. How else could he
come up with such fables and facts as a ``Lubyanka breakfast''
being a cigarette and a bullet? Or that at the battle of Kursk,
between Germany and Russia, ``so many tanks were destroyed on both
sides that Americans saw the rust spot from the moon 25 years
later.'' Or that when the Russians made Janos Kadar the Premier of
Hungary after the 1955 uprising, to make sure that his attraction
to the ladies didn't distract him from his duties, ``the KGB
castrated him _ completely.'' Which, of course, they have to keep
threatening to do to Jack.
</P>
<P>
   And, as usual, McCarry exercises his disdain for the political
left, heaping scorn on draft dodgers, Vietnam War protesters and
``that community of right-thinkers that Peter called the
Unconscious Underground,'' whose members ``manned the junction
boxes of influence and opinion of America.'' What makes his
derision seem particularly vitriolic is that he identifies it with
Peter's, whose ``contempt for those Americans who loved us was
breathtaking,'' Dmitri reports, ``but that is the revolutionary's
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, the novel's landscape begins to seem eerily
familiar, with Jack besieged by sex scandals as he strives for the
presidency, with his wife blaming a vast conspiracy for his
troubles, with campaign contributions coming in from questionable
sources, with an Asian financial crisis threatening to undo the
American economy and with problems connected with a bank's collapse
reaching out to ensnare Jack from the state where he once was
governor. Increasingly as it goes along, ``Lucky Bastard'' reads
like a ``Primary Colors'' written with imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The only moment that McCarry sounds less than completely cynical
is when a U.S. attorney general refuses to go after Jack. ``I
believe that democracy is God's work,'' he tells Jack's enemies.
``Jack Adams may be exactly what you say he is. But he was elected
... by the people, and the people is always right. It's up to them
to decide his fate.''
</P>
<P>
   This may well reflect McCarry's own outlook. On the other hand,
he has earlier described this attorney general as looking ``like an
especially stupid horse that had just awakened to find itself in
bed with the severed head of a Hollywood producer.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, at the conclusion of ``Lucky Bastard'' it is not
the American people who decide if democracy can be saved from Jack,
but instead a determined individual, one of many vivid characters
in the story who push it beyond mere political satire into a
corrosively penetrating view of the contemporary cultural ethos.

PATENTS: STOPPING BABIES FROM CRYING; ELECTRONIC SCHEDULER;
PREVIEWS FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS; TALKING DOORBELL; PATENT INFORMATION ON
THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Texas)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's summer, and the living is supposed to be easy. For new
parents, Donald Spector's recently awarded patent could ease the
wails of a crying baby.
</P>
<P>
   Spector, who lives in Union City, N.J., invented a
voice-activated sound-and-light box that attaches to a crib. Or
rather, it is cry-activated. When a baby wails, a sound-activated
switch turns on a light inside the box. The light shines through a
semireflective mirror on the box's front. Behind the mirror is a
slot for a picture. The box also has a recording and playback
system.
</P>
<P>
   Spector's idea is that new parents will slip a photo of Mom into
the picture slot, and Mom or Dad will record a soothing message for
the baby. Thus, when the infant cries, his wails light up the box
and start the playback. The child sees Mom's picture, hears her
voice, and, Spector hopes, stops crying. Spector received patent
5,774,861.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Calendar Do the Scheduling
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people go on vacation in summer, making it difficult to
schedule work meetings. Gregory Fitzpatrick and Marvin Williams,
two Texas inventors working for IBM, have patented a solution _ an
electronic calendar that monitors other electronic calendars,
detects when dates are available and fits in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The invention uses electronic calendars that are part of a
networked system of computers. First, the person initiating the
meeting enters the date, time and duration of the proposed meeting
into his electronic calendar. If a conflict exists for any of the
expected participants, the software notifies the person who entered
the request.
</P>
<P>
   It then monitors the electronic calendars of the other
participants, detecting when the conflicting events are rescheduled
or canceled. When that happens, the electronic calendar schedules
the proposed meeting on the agendas of everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzpatrick and Williams received patent 5,774,867, which was
assigned to IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a Picture of a Picture
</P>
<P>
   Photo-taking increases in summer as people spend more time with
their families, outdoors or on vacation. Minolta hopes to make
taking snapshots easier with a camera that lets photographers
preview their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Ootsuka, a Minolta employee from Toyokawa, Japan,
invented a camera that has conventional controls for film speed,
shutter speed and exposure. A photographer can set those controls
and then check to see whether the photo he is about to take will
really look the way he expects.
</P>
<P>
   The camera picks up the image of the intended photograph and
displays it on a monitor. The photographer can examine the proposed
picture and change the camera's setting if desired. The camera then
takes up the role of a conventional camera, recording the image on
film. Ootsuka received patent 5,774,754, which was assigned to
Minolta.
</P>
<P>
   A Doorbell With a Voice
</P>
<P>
   Barbecues in the back yard and picnics in the park take people
out of their homes in summer. What if friends or neighbors stop by?
With Todd Housely's invention, when they ring the doorbell, they
won't hear a chime. Instead, they'll get a voice message. When a
visitor pushes the doorbell, a signal is transmitted to a
programmable doorbell controller. The controller contains a
recording of a voice message. When the signal is received, the
controller activates a playback of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Housely also designed a recording system that lets a visitor
leave a message. The visitor presses a recording button installed
near the doorbell, and an adjacent microphone picks up the spoken
message and transmits it to the controller, where it is encoded and
stored. Housely received patent 5,774,039.
</P>
<P>
   Coming Soon: Patents on the Web
</P>
<P>
   The Patent and Trademark Office has announced that it will make
patent and trademark data available free on its Web site before the
end of the year. The agency says that the full text of trademarks
will be posted on the site in August. Drawings from trademarks and
the full text of 2 million patents issued since 1976 will be added
in November. The drawings included with patents will be available
next March.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the agency's site, www.uspto.gov, offered only
abstracts _ the brief description of an invention that appears on
the first page of a patent. But the agency has offered free access
to the full text of AIDS-related patents since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM's famed research division, like so many parts of the
company, has been reshaped and refocused since Louis V. Gerstner
Jr. took over as the chairman of IBM Corp. five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company's research unit had long been an unrivaled engine of
innovation for the computer industry. Its labs produced the Fortran
programming language, relational databases, the D-RAM memory chip,
the RISC chip design, token ring computer networks and five Nobel
laureates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the business criticism of IBM's research efforts had been
that its labs were too insular, too ivory tower with too little
payoff for IBM. Indeed, an internal analysis at the start of the
1990s found that only 2 percent to 5 percent of the research
division's work went toward products and services for IBM
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The doors of IBM's labs are far more open today. IBM researchers
spend about 25 percent of their time with customers. Collaborative
work with leading universities has been stepped up. More outsiders
have been recruited, both to work full time and for brief stints.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach at IBM was evident last week when researchers,
summer interns and executives including Gerstner gathered for a day
for an exercise in free-range futurism _ unfettered discussions of
where technology may be heading by the year 2020. ``A real example
of the new IBM,'' Gerstner observed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the change has been an attempt to tackle an increasingly
important challenge for technology companies in particular: How to
foster innovation and then translate new ideas into new products,
services and profits.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM, there are some encouraging signs that its performance on
that front is improving markedly. Its data-storage research, for
example, is behind the company's rise in the business of disk
drives for laptop computers, a higher-profit market in which IBM
now has a 40 percent share. Its researchers have also designed
low-cost, high-speed chips for use in cellular phones and other
wireless devices, which could open up a big new market for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM always had the knock of not commercializing its
research,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.
``That's not really true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The company as a whole has rebounded remarkably from 1993, the
year Gerstner arrived, when the work force was slashed and IBM
reported an $8 billion loss. Last year, the company earned $6.1
billion on revenues of $78.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive comeback. But if IBM is to generate strong growth
for the future, its research labs must pave the way. And to make a
difference in a company the size of IBM, that means producing some
real winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge is to come up with revolutionary technology
that blows away the competition as its labs once did in the
mainframe-computer era of 1960s and 1970s,'' said David Yoffie, a
professor at the Harvard Business School. ``It's not clear that IBM
can really do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the business necessity of investing for the future,
Gerstner spared the research unit from the deep cuts absorbed by
some company operations. Last year, the research unit's budget
reached $600 million and its payroll increased to 2,785 people,
both figures higher than in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM has valued and invested in its research operations even in
difficult times for the company,'' said Charles Kruger, dean of
research at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   To try to prod people to think big and commercially, IBM invited
an eclectic collection of 1,200 researchers, executives and summer
interns to a series of one-day sessions last week at the company's
seven research labs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   IBM often organizes so-called brainstorming meetings, but it had
not done anything as large before. It was an effort to put people
with different perspectives together, spark some original thinking
and impress the interns _ mainly computer science students _ that
IBM might be a good place to work someday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the gatherings was at IBM's research
headquarters, the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights,
N.Y. The morning began with a short talk by Gerstner emphasizing
that technology's highest purpose is to solve real-world problems.
``I want this to be something more than brilliant irrelevance,'' he
told the group. ``I want something substantive to come out of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The day consisted largely of a series of mind-stretching games,
played in teams of a dozen or so. Questions were prompts: What will
a day in the life of a child be like in 2020? How will technology
change the look and operation of a home? What will be the most
far-reaching applications of ``deep computing,'' best known for its
use in IBM's chess-playing supercomputer Deep Blue, which beat
Garry Kasparov last year?
</P>
<P>
   Just what will come out of such sessions remains to be seen. The
musings, debates and product ideas were all recorded, and the
research staff will later pore through the record over the next
couple of weeks, panning for nuggets. ``We're looking for a few
themes we can cull out, perhaps prompting us to think about things
slightly differently in research,'' explained Paul Horn, senior
vice president of research.

</P>
<P>
   Bernard Meyerson, a research scientist, came prospecting for
ideas, especially from the summer interns. ``You bet I expect to
get something out of this,'' he said. Meyerson recalled how a young
Egyptian graduate student from MIT walked into his office a few
years ago and proceeded to question long-held assumptions about the
speed at which electrons can travel through silicon. The student
proved to be correct, and his insight helped Meyerson's work.
</P>
<P>
   The blunt, burly Meyerson, 44, has become a kind of in-house
poster boy for how much things have changed within IBM research. In
the 1980s, he and a group of IBM scientists developed
semiconductors that used standard silicon with germanium, an
element that is so efficient at conducting electricity that it can
drastically reduce power consumption in devices using such chips.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Meyerson had hoped the chip design could be used in
mainframe computers. When IBM decided to overhaul its mainframes
with another chip technology, Meyerson was advised to fold up his
silicon germanium project. He did not. With the help of his
research superiors and a few believers in IBM's microelectronics
division, Meyerson set about channeling his orphaned project toward
a new market _ fast, cheap chips for use in cellular phones and
other wireless devices.
</P>
<P>
   IBM recently began large-scale production of its silicon
germanium chips, and the company believes this could become a
$1-billion-a-year business within five years. Today, Meyerson is
part scientist and part entrepreneur, building a business. He deals
with chip production problems, scouts for acquisitions and makes
sales calls to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign of semiauthorized guerrilla warfare within IBM, he
said, would have never been allowed to flourish in the old days.
``Now, the attitude is: If you've got a great idea, do it,''
Meyerson said. ``I never would have been allowed to do this five or
six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   To the college interns, Gerstner's message that research must
make its way to the marketplace is a sermon to the converted.
Indeed, their main reservation seems to be that even the new IBM
moves too slowly for their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make products and make money,'' said Anit Agarual, a
junior at Cornell University. ``A lot of the things done here take
five years to get out of the labs or never make it into the
marketplace at all.''

<P>
   Rick Brown did not set out to be anyone's hero. Simply wanting
to learn a little more about the Internet, he signed on two years
ago with Geocities, a service that gives people free space to
publish their own pages on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some people use their Geocities sites to show the world their
children, their poetry or their model train collection. Brown built
a tribute to Monty Python, the British comedy troupe.
</P>
<P>
   His Web site started slowly, but Brown, 34, a grocery store
merchandiser who lives in Bridgeport, Conn., kept adding Python
memorabilia, sound clips, scripts and pictures. Soon the site took
on a life of its own, and Geocities began promoting it as one its
``landmark'' pages.
</P>
<P>
   By June, when he had a falling-out with the service over a
promotion effort, his site had attracted more than 100,000
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's experience exemplifies the paradox of Geocities: The
service is attracting an impressive and growing number of members
and visitors, yet as it moves toward a public stock offering, it is
struggling to formulate a credible image as a viable business.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of Geocities, David Bohnett, says that the sheer
scale of the service's operation and popularity would have been
unimaginable when he started experimenting with the Internet in
1994. As of June, more than 2 million members had created personal
Web sites consisting of more than 15 million pages on nearly every
imaginable topic.
</P>
<P>
   Organized into 40 virtual ``neighborhoods'' at
www.geocities.com, these sites add up to the third-most-visited
domain on the Web, attracting 14 million viewers in April, the most
recent month for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   The audience for Geocities has been growing at twice the speed
of the average Web site, according to Media Metrix, which measures
traffic on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company, based in Santa Monica, Calif., is going public.
The investment bankers promoting the initial public offering hope
investors will be drawn to the potential of Geocities' vast
audience and to the low overhead of publishing a site created by
millions of volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   They also hope that investors will not be discouraged by
financial statements that suggest only the weakest vital signs of a
going concern.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as the company begins its road show over the next few
weeks, it will probably talk of many plans to build its audience,
to sell more advertising and to extract fees from at least some
members for certain services.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear whether the service can build its business
without alienating its members. For example, it was a promotional
effort known as a watermark that set off the feud with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The watermark is a translucent image of the Geocities logo that
hovers in the lower right hand corner of the pages of its members,
like the ``ghost'' logos that identify television channels. The
watermark's purpose is to encourage people entering one Geocities
site to try other sites on the service.
</P>
<P>
   But many Geocities members complained that the watermark made
their pages load more slowly on visitors' browsers, cluttered their
screens and obfuscated links.
</P>
<P>
   So using the very tools that Geocities had given them to build
their Web sites, some members created anti-watermark pages, chat
rooms and mailing lists. When Brown turned the front page of his
Monty Python site black in protest, Geocities stopped featuring his
page. Other members got wind of this and turned his case into a
rallying point for the anti-watermark campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The whole situation, Brown said, reminds him of Monty Python's
sketch in which a pet-store patron tries to return a dead parrot.
``The customer has a valid complaint, and the management uses every
trick available to avoid facing that fact,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the promise and the peril that come with trying to
build a business by giving a megaphone to millions of people.
Geocities is one of a growing number of ``online communities'' _
sites or services that allow people to publish Web pages and
communicate with one another by chatting, sending e-mail and so
forth. Such community sites now make up six of the 20 most popular
sites on the Web. Geocities is the largest, followed in descending
popularity by Tripod, Anglefire, Hotmail, Switchboard and Xoom.
</P>
<P>
   Some advertisers are wary of placing their product next to chat
that as likely as not will turn sexual _ or on a page that today is
an affable tribute to Monty Python and tomorrow is a diatribe
against the host service.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gives us a nervous twitch is the fear that if a user has
a bad experience they will think negatively on our clients,'' said
Jonathan Adams, a media buyer for Ogilvy One, the online agency for
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather. ``Even if 99.9 percent of the sites are squeaky
clean, it's that tenth of 1 percent that will wind up in the CEO's
lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohnett, who has championed the right to free expression of
minorities as a board member of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation, says that playing censor in chief for 2 million
people weighs heavily on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what I'm doing has to do with being gay and part of a
minority that has not had an equal voice in society,'' Bohnett said
in an interview in March. ``But we have to balance freedom of
expression with commercial viability. Otherwise all of this will go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bohnett has declined to comment on the watermark or any other
matter recently because Geocities is in a required ``quiet period''
related to its planned stock offering. In May, Bohnett hired Thomas
Evans, publisher of U.S. News &AMP; World Report, to be Geocities'
chief executive. Bohnett remains chairman.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The impulse that created Geocities was more expressive than
commercial. In the spring of 1994, Bohnett took a break from a
career in software marketing after his longtime companion died of
AIDS. Intrigued by the Internet, Bohnett and a friend, John Renzer,
bought a $5,000 computer powerful enough to serve up Web pages and
published a little site with a live picture of the Intersection of
Hollywood and Vine and a few other locales.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, they seized on the idea of giving users free home
pages and organizing them into ``virtual'' cities, arranged loosely
by topic. Thus, when a new ``homesteader,'' in Geocities' lingo,
wants to set up a page, he or she selects a lot in a particular
city. Those who are interested in cars move into Motor City; jazz
fans choose Bourbon Street.
</P>
<P>
   The most heavily populated of the 40 cities are Silicon Valley,
about computers, and South Beach, a vast spring break-style party.
But the most popular destination among visiting Web surfers is
Hollywood, the home of most of the fan pages, including Brown's
Monty Python page.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sites are simple, even hokey affairs, offering
photos of pets, love poems, pie recipes and other matter that lived
between the refrigerator and a magnet in the past. But some are
much more elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a bank clerk by day and a Smashing Pumpkins fan by
night, this gives you an opportunity to express yourself,'' Bohnett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once they expose themselves to the world, Geocities members
closely watch the count of how many visitors their sites attract,
and they express glee at receiving an e-mail from a far-off place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a ham radio operator in high school,'' Bohnett said.
``It was exciting to collect postcards from people you talked to
around the world. That is a lot of what the Web is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more surprising, people started sending e-mail to their
virtual neighbors to comment on their sites and offer help.
</P>
<P>
   Renzer, now the company's chief technical officer, said,
``People actually go out of their way to become block captains, to
join welcome wagons and to monitor chat rooms so they can have a
neighborhood that is safe and clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Geocities now has 1,500 volunteer community leaders who help
other members and watch out for offensive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community leader program is the perfect environment for
folks with a `helper complex,''' said Sherri Kaufmann, a housewife
in rural Minnesota. She originally joined Geocities to show off
pictures of her 10 children. Now she spends an hour a day on the
computer in her kitchen watching over her corner of the ``Picket
Fence'' neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly are a community of neighbors who help each other
out,'' Ms. Kaufmann said. ``I have made many friends here.
Recently, my father became ill, and I was overwhelmed by the
letters from the friends I have made at Geocities.''
</P>
<P>
   But even more powerful than the common human urge to help a
neighbor, however virtual, is the sexual urge. Volunteers and
Geocities' small staff spend most of their time rooting out
pornography that sprouts constantly on members' pages, as well as
other illegal or objectionable material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through seemingly endless debates about content
guidelines,'' Bohnett said.
</P>
<P>
   And, still, its rules are uncomfortable compromises: Political
opinion is OK; hate speech is not. You can have a page about sex
but no pictures of naked people, unless they are classic artworks
or on pages about nudism as a life style. Most members can
criticize Geocities on their pages somewhat, but community leaders
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Geocities has been in a constant battle with its
members about how much of their pages it controls for advertising
and promotion. Other protests arose when the service began
superimposing advertisements over members' pages.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities has not been able to fill the ad space that it does
have. Last year, the company had only six advertisers. Now, after a
reorganization of its sales force, it says it has more than 100.
But its members' pages are only about 25 percent sold.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a new management team drawn from larger media
companies, Geocities is trying to find ways to turn its audience
into cash. It has tinkered with the design of the site to create
more places for ads and to keep surfers longer at Geocities,
especially on those pages that attract ad rates with a high cost
for every thousand visitors, like pages about cars and other
expensive items.
</P>
<P>
   And it is coming up with other sources of revenue. There are
deals with online merchants like Amazon.com, which will sell books
recommended on member pages, paying commissions to both the member
and Geocities. There are services that for a fee let the most
dedicated members build more ambitious and complex sites. And for
those who want to set up business in cyberspace, it has started a
program called Geoshops to display online storefronts for which it
charges monthly fees starting at $25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, Geocities hopes all these initiatives will
quadruple its revenue from $4.6 million last year to a range of $20
million to $25 million this year, Bohnett said in March. Stephen L.
Hansen, the company's chief financial officer, said in March that
he expected Geocities to break even next year.
</P>
<P>
   But this rush to make money is leaving some members behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I feel they are pushing commercialism a little too
much with all the home pages inundated with ads and links to ads,''
said Sharyn Gleaves, who has built an elaborate site devoted to
drumming around campfires.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Brown says he is about to move his Monty Python site to
another service.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Renzer, the co-founder, argues that making money is just
another aspect of Geocities' virtual vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the real world should be mirrored in
Geocities,'' he said. ``What do you do? You go to bars. You talk to
people. You find a date. But you also go shopping, and you have a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   And, for that matter, you have virtual protests, boycotts and
heroes as well.

 &HT;    Group protests to bring AIDS awareness into forefront at NAACP
conventionBy Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tracie Edness had used drugs, but no needles. She'd
had unprotected sex, but wasn't a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   No way she was a candidate for the HIV virus, she thought.
</P>
<P>
   She was wrong. She was diagnosed a week before Christmas 1991
with the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind every choice there is a consequence. That was my
consequence,'' said Edness, one of more than 50 people who marched
through downtown Atlanta Sunday in support of education and
prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The event, called ``Outrage Over AIDS: A Walk For Action,'' was
part of the NAACP's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Edness, of Douglasville, Ga. yelled louder than anyone as the
marchers shouted ``No progress, no peace!'' and ``Action for
AIDS!''
</P>
<P>
   According to the NAACP, AIDS is the leading killer of black
people aged 25 to 44. Although blacks make up approximately 12
percent of the country's population, they account for about 57
percent of new HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
   Also, black women represent 56 percent of AIDS cases among
women, and blacks ages 13 to 24 are estimated to account for 63
percent of new HIV cases in that age group, the NAACP's statistics
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disease has reached astronomical proportions in black
communities and Latino communities in America,'' said NAACP
president and CEO Kweisi Mfume, who was among the marchers. ``The
best way to deal with it is to talk about it openly, get the myths
and the taboos off the table and to recognize that it can affect
and infect any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the issue is one of social justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are advocating on behalf of all those who are infected with
this virus, all of those who are about to be infected and don't
understand that because of their behavior they will be, and all
those who have died as a result of this disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcher Victor Dunbar, who is president of the Fairfax, Va.,
branch of the NAACP, said he has lost two cousins to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were men who were educated,'' Dunbar said. ``It's such a
waste. Both of these young men had a lot to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   He supports education efforts and more funding for research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It needs to be on everybody's landscape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edness, the HIV patient and counselor, said that before her
diagnosis, she had been telling her friends she'd been tested with
negative results.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was tested, I had no idea my results would come back
positive. But they did,'' the 39-year-old said. ``I was upset and
angry. I wanted to know who did this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She learned three years ago who infected her, and has forgiven
him. But early on, she felt despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became very suicidal,'' said Edness, mother of three and
grandmother of four, none of whom are infected. ``I was walking the
streets of downtown Atlanta trying to figure out how I was going to
take my life.''
</P>
<P>
   She came across a stranger and told him she needed to talk. He
sat on a curb with her as she told him her story. Turns out he'd
been living with AIDS for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I don't know if I believe you, but just for today,
you've given me hope,' '' she told the man. ``I want to go home.''

   Youth delegates debate how to bring more students into fold
</P>
<P>
   By Christy Oglesby
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There is a balance between politics and parties and
academic achievement and activism. The challenge, said young black
students from across the country, is finding that balance so the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People can
maintain its momentum on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The steady influx of young visionaries into the NAACP is
important enough to be the basis for this year's convention theme,
``Preparing Tomorrow's Leaders Today.'' However, many of the
students said they have difficulty bringing in soldiers and keeping
them motivated long enough to become generals.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 youth delegates gathered Sunday morning during the
organization's national convention at the World Congress Center to
discuss maintaining and growing college chapters, and their
frustration was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the membership competition from popular fraternities
and sororities. Then academic demands leave little time for
political activism,'' said Taliah Givens, a panelist from Georgia
Tech, who said she often is in a laboratory until 3 a.m. when
school is in session. And no one can overlook plain old apathy.
</P>
<P>
   Where African-American students are plentiful, they can get
lulled into thinking they don't have to join their college NAACP
chapter because someone else will, one delegate said. And at
predominately white colleges, the pool from which to draw members
is pretty shallow.
</P>
<P>
   But the woe-are-we session didn't last long. Students
participating in Sunday's session soon discovered no shortage of
solutions or college activism, just a shortage of sharing
strategies among themselves. Delegates from the same states were
surprised to learn what was happening on campuses just two hours
away. By meetings end, many had resolved to share e-mail addresses
and use the NAACP's chat line to continue the flow of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   What started as frustration became determination after a young
woman from Ohio State University told the audience how the college
NAACP chapter took over the university's administration building
for eight days until school leaders heard its demands. The young
delegates applauded the action.
</P>
<P>
   Students share-- what they are doing on their campuses and
encouraged one another with offensive strategies, from securing
positions on college administrative boards to enlisting the help of
fraternal organizations in procuring members.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, said Taj Brown, 19, from Lock Haven University in
Pennsylvania, college chapters must not get duped into believing
they need to promote a party-packed agenda to compete with
fraternal organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a social organization. We are an activist
organization,'' said Brown. ``When we are what we are supposed to
be _ political activist _ we will attract young people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Toledo, the college chapter is starting a
mentoring program to reach out to younger children in the community
and regularly invites local politicians to keep chapter members
educated about the community issues outside of their campus.
</P>
<P>
   Dawnnay Butler, president of the University of Toledo chapter,
encouraged her fellow delegates to keep strong programs in place
and to focus on freshman who are looking to be a part of something.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be consistent,'' Butler, 20 said. ``People don't
want to be a part of anything that's not consistent.''

 &HT;    Notebook: Quotes and scenes from the NAACP convention
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Michael Jordan is not my hero,'' said 17-year-old
Lendeh Sherman, as she stood in front of two of her paintings on
exhibit at the World Congress Center, site of the NAACP convention.
</P>
<P>
   One painting depicts the four little girls who died when a bomb
exploded in their Birmingham church in 1963. It is untitled. In the
other, a black man sits at a lunch counter while someone pours
ketchup on his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be hurt but he knows he's doing something that's
right,'' said Lendeh, who is from Maryland and will attend art
school in New York this fall. The man in the lunch counter
represents all those who took place in the famous lunch counter
sit-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not know them, but we would not be where we are today
without them,'' Lendeh said.
</P>
<P>
   That piece is titled ``Heros.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Garrett can feel eyes on him as he walks the aisles of the
convenience stores in his small Ohio town. Last year when his
grandmother sent him into a grocery store parking lot to turn off
her car's headlights, a clerk in the store called the cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I go, there's somebody watching me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve, who wants to be a director, entered the Afro-Academic,
Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics (ACT-SO) film
competition with a short piece about the racism he endures. The
last scene is shot in his school, which he says is a haven from the
stares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students treat me equally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nefertiti Oji-Njideka, 17, has also lived with racism. When she
was in the fifth grade, her family lived with her grandparents for
a year while their home was being remodeled.
</P>
<P>
   She was the only black student in the school in her
grandmother's Kentucky town. It was then that she started writing
poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel a little bit better,'' said Nefertiti, who entered
the ACT-SO poetry competition. It is called ``Sunshine,'' and has a
simple, positive theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to make it a racial poem,'' she said. ``I'm not
bitter at all. I don't feel any hate.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in Dayton, Ohio, Nefertiti will be president of her senior
class this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Durham, who remembers eating at the back of restaurants
when he was his son's age, brought 10-year-old Ricardo II to the
NAACP convention Sunday. He wants to start teaching his son about
those days, and the changes the NAACP has helped bring about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went last year in Pittsburgh and had a real positive
experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo II was indeed full of questions _ but they didn't
exactly involve civil rights. He wanted to know all about his belly
button. His dad explained that unborn children get nutrition
through the umbilical cord.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice cream?'' the boy asked. ``Broccoli?''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Ricardo smiled and patiently answered his son's
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We brought him down here so he can connect with the various
organizations,'' Durham said as he prepared to enter the convention
rooms with his son, who doesn't have to worry about being told to
sit in the back of restaurants. He can concentrate on more
important things, like belly buttons.

 &HT;    Black churches, NAACP may have stronger bond in future
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NAACP and the black church are two institutions
that have helped move the African-American community forward this
century, always taking the lead when issues of justice and civil
rights are being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship between the NAACP and the black church has
historically been distant. That, however, may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   During the NAACP's national convention in Atlanta this week,
delegates will explore various strategies to insure its survival in
the 21st century. One option is working closer with the the black
church.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Erskine understands the complex relationship between the
NAACP and the black church. He is an associate professor of
theology at Emory University and author of, ``King Among The
Theologians'' (Pilgrim Press, $14.95). During a recent interview,
he shared his views about these two institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why has the black church and the civil rights movement been
so intertwined?
</P>
<P>
   A: The civil rights movement came out of the black church. The
connection was there from the start. The civil rights leaders were
ministers. The black politicians were ministers. The black church
is the one institution that we've always had that has somehow
remained intact. I don't think we can talk about civil rights
without talking about the black church at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why has the NAACP had a distant relationship with the black
church?
</P>
<P>
   A: The NAACP was different. W.E.B. DuBois (one of the NAACP's
founders) . . . was mesmerized by the black church. He gave us
wonderful critiques about the black pastor and the importance of
the black church. But he himself was more on the outside than the
inside of the . . . church. The NAACP was historically more
concerned with legal issues, which the black church didn't see as
its main agenda. But I think they're getting closer now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How and why are they getting closer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think that black theology, which came out of the civil
rights movement, is helping younger ministers, who grew up in the
'50s and '60s, to make the connection between the church and
justice issues. We had a tradition where we said that good church
people don't go to the court. The black church was unsure about
going to court to fight for justice. The church was content to sit
back and let the NAACP do that for us. But since (Martin Luther)
King and Malcolm (X), the black church has not been afraid to take
on justice issues, such as voting rights and desegregating schools.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could the NAACP learn anything from the black church?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the long haul, if it is to survive, it must recognize the
importance of spirituality as the bedrock of the black community.
For good or bad, the masses of black people are still in the black
church. You can't get to those people without the . . . church. The
one person who discovered that was Jesse (Jackson). When Jackson
ran for president, everywhere he went, he went to the black church.
I remember going to one church and there were two collection
plates, one for Jesse and one for Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the black church lost its sense of political activism?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have. We have grown tired. There's not a national
forum. There's not a national consensus on issues. We're doing
stuff, but it's each little black church . . . There are many
issues that the NAACP and the black church could cooperate on
without both losing their focus.

   LOUDEN, N.H. _ As concession speech's go, the one delivered
Sunday by rival crew chief Ray Evernham on behalf of Jeff Burton
was right on the button with 50 laps remaining in the Jiffy Lube
300.
</P>
<P>
   Burton had a 5.6 second lead at the time of Evernham's missive,
and was able to put his Taurus on cruise control, taking the
checkered flag 7.43 seconds ahead of teammate Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It was Burton's second consecutive Jiffy Lube 300 victory, and
career fourth overall. He won twice a year ago, at Texas Motor
Speedway and Martinsville Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those came close to Sunday's dominating victory. He
started fifth, was running second at the 75-lap mark, took the lead
for the first time at lap 80 and was leading at the 150th and
225th. He never ran lower than fifth and was in front for 191 of
the final 221.
</P>
<P>
   ''We win on Sunday by what we do on Saturday,'' Burton said of
the work by he and crew chief Frank Stoddard. ''In Saturday's
practice, we got passed by John Andretti. It got our attention. We
went to work and did more things on our race car.''
</P>
<P>
   It made a difference. Once the race was underway, he decidedly
had the best car.
</P>
<P>
   Only Gordon offered any challenge, leading four times for a
season low 73 yards. Martin had none. Pole sitter Ricky Craven led
for 13, but they came early, and he finished 29th.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody could touch the 99 (Burton). He definitely was in a
different league than the rest of us,'' Gordon said. ''I don't know
what they found, but they sure found something. We got out early
and led some laps, but I knew it was just a matter of time before
they ran us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Boring? Yes. To all but Burton. He had one close call that could
have ended his day on the first lap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had messed up and missed a gear, and the 44 car (Kyle Petty)
got by me and scooted up the track, and when he did I went under
him. And he didn't know I was there and maybe I was pushing a
little too hard early.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got together and on the back stretch, he wanted to let me
know how he felt about it. So, the next thing I know, we're almost
in the grass, and I decided to to back off and get away from that.
That could have been it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Others had their narrow escapes earlier. There were nine
cautions for 90 laps, and six cars failed to finish due to
accidents _ Hut Stricklin, Lake Speed, Gary Bradberry, Ted
Musgrave, Rick Bickle and Geoff Bodine.

<P>
   Federal securities regulators have grown increasingly concerned
that the accounting industry's lucrative expansion into computer
consulting may be creating conflicts with the accountants' role of
being watchdogs for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants from the Big Five accounting firms are now
installing complex software packages at hundreds of companies.
While the computer consulting is not new for the accounting firms,
the business is so hot now that it is growing at annual rates of up
to 50 percent. That growth, in turn, is drawing the attention of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations prohibit close ties between accountants and
the companies they audit because auditors are expected to give an
unbiased opinion on the accuracy of companies' financial
statements. But because of the sudden consulting boon, never have
the accounting firms been so involved in the day-to-day operations
of some of their audit clients.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Peoplesoft, a California software company whose
products help automate a variety of vital corporate tasks, warned
investors in its annual report this spring that sales could suffer
if it could not find enough consultants skilled at installing its
wares. The company's outside auditor, the accounting firm Ernst &AMP;
Young, appears to be doing its best to help.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young not only gave Peoplesoft a clean bill of financial
health, but is also a key partner of Peoplesoft's sales force. As
many as 1,000 of the accounting firm's employees install
Peoplesoft's products at other businesses around the world, many of
them also Ernst &AMP; Young audit clients.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a recent case that raised some investors' eyebrows,
Ernst &AMP; Young's Dutch affiliate audited the books of Baan Co. for
years even as the accounting firm had hundreds of consultants
installing the software that Baan produces. The Ernst &AMP; Young
consultants were so good at their software work, in fact, that Baan
gave them its first ``global gold award'' as one of its most
``successful implementation partners.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was only this spring, after forcing Baan to change some
questionable accounting practices, that Ernst &AMP; Young decided to
resign the auditing account to pursue what Baan described as a
``business relationship'' with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young's computer consulting work is the biggest piece of
an overall consulting practice that has grown to an expected $3.6
billion this year from $300 million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But while Ernst &AMP; Young has one of the fastest-growing computer
consulting practices, all of the Big Five firms have a rising
number of potential conflicts because of such work.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Price Waterhouse Coopers, the new name of the
accounting firm formed in the recent merger of Price Waterhouse and
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, audits the books of the Denver-based software
publisher J.D. Edwards &AMP; Co. even as its consulting side searches
for potential recruits skilled in working with J.D. Edwards
software.
</P>
<P>
   As Isaac Hunt Jr., a commissioner at the SEC, warned in a speech
to accountants, the growing number of relationships between
auditors and their clients ``calls into question the ability of
auditors to be independent when carrying out their statutory
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But the accounting firms argue that they have only loose
alliances, and not contractual relationships, with the software and
hardware companies that they audit. And the firms say that they are
qualified to continue with audits of those companies even though
they may be earning hundreds of millions of dollars by installing
the companies' wares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much separate the work we do in consulting and the
work we do in auditing,'' said Philip Laskawy, chairman of Ernst &AMP;
Young. ``We just do not believe that this is an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Peoplesoft, Laskawy said that Ernst &AMP; Young was
hiring consultants trained in that company's software because the
product was in demand. ``We aren't hiring people to help
Peoplesoft,'' he explained. ``We're hiring people because they have
a product that our customers want.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Ernst &AMP; Young was not marketing Peoplesoft's
products, only helping other companies to install the software.
</P>
<P>
   Laskawy said Ernst &AMP; Young's relationship with Baan while the
firm performed the audit was similar to the firm's relationship
with PeopleSoft and did not cause a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Andersen, which audits SAP, a German software company
that plans to sell stock in the United States this year, now has
about 400 Andersen consultants installing SAP software. Recently,
its consultants toured the nation with SAP sales representatives,
making presentations to interested companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the firm's partners say that its consultants are not allowed
to actually promote SAP software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have a very workable system in place that allows us
to stay independent from the hardware and software companies that
we audit,'' said Michael Travis, a partner in charge of Arthur
Andersen's SAP consulting practice in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the possible conflicts arising from such consulting work do
not end with the software companies. The questions extend to the
hundreds of public companies for which the accounting firms are
both installing the computer systems and auditing the books. Ernst
&AMP; Young consultants, for example, are now helping install a $300
million information system at Coca-Cola, a company whose books the
firm has long audited.
</P>
<P>
   Although no major problems have yet come to light in such cases,
some accounting experts say the accounting firms' double duties
raise many uncertainties. For instance, will an accounting firm
that is being paid $100 million to install software be willing to
disagree with company executives on a controversial accounting
issue and demand they correct the financial statements if they fear
they could anger management and lose the consulting job?
</P>
<P>
   Or, will an auditor who works for the same firm that installed a
company's information system raise questions about flaws in that
system when it was the accounting firm's consultants who installed
it? Such undisclosed flaws could be significant to the financial
statements, since today's software packages are so far-reaching
that a warehouse clerk can update accounting records from a
computer on the loading dock.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``As auditors, they will have to express an opinion on something
that they did,'' said Itzhak Sharav, who teaches accounting at the
Columbia Business School. ``That is a conflict, and that is a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bayless, associate chief accountant at the SEC, said the
commission was concerned about any instances in which auditors
audit their own work.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the SEC, which raised concerns about these issues
last year in a report to Congress, has taken few steps to limit the
firms' consulting work. And, the federal rules defining what
auditors must avoid to remain ``independent'' from the companies
they audit are little changed from 10 years ago when most of these
potential consulting conflicts did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the SEC did create an eight-member group, called the
Independence Standards Board, to review whether the rules should be
updated to protect investors. The board includes the chairmen of
three of the Big Five firms, including Laskawy, as well as the
president of the American Institute of Certified Accountants and
four members appointed by the SEC who are not accountants.
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur Siegel, the board's director and a former partner
with Price Waterhouse, said that the board had other issues to
address before it could take up the software consulting. He said
that the SEC had long known that the firms were expanding their
consulting practices but had let them continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't make it right,'' he said, ``but there is plenty
going on, and the SEC hasn't questioned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many public companies are now scrambling to buy software
packages created by such developers as SAP, Oracle, Peoplesoft and
Baan, which sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. The
companies want to upgrade their computer systems before Jan. 1,
2000, when many existing systems are expected to malfunction when
they do not recognize the new date.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, tailoring software to the buyer's needs requires an
army of consultants, and experts estimate that the companies must
spend between two and five times the software's cost on
consultants, who do everything from fine-tuning computer programs
to training the company's workers to use the new system. Each
consultant can bring his or her employer about $300,000 in revenue
a year, according to estimates.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent to 30 percent of companies needing to upgrade
their computer systems choose their audit firm's consultants to
help them put in the new software, said Vinnie Mirchandani, a vice
president at the Gartner Group, which does research on the software
consulting industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CEO says go with this firm because I have known this firm
for many years,'' Mirchandani said. And yet, the auditors
themselves may not feel comfortable about the role of their
consultant colleagues. ``The audit partners don't always want the
consulting side to do the job,'' he said, ``because they're worried
of problems and a black mark.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the software and hardware companies covet
connections to the Big Five firms because of the firms' access to
the executives and decision- makers at the thousands of companies
that they audit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Microsoft and Netscape struggled for
KPMG Peat Marwick's allegiance, both wanting to supply the
accounting firm's computer-networking software. Microsoft
ultimately won by offering to pay KPMG millions of dollars if the
firm would use its product. As part of the deal, KPMG agreed to set
up a subsidiary that would market consulting services to
corporations adopting Microsoft's Windows NT networking software.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firms, meanwhile, say that the new computer
systems they help install can strengthen a company's controls over
financial information and, therefore, should reassure investors
rather than worry them. And the consulting work, they insist,
actually helps them conduct better audits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you know about a company,'' Laskawy said, ``the
better the audit you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharav, at Columbia, notes that the SEC's rules say that
auditors should avoid even the appearance of a conflict of
interest. ``Somehow,'' he said, ``they have gotten around that.''

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Reeling from the defections of several top
investment bankers, Deutsche Bank is looking to buy or team up with
a U.S. investment firm to shore up its position in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are absolutely committed to investing more in the U.S.A.,''
said Rolf-Ernst Breuer, chairman of the bank, which is Germany's
largest. ``It isn't enough to be Wall Street watchers; we must be
Wall Street participants.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Breuer said he had no specific target now, he
acknowledged that the bank must either make an outright acquisition
or enter into a significant alliance with a U.S. company. ``It
could be an acquisition, but I could easily imagine a joint
venture,'' he said at a meeting with reporters on Friday night.
``But we have to do our homework. We should not lose sight of what
fits well with Deutsche Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Other financial industry executives have been speculating for
months about potential acquisition targets for Deutsche Bank. Among
the most frequently mentioned names are those of J.P. Morgan, Paine
Webber, Lehman Brothers and, until recently, Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Another name circulating is the venture capital firm Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist of San Francisco, which specializes in corporate finance for
high-technology companies. Hambrecht &AMP; Quist might fill a gap at
Deutsche Bank that was created by the departures of three top
investment bankers who specialized in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Their departures gave Deutsche Bank a rude lesson in the limits
to which money buys loyalty on Wall Street. Three years ago, the
bank recruited star deal makers from Wall Street firms like Morgan
Stanley and Merrill Lynch with huge signing bonuses and pay
packages. At the time, rival firms bitterly complained that
Deutsche Bank was inflating the already sky-high salaries of
investment executives.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks ago, Credit Suisse First Boston recruited the
three investment bankers for what were said to be hundreds of
millions of dollars. The most visible loss was that of Frank
Quattrone, whom Deutsche Bank had recruited from Morgan Stanley and
who headed Deutsche's technology business in Menlo Park, Calif.
Quattrone, who had written a letter in March to assure clients that
he had no plans to leave Deutsche Bank, is reported to have been
offered a package worth about $250 million. He is also taking as
many as 100 co-workers with him.
</P>
<P>
   From a strategic point, Deutsche Bank executives say they want
to increase their U.S. presence both as investment bankers and
money managers. But in investment banking, Breuer has hinted at
somewhat cautious goals of expanding in certain areas. ``We don't
want to be everything to everybody,'' he said, adding that the
focus has been on ``future-oriented'' businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he left no doubt that Deutsche Bank had lowered its
expectations of becoming a full competitor in the United States
with the likes of Merrill Lynch, Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even before Quattrone's abrupt departure, Deutsche Bank had been
having problems in its investment banking. Having bought the
venerable Morgan Grenfell of Britain in 1989, and then investing
billions of dollars in its expansion, costs had rapidly risen and
the bank failed to find its footing in the crucial area of mergers,
acquisitions and corporate finance.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions increased as Breuer started to clamp down on costs and
exert tighter control. Last year, he pushed through a broad
restructuring that brought the London-based investment bank under
the direct control of Frankfurt and did away with the name Morgan
Grenfell. That led to the resignations of the two top executives at
Morgan Grenfell, Carter McLelland and Maurice Thompson, in March.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer insisted on Friday that he had no intention of backing
away from Deutsche Bank's broad push into investment banking.
``There is no pullback with regard to investment banking
opportunities,'' he said. The acquisition of Morgan Grenfell ``was
a brainchild of my own,'' he said, ``and I am still convinced we
could not survive without a third pillar of earnings, which is in
investment banking.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surprise at Quattrone's recent departure, Breuer
also insisted that Deutsche Bank did not want to retreat from the
United States. Though the bank has no ambition of trying to compete
with big Wall Street firms on a full range of services, Breuer
said, it does want to have a ``meaningful presence.'' In other
words, it still wants to be the biggest foreign bank operating in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Deutsche Bank executives are still angry about
what they consider the shabby behavior of Quattrone and his
colleagues. Even though Deutsche Bank raided rival banks, its
executives complain bitterly about the callous ``job hopping'' and
willingness to jump over to a rival for more money. That, one
executive said, marked a startling difference between U.S. and
German corporate culture.

   NEW YORK _ What's the difference between New York and Boston?
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston area, an April Fool's Day broadcast hoax on
WAAF-FM about the mayor's death cost two afternoon disc jockeys
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, it earns the pair, known as Opie and Anthony, a
shot at the big time on rock station WNEW-FM. No joke.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Hughes, or Opie, and Anthony Cumia, whose broadcasting
career began to take off at Long Island's WBAB-FM, developed into a
ratings-winning success over three years in Worcester, Mass. That
ended in an apology by station executives and the team's dismissal
in April for a sketch _ complete with phony sound bites from a news
reporter and a police officer _ about Boston Mayor Thomas Menino's
supposed death in a traffic collision.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the prank showed ``a wanton and reckless
disregard for human decency and professional ethics,'' in a letter
to the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their termination also brought Hughes and Cumia thousands
of e-mails of support from fans and two job offers. Last month, the
pair began their patter of parody and humor weekday afternoons at
the CBS-owned WNEW, where they were hired by Garry Wall, a new
programming director at the No. 23-rated station.
</P>
<P>
   Wall said he hired Hughes and Cumia because of their talent, not
their prank. ``You don't get ratings in the newspaper,'' he said,
adding that the team's on-air personas had been altered to take
into account WNEW's more adult audience. ``There's not as much
toilet humor.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday's Opie and Anthony show, topics included listener
reaction to the pair's discussion of an album cover that showed
singer Patti Smith's unshaven armpits, and a parody of a news
report about children locked in a car trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Eatman, the Los Angeles agent Hughes and Cumia hired
after their dismissal, said, ``They made a fortunate situation out
of an unfortunate circumstance.'' He said his clients' contract
does not contain a no-prank clause, and he declined to say how much
they would be paid at WNEW.
</P>
<P>
   CBS rejected a request for an interview with Hughes and Cumia.
</P>
<P>
   Pranks are to radio personalities what hit movies are to actors.
</P>
<P>
   Like other print and broadcast outlets, radio stations are
pushing against the boundaries of what is considered appropriate
content in a drive for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Stern's antics draw obscenity fines and buff his
celebrity. A haircut that halted traffic on San Francisco's Bay
Bridge in 1993 catapulted the career of Mancow Miller, who will
reportedly be one of the best-paid radio personalities in the
country when he starts next month at WKQX-FM in Chicago. KROQ-FM in
Los Angeles lived up to its claim to be ``world famous'' by
broadcasting a 1990 faked murder confession, leading the FCC to
adopt a hoax rule that permits sanctions for broadcasts that cause
``immediate and substantial harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Abrams, a radio programming consultant, said he often
received press clippings about stunts and complaints that followed
wrapped around audition tapes by personalities looking for work.
``They are a badge of honor.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the Boston mayor's complaint, no action was taken
against WAAF, said Robert Ratcliffe, deputy chief of the FCC's mass
media bureau. In any case, he said, the gag would not have derailed
the then-pending $2.6 billion acquisition of WAAF's parent,
American Radio Systems Inc., by CBS Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Because CBS continues to operate other Boston area stations,
which were all losing to Opie and Anthony in the ratings, some
radio executives questioned whether CBS had shaped the
controversy's outcome to benefit its local stations.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is required to operate the to-be-sold stations separately,
but keep their business intact. ``That doesn't apply to talent,''
said Steven Lerman, a lawyer who has worked for Infinity
Broadcasting, which CBS acquired in 1996 and which is handling the
planned sale of the stations. In a precautionary effort to avoid
jeopardizing the pending deal, CBS consulted with Justice
Department officials before hiring Hughes and Cumia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fired for good cause,'' Lerman said. ``CBS had
nothing whatsoever to do with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dodge, the former chairman of American Radio, agreed. ``It
was the right thing to do,'' he said.

KING DUCKS ANOTHER PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This and that from the boxing world:
</P>
<P>
   Well, we haven't seen the last of promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   King, the ``Only in America'' man, has again ended up on the
fortunate end of the American justice system. He was acquitted last
week on all charges that he faked a contract to cheat Lloyd's of
London out of $350,000 after one of his boxing promotions was
canceled in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of his good fortune:
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he shot and killed a man, but it was ruled justifiable
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he was convicted of second-degree murder, but the
charge was reduced to manslaughter. He served only 3 years, 11
months in an Ohio prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, King was named in a 23-count indictment for income-tax
evasion but was acquitted of all counts the following year.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there was last week's decision,
</P>
<P>
   It'll be interesting to see what role King will play now.
</P>
<P>
   He's 65 and reported to be in failing health. He lost his gold
mine, Mike Tyson. Evander Holyfield is his only fighter with the
ability to generate a great deal of money and it's unclear how many
fights under which he has the champ under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it seems, he'll make his presence felt....
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the boxing world have respect for the skills of
Naseem Hamed, the flamboyant Briton who has become one of the
sport's biggest moneymakers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-respected trainers in the world isn't one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Steward laid into the unbeaten featherweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's strictly hype,'' Steward said. ``They have to match him
very carefully. He can't fight. That's why they're matching him
with weather-worn fighters. He can't beat the top fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``...He doesn't have the basic foundation (of skills). They put
him in with older guys (example: 30-year-old Kevin Kelly) and he
beats them with the physical strength of a young man.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you (ITAL)really(END ITAL) think, Emanuel?...
</P>
<P>
   Long-time broadcaster, Don Dunphy, who recently turned 90,
worked more than 2,000 fights, including roughly 200 championship
bouts, according to the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He believes Joe Louis' knockout of Billy Conn in 1941 was the
most dramatic moment in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   However, who's the best he's seen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis, Marciano and Ali were, to me, the best of the
heavyweights,'' he wrote in his 1988 autobiography, ``but Robinson
was unquestionably the best of three divisions _ lightweight,
welterweight and middleweight _ and he was winning the
light-heavyweight title (from Joey Maxim at Yankee Stadium) when
the 106-degree heat did him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with those who say that Sugar Ray Robinson was the
greatest.''...
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen, the promoter of Azumah Nelson, is trying to match
his fighter against Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who stopped Jesse James Leija on Saturday, has a
terrific chin. Without question, Hamed's power would be tested.
However, he and his handlers know that and it might be difficult to
make the fight....
</P>
<P>
   Lou Del Valle told a group of writers that his ``fantasy is to
tell all you guys, `Kneel, kneel. Bow your heads,''' after he beats
Roy Jones Jr. on Saturday at The Theater at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   If they bow their heads, it will be to get a better look at Del
Valle lying on the canvas in the title-unification fight on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   This should be a typical one-sided Jones victory. Only a master
boxer _ like Montell Griffin _ could give Jones problems. Del
Valle, while capable, is hardly that fighter.
</P>
<P>
   His only loss, on points, came against Virgil Hill in 1996.
Jones knocked out Hill in four rounds with a crushing body punch
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones doesn't attack aggressively, this could be a dull
fight. Both fighters are counterpunchers.
</P>
<P>
   On the same card, Kevin Kelly faces Derrick Gainer in a
junior-lightweight rematch of a wonderful fight in 1996, in which
Kelly, his eye swollen shut and behind on points, stopped Gainer
with one punch in the eighth round....

VOTERS REBUKE JAPAN'S GOVERNING PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Voters in parliamentary elections on Sunday gave Japan's
governing party a brutal drubbing, setting the stage for the
resignation of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and creating new
uncertainties about the country's political and economic course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are attributable to my lack of ability,'' a grim
Hashimoto told Japanese television early Monday morning. ``We could
not live up to the people's expectations, and it is all my
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He strongly hinted that he would resign after meeting later
Monday with officials of his Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But while the voters were apparently punishing the confusion and
lack of decisiveness in the government as it faces Japan's worst
economic crisis in more than half a century, the election result
may create more disarray than ever in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows who will lead the country _ whose economy is second
only to that of the United States in size _ as it tries to
extricate itself from recession, or what will happen to Japan's
recently announced plans to deal with its mountain of bad loans
held by banks.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be harder than ever for the Liberal Democrats to
govern Japan and push economic legislation through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   None of the main contenders for the prime minister's job is the
kind of new and dynamic leader that many Japanese say they want,
and that the United States and other countries fervently desire.
There is some risk that the job will go from a man who exhibited
little leadership to a rival who has shown absolutely none.
</P>
<P>
   The markets would have tumbled more if it were not for the
possibility that the election shock may force the Liberal Democrats
_ who have changed policy in the past in reaction to electoral
defeat _ to become more aggressive in tackling the nation's
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   There may now be more possibility of tax cuts and of another
economic stimulus package, although it is not clear that there will
be any push for the kind of market-oriented reorganization that
many economists urge.
</P>
<P>
   The elections on Sunday were for the upper house of parliament,
not the more important lower house, so they do not directly affect
Hashimoto's post as prime minister or his party's lock on power.
But he billed the election as a referendum on his leadership, and
the party won only 44 of the 126 seats up for election this year.
</P>
<P>
   That was still far more than the 27 seats won by the leading
opposition group, the Democratic Party, but far less than the 61
seats that the Liberal Democrats held going into the election.
</P>
<P>
   Other seats were won by the Communists, who did exceptionally
well as a winner of protest votes, and by independents and other
groups in Japan's deeply fragmented opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval comes at an odd time in the Japanese political
world, when the country is neither the one-party state it used to
be nor a Western-style system where parties go in and out of power.
The Liberal Democrats traditionally ran the country with only token
opposition, but they were evicted from power in 1993 after a poor
election performance and a series of defections by members of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, many thought that old-style Japanese politics were
gone forever, but a year later, the Liberal Democrats clawed their
way back to power as part of a coalition. Then Hashimoto took over
as prime minister in January 1996 and led the Liberal Democrats in
a long slog in which they managed to regain majority control of the
lower house of parliament, so that five years later the situation
is much as it was before _ but with much less sense of expectation
that the political system can be a vehicle for far-reaching change
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Sunday's vote was an unambiguous rebuke of the Liberal
Democrats, it is less clear whether it was a vote in favor of
anything. By most accounts, the voters were simply annoyed by the
Liberal Democrats' lack of strong leadership at a time of national
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest reason is the lack of economic recovery,'' Taku
Yamasaki, a Liberal Democratic leader, told NHK Television.
Yamasaki said that the top party officials, including Hashimoto and
himself, should resign, but he added that he worries about the
impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if something happens like the collapse of a financial
institution while our financial restructuring scheme is still
unfinished?'' Yamasaki mused. ``I'm very worried about the power
vacuum created by this election result.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto had planned to go to Washington for a state visit
later this month, but that will almost certainly be called off or
postponed until a new leader is in place. The Liberal Democrats
will be under strong pressure to act within a week to choose a
replacement, and probably to summon parliament into session so a
new person can formally take the prime minister's post.
</P>
<P>
   The main contenders are Keizo Obuchi, the foreign minister and
leader of the largest faction in the Liberal Democratic Party;
Seiroku Kajiyama, a veteran politician who was the chief Cabinet
spokesman for a time under Hashimoto; Kiichi Miyazawa, a former
prime minister; and Yohei Kono, who had been the Liberal Democratic
leader until he resigned to make way for Hashimoto. Whoever takes
over, fundamental changes are not expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LDP has a firm lock on power in the lower house, and
that's not going to change,'' said John Neuffer, an analyst of
Japanese politics at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo,
speaking of the Liberal Democratic Party. ``Hashimoto was being
pulled around by his nose by party elders, and whoever is in there
is going to continue party-established policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuffer said that while financial markets will be jittery, the
humiliation may encourage the Liberal Democrats to become more
aggressive in tackling bad debt problems, cutting taxes and
approving a new economic stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, I think this is good for the nation and the
world, but in the short term I think everybody's going to be
nervous,'' Neuffer said.
</P>
<P>
   One important winner was the Democratic Party, which
consolidated its role as the leading opposition force. While the
party is a poorly organized and newly formed coalition of various
factions, it shows hints that it may eventually emerge as a
Western-style opposition force, distinguishing itself from the
governing party on issues and seen by voters as a credible
alternative force.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is led by Naoto Kan, who opinion polls
suggest is by far Japan's most popular politician. Kan, who made
his name as a Cabinet minister crusading against the bureaucracy,
will now push to build his party's organization so it can wrest
power from the Liberal Democrats in general elections that must be
held by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it very seriously that the new-born Democratic Party
has been given a chance by the people,'' a jubilant Kan told
reporters at his party headquarters. ``People said no to what the
Liberal Democratic Party has done. They realized that the Liberal
Democratic Party cannot reform, is totally bound by special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People rejected the bureaucracy-led government,'' Kan added,
calling for early elections for the lower house as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ichiro Ozawa, who once was the main opposition leader but now
heads only a small opposition party, said, ``I think lower house
elections are inevitable.'' The Liberal Democrats may see things
differently, however, since they would almost certainly lose ground
in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   With the election, Hashimoto becomes the latest in a series of
politicians who entered the prime minister's residence strong and
self-confident but left ignominiously with their reputations in
tatters. When Hashimoto took office, he was welcomed
enthusiastically as a dynamic leader who was an expert on policy
issues. He was thought to offer a sharp contrast to his
predecessor, Tomiichi Murayama, a grandfatherly socialist who was
widely viewed as extremely nice and extremely lackadaisical.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto initially did indeed exhibit leadership and
decisiveness, but in retrospect he chose to exercise it in the
wrong way: He pushed through an increase in the national sales tax
from 3 percent to 5 percent. It was a bold and politically
courageous attempt to put Japan's finances on a better footing, but
it turned out to be economically catastrophic, tipping the nation
into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Hashimoto proved much less firm in tackling the
recession. He eventually pushed through a large stimulus package,
but it took so long to put it into place that the economy tumbled
in the meantime and further endangered the country's weak banks.

 By FELICITY BARRINGER with GERALDINE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of all the documents that passed over Tina Brown's
desk in June, two received particular attention. One was the
proposed five-year contract that would ensure she remained The New
Yorker's editor through mid-2003. The other was Brill's Content,
the ballyhooed new magazine about the press.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was an invitation to continue to edit the magazine
whose words had set it apart as an intellectual arbiter and whose
balance sheet _ over which she had little control _ had set it
apart as a financial sinkhole. Brill's Content was proof that
alternatives existed, that a high-profile editor with well-endowed
backers could create a magazine with instant impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of intrigued by the Brill label and the things he
had been able to do,'' Ms. Brown said in an interview. ``They did
give me additional impetus'' to think about alternatives. And
Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of the film production company
Miramax, was aggressively seeking to enlist her to create a
magazine and a company, which she would partly own.
</P>
<P>
   At Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications, she remained
close to the chief executive, S.I. Newhouse Jr., but her influence
no longer matched her ambitions. To the outside world, The New
Yorker's editor was winning the public-relations battle with Conde
Nast's chief executive, Steven T. Florio, over who deserved the
blame for The New Yorker's financial woes. But within the company,
Florio increasingly got his way. She did not, and she felt
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   And Weinstein wanted her to do something she had never done, to
shape a magazine _ ``put down the editorial DNA,'' in Ms. Brown's
phrase. She would be both an owner and a participant in the profits
of the individual films or books spun off from the magazine
articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why be the owned star, if you can be the star owner?'' asked
Stephen Schiff, a screenwriter who is a friend of the editor.
</P>
<P>
   That may be an easier question to answer than the questions of
the entertainment executives who admire Ms. Brown, but do not
admire magazines. Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom Inc.,
said: ``Entertainment companies are moving away from print. They
are simply not that interested.'' But he added that if anyone could
pull off such a venture, it would be Tina Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Others who attended this weekend's annual Sun Valley meeting of
media company executives asked what good ownership is, when quality
magazines can cost $10 million, $20 million, $30 million or more to
start and often lose money for five years.
</P>
<P>
   And among journalists, eyebrows were raised about the up-front
effort to tie the fact-based craft of nonfiction to the
fantasy-based world of film. ``If the stated purpose of this is to
develop entertainment packages, that's not what journalism is,''
said Bill Kovach, the curator of the Nieman Foundation.
``Journalists survey the world to inform the citizen, not with the
idea of creating a property to entertain the citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of skepticism did not deter Ms. Brown, who said: ``I
certainly don't intend to ever compromise the journalistic
integrity of the magazine for an end game with Hollywood. If I did,
it would have a short life.''
</P>
<P>
   What she intends is to recreate the successes of her 20-year
editing career. At Tatler, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, she
constantly put new geist in the Zeitgeist. Last week, she edited
her career with the same instinct for emerging trends. Like Brill,
she is setting out to defy the odds that a new magazine will get
lost in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Like Geraldine B. Laybourne, the leading force in children's
television programming who left Walt Disney Co. and ABC last month,
Ms. Brown is leaving a large corporation to work for herself.
(Although it is also true that Ms. Brown's new company, as a unit
of Miramax, will ultimately fall under the large corporate umbrella
of Walt Disney Co.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Martha Stewart, the multimedia arbiter of all things
tasteful, Ms. Brown and her partners hope to make a magazine the
core of a lucrative empire encompassing books, movies and
television productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been an editor in chief for 20 years,'' Ms. Brown said.
``If a job was what I was going to be doing, this was the best job
in the world. But I had reached the point in my life when I wanted
to do more than a job.'' She added: ``Just thinking about this
week's magazine, fun and exciting as it was, wasn't enough to keep
me intellectually challenged. I wanted to grow in a more lateral
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, whose resume contains little in the way of financial
background, sought out Ron Galotti, the publisher of Vogue, to talk
to Weinstein. ``I said I really need to have a business partner
with me to ascertain that this isn't just high-concept without
having its feet in nitty-gritty land,'' she said. In the end,
Galotti decided to join her as a part owner of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that was so unique about this was that it made sense
right away,'' he said. ``It's not some far-fetched idea that
required exaggerated thinking. You create a high-quality magazine
and give young writers a place to start. Tina has the sensibility
to do that more than anyone else. She has an instinct for it.''

no commercial overtone at all,'' and advertisers will not influence
the content of articles. But, he said, working for Miramax, a film
company with its own publishing arm, could give advertisers wider
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one of the larger cosmetic companies,'' Galotti
said. ``They are looking to move our tentacles into the Hollywood
area.''
</P>
<P>
   A shot in a Miramax film, he said, could include such an
advertiser's products: ``I would immediately see a bathtub
surrounded by the Elizabeth Arden product or Clinique.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added, ``I think clients are looking for new
out-of-the-box ideas and ways to position products and brand their
concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the magazine might do an article on Italian
automobile executive Gianni Agnelli, while Miramax produced a
companion biography to run on the Arts &AMP; Entertainment cable
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was unfazed by business executives' predictions of
five years of losses before a magazine could be profitable. ``I
have never followed a traditional formula in my life, and I don't
believe in them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galotti and Ms. Brown gave no details about the extent of their
ownership stake or the amount of backing Weinstein has committed to
the publication. Weinstein said only that Galotti and Ms. Brown
would have salaries and would participate in the profits from
individual films or books as well as have an ownership stake in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said in an interview that she and Weinstein ``have
been friends for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the kinds of movies he makes are the kind of
journalism we try to do,'' she said. ``He has this incredible gift
for making good things commercial. I found myself asking, surely
The New Yorker can't be harder to market than `The English
Patient?'''
</P>
<P>
   The remark underscored her continuing frustration at the
financial strategies employed by Conde Nast at The New Yorker.
Although she remains discreet about any direct criticism, dwelling
mostly on the closeness of her relationship with S.I. Newhouse Jr.,
her partisans on the staff of The New Yorker are scathing about
Steven Florio and dismissive of his brother, Thomas Florio, who
served as The New Yorker's president until last month.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to both Florios, Tom Florio asked his brother
for a new job, saying the presidency was far less attractive when
many of the management and production functions would be melded
into the larger Conde Nast structures. Steve Florio agreed and
suggested Tom Florio take over as publisher of Conde Nast Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown was not consulted about that move, nor about Tom
Florio's successor, David Carey. Though she repeatedly praises
Carey as ``a terrific hire,'' she also confided to friends that the
magazine would be in better financial shape if some of her
suggestions for increasing circulation revenue had been heeded a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker lost $11 million last year. But that loss masked
the steady improvement of the magazine's performance since 1993 _
when Steven Florio was the president and Tina Brown the incoming
editor. That year, it lost $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's failure to gain any authority over the business side
rankled, particularly when her name was juxtaposed with reports of
the magazine's financial losses. Her suggestions about tying The
New Yorker to new publishing or film ventures were also ignored,
although 20 of the magazine's pieces had been optioned for films
during her tenure, and at least as many were becoming books.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had made such a success editorially, and to have all the
business problems dragged across the papers and everything with it,
it was extremely dispiriting,'' said one of the magazine's editors,
speaking on condition of anonymity. At a dinner for her staff on
Thursday, Ms. Brown said, ``Sometimes in the last six months I have
felt so vulnerable and exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite this, and despite the increasing irritations
associated with the move into the new Conde Nast tower being built
in Times Square (staffers were constantly complaining about their
new accommodations, she confirmed), Ms. Brown had planned to sign
the contract as recently as mid-June, although she would have
preferred to have a shorter-term agreement.
</P>
<P>
   She never got around to asking for that, she said. Weinstein got
there first. As Ms. Brown tells it _ an account confirmed in
general by Weinstein _ he read about her coming contract renewal,
and he reminded her of conversations they had had months before
about the prospects for a new magazine. Then, feeling she had not
taken him seriously, he called her agent, attorney Morton Janklow,
during the last week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown heard him out, but had other worries. Her mother, who
had been suffering from cancer for about a year, was fading
rapidly. Telling Janklow to work out some details with Weinstein,
she spent her time with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother died on June 30. Five days later Ms. Brown called
Weinstein and asked him to meet with her and Galotti in New York.
``The Monday after the Fourth of July, I surfaced after this
terrible five days,'' Ms. Brown said. ``I felt strangely strong at
the end of that experience. My head began to clear for the first
time in a long time, and I began to feel a tremendous desire to
have my motors raced.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday they met at her Manhattan brownstone and later at her
lawyer's office. The deal was completed after more than 40 hours of
discussions and contract drafting.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 that morning, Ms. Brown called Newhouse and asked to
meet with him. She walked from The New Yorker's offices to Conde
Nast and told him of her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   A Conde Nast executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that there is a long list of possible candidates to succeed Ms.
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse has promised a selection by midweek. Among those on the
list, the executive said, were James Truman, the company's
editorial director; Peter Kaplan, the editor of The New York
Observer; David Remnick, a New Yorker writer, and Dominique
Browning, the editor of the Conde Nast magazine House &AMP; Garden.

TWO VORACIOUSLY CREATIVE DEFINITIONS OF `POSTMODERN'
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
By MARGO JEFFERSON  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some of the best work billed as theater right now
can't be fitted into just one form or genre, let alone style.
History is too complicated, and our imaginations are too restless.
</P>
<P>
   But what people like to call a postmodernist aesthetic, with its
love of pastiche _ a clever assemblage of previous styles and a
juxtaposition of genres and allusions, all signaling their capacity
for playful irony at every moment _ really isn't enough. This kind
of irony has become as safe, as cliched for us as melodrama was for
an earlier age. It draws energy from parodying earlier forms, yet
rarely generates any passion or daring of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Savion Glover Downtown,'' at the Variety Arts Theater, and
Basil Twist's ``Symphonie Fantastique,'' at Here, do generate
passion, daring, wonder and pure pleasure. Glover's medium is tap,
Twist's is puppetry, both forms that have always been at the mercy
of what is popular and on the margins of what is thought
artistically respectable. They are having their revenge now, with a
wave of voracious creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Glover choreographed ``Bring In 'da Noise, Bring In 'da Funk''
and helps train its ever-changing fleet of wonderful dancers;
Twist's puppeteer colleagues include not only Julie Taymor of ``The
Lion King'' but the less well-known, extremely gifted Theodora
Skipitares and Janie Geiser.
</P>
<P>
   Glover's new show, which he directed and choreographed, has been
called a jam session for five dancers and four musicians and a tap
revue. It has a street-corner insouciance and after-hours chic.
</P>
<P>
   Cannily paced, it moves between solos, duets, quartets and
ensemble numbers; and, with a repertory that includes the songs of
Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Juan Tizol, Irving Berlin and
Chaka Khan, as well as original numbers, it is probably best called
a jazz, Latin and funk musical. (There is a bit of text, too, a few
poems written and recited by Reg Gaines, but they are nowhere near
the quality of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   I preferred the asides of the musicians _ the excellent Eli
Fountain and the Incog-Negroes _ and the voices of the dancers as
they woofed, shouted and egged one another on.)
</P>
<P>
   There is room for the unexpected: guest dancers and musicians
like Dule Hill, Bakaari Wilder and Jared Crawford, ``Noise/Funk''
veterans. And, at the show's end, any members of the audience who
are ready to come onstage and buck, wing or strut their stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Let's call the look hip-hop street and hip-hop suave. It
includes T-shirts and baggy pants, of course (one leg hitched up);
flowing shirts in mauve, brown and white with a light sateen
finish; khaki suit jackets (Nehru collars for the men, classic
lapels for the women), and various hats and caps over braids,
dreadlocks and plain old flowing locks.
</P>
<P>
   Every dancer is first rate. There is Chance Edwards, with his
pristine lines of sound; Abron Glover (Savion's brother),
long-limbed and self-contained; breezy staccato-driven Jason
Samuels, and Ayodele Casel _ what fun to see a woman up there
giving no quarter _ all rhythmic attack and unforced charm. When
they dance together we get the thrill of unison virtuosity (like a
swing band when all the instruments take the first chorus
together), and suspense (those jumps and turns when they land all
together and pick up the beat as if they had never left it).
</P>
<P>
   And when they take their solos, your energies shift. You get to
test your more intimate responses, feel what particular
inflections, ways of moving, ways of building a rhythm and a melody
stir you most.
</P>
<P>
   Glover is a brilliant choreographer and a dream dancer. He says
that when he dances he is ``spitting out those verbs,'' and that's
a great metaphor. His solos are marvels of mood-shifting talk, with
Fountain's tintinnabulating triangles, with the faux Arabian Nights
melody of Juan Tizol's ``Caravan'' and with the languorous
harmonies of Ellington's ``In a Sentimental Mood.''
</P>
<P>
   He talks with each musician; when there is no music but that of
his own feet, he talks to himself. (I like the air of slightly
extraterrestrial distance that comes over him at times. Improvising
can certainly be spurred on by a performer's intense connection to
the audience, but it is also deeply introspective, and sometimes
our pleasure comes from knowing that we are spying on an artist as
he creates.)
</P>
<P>
   Whomever he is talking with, the verbs proliferate. He teases
and challenges and rumbles and rumbas. He speaks in swing and
be-bop phrases, and he free-associates. He produces ballet-timed
leaps, African-influenced stomps with wide and shimmying shoulders
and rag-doll twists cartoon style. He moves across the stage
holding his upper body quite still, led by a toe that taps at the
level of a whisper. And his feet don't just play melodies, they
play chords.
</P>
<P>
   In a state of hyperactive bliss, I went home and looked up
Charles Dickens' equally hyperactive and astonished description of
the great 19th-century black tap dancer William Henry Lane, known
as Master Juba. There he was, wrote Dickens, spinning, shuffling,
cross-cutting, creating rhythms: ``dancing with two left legs, two
right legs, two wooden legs, two wire legs, two spring legs _ all
sorts of legs and no legs _ what is that to him?''
</P>
<P>
   For Dickens, the wonder came from seeing something that was
utterly new to him and pretty new to his culture and his century.
But we are nearing the end of a century, and we are exposed via the
media, however superficially, to the art of many cultures. Certain
forms, genres and styles have been so crushed by use and abuse that
we thought there was nothing more we needed or cared to know about
them; we need to see them rise up and make our hair stand on end.
That is what ``Savion Glover Downtown'' does.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why Basil Twist's ``Symphonie Fantastique'' is also
a small-scale, late-20th-century wonder. The theater seats 75
people. The stage, about the size of an old-fashioned
puppet-theater stage, is a tank filled with water, which, when
lighted, looks like a small movie screen. Unseen by us, Twist and
three other puppeteers turn Hector Berlioz's vehemently romantic
music into a delicious abstract art spectacle. Images drift, float,
zigzag and pounce; we see rhythmic arrangements of bubbles,
feathers, moons and suns, cylinders of light, blocks of color,
curved and geometric shapes.
</P>
<P>
   This is abstract art that looks like abstract film. But it is
something else, too. ``Symphonie Fantastique'' is quintessential
Romantic ballet music, and it becomes clear, watching the patterns
and phrasing of Twist's work, that, just as this is puppetry
without human figures, it is choreography without human beings.
Certainly not choreography that is enslaved to a canonized musical
work. There is grandeur and lavish beauty in Berlioz's music, but
there is bombast, too. The bombast is countered by Twist's visual
wit, while the grandeur is modulated but not effaced by the
delicacy of his method, and by the smallness of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   What an uncanny experience. You are free of human sights and
sounds, but you feel flooded with human emotions.

ANALYSIS: BURYING ABIOLA AND LONG-HELD HOPE OF ENDING MILITARY
RULE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: budgeted earlier as NIGERIA-RDP) 
(js) 
 By ROGER COHEN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ As the Nigerian opposition leader, Moshood K.O.
Abiola, was laid to rest, the frenzy of the moment conveyed all
that was being buried with him. Feverish men shoveled red earth
onto the corpse and African chants, and Muslim prayers mingled with
the wailing of the women in the heaving crowd.
</P>
<P>
   For it was not merely the man who most vividly embodied
Nigeria's striving for an elusive democracy who was laid to rest
here on Saturday. It was the specific conviction represented by the
date June 12 _ the day in 1993 when Abiola appeared to have won a
presidential election later annulled by the military government.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, June 12 has been the touchstone of Nigeria's quest
to end military rule. For Nigeria's opposition, it was a mandate in
abeyance, unfulfilled but compelling, even as Abiola languished in
prison. No matter that five years had elapsed: June 12 was vividly
alive, the banner beneath which the opposition marched.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, however, with Abiola's body in the ground and with
the sober verdict delivered by Western doctors that he died of
heart disease, that opposition seemed for the first time to face
the fact that the mandate of 1993 is beyond resuscitation.
</P>
<P>
   The National Democratic Coalition, the main opposition group,
issued a statement on Sunday saying that the military should
surrender power on October 1 to a 24-member government of national
unity that would pick a chairman and then organize the creation of
new political parties and elections.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the coalition, its leader, Abraham Adesanya, made
no attempt to speculate about who that chairman might be. The fact
is the void behind Abiola is too vast for such speculation to make
any sense. Names are sometimes heard here _ the former Vice
President Alex Ekwueme is among them _ but for the moment they
carry no weight.
</P>
<P>
   This void does not appear to alarm Western governments. On the
contrary, there seems to be a certain relief that the so-called
``June 12 issue'' has disappeared with an unexpected finality.
``Frankly, the fact that the question of the mandate has gone away
might make it easier to move forward,'' said one Western official.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, had also been the view of the military
government of Gen. Abdusalam Abubakar. It had been preparing to
release Abiola when he died, but it was also looking for guarantees
that he would not claim the mandate he was denied. In other words,
a new election was perhaps possible, but on the condition that the
one five years ago would be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Abiola accepted this condition remains in dispute. What
is clear is that the question is now moot and a new one has arisen:
who or what can possibly be put in his place to take Nigeria toward
the stable democratic system that has largely eluded it since
independence in 1960?
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's funeral suggested just how difficult it will be to
replace so eclectic a man. He was at once an African chief, a
devout Muslim, a supporter of Christian causes, a business mogul
and a larger-than-life example of a rare thing in Nigeria: a
rags-to-riches success story.
</P>
<P>
   In Abiola, an unusually wide swathe of this divided nation could
find some identification, or place some dream, and therein, it
seems, lay the key to his unique popularity.
</P>
<P>
   His funeral, attended by several of his wives and many of his
children, was as volatile as Nigeria is today. It veered between
tumult charged with potential violence and sudden, radiant good
will charged with hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Abiola mansion contains several apartments for his wives,
and in the dwelling once occupied by his second wife, Kudirat,
women who had been close to her were crying. After asserting her
husband's right to lead Nigeria, in 1996, Kudirat Abiola was shot
to death in Lagos by six armed men. Nobody has been arrested or
tried for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so bitter _ it is beyond words,'' said Bimbo Soremekun,
a close friend of Kudirat Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   In a large central room on the first floor, other members of the
family mourned. Representatives of Nigeria's unusually vibrant
press asked to be allowed to say prayers, and one Muslim prayer was
read followed by a Christian prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola, born poor, went to a Christian school _ the Baptist Boys
High School in Abeokuta _ but he also attended Koranic schools from
an early age and chose to become a Muslim when still a young man,
friends said. He was a strong supporter of Islamic causes, but he
also knew many Christian hymns by heart.
</P>
<P>
   The most explosive division in this country is also a religious
one between the mainly Muslim north, dominated by the Hausa and
closely related Falani tribes, and the predominantly Christian
south, from which Abiola came. So his ability to find support in
both areas will almost certainly be hard to reproduce, especially
as his death has exacerbated the cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in pain; my sisters are in pain; you are all in pain,''
his daughter Wula Abiola shouted to the crowd at the funeral. ``But
we have a memory. And that memory is for democracy and it is for
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   At times peace seemed likely to give way to violence. The
presence of soldiers, even several hundred yards away, incensed
young followers. At others, when disco music was abruptly played,
the whole front yard of the mansion was one seething party. Light
and dark moods moved very close to each other.
</P>
<P>
   As his body, following the Muslim custom, emerged from the house
invisible beneath the white cloth, dozens of Abiola's followers
surged forward, their features marked by the harsh imprint of
poverty and a kind of desperate thirsting for consolation. People
were thrown this way and that, chairs were smashed, and sobbing
women were led away.
</P>
<P>
   After the body was lowered into the ground, a man perched in a
tree began to tear off branches, which were set over the corpse.
Then, to the beat of African chants and the hypnotic lilt of Muslim
prayer, feverish men begen shoveling earth onto the body as tearful
women gazed down from an overlooking balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Not one Western diplomat was present at these extraordinary
proceedings. America and its allies, it seems, had already opted to
place their bets elsewhere. But with the issue of the June 12
mandate at last settled, the real difficulties may be just
beginning in Nigeria.

IN CAMPAIGN '98, BEING AN INSIDER IS BACK IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Texas, Ga., Neb., N.C., Mass., Md., Calif., N.M.,
Ark., Ky., Ohio, Ill.)  (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Majestic and historic, the dome of the U.S.
Capitol was once the favored backdrop in television commercials of
contenders for public office. But in recent years, the only
candidates who dared feature the dome in their advertisements were
challengers who made it a symbol of government gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dome is back, in all its patriotic glory.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better demonstration of how dramatically the
political climate has changed this election year than in the
commercials candidates are broadcasting around the country. After
years of shunning Washington and politics-as-usual, even incumbents
who once went out of their way to portray themselves as government
outsiders are proudly trumpeting their insider credentials, the
legislation they passed and their connections in Washington or
their state capital.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of hundreds of commercials broadcast by Democrats
and Republicans alike shows that a striking proportion of
contenders are cramming their advertisements with bland but, they
hope, convincing pitches that include insider attributes like
``experience'' and ``record'' and ``proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Miss., this week unveiled a commercial
with this tag line: ``So much experience. So much he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Texas, the advertisements for Republican Gov. George W.
Bush emphasize that despite his accomplishments, like enacting
``the toughest juvenile justice laws,'' there is much more for him
to do.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan for the campaign of Roy Barnes, a Democratic
candidate for governor in Georgia, is typical: ``Experience and
ideas that work for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Strother, a Democratic media consultant who advises Barnes,
said the commercials he made for the Barnes campaign in 1990
pointedly did not emphasize the Democrat's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago or four years ago, when we filmed our
commercials we wouldn't film them in the marble halls of
Washington,'' Strother said. ``We actually hid incumbency from
people. But experience is no longer a liability. People don't want
to burn down government. They want somebody who can manage it _ and
they're afraid to turn it over to novices.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, a Republican media consultant, explained the shift
this way: ``Because there's less anger, voters want people who are
going to get things done. And they perceive that you get more
things done if you have real experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Several strategists explained that their emphasis on
accomplishments is not based merely on gut instinct but on focus
groups and polls showing that voters have had enough of outsiders
who claim that their naivete about the legislative process is an
asset. These days, voters often rank experience and integrity as
the two most important characteristics that they seek in a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that both parties are reluctant to bash the
status-quo is that both Democrats and Republicans are now the
status quo themselves. In 1994, Republicans could deride the
Democratic-controlled Congress and White House. Now, they run the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago, every Republican was outside the temple saying,
`Tear the temple down!''' recalled Alex Castellanos, a Republican
media consultant. ``We're in the temple now.'' As a result, he
said, he and his colleagues were ``risk averse'' in their
advertising approaches. ``Why take a chance?'' he said.
```Experience that hears you' is the perfect slogan.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advertisements this year could best be described as
30-second, televised resumes. One after another, they feature
newspaper headlines telling of candidates' accomplishments or bills
they proposed. Even nonincumbents are trying to sound like
incumbents. One of the most popular gimmicks is that candidates are
offering toll-free numbers that voters can call to get booklets
listing their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Terry, an Omaha, Neb., City Council member who won the
Republican primary for a House seat, produced an advertisement in
which he looked into the camera and made this pitch: ``All of us
running for Congress talk about what we'll do. But how do you know
we can? Well, I'm the only Republican running with a record. I've
gotten results.''
</P>
<P>
   Another trend this year is the greater hesitancy to run slashing
attack ads. Those who are lashing out are relying less on anonymous
narrators; instead, several politicians are calmly critiquing their
rivals themselves _ directly to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   When Lauch Faircloth first ran for the Senate in North Carolina
six years ago, his advertisements had a decidedly anti-Washington
cast. But now that he is a Republican incumbent, the National
Republican Senatorial Committee is running a commercial that tries
to play up Faircloth's stature as an insider who could not be
corrupted by Washington. ``Washington's a crazy city,'' the
narrator says as grainy images of the city fill the screen. ``They
pay people not to work and they even elected a convicted drug-user
mayor. But our Lauch Faircloth is shakin' up the place _ doing what
he promised.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The anti-incumbency fervor was always more intense at the
federal level than in state campaigns. But several consultants for
gubernatorial candidates said they, too, were dwelling on
experience and incumbency this year more than in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci, a Republican, was lieutenant
governor before taking over from William Weld less than a year ago.
But in Cellucci's quest this year for a full term, he is already
portraying himself as an entrenched incumbent. ``Governor Cellucci
balanced eight budgets in a row,'' the announcer intones in one
commercial, ``and has taken Massachusetts from deficits to a record
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   In his advertisements, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, a
Democrat who faces a spirited primary challenge, ticks off what the
announcer describes as a ``real record of accomplishment,'' from
225 new state troopers to cutting the state income tax. ``It's a
good start,'' the announcer says, ``but there's more to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Though candidates are proclaiming their experience, many still
prefer to deliver their pitches outside the confines of the

   New York Rep. Charles Schumer, who is running in the Democratic
Senate primary, tries his insider pitch from a classroom. The
advertisement closes with these words scrawled on a blackboard:
``Chuck Schumer for Senate. He's done more ... He'll do more ...
For you.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set in California when Lt. Gov. Gray Davis won an
upset victory in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in June by
portraying himself as far more experienced than his two
better-financed rivals. His advisers said the slogan, ``Experience
money can't buy,'' was central to Davis' swift rise in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, Heather Wilson, a Republican candidate in a special
election for the House in New Mexico, appropriated the Davis pitch
in her own successful campaign against a wealthy Democratic state
senator, Phil Maloof. ``Experience money can't buy,'' the announcer
says. ``Heather Wilson for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who lack Washington experience are trying to play up
whatever experience they do have. In one of his commercials, Scott
Ferguson, who ran in the Democratic primary for Senate in Arkansas,
looked into the camera with this appeal: ``Arkansas doesn't need a
senator with a lot of Washington experience. We need a senator with
Arkansas experience.''
</P>
<P>
   He was defeated by former Rep. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, who
declared in her commercials that she had even more experience.
Washington experience.
</P>
<P>
   David Dixon, a Democratic media consultant, created offbeat,
original commercials that emphasized that his candidate for a House
seat in Kentucky, Jonathan Miller, was a family man. But Miller
lost the Democratic primary to Ernesto Scorsone, whose
advertisements reminded viewers that when The Lexington
Herald-Leader endorsed him ``they cited his experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to tug more on the emotional heartstrings,'' Dixon
said, ``but people want to hear more about your resume.''
</P>
<P>
   In a primary for a House seat in Ohio, two Republicans dueled
over just who had the most experience. A commercial for former Rep.
Frank Cremeans featured a shot of the Capitol dome and the slogan,
``We need a congressman with real experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But in her advertisements, Nancy Hollister countered that
Cremeans did not get much done when he was in Washington. ``You've
probably heard that former Congressman Frank Cremeans has never
passed a bill,'' the announcer intones. The advertisement went on
to list Ms. Hollister's record as lieutenant governor, with this
close: ``The bottom line: Nancy Hollister gets results.'' Ms.
Hollister won.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Schriefer, a Republican media consultant, said Washington
insiders are so in vogue that he featured former Sen. Bob Dole in a
commercial for Loleta Didrickson, who lost the Illinois Senate
primary this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used Bob Dole at the end of the ad standing in front of the
Capitol, with just a tag, `Hey Loleta, we need you out here.'''
Schriefer recalled. ``A couple of years ago, four years ago, you
wouldn't have done that.''

MISSOURI: DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATE ANGERS BLACK  
 NEW HAMPSHIRE: IT'S SUNUNU VS. SOMEBODY  
 ARIZONA: SKY-HIGH TRIBUTE GROUNDED BY FALLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the start, this year's Senate race in Missouri had the look
of a close contest, with Democrats figuring they might just capture
the seat and nibble away a bit at the GOP's hold on Capitol Hill.
Republican incumbent Christopher Bond, a moderate who has struggled
in more than one election, seemed to Democratic campaign
strategists to be hardly any stronger in 1998 than he was in 1992
when he squeaked through to a second term with just 52 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Democrats are not so confident.
</P>
<P>
   Their candidate, Attorney General Jay Nixon, also a moderate,
has alienated many black voters _ 20 percent or so of the
Democratic base in Missouri _ by proposing to end busing as a
school desegregation tool. Many black leaders in the state see the
proposal as a prime example of how Democratic leaders around the
country often take the black vote for granted and some are
threatening to support Bond this fall, stay home or even cast about
for another Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It is a political tactic being tried by blacks in a number of
close contests this year, most notably in the governors' races in
Florida and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent members of the Missouri chapter of the NAACP have
picketed Nixon at campaign appearances, ignoring his promises to be
a strong advocate for working people and families. One chapter
official called him the ``reincarnation'' of former Alabama Gov.
George C. Wallace; another announced, ``I'm backing Bond.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, who is black, sent the Bond
campaign a $200 check the other day, asserting it was not an
endorsement of the senator but part of his ``obligation'' to help
the Democratic Party. The state's senior black elected official,
Rep. William Clay Sr. of St. Louis, has urged senior national
Democrats, including President Clinton, not to help Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bond campaigns on, but a bit differently than in 1986
and 1992. This year he is working the black precincts hard, showing
up at churches and social clubs and community centers, normally the
places Nixon would be working hard, except this year Nixon is often
avoiding them lest he run into more picketing.
</P>
<P>
   IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IT'S SUNUNU VS. SOMEBODY
</P>
<P>
   The award for the 1998 election with the most fits and starts _
thus far _ goes to the contest in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional
District, where Democrats have finally settled, for the fourth time
in six weeks, on a candidate to challenge the Republican incumbent,
Rep. John E. Sununu.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The party's first choice was no choice. Nobody wanted to take on
Sununu, New Hampshire not being fertile ground for Democrats these
days.
</P>
<P>
   But then as the June 12 deadline for filing neared, the party
began having second thoughts about giving a free ride to Sununu,
the son of former Gov. John H. Sununu. A Durham educator, Wayne
Burton, was persuaded to run.
</P>
<P>
   He lasted not quite five days before retreating from the fray,
saying the challenge was too daunting. Once again party leaders
resigned themselves to the prospect that Sununu would slip back in
unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   But then, just 30 minutes before the filing deadline, Cynthia
McGovern, a legislative lobbyist, signed up _ only to pull out a
couple of days later when New Hampshire papers reported that she
had once been arrested on a charge of assaulting a state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   Make that almost pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials ruled there could be no pulling out once the
filing deadline had passed. When you're in, you're in, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Again Democrats despaired, anticipating the pounding Ms.
McGovern would probably take over the trooper incident.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. McGovern was still determined not to run, so determined
that she moved out of state, to neighboring Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials relented last Monday, conceding, well, that
when you're out, you're out. Not only that, they said the Democrats
could send in a substitute, if they could find one.
</P>
<P>
   They did.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Choice No. 4 - assuming no Republican challenges the
McGovern decision - is real estate agent Peter Flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take it up hill from here to the top,'' he said as he
hit the campaign trail on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   SKY-HIGH TRIBUTE GROUNDED BY FALLOUT
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Barry Goldwater died in late May, Phoenix Mayor
Skip Rimsza suggested that a wonderful way to honor the former
senator was to change the name of Phoenix's Sky Harbor
International Airport to Barry Goldwater International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   He got 2,000 phone calls in a single day from irate people who
said they dearly loved the senator, but naming the airport for him
was a bad idea because Sky Harbor was a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   A better idea, many suggested, would be to name a mountain
range, park or some big building for the senator, who in his
unsuccessful run for president in 1964 did more than any other
Republican to set the GOP on its current ideological course.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor stood firm. But the negative calls continued to flow
in, along with the negative letters and negative editorials, not to
mention the negative poll that showed two of every three Arizonans
wanted to keep the Sky Harbor name.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor toyed with the idea of holding public hearings on the
matter. But then, second thoughts began to nag at him, especially
after both political friend and foe started warning that the name
change brouhaha was turning into the biggest gaffe of his political
career. They urged him to cut his losses.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday he withdrew his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to move on,'' he said. ``If I made a mistake, it was
a mistake of the heart.''

RUSSIA REACHES AGREEMENT WITH IMF ON AID PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Yeltsin government said on Sunday that it had
reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a
multi-billion-dollar package to stabilize Russia's financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sides have achieved agreement on all major questions of
principal importance,'' the government of President Boris Yeltsin
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was aimed at reassuring investors before the stock
and bond markets opened on Monday. Negotiators for the monetary
fund had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   As fears have grown about Russia's deteriorating economy, the
Clinton administration urged the IMF bring its negotiations to a
speedy close.
</P>
<P>
   John Odling-Smee, the chief negotiator for the fund, arrived in
Moscow on Friday night and immediately plunged into talks with
Anatoly Chubais, the chief Russian negotiator with the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have been informed they will receive $11 billion in
new loans this year from the monetary fund if they meet its
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF financing is part of a package of more more than $20
billion that the Russians hope to assemble from a variety of
sources, including the World Bank, Japan and Western commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Yeltsin aides have issued a series of upbeat
statements to impress anxious investors. And on Sunday a senior
Russian official said the final details of the IMF accord were
being worked out so that it could be announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Representatives of Russia and the IMF will report in detail on
Monday on concrete agreements that have been reached and practical
steps that will be taken soon,'' the semi-official Itar-Tass news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiating the agreement the two sides have had to overcome
important differences.
</P>
<P>
   A major issue in the talks, for example, has been the pace at
which Russia should cut its budget deficit. The two sides now agree
that the deficit should be reduced to 2.8 percent of Russia's Gross
Domestic Product in 1999, from about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even when the negotiations are completed, Russia will
have to overcome hurdles to qualify for the new funds.
</P>
<P>
   Before Russia can qualify for new financing, the IMF is
insisting that the government complete some of the reforms to which
it had agreed as part of an earlier $10 billion loan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the previous IMF loan, for example, the
Russian government was supposed to have taken steps to limit barter
transactions by monopolies, such as Gazprom, the huge natural gas
company, and United Energy Systems, the electrical monopoly,
Russian officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another earlier measure the Russians must now carry out involves
new legislation to preclude unauthorized spending commitments. The
monetary fund wants the Yeltsin government to submit legislation to
Parliament that would require governmental organizations to
register all contracts with the federal treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The Yeltsin government plans to rush ahead with these measures.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF will also be watching closely when the government tries
to win parliamentary approval for its plan to reduce its deficit,
overhaul the tax system and undertake other reforms. The
extraordinary parliamentary session is scheduled for Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The new financing Russia is seeking is vital for its efforts to
restore confidence in the nation's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Central Bank reserves have declined to about $15 billion, and
some $5 billion of that is in gold, which cannot readily be spent.
Foreign investors, however, own about $20 billion in treasury
bills.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is that foreign investors might panic and withdraw
from the treasury bill market. If they took their ruble proceeds
and converted them into dollars, the Central Bank would not have
sufficient reserves to prop up the ruble. That would lead to a
devaluation of the ruble and a political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   The new loans would also be used to help Russia restructure its
short-term debt. Russia has been forced to offer treasury bills at
enormous interest rates to try to attract buyers, and even then
many investors have stayed away.

`RUSSIAN RHYTHMS ON BROADWAY': A FLAIR FOR STRAVINSKY'S
TALE-TELLING
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
By ALLAN KOZINN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Trinity Church, at Wall Street and Broadway, offers
free lunchtime concerts by superb young soloists and ensembles all
through the season, but last year the church staked its claim in
the world of summer festivals by offering a thematically coherent
series. With a grant described in its program book as ``an
anonymous donation to the glory of God and in honor of Johannes
Brahms,'' it commemorated the centenary of Brahms' death with an
overview of his chamber, orchestral and choral works, ``Brahms on
Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the terms of the supporting donation are unchanged _
still anonymous, still dedicated to God and Brahms _ but apparently
the donor has agreed to allow Brahms' music a rest. Now Trinity is
presenting ``Russian Rhythms on Broadway,'' a wide-ranging 10-week
survey that touches on everything from Russian folk song and
liturgical works to Romantic and early modern chamber and
orchestral scores.
</P>
<P>
   All the concerts are on Thursdays at 1 p.m., and in the most
recent installment, Richard Auldon Clark conducted the Manhattan
Chamber Orchestra in two early works by Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The program began with a semi-staged version of ``Renard,''
Stravinsky's 1915 burlesque in which Renard does his best to catch
a rooster for dinner but is outfoxed by the other barnyard animals.
Its companion was ``L'Histoire du Soldat,'' the story of a simple
soldier's series of encounters with the devil, composed in 1918.
</P>
<P>
   What they share, apart from allegorical lessons about the
pitfalls of temptation and pride, is a musical omnivorousness. In
``Renard,'' Stravinsky weaves folk styles and old church modes into
a modern orchestration that drips with the acid humor that was
already a Stravinskian thumbprint.
</P>
<P>
   That sardonic quality suffuses ``Histoire'' as well, and the
centrality of duplicitous figures in both works _ the fox and the
devil _ makes it seem fitting. But where Stravinsky brought
``Renard'' to life with transformations of antique musical models,
in ``Histoire'' he drew from jazz, ragtime and tangos, similarly
bent to suit his own style.
</P>
<P>
   The performances at Trinity treated both works well. In
``Renard,'' the Songfellows vocal ensemble _ Mukund Marath and Greg
Davidson, tenors; Jared Stamm, baritone, and Ross Crolius, bass _
sang with clarity and vigor, wearing masks that represented the
fox, cat, goat and rooster, and acting in a stylized way that
reflected the score's olden currents and suggested a medieval
church play. Costuming touches like a red Mostly Mozart apron
undercut that impression to a degree, much as the humorous touches
in Stravinsky's score did.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra supported Songfellows solidly, although only its
broadest strokes could be heard clearly; much of the detail was
lost in the church's swimmy acoustics. ``Histoire'' fared better in
that sense. Stravinsky's scoring, for septet, is notably more
transparent, and Clark's ensemble was equal to its often soloistic
challenges. Particularly striking were Karen Rostron's earthy
readings of the recurrent fiddle figure and Chris Gekker's clean,
virtuosic trumpet playing.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Bloom narrated the tale, and if the amplification was
heavier than necessary, it did not destroy the considerable nuance
with which she distinguished each character's voice, and the
soldier's various changes of heart.

   Conspiracy or bad choice of words? An Internet service provider
in Vancouver, British Columbia, says an error message in
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 is advising his customers to take
their business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The message appears in a dialogue box that pops up when
something goes wrong. It says, ``You might want to try selecting
`other Internet provider' from the list of Internet service
providers.'' The error message affects only certain Explorer users
who have built Web pages with Microsoft's Front Page Express.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, customers of MDI Internet Inc. are calling the
company's customer service line for help. The messages ``just
totally confuse your customers into believing there's got to be
something wrong with your company and to choose a different one,''
says Shiloh Costa, MDI's senior system administrator.
</P>
<P>
   What it also means, he said, is that Microsoft is trying to get
his company to move from the Unix operating system to Microsoft's
Windows NT and its server software.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Adam Sohn, conceded that the message was
confusing but insisted it was an innocent mistake. ``It was never
our intention to advise people to go out and find another ISP,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to issue software to fix the problem on its
Web site and will change the message in future versions of Internet
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sohn said, the message is not even referring to
Internet service providers like MDI but to the transmission
protocol used for sending and receiving data. He said the company
would change the wording to ``Please choose another transmission
protocol'' or something like it.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes the mistake was so innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its an old trick,'' said Ken Wasch, president of the Software
Publishers Association in Washington. Microsoft, he said, has in
the past included error messages in its applications that encourage
users to take certain actions that promote other Microsoft
products, like error messages saying a product is not compatible,
when it is.

   Chat Software Company Joins America Online
</P>
<P>
   Decisions of the digital age: What do you do when your small
technology start-up is bought by America Online for $287 million?
The founders of Mirabilis, based in Tel Aviv, Israel, know. They
flew the entire staff to New York for a weekend-long celebration.
</P>
<P>
   So on Friday, 68 Israeli software developers filled the back of
Lot 61, a nightclub on West 21st St. in New York, doing in real
time what users of their product do on line: chat.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabilis, in its two years of existence, has developed a
formidable following for its chat software, called ICQ _ short for
``I seek you.'' The company says 14 million people have downloaded
the free software, a figure that surely piqued the interest of
America Online, the biggest Internet service provider in the United
States, which has about an equal number of members and a much
larger marketing budget.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of Mirabilis with America Online has raised the
eyebrows of the company's faithful. To counter concerns that its
essence would disappear under the America Online umbrella,
Mirabilis has posted a letter on its Web site at www.mirabilis.com
assuring users that the company's staff, spirit and free
distribution will remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Mac Is Out; The Mac Is Back
</P>
<P>
   Just as Steve Jobs was taking the stage in New York to flaunt
Apple Computer's financial upturn and sing the praises of the
company's new consumer strategy, Wells Fargo Bank was busy
informing its online banking customers that it would no longer
support the Macintosh version of Quicken, the leading
financial-software program from Intuit Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In their announcement, bank representatives said that users of
Mac Quicken amounted to only about 1 percent of their online users,
or 7,000 customers. As of Aug. 7, they would no longer be able to
log on, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently, 7,000 customers wield a lot of clout. By the end
of the week, the bank had received so many complaints _ more than
700 of them _ that it reversed its position and said it would
continue to support the Mac product. Quicken users on the Mac will
continue to be able to download statements, pay their bills and
view the status of their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the Mac's small market share among its customers,
other components of the bank's online strategy had priority,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Macintosh users prevented
Quicken from getting the ax. In the spring, Intuit also cited a
shrinking market share when it said it would stop developing a new
Macintosh version of Quicken. In that case, a direct appeal from
Jobs persuaded Intuit to reverse its position.

   LOS ANGELES _ This and that from the boxing world:
</P>
<P>
   Well, we haven't seen the last of promoter Don King.
</P>
<P>
   King, the ``Only in America'' man, has again ended up on the
fortunate end of the American justice system. He was acquitted last
week on all charges that he faked a contract to cheat Lloyd's of
London out of $350,000 after one of his boxing promotions was
canceled in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of his good fortune:
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, he shot and killed a man, but it was ruled justifiable
homicide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he was convicted of second-degree murder, but the
charge was reduced to manslaughter. He served only 3 years, 11
months in an Ohio prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, King was named in a 23-count indictment for income-tax
evasion but was acquitted of all counts the following year.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, there was last week's decision,
</P>
<P>
   It'll be interesting to see what role King will play now.
</P>
<P>
   He's 65 and reported to be in failing health. He lost his gold
mine, Mike Tyson. Evander Holyfield is his only fighter with the
ability to generate a great deal of money and it's unclear how many
fights under which he has the champ under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it seems, he'll make his presence felt....
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the boxing world have respect for the skills of
Naseem Hamed, the flamboyant Briton who has become one of the
sport's biggest moneymakers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most-respected trainers in the world isn't one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Steward laid into the unbeaten featherweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's strictly hype,'' Steward said. ``They have to match him
very carefully. He can't fight. That's why they're matching him
with weather-worn fighters. He can't beat the top fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``...He doesn't have the basic foundation (of skills). They put
him in with older guys (example: 30-year-old Kevin Kelley) and he
beats them with the physical strength of a young man.''
</P>
<P>
   What do you (ITAL)really(END ITAL) think, Emanuel?...
</P>
<P>
   Long-time broadcaster, Don Dunphy, who recently turned 90,
worked more than 2,000 fights, including roughly 200 championship
bouts, according to the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He believes Joe Louis' knockout of Billy Conn in 1941 was the
most dramatic moment in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   However, who's the best he's seen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Louis, Marciano and Ali were, to me, the best of the
heavyweights,'' he wrote in his 1988 autobiography, ``but Robinson
was unquestionably the best of three divisions _ lightweight,
welterweight and middleweight _ and he was winning the
light-heavyweight title (from Joey Maxim at Yankee Stadium) when
the 106-degree heat did him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with those who say that Sugar Ray Robinson was the
greatest.''...
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen, the promoter of Azumah Nelson, is trying to match
his fighter against Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who stopped Jesse James Leija on Saturday, has a
terrific chin. Without question, Hamed's power would be tested.
However, he and his handlers know that and it might be difficult to
make the fight....
</P>
<P>
   Lou Del Valle told a group of writers that his ``fantasy is to
tell all you guys, `Kneel, kneel. Bow your heads,''' after he beats
Roy Jones Jr. on Saturday at The Theater at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   If they bow their heads, it will be to get a better look at Del
Valle lying on the canvas in the title-unification fight on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   This should be a typical one-sided Jones victory. Only a master
boxer _ like Montell Griffin _ could give Jones problems. Del
Valle, while capable, is hardly that fighter.
</P>
<P>
   His only loss, on points, came against Virgil Hill in 1996.
Jones knocked out Hill in four rounds with a crushing body punch
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   If Jones doesn't attack aggressively, this could be a dull
fight. Both fighters are counterpunchers.
</P>
<P>
   On the same card, Kevin Kelley faces Derrick Gainer in a
junior-lightweight rematch of a wonderful fight in 1996, in which
Kelley, his eye swollen shut and behind on points, stopped Gainer
with one punch in the eighth round....
</P>
<P>
   A bout between Jorge Paez and Gustavo Cuello on July 25 in Las
Vegas has been rescheduled for Aug. 22 because Paez had oral
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Paez, too, is campaigning for a shot at Hamed. Wouldn't that be
interesting? ``The Clown Prince'' and ``The Prince.''...
</P>
<P>
   The Forum has announced the pairings for its junior-lightweight
tournament. On July 27, Jose Luis Castillo will face unbeaten Adan
Castillas and Ricard Rivera will take on Armando Bosques. On Aug.
17, undefeated Acelino Freitas (15-0, 14 KOs) fights Vincent Howard
and Sandro Marcos faces Golden ``Demon'' Johnson....
</P>
<P>
   The Forum's Ed Mahone faces Daniel Netto in a heavyweight bout
next Monday at the Forum.

 By KAREN W. ARENSON  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In many ways, Donald and Mildred Othmer were like any
other faculty couple. He was a professor of chemical engineering at
Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, a workaholic with scores of
patents and a sideline in consulting. She was a former teacher and
a buyer for her mother's dress stores who volunteered at the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Planned Parenthood. They had no
children, unless you count the students he invited home to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   When they died _ he in 1995 and she in April, both in their 90s
_ they left their money to many of their favorite charities,
including his university and the places where she volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   But the level of their generosity distinguished them from the
typical academic couple, putting them more in a league with the Ted
Turners and George Soroses of the world. The value of their
combined estates is approximately three-quarters of a billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although Othmer was a successful inventor and a tireless
consultant, there is another explanation for the stunning total.
Some decades ago, the couple invested most of their savings with an
old family friend from Omaha: Warren Buffett, the stock market
wizard who runs the investment company Berkshire Hathaway. And
thanks to patience, the booming market and Buffett's golden touch,
the Othmers were transformed over the years from comfortable to
wealthy to staggeringly rich _ all with barely an outward sign of
change.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the beneficiaries of their gifts, some of them modest
institutions of little renown, that stand to be transformed, with
the Othmers' bequests instantly multiplying their resources and
vastly broadening their possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Polytechnic, for instance, stands to receive nearly $200
million, a sum about four times the school's entire endowment. Long
Island College Hospital, also in Brooklyn, is in line for about
$160 million. The University of Nebraska and the Chemical Heritage
Foundation, in Philadelphia, also expect to get more than $100
million, while a number of other institutions will also get
multimillion-dollar gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an amazing estate,'' said Theodore Wagner, the New York
estate tax lawyer who helped the Othmers draw up their wills. ``It
is really quite astounding that this nice couple was able to drop
so much money on so many institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   For the recipients, the gifts are like winning the lottery.
Officials at Polytechnic, for example, see the money as a way for
the university of 2,000 students to climb from a second- or
third-tier engineering institution into more selective company,
with an endowment per student larger than that found at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, N.Y., or Carnegie-Mellon
University, in Pittsburgh. ``We start from being one of the
have-nots and go to being one of the very well-endowed schools,''
said Polytechnic's president, David Chang.
</P>
<P>
   The final amounts of the bequests will depend both on legal
negotiations surrounding the wills and on the stock market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One set of negotiations is between the charitable institutions
and Mary Donahoo Seina of Omaha, Mrs. Othmer's niece, who is to
receive less than $2 million under Mrs. Othmer's will. Mrs. Seina,
who is in her mid-60s, declined to be interviewed, said her lawyer,
James Fitzgerald. But she told The Omaha World-Herald in May that
her own family deserved more, and that her aunt no longer wanted to
leave her money to the same institutions and had revoked her will.
Fitzgerald said only that the settlement talks were continuing.
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions about how much of the estate should be
disbursed under the terms of Othmer's will and how much under Mrs.
Othmer's; that issue could affect exactly how much each institution
receives.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the sums will also be tied to the value of
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway shares. After initially investing
$25,000 each in a partnership with Buffett in the early 1960s, the
couple received shares of Berkshire Hathaway in 1970 at $42 a
share. The stock closed on Friday at $77, 250 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say that Mrs. Othmer's estate contains about 7,500
shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock; her husband's approximately
7,000 shares were sold after his death in 1995, at just under
$30,000 a share.
</P>
<P>
   While the huge gifts hold the promise of substantial change for
some of the beneficiaries, the enormous wealth had little effect on
the Othmers themselves, who lived comfortably but not
ostentatiously and rarely talked about their money.
</P>
<P>
   W. Fred Schurig, a protege and colleague of Othmer, recalls
Othmer's making only one brief reference to his investments, in the
elevator at Polytechnic, decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back from Omaha and was telling me about this guy
Buffett and how investing with him was going to be lucrative,''
Schurig said. ``I said I had $5,000 and asked, `Would he take
that?' But he said, `That's not enough; he wouldn't touch that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He never brought it up again,'' Schurig said.
</P>
<P>
   The shares made the Othmers rich many years ago, and during
their lives they had quietly made a number of multimillion-dollar
gifts. But it was only in recent years that their wealth shot into
the stratosphere. At the time the Othmers wrote their wills in 1988
_ Othmer drafted much of the meticulous detail himself, down to a
small Rembrandt etching and 12 carved elephants, each in a
different Burmese wood _ Berkshire Hathaway was selling at about
$4,700, and their shares were worth about $68 million. (He revised
his will in 1994.)
</P>
<P>
   Even without the Buffett millions, it is easy to see Othmer as
the classic American success story: a poor boy who reached the top
of his profession, widely known as a consultant and co-editor of
the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Omaha, he developed a lifelong frugality as
he earned money picking dandelions from neighbors' lawns,
delivering newspapers and telegrams and walking a farmer's cow to
and from pasture. After graduating from the University of Nebraska
and earning a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1927, he set
out for Rochester and Eastman Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   His research contributed to more than 40 patents for Kodak, most
of them involving the distillation and concentration of acetic acid
. But unhappy to be making only a $10 bonus per patent, he headed
out on his own in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Depression, however, and business was slow, so when
Brooklyn Polytechnic made him an offer in 1932, he accepted.
Polytechnic gave him a lab, allowed him to collect his patent
earnings and provided a steady stream of graduate assistants for
his research and consulting. Unless he was traveling, he was
usually in his lab six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   By conventional measures, he was not much of a teacher. Former
students recall that he was so wrapped up in research and
consulting that he spent little time preparing lectures and would
abandon class to take calls from his consulting clients. But to
generations of ambitious young students, many of them
first-generation immigrants, he was the ideal role model and
mentor, one who involved them in his research, took them home for
dinner and found them jobs. Some named their children after him.
Others, like Joseph Jacobs, called him the most important influence
in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not only an excellent chemical engineer, but he was
also ambition incarnate,'' Jacobs, chairman of his own engineering
firm in Pasadena, Calif., wrote in his autobiography, ``The Anatomy
of an Entrepreneur.''
</P>
<P>
   Othmer's first marriage fizzled. But then he met Mildred Topp,
known as Mid, a former high school teacher who earned a master's
degree from Columbia Teachers College in 1945 and served as a buyer
for her mother's fashion shops in Omaha. Friends describe her as
Othmer's intellectual equal, someone who shared his devotion to his
career but was also able to stand up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mid was very smart and a full participant in
decision-making,'' Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   They were married at the Plaza Hotel in 1950, and settled into a
town house in Brooklyn Heights with a view of the harbor stretching
from the Statue of Liberty to the Brooklyn Bridge. They lived on
two floors and rented the other three.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Othmer was an active volunteer while her husband distilled
chemicals. She helped out in the Botanic Garden's plant sales and
at Planned Parenthood's thrift shop. She also served on Planned
Parenthood's board, while her husband became a trustee of the Long
Island College Hospital, just a few blocks from their house.
</P>
<P>
   Othmer, a tall, solid man with wavy brown hair, impressed
everyone with his insatiable curiosity and his strong will. When
other professors planned a new encyclopedia on chemistry, for
example, he muscled his way into the project, convinced that it
should include chemical engineering to broaden its interest to
industry. He became co-editor of the resulting Kirk-Othmer
Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, which quickly became the
industry bible.
</P>
<P>
   At the Othmer home, Othmer's students, colleagues and clients
were frequent guests. So were visitors from Omaha, including
Buffett, who became a good friend.
</P>
<P>
   As Buffett recalls it, Mrs. Othmer's mother, Mattie Topp, first
approached him about investing money for the family around 1958,
when he was 27 and managing less than $1 million. She had used
Buffett's father as her broker before he became a congressperson .
</P>
<P>
   Other family members withdrew money but the Othmers were patient
investors, adding money from time to time. When Buffett dissolved
the partnership in 1969 and the Othmers chose to take shares in
Berkshire Hathaway, Othmer's investment had grown to $770,000 and
his wife's to $817,000. ``They just rode along,'' Buffett said,
adding that the burgeoning investment ``never changed their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only in recent years that some of the Othmers' intended
beneficiaries began to get a clue about the windfall they had
coming. Even those who knew they would inherit something had little
idea of how much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don and Mid had said, `Don't worry, we're putting you in our
wills,''' said Arnold Thackray, president of the Chemical Heritage
Foundation, a group dedicated to the history of chemistry and
chemical technology. ``When someone does that, you smile and say,
`Thank you, that's very nice.''' Buffett is used to dealing with
large sums of money, but he, too, calls the Othmer bequests an
``amazing story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were such high-quality, nice people, who had no children
and wanted to translate their wealth into something beneficial to
society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Buffett suggested, somewhat tantalizingly, that there might
be others whose investments with him will eventually yield vast
bequests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more coming,'' he said. ``There are going to be some
bigger ones than this.''

COMMENTARY: IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Governments in Italy since World War II have lasted, on
average, 11 months. Romano Prodi has now been prime minister for
more than two years. Interviewing him just before a critical
political test, I began by asking, ``Will you survive?''
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle I didn't survive all this time,'' Prodi said,
smiling. ``In reality I did. If I look at rationality, there are
some problems. But politics is never rational.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders of democracies around the world, Prodi is
unique. He has no party and no political past. He was a professor
of economics at the University of Bologna when, a few years ago, he
began campaigning for a shake-up in Italian politics. He proposed a
new center-left coalition with himself, a man who had never held
elective office, as leader. Amazingly, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   After two years in office, he continues to take delight in his
odd position.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told [Prime Minister Ryutaro) Hashimoto [of Japan) that
I delivered my first speech in Parliament as prime minister,''
Prodi said, ``he was furious! He waited years. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in the luxurious position of not having any burden of a
party _ and being indispensable to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Prodi interesting is not just his survival skills, or
his sense of humor. It is what he has done in office.
</P>
<P>
   When The Financial Times of London surveyed Italy last month,
its headline was, ``Italy: Promoted to Europe's Premier League.''
(The top English football teams play in the Premier League.)
</P>
<P>
   Prodi's prime goal when he took office was to have Italy
included in the planned European Monetary Union and its common
currency, the euro. That looked impossible. The rules for joining
required a country to have a budget deficit of not more than 3
percent of gross domestic product, and Italy's deficit was 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But when the EU made its decision, two months ago, Italy was
included. In two years the Prodi government had cut the deficit
below 3 percent of GDP. The annual inflation rate was also down, to
1.7 percent. And the interest rate on government bonds was down to
5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   How was it done? In a word, discipline. Prodi resisted pressures
for what in Washington is called pork-barrel spending. The lure of
the euro was a big help. All parties wanted to see Italy in the
monetary union, and Prodi could tell them that without fiscal
discipline it would not happen.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining discipline is harder now, without the leverage of
the euro. But Prodi plans a further round of reforms, including
reform of Italy's notoriously inefficient state bureaucracy.
Whether he will survive to carry them out depends on the working of
his half-finished project to reshape the political system.
</P>
<P>
   He wants what he calls a ``normal'' democracy, with a left party
and a right party. What he has is a bloc of genuinely reformed
ex-Communists and some centrists in his coalition, and a right-wing
group including ex-Fascists as the opposition _ neither with a
majority in Parliament. Standing apart are the Refounded Communists
_ unreconstructed Leninists. Prodi needs their support in votes of
confidence to survive. And they have undertaken to give him that
support at least until the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the coalition has worked for two years is
important,'' he said. ``Ideology is declining. It's a fantastic
change in the country _ former Fascists and Communists as part of
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Italy has troops in Bosnia and Macedonia, and concerns in
Kosovo. ``Sometimes I ask myself if it is possible to keep people
living together,'' Prodi said. He saw the European Union as the
model for the solution: ``A higher authority that respects regional
and ethnic identities.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Prodi visited Iran, the first Western leader to do
so since the election of its moderate president, Mohammad Khatami.
I asked how he appraised Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows democracy,'' Prodi said. ``He knows how important it
is for Iran to be in the international community again. He has read
the political philosophers. I discussed Machiavelli with him, and
Bertolt Brecht's `Galileo.'''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder whether any Western political leader but Romano Prodi
would discuss the works of Bertolt Brecht with Khatami.

<P>
   BALLYMONEY, Northern Ireland _ Three young Roman Catholic boys
were burned to death in their home early Sunday morning in an arson
attack that police said was the work of Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Political and religious leaders, both Protestant and Roman
Catholic, throughout the British province denounced the killings,
which followed more than a week of Protestant violence linked to
the banning of a Protestant march through a Catholic area and
heightened fears of a breakdown in the Northern Ireland peace
agreement reached this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Ballymoney, a largely Protestant village 40 miles north
of Belfast, stunned residents, some weeping, walked quietly around
the mostly Protestant public housing complex of Carnany Estate,
made up of two-story white stucco row houses. They stared up at the
scorched walls and windows of the upstairs room where the three
Quinn boys _ Richard, 10, Mark, 9, and Jason, 7 _ had been sleeping
when attackers threw a flaming gasoline bomb though a downstairs
window at about 4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The boys' mother, Christine Quinn, 29; her Protestant boyfriend,
Raymond Craig, 31, and a woman friend who was in the house were
unable to reach the children before escaping.
</P>
<P>
   When firefighters and police arrived, they found the boys dead.
The boys' father, John Quinn, who was separated from their mother,
was believed to be in England, where he lives and works.
</P>
<P>
   There were no arrests by Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, as young girls brought bouquets of flowers to
the site, handing them over to the police who stood guard around
the house, grief-stricken neighbors and relatives discussed the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just typical boys _ just ran about and played
football, sat about watching videos,'' said Shirley Patton, Mrs.
Quinn's cousin and a Protestant. She said that although Mrs. Quinn
is a Catholic, she sent her sons to a local public school.
</P>
<P>
   All but a few families in the area are Protestant, Mrs. Patton
said, standing in her doorway, a British Union Jack fluttering from
the side of her house. Her son, Russell, 11, who had been a friend
of the dead Quinn boys, played with a small dog to distract
himself. Asked what he thought of the incident, Russell lowered his
head and said softly, ``Deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Patton's father, Robert, had one word for the people who
killed the boys: ``Trash.'' He was helping to arrange the funeral
at a nearby Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Richard Rogers, an unemployed salesman, said
someone in the housing complex must have given the arsonists
information to indicate where the Catholic family lived. Rogers, a
member of the Progressive Unionist Party, which represents a
Protestant paramilitary group that is observing a cease-fire, said
he doubted Protestant paramilitaries had any part in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sad, sick individuals full of sectarian hatred,'' he said
about the arsonists.
</P>
<P>
   He, like many others, linked the boys' death to the outbreaks of
violence by Protestants that have accompanied a standoff between
British security forces and members of the Protestant Orange Order
who are protesting a ban on parading through a Catholic
neighborhood in Portadown, south of here.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, Rogers said, insists it holds ``the high moral
ground'' in the dispute over the Portadown march. ``But where's the
logic when children are burned in their beds?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   His words were echoed by Archbishop Robin Eames, the Church of
Ireland's Protestant Primate, in an appeal to the Orangemen who
have been demonstrating in Drumcree on the edge of Portadown.
``Quietly walk away,'' Eames said. ``In the name of God, please
leave the hill at Drumcree. You've made your points.''
</P>
<P>
   Public anxiety rose Sunday night when the Orange Order declared
it would not call off its protests and was asking all 70,000
members to join the demonstrations in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Some Orangemen said the British government was ultimately to
blame for the killings by blocking their parade. Others said
Protestant paramilitaries must have had a hand in the firebombing,
which came 10 days after Protestant arsonists burned 10 Catholic
churches, destroying three.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, the leader of the Progressive Unionist Party, David
Ervine, said all sides were to blame for the ``savage, savage''
act. ``We are morally bankrupt in a situation that will bring us to
hell.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first public official to arrive at the housing complex
Sunday morning was the Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line Protestant
leader who called the killings ``diabolical, hellish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sympathy goes out to the family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As political leaders and clerics deplored the killings and
called for calm, the question most people here were asking was:
Would the horror of the boys' deaths help end the violence that has
been spreading in the province, or only worsen it?
</P>
<P>
   The violence has threatened to undermine the Northern Ireland
peace agreement approved last spring and the new Assembly, which is
to enact political reforms to give the province's Catholic minority
greater power.
</P>
<P>
   At Drumcree, where the Orangemen have been attacking policemen
blocking the roads to the Catholic area, a few Orange Protestants
said today that the boys' deaths might decrease the number of
protesters, particularly on Monday, when about 500 Orange parades
are to take place around the province to celebrate the 17th-century
Protestant victory over Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevalent view seemed to be that of a 41-year-old civil
servant, who declined to give his name for fear of reprisals. He
said the protests must continue at Drumcree. ``It's a matter of our
freedom, our right to walk on the Queen's highway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed British officials, including Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who refused to let the march go down the Garvaghy Road in
the Catholic area. Catholics view the parades as triumphalist and
demeaning to them.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Pollock, an Orange supporter, said she was ``totally
devastated'' by the boys' deaths, but added that the Orangemen are
right to stand up to the Catholic community because ``they're
taking Northern Ireland away from us. They want a united Ireland,
which we don't want.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters who have attacked the troops and the police at
Drumcree are ``just extremists, just a bunch of kids hanging about
with nothing to do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she conceded, ``There's too much hate and not enough
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, several hours after the firebombing, a British
Government commission denied an appeal by the Orange Order against
the ban on the march at Drumcree. The two leaders of the new
Northern Ireland Assembly, David Trimble, a Protestant, and Seamus
Mallon, a Catholic, urged the Orangemen to give up their protests
and go home.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Flanagan, the chief constable of police for Northern
Ireland, said: ``What went on last night was not protest. We
believe we are investigating the sectarian murder of three children
_ Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn _ asleep in their beds. That's not
protest. That's murder.''

PURPLE HOUSE MAKES SOME TEXANS SEE RED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mexico)  (lb) 
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Sandra Cisneros, the poet and novelist whose work
explores the relationship between home and identity, did not want
her own long-yearned-for house to be bland or timid or understated.
The old coat of beige paint it had would not do. Ms. Cisneros found
what she was looking for in Sherwin-Williams Corsican purple.
Overnight, her bungalow became the Purple House.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a kind of blank canvas, as well, layered with
symbolism and inspiring intense passions and debate in this proudly
Mexican-American city.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on who is looking at it, it is a work of art, a
flagrant violation of the rules in Ms. Cisneros' historic
neighborhood, a flag signifying Mexican-American pride, an
embodiment of border culture, a symbol of freedom of expression, a
sign of Ms. Cisneros' identification with her Mexican-American
roots, a reflection of Ms. Cisneros' uppityness, a brilliant
publicity stunt, a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My granddaughter calls it the Barney house,'' said the Rev.
Tom Chavana, a nondenominational minister who lives across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio has plenty of colorful buildings _ the new library
is enchilada red _ and a purple house might not have created such a
stir were it not for its being in the historic Victorian King
William neighborhood. The city's Historic Design and Review
Commission ruled that Corsican purple was historically incorrect _
even if it was ``exquisite,'' as Milton Babbitt, the architect in
the group, called it _ and had to be changed.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, with the novelist and the city negotiating over
the color, the house is still purple, though its original intensity
has faded somewhat in the Texas sun.
</P>
<P>
   Elsa Calderone, 73, who lives a block away and is confined to
her home because of poor health, insists on being driven by
whenever she goes to the doctor. ``It's like a fairy tale,'' said
Mrs. Calderone, whose own house is white. ``I belong to the King
William Association and I agree with their standards, but once in a
while you need something like that to brighten up your life.''
</P>
<P>
   People have come from all over to see the house, writing down
their opinions _ everyone has an opinion on the Purple House _ on
the legal tablet that Ms. Cisneros, ever the probing novelist, has
attached to a clipboard on her front gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beautiful house,'' wrote Jeff from San Francisco. ``I love the
color. What's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   A man named Gene Elder wrote: ``I love the discussion that
purple has brought to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it _ they can shove it,'' wrote Maria from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   One of seven children of a Mexican upholsterer and his
Mexican-American wife, Ms. Cisneros, 43, grew up up in Chicago but
traveled often to Mexico City to visit her grandmother. ``What the
house is saying is, `I'm very Mexican, and I'm proud of it,' and
that it's another way of being American,'' the author said in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gossen, the vice chairman of the historic commission, said
he thought the Purple House was saying something else. ``It's not
about ethnicity,'' he said. ``It's about eccentricity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Cisneros has written about the working class and
downtrodden all her life,'' added Gossen, a banker whose house is
brown brick. ``Yet she's acting like the privileged class that
doesn't have to follow the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the purple, Gossen finds it ``appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cisneros drives a small red pickup truck with a bumper
sticker that says ``Wild Women Don't Get the Blues.'' She is
``nobody's mother, and nobody's wife,'' according to the author's
note in her acclaimed novel ``The House on Mango Street'' (Vintage,
1991). She shares her two-bedroom house on Guenther Street with
five cats, three dogs and two parrots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course her house is purple,'' Jan Jarboe, who is also a
writer living in San Antonio, said admiringly. ``I'm surprised it
isn't dripping with rhinestones.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhinestones do, in fact, decorate the horseshoe beside Ms.
Cisneros' front door. Her dog Violetta, a small mutt who often
accompanies her to readings, has a rhinestone collar.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Vasquez y Sanchez, who oversees public art for the city
and also sits on the commission, says he considers the Purple House
to be public art, and historic besides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color purple is pre-Columbian,'' Sanchez said. ``If you
want to see purple, go to Mexico. I told them, `You're using a
northeastern palette for colors. What you should do is realize
where you're at.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The mansions built by the wealthy German merchants who settled
Ms. Cisneros' neighborhood in the late 19th century are mostly
white and beige. But the historic commission has not aggressively
enforced color rules, and King William, home to struggling artists
and laborers as well as bankers and lawyers, also has bungalows
painted pink, orange and even red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The House on Mango Street,'' the narrator, a young girl
named Esperanza who lives in the Chicago barrio, is ashamed of her
``sad red house, the house I belong but do not belong to.'' What
she longs for: ``A house all my own. With my porch and my pillow,
my pretty purple petunias.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cisneros' porch has a pink floor, a bed for lounging and a
stuffed bull on the wall. Outside there are pink geraniums, yellow
sunflowers, a flock of pink plastic flamingoes and a purple swing
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted my own swing set,'' the author said, giving a
tour the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Her house is filled with books, altars to the Virgin of
Guadalupe, and the exuberant paintings of her artist friends. The
walls are green, pink, purple and even white.
</P>
<P>
   As for the exterior, both Ms. Cisneros and the city say they
hope to reach a compromise. Ms. Cisneros, who has rejected such
suggested colors as Plymouth green and Colonial-revival tan, has
proposed repainting the roof terra cotta. The city has yet to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a novel,'' said the author, who is finishing her
second novel, ``Caramelo,'' about a Mexican-American family. ``You
have to guess how it will end.''

   POLITICS-INCUMBENCY (Austin, Texas) _ There is no better
demonstration of how the political climate has dramatically changed
this election year than in the commercials candidates are
broadcasting. After years of shunning Washington and
politics-as-usual, even incumbents who once went out of their way
to portray themselves as government outsiders are proudly
trumpeting their insider credentials. An examination of hundreds of
commercials shows that a striking proportion of contenders are
cramming their ads with bland but, they hope, convincing pitches
about their ``experience'' and ``record.'' By Richard L. Berke.

   LUNA-MOTH (New York) _ The endangered, lovely Luna moth is being
reintroduced to Central Park, part of a plan to reintroduce one
species to each borough. Riding delicate pale green wings, with
scalloped, gossamer edges trailing in the darkness, the luna moth,
one of the most spectacular insects on Earth, flew through the
nights of New York City before it succumbed to the stresses of
pesticides and development. Now the luna will be taking flight here
once again. On July 20, the 29th anniversary of the lunar landing,

COMMENTARY: IS THERE A RIGHT TO SEX? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Does a poor man have as much right to sex as a rich
man? Ask anybody that question, and the answer will be yes.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the recent decision by Kaiser Permanente, the
health plan of 9 million people nationwide, not to cover the cost
of the potency pill Viagra will meet with disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   This despite Kaiser's upfront explanation: The $7 pill costs too
much. If Kaiser were to pay for unrestricted use of the
sought-after drug, pharmaceutical bills would jump 10 percent _ a
cost that would sharply increase premiums paid by all.
</P>
<P>
   Some other health plans, worried about their images at a time
that every HMO wears a ``kick me'' sign on its back, will pick up
the cost of one potency pill a week. Even so, Kaiser's frankness
draws the larger issue that politicians hate to confront: Should
medicine be rationed, and if so, by whom?
</P>
<P>
   The answer used to be: Leave it up to doctors. Supposedly,
patients would then get the treatment they needed, unhampered by
the niggling naysaying of insurance company accountants.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not account for an epidemic of incurable greed.
Insured patients were greedy (``Never mind that $100 X-ray, doc,
give me a $1,000 MRI''); doctors were intimidated (``If I don't
give this hypochondriac all the expensive tests he wants, he'll sue
me for malpractice'') as well as greedy (``Why shouldn't I make as
much as a trial lawyer?'').
</P>
<P>
   This incentive to waste and overcharge drove up demand for
medical services without increasing the supply. The result was the
incredible inflation of costs. Insurance cost more and covered less
because the one law you can't repeal is supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton came up with an answer: Let government manage
care, ration medicine on the basis of need and subsidize health
care for everyone with increased taxes. This liberal approach
wasn't crazy, but Americans overwhelmingly rejected her approach as
overly intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   That did not stop the idea of ``managed care'' as a rationer;
some institution has to say no, to play the villain, to limit
demand. And so we had the rise of HMOs as a hate object, with some
of the mismanaged ones deserving the fury that patients would have
aimed at bumbling government.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, liberal politicians are offering to ride to
the rescue by having government carefully manage the privately
managed care. Because publicly financed campaigns and tobacco
taxing fizzled as voter-turnouters, ``patient protection'' has
become the Democrats' chosen issue this fall.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we see the president pitching a ``patient's bill of
rights'' that would force the insured to pay for more benefits.
(It's not the employer or the HMO that pays; in the end, the
insured pays.) Such pressure pushes Republicans to counter with
tax-free medical savings accounts and closer regulation of the most
stupidly bureaucratic of the HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   But few will whisper a truism of American life: People who can
afford it are able to buy better health care. The poor, elderly,
disabled and otherwise dependent are entitled to an adequate level
of treatment, but above that level is the best care that money
should be able to buy.
</P>
<P>
   If you work hard, save and invest, you and your family will eat
better, shelter better, travel farther and enjoy yourselves more
than others. Although nobody in America need starve, live without a
roof, or be denied basic medical care or equal opportunity, the
reason most of us earn and save money is to do much better than
subsist.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't that unfair? John F. Kennedy had the answer: ``Life is
unfair.'' The world now knows that nonmonopoly capitalism makes
life better for more people than leveling-down socialism.
</P>
<P>
   To the point: Should the government direct that the price of
something as life-enhancing as a potency pill be within easy reach
of poor and rich alike? The nonpopulist answer few politicians dare
utter: No. The free market does it better.
</P>
<P>
   High initial price and heavy demand will soon draw other pill
makers to produce a better pill at a lower price, which competing
health plans will eagerly cover. The patient's insurance bill will
cost less than a spinmeister's ``bill of rights,'' and all of us
geezers, rich and poor, will be happily rutting around like
rabbits.

 &HT;    Maddux ignores accomplishments
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami _ No one in baseball studies the game closer than Greg
Maddux, who relies on a near-photographic memory of players and
performances every time he takes the mound. About the only thing he
specifically ignores is how he has performed over his 11 years in
the majors. He finds his life is easier that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be why I do it, to keep the weight of expectations
off my shoulders,'' Maddux said. ``It's my way of trying to control
it. I understand the expectations on me are as high as anyone,
expect maybe (St. Louis' Mark) McGwire and a couple guys like that.
The expectations are tough to deal with sometimes but you try to do
what you can to lighten them.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Maddux was aware his loss Saturday night ended his
10-game win streak but he had no idea he had also won 16 straight
on the road until the Marlins beat him 4-3. He knows he is having a
strong year but doesn't know he leads the league in four
categories. He won't look back, primarily because he doesn't want
to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to do it,'' he said. ``I'm aware I've had some pretty
special years but I'm also aware it doesn't matter. It's not going
to help me win my next game. How many young pitchers throw shutouts
and win just one of their next five games? They may have gotten a
little too excited about it and it's easy to forget what you did to
get ready for your next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1993 All-Star break, Maddux is 93-28 (.769). His ERA
over the last six years (2.04) is the lowest posted since World War
II and the second-best, Sandy Koufax's 2.19, isn't even close. When
Maddux pitches another 248 innings to reach the 3,000-inning
all-time qualifying status, his career ERA (now 2.74) figures to be
among lowest in history with Grover Cleveland Alexander (2.56) and
Whitey Ford (2.74). Maddux doesn't want to hear the history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not history yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pride's one-day tour
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Pride accompanied the team to New York Sunday night but
flew to Richmond this morning, where he will join the Richmond
Braves for one game against Pawtucket. The club then plans to
activate him in time for Tuesday's game with the Mets and return
rookie Randall Simon to Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Pride has still not lived down injuring himself June 27, when he
split his left index finger pounding a wall with his bat. Ryan
Klesko's appendectomy would have provided him the opportunity for
several starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' said Pride. ``I would have had a lot of
chances to play. The last couple weeks with Ryan out, I would have
had a chance. Being on the DL has driven me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko, meanwhile, saw his first action since June 28 on Sunday
and while he was able to drive a ball deep to center with his first
swing and was robbed of extra bases by Mark Kotsay in the eighth,
the Atlanta left fielder went 0-3 with an RBI. Some swings left him
in obvious pain but while it has been 13 days since he had his
appendix removed, Klesko says his weight is not down from his usual
220.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not after the way I've eaten around this place the last five
days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Life of Brian
</P>
<P>
   Former Brave Brian Edmondson, whom the Marlins claimed off
waivers June 4, made his second appearance against his former club
and allowed an unearned run and a Andres Galarraga single in two
innings of work. That lowered his ERA to 1.31 in 14 appearances
since joining the Marlins. He had a 4.32 ERA with the Braves and
credits his improvement to his slider, which he said the Braves did
not encourage him to throw.

FRANCE DOMINATES BRAZIL, WINS ITS FIRST WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ The French soccer team, which had aroused
an indifferent nation with its exceptional play over the past
month, delivered an even more stunning accomplishment Sunday night,
dominating favored Brazil to win its first World Cup title. In
winning the world's largest sporting event, 3-0, France produced
the tournament's most improbable championship game upset in nearly
five decades.
</P>
<P>
   Zinedine Zidane, France's exquisite playmaker, scored his first
two goals of the competition at its most decisive moment, heading
in a pair of corner kicks and making the home team the champion of
the quadrennial tournament for the first time since Argentina
prevailed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Even after defender Marcel Desailly was ejected for receiving
his second yellow card 22 minutes from the end, France kept
attacking and produced a short-handed goal in the 93rd minute from
midfielder Emmanuel Petit. So much for the belief, held inside and
outside of France, that French athletes seldom have the confidence
or poise to win the big game.
</P>
<P>
   France clearly dominated this tournament, surrendering only two
goals in seven matches with a compact defense that pressured Brazil
Sunday night and smothered its attack in midfield. With more
precise shooting, France could have won 6-0 or 7-0. Even so, the
three-goal margin matched the largest ever in the championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not satisfied just to be in the final,'' said Aime
Jacquet, France's embattled coach. ``We've been working toward this
for two years, and we deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo, the Brazilian forward considered to be the best player
in the world, was reduced to limping immobility Sunday night by an
ankle injury and tendinitis in his knee suffered earlier in the
tournament. The team doctor, Lidio Toledo, also said that Ronaldo
felt faint after lunch Sunday but had begun to feel better after
resting.
</P>
<P>
   The ``O Estado'' newspaper of Sao Paolo, Brazil, relying on an
interview with Ronaldo's close friend and teammate, Roberto Carlos,
reported that the pressure to succeed had apparently led the
21-year-old superstar to suffer a severe case of nerves that
included vomiting and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to a hospital for treatment for his ankle before
the game, according to FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and was
not listed in the original starting lineup. With Ronaldo a
non-factor, Brazil lost a World Cup final for only the second time
in six appearances. That earlier defeat, a 2-1 loss at home to
Paraguay in the 1950 championship game, was the most unexpected
result before Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``France was better,'' said Brazil's 66-year-old coach, Mario
Zagallo. ``We suffered a major traumatic shock. Ronaldo was not fit
to play. That was a major psychological blow. Everyone was upset
and down that Ronaldo would not be able to play well. The team was
a little inhibited thinking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   With 80,000 spectators watching at Stade de France, and an
estimated 1.7 billion watching on worldwide television, France
became only the seventh team ever to win the World Cup, which began
in 1930, joining Argentina, Germany, Uruguay, Italy, England and
four-time champion Brazil in this exclusive sporting fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Frenchman, Jules Rimet, who conceived the idea of a
soccer world championship and Sunday night it was the Jules Rimet
trophy that President Jacques Chirac handed over his head to Didier
Deschamps, the exultant French captain. This was quite a turnaround
from 1994 when France failed to qualify for the World Cup, and from
1958, 1982 and 1986, when it exited prematurely in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   When this tournament began on June 10, France hardly seemed
interested that it was hosting an event that dwarfs the Olympics in
terms of international anticipation. But slowly the French grew
consumed by their soccer team, and Sunday night hundreds of
thousands gathered to celebrate along the Champs-Elysees and the
plaza at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac wore a soccer scarf around his neck, while ordinary fans
dyed their hair red, white and blue. Even some French policeman had
the country's tricolor painted on their arms in anticipation of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   At the game's conclusion, the steely defender Lilian Thuram
grabbed a tricolor, jogged to a corner of the stadium and waved it
joyously, signaling that this was not merely a victory for French
soccer, but also for French ethnic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram was born in Guadeloupe. Zidane is the son of an Algerian
night watchman. Desailly was born in Ghana. Others players are of
Armenian and Polish descent. Sunday night's victory was a rebuke,
in an athletic sense anyway, of the anti-immigration stand by
Jean-Marie Le Pen and the right-wing National Front party that has
gained popularity in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under adversity, France showed that it was a great team that
could play with its heart,'' Jacquet said. ``So many players wanted
to see the French flag fluttering above us tonight.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jacquet, who had been heavily criticized before the World Cup
for his defensive tactics and his inability to find reliable
scorers, has been at war with the French sports newspaper,
L'Equipe. And in his final, victorious game as coach, he showed no
signs of letting bygones be bygones.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never forgive that,'' the vindicated Jacquet said,
accusing some French journalists of ``shameless lying.'' He added:
``I think people see that France has a great team. We have
tremendous rapport with the country. I think everyone saw that
France was able to play with pride and heart and deserved
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   France played without one of its central defenders, Laurent
Blanc, who was ineligible because he received a red card in the
semifinals. But Frank Lebouef played steadily in replacement, and
the French defense was equally impregnable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just an excuse,'' Lebouef said of Ronaldo's sick
stomach. ``Brazil is always dangerous, no matter who is out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   While France attacked from the beginning, Brazil played with a
curious torpor in the first half. Ronaldo conserved his energy for
the occasional sprint, only to suffer further injury with a
high-speed collision with Fabien Barthez, the French goalkeeper.
Ronaldo was unable to jump, and though he was in the vicinity, he
was useless in attempting to stop Zidane as he headed a corner kick
over Leonardo in the 27th minute and as he repeated the maneuver
unmarked in the 46th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the first half, Zagallo said he kept wondering
whether ``I should keep Ronaldo on the pitch or take him off.'' An
argument with a reporter over this issue caused Zagallo to walk out
of his post-game news conference. Ronaldo did have one inviting
scoring chance in the second half, but he fired directly at Barthez
from point-blank range instead of at Deschamps, a midfielder who
had retreated to the goal line but could not use his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo lost both a chance to score and to put himself in the
company of such greats as Pele and Diego Maradona who brought their
teams World Cup titles and themselves acknowledgment as the
greatest players of their generation.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any question about removing Zidane, the
26-year-old French midfielder, even though he had not scored before
Sunday night's championship match. An impetuous foul cost him a red
card and a two-game suspension in the first round. But he is
everything to this French team, its best scorer and playmaker, its
unquestioned leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zidane brought light to the game and illuminated it,'' Jacquet
said. ``He scored with his head. Who could have predicted it? But
it is one of those unpredictable things that makes this a beautiful
game.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It is often ticklish to balance protection of the environment
against its cost. Sweden's Social Democratic government has come up
with a novel answer: a ``green'' policy that is not only hugely
expensive, but may actually damage the environment.
</P>
<P>
   It plans shortly to shut a nuclear power station that is
efficient and safe; another is to be closed in 2001. If the courts
permit the closures, Sweden will be poorer and dirtier _ and may be
more at risk from nuclear accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of closing down Sweden's nuclear industry emerged two
decades ago, when a large majority of Swedes voted in a referendum
to scrap nuclear power. But that (non-binding) vote told the
government to move only gradually; no nuclear power station has yet
been decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   That is not fast enough for the present government. Nuclear
power, it says, is dangerous: fallout from Chernobyl wafted across
the country. Shutting the two stations will help boost renewable
forms of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Admiring greens in other countries are talking of following
Sweden's lead. That would be a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear reactors are hugely expensive, both to construct and to
demolish; that is the strongest possible argument against building
any more. However, once built, they are extremely cheap to run. So
it makes sense to keep them going until the end of their working
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The sums involved are not trivial. William Nordhaus, an
economist from Yale University, has put the cost of phasing out all
of Sweden's 12 reactors by 2010 at $18.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What about the environmental gains? Renewable energy is too dear
and too underdeveloped to replace more than a fraction of the lost
power. Instead, more electricity will have to be generated from
coal or natural gas, which will produce more greenhouse gases,
increasing global warming and also contravening the recent Kyoto
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would shutting the stations do much to reduce Sweden's
radioactive waste. Most of the waste from a nuclear power station
comes from its irradiated reactor, rather than spent fuel: one more
reason why, once a power station exists, it should generate
electricity for as long as it is safe to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Is it safe? Sweden has a good record of nuclear safety; its
government has the power to close dangerous plants without notice.
But the two reactors the government wants to close are not in this
category. Indeed the Swedish parliament has had to pass a special
law allowing it to close private entities that are operating
legally and according to their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Swedes might retort that they are simply unwilling to stomach
any nuclear danger, however minimal. But even on this basis,
closing the two reactors would be wrongheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Several Russian and Baltic nuclear plants sell power to the
Nordic electricity pool via Finland. An unintended consequence of
shutting down the Swedish reactors will be to increase demand for
electricity from these plants _ none of which meet Swedish safety
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania's Ignalina plant, for instance, is one of Europe's
worst _ and it is several hundred miles closer to Sweden than
Chernobyl. Reactors in Ukraine and Russia, only a little further
off, are more dangerous still.
</P>
<P>
   If Swedes want to spend money to improve their nuclear safety,
it would be better to devote it to the poor and dangerous nuclear
industry to their east, rather than wasting it on shutting down
their own. &QL;

   It is often ticklish to balance protection of the environment
against its cost. Sweden's Social Democratic government has come up
with a novel answer: a ``green'' policy that is not only hugely
expensive, but may actually damage the environment.
</P>
<P>
   It plans shortly to shut a nuclear power station that is
efficient and safe; another is to be closed in 2001. If the courts
permit the closures, Sweden will be poorer and dirtier _ and may be
more at risk from nuclear accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of closing down Sweden's nuclear industry emerged two
decades ago, when a large majority of Swedes voted in a referendum
to scrap nuclear power. But that (non-binding) vote told the
government to move only gradually; no nuclear power station has yet
been decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   That is not fast enough for the present government. Nuclear
power, it says, is dangerous: fallout from Chernobyl wafted across
the country. Shutting the two stations will help boost renewable
forms of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Admiring greens in other countries are talking of following
Sweden's lead. That would be a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear reactors are hugely expensive, both to construct and to
demolish; that is the strongest possible argument against building
any more. However, once built, they are extremely cheap to run. So
it makes sense to keep them going until the end of their working
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The sums involved are not trivial. William Nordhaus, an
economist from Yale University, has put the cost of phasing out all
of Sweden's 12 reactors by 2010 at $18.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   What about the environmental gains? Renewable energy is too dear
and too underdeveloped to replace more than a fraction of the lost
power. Instead, more electricity will have to be generated from
coal or natural gas, which will produce more greenhouse gases,
increasing global warming and also contravening the recent Kyoto
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would shutting the stations do much to reduce Sweden's
radioactive waste. Most of the waste from a nuclear power station
comes from its irradiated reactor, rather than spent fuel: one more
reason why, once a power station exists, it should generate
electricity for as long as it is safe to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Is it safe? Sweden has a good record of nuclear safety; its
government has the power to close dangerous plants without notice.
But the two reactors the government wants to close are not in this
category. Indeed the Swedish parliament has had to pass a special
law allowing it to close private entities that are operating
legally and according to their licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Swedes might retort that they are simply unwilling to stomach
any nuclear danger, however minimal. But even on this basis,
closing the two reactors would be wrongheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Several Russian and Baltic nuclear plants sell power to the
Nordic electricity pool via Finland. An unintended consequence of
shutting down the Swedish reactors will be to increase demand for
electricity from these plants _ none of which meet Swedish safety
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania's Ignalina plant, for instance, is one of Europe's
worst _ and it is several hundred miles closer to Sweden than
Chernobyl. Reactors in Ukraine and Russia, only a little further
off, are more dangerous still.
</P>
<P>
   If Swedes want to spend money to improve their nuclear safety,
it would be better to devote it to the poor and dangerous nuclear
industry to their east, rather than wasting it on shutting down
their own. &QL;

PARIS EXPLODES IN JOYOUS CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A million Parisians stormed the Champs Elysees Sunday
night in an early celebration of their July 14 Bastille Day
national holiday unleashed by France's first victory ever in the
World Cup soccer championship, a 3-0 win over Brazil in the Stadium
of France in St. Denis.
</P>
<P>
   Black and white, Muslim and Christian, Arab and Asian, the
people of Paris trooped down the avenue together Sunday night. It
was, the French coach, Aime Jacquet said, a moment of ``national
communion.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the French came together to wave blue-white-and-red
flags, honk horns, and toss cherry bombs and firecrackers onto the
granite cobblestones under a shimmering clair de lune, in the sheer
exuberance of suddenly being on top of the world after a long
period of doubt about whether they had what it took to compete in a
global economy, the Champs Elysees became a Latin quarter, a
celebration of the Gallic spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is here,'' boasted one of the celebrants,
Rachid Kasimi, a French soccer booster from the racially troubled
suburb of Asnieres who said his family emigrated here from Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most beautiful avenue in the world, and we're
going to stay here all night,'' he shouted over the din created by
drivers of cars trapped in the celebratory madness honking staccato
victory rhythms, and people shouting ``We've won, we've won.''
</P>
<P>
   Youths with the tricolor painted on their cheeks jumped into
water fountains on the Avenue Victor Hugo. Similar scenes of
delirium played themselves out in Lille, Lyons, Marseilles and
Bordeaux Sunday night, temporarily uniting in joy a people whose
most commonly shared value until recently seemed to be pessimism
about the future. The spontaneous march down the Champs Elysees
will be mirrored by a parade up the avenue Monday afternoon by the
winning French national team, a day before the usual Bastille Day
military ceremonies along the same axis from the Arc de Triomphe to
the Place de la Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, a conservative who buried the
political hatchet and attended the match Sunday night with
Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, both wearing scarves with
the national colors, also invited the team, affectionately dubbed
``les bleus'' for the blue color of their team uniforms, as guests
of honor at the Bastille Day celebrations at the Elysee Palace on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The team is as racially diverse as France's spontaneous
demonstrators. Two of the goals were scored by the French team's
top playmaker Zinedine Zidane, whose North African origins made two
Algerian women who gave their names as Nadia and Farida proud to be
among the victory celebrants on the Champs Elysees Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Muller, a young black man who had watched the match in a
bar in Montparnasse, said he came to the avenue because the bar had
become too crowded. Soon, so was the Champs Elysees, a mile-long
avenue of eight lanes that is still the place to see and be seen.
It was filled entirely with flag-waving pedestrians half an hour
after the game ended at 11 p.m. And the 164-foot-high Arc de
Triomphe was emblazoned with blue laser signs proclaiming, ``Thank
you, Blues.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>
   ``The game was great, Brazil played really well, and it was a
thrill to see our team win,'' said Carla Dupont, a French
journalism student who, with her friend Sophia, was handing out
free plastic boaters Sunday night for one of the soccer
tournament's corporate sponsors, Snickers.
</P>
<P>
   There were only a few querulous French eyebrows raised at the
fact that the corporate soccer sponsors included such multinational
companies as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Fuji Film. With unemployment
stuck above 12 percent for most of the past three years, and still
at 11.9 percent, France needs jobs wherever it can get them, and
some French officials expressed hope that a soccer victory that had
brought the host team from behind in a truly multinational
tournament would also leave France with enhanced self-confidence.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Two years after the Bay of Pigs invasion ended in
ignominious failure on the beaches of Cuba, two young Cuban exiles
stood next to each other in the spring sun at Fort Benning, Ga.,
training for the next march on Havana.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1963, a time of feverish American plotting against Fidel
Castro's rule. The two men were among the exiles who had survived
the bungled operation to overthrow the Cuban leader and had
enlisted in the U.S. Army, confident that President Kennedy would
soon mount another attack that would banish communism from the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The orders never came, and both men soon quit the Army to begin
their own three-decade war against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Canosa, the younger of the two, emerged as the public
face of the movement, a successful businessman who courted
presidents and politicians, raised money and relentlessly lobbied
the White House and Congress to get tough on Cuba. By the time Mas
died of cancer last November, after two decades of denying any
direct role in the military operations of exiles seeking to
destabilize Cuba, he had become perhaps the single most influential
voice in tightening America's official policy of economic and
political quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   The older man, Luis Posada Carriles, a former sugar chemist,
became a leader of the exiles' clandestine military wing, plotting
to kill Castro and planting bombs at Cuban government
installations. As Mas was building a personal fortune that
eventually exceeded $100 million, Posada remained in the shadows,
consorting with intelligence officers, anti-Castro militants and
even, declassified documents say, reputed mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he nears the end of his career as the most notorious
commando in the anti-Castro underground, Posada has for the first
time detailed his 37-year relationship with exile leaders in the
United States and with the American authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Supplemented by additional interviews and newly declassified
American intelligence reports, Posada's account is the most
detailed to date of the deadly underside of the campaign against
the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of taped interviews at his hideout in the Caribbean,
Posada was by turns proud, bawdy, boastful and evasive about his
work as a self-proclaimed freedom fighter, which included a series
of hotel bombings last year that plunged Cuba into tumult. He
described, sometimes selectively, the role of his sponsors in the
ostensibly nonviolent Cuban-American population, and his
complicated relationship with American officials who originally
trained him but now take a dimmer view of his activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA taught us everything _ everything,'' Posada said.
``They taught us explosives, how to kill, bomb, trained us in acts
of sabotage. When the Cubans were working for the CIA they were
called patriots. `Acciones de sabotaje' was the term they used to
classify this type of operation,'' he added, using the Spanish for
acts of sabotage. ``Now they call it terrorism. The times have
changed. We were betrayed because Americans think like Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why Posada, who has avoided interviews for most
of his career, has chosen to speak publicly. Last month, he agreed
through an intermediary to talk to a reporter, provided that the
location of the interview was described only as ``somewhere in the
Caribbean'' and that his current residences were not disclosed.
Posada, who has survived several assassination attempts, recently
told a close friend that he feared that he would not live long
enough to tell his version of events.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be photographed. At 70, he bears scant
resemblance to the last known photo of him, a 1976 snapshot that
shows a rugged man with a shock of black hair and a steely gaze.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Posada's hair is silvery gray, with dark patches.
His eyebrows, dense and unruly, slant diagonally over watchful
gray-green eyes. Age spots dot his hands and arms. A reputed
Casanova who says his companion of the last five years is more than
25 years his junior, Posada turns up for dinner in a crisply
pressed long-sleeved white linen guayabera, the traditional dress
shirt of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews, Posada often joked about his outlaw
activities. But there was also a wistful, almost melancholic tone
to the conversations with a man who has devoted his entire adult
life to a not-yet-realized goal that seems as elusive as ever.
Communism in Europe has vanished, but the 71-year old Castro is
still a true believer and still in power, with no signs that he is
losing his grip.
</P>
<P>
   No anti-communist opposition in the world has been more fervent
or as well financed as that of Cuban exiles living here. And yet,
as Posada made clear in the interviews, they have little to show
for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, the struggle between the aging leader and the
graying commandos who want to displace him seems geriatric, as out
of place in the late 1990s as the vintage American cars that still
cruise the streets of Havana. But as Posada emphasized, the hatred
of the men on the losing side of Castro's revolution has not been
dimmed by the passing of the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro will never change, never,'' he said, adding later,
``Our job is to provide inspiration and explosives to the Cuban
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a half-hour into the conversation, Posada yanked his
shirt over his head, displaying a torso ribboned with scars, the
legacy of an attempt on his life in Guatemala in 1990. Both his
arms showed holes where slugs had entered and exited; across his
upper left chest was a 10-inch gash where bullets had grazed his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me have your hand,'' he said, maneuvering a reporter's
wrist to the right side of his jaw, shattered by the same bullet
that damaged his tongue and nerves, leaving him with a crushed,
gravelly voice. ``One bullet entered here, and it exited on the
left side. My chin used to be an inch longer, very nice. I was very
handsome once.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Ever since the collapse of communism, Hollywood
has been searching for villains. For a while it looked as if South
Africans might fit the bill (see, if you can stand it, ``Lethal
Weapon 2''). But then apartheid collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief fashion for demonizing the English, as in
``Braveheart,'' in which the English army rapes and pillages its
way across Scotland, and the ``Die Hard'' films, in which English
actors play East German terrorists in pursuit of Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was always Hugh Grant in the wings, to prove that
the English are just a bunch of charming fops after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' tapped a rich seam of villainy with its
megalomaniac media baron. But many studio heads _ particularly at
Fox _ may be content to leave that seam unmined.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, space aliens and giant lizards can be quite
useful. But their appeal seldom extends to people with a mental age
above ten.
</P>
<P>
   At last, however, Hollywood has solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) are in many ways like
communism. They are designed by pointy-headed intellectuals. They
are manned by a Kafkaesque bureaucracy. And they reduce individual
freedom in the name of the greatest good of the greatest number.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, they are even better than communism: they directly
touch the lives of at least half the American population.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bulworth,'' Warren Beatty's latest film, a Californian
senator rants about the evils of HMOs after a nervous breakdown
leaves him with a compulsion to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty is well-known for his interest in politics. But an HMO
also pops up as the villain in Eddie Murphy's new adaptation of
``Dr. Dolittle,'' hardly a place you would normally expect to find
heavy political sermonizing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle has a chance of making millions of dollars and
getting a new car every other year if he agrees to join CalNet, a
giant HMO. All he has to do is reduce his staff and see his
patients less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   On discovering that the doctor can cure animals, the head of the
HMO thinks he has found a winning ``business franchise.'' But the
noble doctor retorts that his ``franchise'' is not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The most gripping demolition of HMOs, though, occurs in ``As
Good as it Gets,'' about the relationship between a waitress and a
highly neurotic writer.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress has to take time off work because her son is
suffering from a terrible respiratory disease. The writer is so
determined that his daily routine should not be disturbed that he
pays for an old-fashioned doctor to examine her son.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor is appalled to learn that the boy has been denied an
essential test because it is not ``covered by her plan.'' ``F------
HMO bastard pieces of s---,'' she exclaims, to spontaneous applause
in cinemas across the land.
</P>
<P>
   When she apologizes for her language, the doctor tells her to
think nothing of it. ``Actually, I think that's their technical
name.'' &QL;

 MIAMI: handsome once.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Posada, who always carries a revolver with him and is described
in CIA files as an excellent marksman, blames Cuban operatives for
his maiming. But as he told the story of his life on the run and
his work for various anti-communist governments in the region, it
became clear that his decades of intrigue had left him with enemies
aplenty throughout the region, from the leftist guerrilla movements
of Venezuela, Nicaragua and El Salvador to the Guatemalan military,
whose officers he was spying on at the behest of the country's
president.
</P>
<P>
   A long period of recuperation followed the attack. But at 64, he
resumed his life's mission, doggedly determined to topple Castro.
``It's a war, a bad war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Early Years
</P>
<P>
   Luis Posada Carriles was born on Feb. 15, 1928, in the
then-elegant coastal city of Cienfuegos, one of four children in a
family that he described as upper-middle-class. His father owned a
bookstore and printing press, but moved the family to the capital
when Luis was 17 and about to enroll at the University of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the university was an intense law student named Fidel
Castro. ``He was three years ahead of me,'' Posada recalled,
describing him as tall and handsome but outfitted ``like a crazy
guy, dressed like a gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his most vivid memory of Castro was his imposing the
same gangster style on student politics, relying on a band of
supporters in which ``everyone had guns'' to intimidate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   After studying medicine for two years and then chemistry, Posada
went to work for Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., first in Havana and
then in Akron, Ohio, after the revolution. His entire family,
including his parents, two brothers and a sister, remained behind,
committed to Castro's revolution.
</P>
<P>
   His 58-year-old sister, Maria Conchita Posada de Perez, joined
the Cuban army after the revolution and reached the rank of
colonel. ``She is married to a colonel in the intelligence
department,'' Posada said, savoring the irony. ``I help her with
money now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most educated Cubans his age, Posada opposed the
dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. ``To be frank, I was never
interested in politics when I was young,'' he said. ``Not until the
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1960 he had moved into open opposition to Castro, which
landed him in a military prison. According to his Cuban criminal
record, a copy of which was published a decade ago in Granma, the
official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, he then sought
political asylum at the Embassy of Argentina, left Cuba in February
1961 and immediately volunteered for the force being trained by the
CIA for the Bay of Pigs invasion two months later.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear precisely what prompted Posada to take up arms
against the revolution so heartily supported by his own family and,
initially, by the great majority of his countrymen. Asked
repeatedly to explain, he said simply: ``All communists are the
same. All are bad, a form of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the interviews, Posada wrote out his credo on a sheet
of yellow note paper. The oppression, suffering and poverty Castro
has propagated, he argued, ``gives the right to all free Cubans to
rebel in arms against the tyrant, using violence and any method
within our reach that contributes to the toppling of the nefarious
system and leads to the freedom of our fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada was sent to Guatemala to take part in a second wave of
landings in the Bay of Pigs invasion, but did not see action
because the initial invading force foundered.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1963, at the CIA's behest, Posada enrolled in officer
candidate school at Fort Benning and received instruction in
demolition, propaganda and intelligence. Fate brought him together
with Mas Canosa. ``Jorge stood next to me every day for seven
months in the line,'' recalled Posada. ``We were very close
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men left the Army after it became clear that the United
States had no intention of invading Cuba again. They settled in
Miami, the epicenter of anti-Castro activity.
</P>
<P>
   Although revolution was his passion, Mas took jobs as a milkman,
stevedore and shoe salesman before becoming involved with a
telephone cable company that became the cornerstone of his
multimillion-dollar fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Jorge when he was poor,'' Posada recalled. ``He was not
perfect, but he was a very smart guy. He had a lot of trouble with
different people, even with his own brother.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Posada added, ``I trusted him.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA Years
</P>
<P>
   While Mas was making his mark in business, Posada was building
close ties to the CIA, which was using Miami as a base of
operations against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dizzying time of conspiracies and plots, some
harebrained, some deadly serious. The agency's station in Miami was
among its largest, and its officers industriously enticed
anti-Castro Cubans to sign on with ``the company.'' Miami's
organized-crime figures, who had taken in bountiful profits under
the Batista government, were eager to bankroll the Cuban
opposition, or use the Cubans for their own ends.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, Posada spoke only obliquely about this period
and provided even fewer details in his 1994 autobiography, ``The
Roads of the Warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, newly declassified documents furnished for The New York
Times by the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research group
in Washington, make clear why: For much of that time, the CIA was
directing Posada's activities, involving itself even in such
minutiae as whether he should buy a boat. (His handlers thought
that it was a bad idea and that his cover would be better without
it.)
</P>
<P>
   The documents are part of voluminous files amassed by the 1978
House Select Committee on Assassinations as part of its
investigation into the killing of President Kennedy. Investigators
examining whether anti-Castro Cubans had any links to the 1963
assassination were permitted to read and summarize a trove of
government cablegrams and documents, all of which remain
classified.

   LOS ANGELES _ Ever since the collapse of communism, Hollywood
has been searching for villains. For a while it looked as if South
Africans might fit the bill (see, if you can stand it, ``Lethal
Weapon 2''). But then apartheid collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief fashion for demonizing the English, as in
``Braveheart,'' in which the English army rapes and pillages its
way across Scotland, and the ``Die Hard'' films, in which English
actors play East German terrorists in pursuit of Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was always Hugh Grant in the wings, to prove that
the English are just a bunch of charming fops after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' tapped a rich seam of villainy with its
megalomaniac media baron. But many studio heads _ particularly at
Fox _ may be content to leave that seam unmined.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, space aliens and giant lizards can be quite
useful. But their appeal seldom extends to people with a mental age
above ten.
</P>
<P>
   At last, however, Hollywood has solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) are in many ways like
communism. They are designed by pointy-headed intellectuals. They
are manned by a Kafkaesque bureaucracy. And they reduce individual
freedom in the name of the greatest good of the greatest number.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, they are even better than communism: they directly
touch the lives of at least half the American population.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bulworth,'' Warren Beatty's latest film, a Californian
senator rants about the evils of HMOs after a nervous breakdown
leaves him with a compulsion to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty is well-known for his interest in politics. But an HMO
also pops up as the villain in Eddie Murphy's new adaptation of
``Dr. Dolittle,'' hardly a place you would normally expect to find
heavy political sermonizing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle has a chance of making millions of dollars and
getting a new car every other year if he agrees to join CalNet, a
giant HMO. All he has to do is reduce his staff and see his
patients less frequently.
</P>
<P>
   On discovering that the doctor can cure animals, the head of the
HMO thinks he has found a winning ``business franchise.'' But the
noble doctor retorts that his ``franchise'' is not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The most gripping demolition of HMOs, though, occurs in ``As
Good as it Gets,'' about the relationship between a waitress and a
highly neurotic writer.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress has to take time off work because her son is
suffering from a terrible respiratory disease. The writer is so
determined that his daily routine should not be disturbed that he
pays for an old-fashioned doctor to examine her son.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor is appalled to learn that the boy has been denied an
essential test because it is not ``covered by her plan.'' ``F------
HMO bastard pieces of s---,'' she exclaims, to spontaneous applause
in cinemas across the land.
</P>
<P>
   When she apologizes for her language, the doctor tells her to
think nothing of it. ``Actually, I think that's their technical
name.'' &QL;

 MIAMI: remain classified. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to those summaries, Posada provided the agency and the
FBI with a steady stream of valuable information about Cuban exile
activity in Miami. It was the CIA that directed Posada to
``establish a training camp for guerrilla ops against Castro.'' At
one point, the documents say, the agency pressed Posada to recruit
his brother Ricardo as a spy.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in the late 1970s by investigators from the House
assassinations panel, Posada said he had been trained as a CIA
operative in the Florida Keys and had quickly become a ``principal
agent.'' He said his anti-Castro group had ``worked with the
company direct'' and had had arms, boats and a network of safe
houses.
</P>
<P>
   His handling of those responsibilities evidently earned Posada
the respect of his CIA superiors and high marks in the agency
evaluations filed on him. One from the summer of 1965 deemed him
``of good character, very reliable, security-conscious,'' while
another a year later said his ``performance in all assigned tasks
has been excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Posada was deepening his relationship with
Mas, who is described in one of the CIA documents as a ``close
friend'' of his. The two were active in the exile group RECE, or
Cuban Representation in Exile, and later in a larger umbrella
alliance called CORU, or Coordinator of United Revolutionary
Organizations, both of which undertook violent actions aimed at
toppling the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   A series of July 1965 cablegrams asserts that the two men were
plotting to attack Soviet and Cuban installations abroad. One
document quotes Posada as saying that ``Jorge Mas Canosa of RECE
had paid assassin $5,000 to cover expenses of a demolition
operation in Mexico'' and that Posada himself was ``planning to
place limpet mines on a Cuban or Soviet vessel in the harbor of
Veracruz, and had 100 lbs. of C-4 explosives and detonators.''
</P>
<P>
   Mas, other documents reported, ``had in his possession 125 lbs.
of Pentol to be placed as charges on the vessels'' and had
``proposed to demolitions expert he travel to Spain, Mexico at
expense of RECE and place bombs in communist installations in those
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   By July 24, according to the cables, Posada had ``completed two
10-lb. bombs for RECE working directly with Mas Canosa.'' At that
point, the cablegrams cryptically report, Posada was ``instructed
to disengage from activities.'' There is no indication that the
operation went forward.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence files contain intriguing references to Posada's
dealings with Frank (Lefty) Rosenthal, described in one report as a
``well-known gangster'' who became the model for the fictional
crime figure at the center of the movie ``Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer of 1965, Posada was ``involved in passing
silencers, C-4 explosives, detonators'' and hand grenades to
Rosenthal, according to a Defense Department intelligence report. A
year later, the report continued, Posada supplied 150 small bombs
and some fuses to Rosenthal ``under threat of bodily harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, dated 1967, drily states that ``station only
recently advised of this transaction.'' A ``memo for the record''
says the timing ``suggests Posada may have been moonlighting for
Rosenthal and only reported transactions to agency when it got
hotter.'' About that time, Rosenthal left Miami for Las Vegas after
being questioned by police in Miami about a series of unsolved
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Posada's ties with the agency had begun to
fray. A report in February 1968 complains of his ``tendency'' to
become involved in ``clandestine sabotage activities.'' A few
months later, in June 1968, Posada was questioned about
``unreported association with gangster elements'' and ``thefts from
CIA, plus other items.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Years
</P>
<P>
   Posada's life took a new turn in 1967, when he abruptly left
Miami and joined Venezuelan intelligence. This marked the beginning
of his years as an operative for a succession of Latin American
governments. He has not lived again in the United States, depending
instead on a web of powerful friends in the region who see to his
welfare and shield him from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   He got his job as chief of operations for Venezuelan
intelligence with the help of CIA recommendations and was
immediately sent to wipe out the leftist guerrilla movements that
Castro was supporting in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   To Posada, who believes in simple, utilitarian politics, the
work was merely an extension of his efforts to bring down Castro,
and by all accounts, he carried out his job in Venezuela with
gusto. ``I persecuted them very, very hard,'' he said of the
guerrillas, some of whom later abandoned armed struggle and now are
important political figures in Venezuela. ``Many, many people got
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada also arranged for an old friend from his CIA days,
Orlando Bosch, to ``come to Venezuela to make sabotage'' against
the Castro government. Bosch had earlier been convicted in the
United States of a bomb attack on a Polish freighter bound for Cuba
and advocated the violent overthrow of Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But a falling out with Venezuela's newly elected president,
Carlos Andres Perez, led to Posada's dismissal and prompted him to
found his own private security agency, ``the largest in
Venezuela,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, Posada's relationship with the American
authorities was suddenly thrown into crisis by an intelligence
report that ``Posada may be involved in smuggling cocaine from
Colombia through Venezuela to Miami, also in counterfeit U.S. money
in Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, a copy of which is summarized in the
House investigators' files, the CIA decided ``not to directly
confront Posada with allegation so as not to compromise ongoing
investigation.'' But subsequent cablegrams call Posada a ``serious
potential liability.'' The agency would most likely ``terminate
association promptly if allegations prove true,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   Posada was questioned, and ``found guilty only of having the
wrong kind of friends,'' the synopsis of another report read.
Interrogators were convinced by his denial of drug trafficking, the
report concluded.

 MIAMI: report concluded. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even so, by February 1976, the agency's officers decided to
break their ties with Posada in what the documents cryptically
described as concerns about ``outstanding tax matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Posada volunteered information to the
agency in hopes of obtaining American visas for himself and his
family. He warned that Bosch and another Cuban exile were plotting
against the nephew of Chile's deposed leftist president. In June,
Posada was calling the CIA again, ``concerning possible exile plans
to blow up Cubana airliner leaving Panama.'' He again asked for
help with his visa. The documents also indicate that he alerted the
CIA to an assassination attempt being planned by fellow Cuban
exiles against then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, on Oct. 6, 1976, a Cubana jetliner with 73
people aboard was blown out of the sky shortly after it took off
from the Caribbean island of Barbados. The dead included teen-agers
from Cuba's national fencing team.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, the CIA made what its records call
``unsuccessful attempts'' to reach Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Jail and an Escape
</P>
<P>
   The bombing dramatically changed Posada's fortunes.
Investigators in Venezuela traced the bomb to the plane's luggage
compartment and identified two Venezuelans who checked bags through
to Havana but got off the plane in Barbados. The men had worked for
Posada, who was arrested and charged with the bombing. Also
arrested was Bosch, who had long collaborated with Posada.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Posada maintains that he did not order the bombing
and blames a Cuban colleague in Venezuelan intelligence for the
action, which he called ``stupid.'' Bosch has defended the attack
in a published interview as ``a legitimate act of war.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired CIA official familiar with the case said in a recent
interview that ``Bosch and Posada were the primary suspects,''
adding, ``There were no other suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada was jailed in Venezuela, and for most of the next nine
years, he remained behind bars, where along with Bosch he learned
to paint.
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews, Posada emphasized that he was never
convicted of the bombing, and blamed corruption and political
influence-peddling in the Venezuelan justice system for his failure
to be freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Mas, in contrast, was flourishing, his business booming and his
political influence growing. At the behest of the Reagan
administration, he founded the Cuban-American National Foundation
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Posada acknowledged that he might still be in jail in Venezuela
had not his friends, led by Mas, come to his rescue. In a sworn
deposition taken in a civil lawsuit, Ricardo Mas, the estranged
brother of Jorge Mas, recounted how he had traveled to Panama to
obtain the cash used to pay for the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Mas was the comptroller of his brother's company, Church
&AMP; Tower, from 1972 to 1985. He said that at his brother Jorge's
instruction he deposited a check in one of the company's Panamanian
accounts and returned with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he needed me to go down and bring back $50,000,
that it would be used to get Luis Posada Carriles out of jail, that
Carriles wanted out, that he might start talking,'' Ricardo Mas
testified. ``The guy, I guess, was breaking down, they had to get
him out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada's version of how money was raised for escape is somewhat
different. He said that a bribe for the warden had come from the
sale of his house in Venezuela and that the money from Mas had paid
for additional expenses.
</P>
<P>
   During a changing of the guard at midnight on Aug. 18, 1985,
Posada, dressed in a black jacket with a collar turned up like a
priest's, crossed the courtyard of the prison. He carried a Bible,
to strengthen the impression that he was a priest, and a satchel
containing a small survival kit of food and a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   A farmer saw him and ran to his side seeking solace, he recalled
with amusement recently. ```Father, I have a son who is ill. Could
you please pray for him?' I said, `O.K., friend, walk with me and
pray,''' and together the two men strolled out of the prison. ``It
was perfect,'' Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 days in Caracas, Venezuela, Posada said, he was taken
to Aruba aboard a shrimp boat. From there, a private plane flew him
to Costa Rica and then on to El Salvador, where Felix Rodriguez, a
Cuban-American comrade from his CIA days, was waiting for him with
a job helping the secret contra resupply operation directed by Lt.
Col. Oliver North, the White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   Posada was working for the American government again, this time
for a covert operation that had ties to the CIA and the local
military attache, but which was run by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Posada acknowledged his debt to Mas. He
wrote that ``a group from Miami, all very prominent, among them
Jorge Mas, Feliciano Foyo, Pepe Hernandez and others'' created a
``pool'' to handle his finances. Foyo, who first met Posada during
their training for the Bay of Pigs, is the longtime treasurer of
the Cuban-American Foundation, while Hernandez is the group's
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually got $2,000 to $3,000 a month from Jorge,'' Posada
elaborated recently. ``Every month someone came from Miami, and
they gave me money. But as soon as I started working with the
contras, I said stop sending me money, because I am working.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada was given a Salvadoran passport in the name of Ramon
Medina Rodriguez. He coordinated the flights of a fleet of rickety
planes that ferried supplies for the contras from the Salvadoran
air base at Ilopango to the battlefront.
</P>
<P>
   The flights ended in Oct. 1986, when Sandinista forces shot down
one of the planes and captured an American named Eugene Hasenfus,
who parachuted safely to the ground. Posada said he had
relentlessly teased Hasenfus about his habit of wearing the
parachute and had been scheduled to fly aboard the downed aircraft
but had narrowly missed the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Captured by the Nicaraguan government, Hasenfus began talking
and immediately admitted that the contra operation was being
directed by a Cuban exile known as Max Gomez whose real name was
Felix Rodriguez. It was not long before the world learned that
Ramon Medina was actually Luis Posada Carriles, the international
fugitive.

<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, however, Posada describes his relationship with
Rodriguez as frosty. According to FBI documents obtained by the
National Security Archive, Posada was interviewed for more than six
hours at the American Embassy in Honduras regarding his role in the
Iran-contra affair and complained to FBI agents that Rodriguez
``talked too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to come to Washington to testify against Oliver
North,'' he said in the recent interview. ``I refused to go,'' he
continued proudly, adding disparagingly that ``Felix went and
testified.'' Of Rodriguez he said: ``You see, he's like a boy, like
a child. Felix was an enemy of Oliver North.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemala Years
</P>
<P>
   At loose ends after the Iran-contra affair, Posada soon signed
on as a security consultant to Vinicio Cerezo, Guatemala's first
democratically elected civilian president in a generation. Cerezo's
biggest challenge was to curb the power of the Guatemalan military,
and Posada's reputation for loyalty and tenacity seemed to make him
the ideal choice to keep an eye on restive officers or guerrillas
who might be planning a coup or an assassination.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Posada continued to pursue his campaign
against the Cuban government, keeping in close touch with his
friends in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Posada said that during the 1980s, Gaspar Jimenez delivered
money and messages to him. Jimenez, who was jailed in the 1976
murder of a Cuban diplomat in Mexico, now works at the medical
clinic run by Dr. Alberto Hernandez, the foundation's current
chairman, according to employees there.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Cuban exile, who has known Jimenez for 40 years,
said the money had been provided by Cuban-Americans in Miami.
Jimenez, he said, gave Posada $15,000 ``for every act of
sabotage.'' Jimenez did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Posada's activities were brought to a halt on Feb. 28, 1990,
though, when three gunmen he describes as Cuban intelligence
operatives approached his car as it was stopped in traffic in
Guatemala City and opened fire at him. He was hit by a dozen
bullets, and he survived, he said, only because he was able to
drive himself to a gasoline station and scratch out a note that
mentioned his relationship with Cerezo and asked for an ambulance
to be called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two years and three surgeries to recover,'' Posada
said. ``My last surgery was a year ago. A doctor friend from
Houston came down and operated on me at an army base in El
Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Posada said his medical bills, some $22,000, were
paid by friends in Miami. Once again, leaders of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, among them Hernandez, who succeeded Mas Canosa
as chairman of the group last November, and Foyo, the
organization's treasurer, led the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Posada acknowledged that many people besides his enemies in Cuba
had had motive to want him eliminated. Guerrilla groups in
Venezuela, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front in El Salvador had all been victims
of his anti-communist zeal, and the Guatemalan army had long been
resentful of an outsider being brought in to advise and protect
Cerezo.
</P>
<P>
   But Posada said he was certain that his attackers were Cuban
operatives, citing information provided to him by an unidentified
friend in Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. ``They were
supposed to kidnap me and take me back to Cuba, interrogate me and
have me confess on television,'' he maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Dreading That Castro May Outlive Him
</P>
<P>
   At an age when most of his contemporaries have retired and are
doting on their grandchildren, Luis Posada Carriles has returned
with renewed vigor and determination in recent years to the
struggle that has consumed him all of his adult life. Time is
running out, he made it clear, both for him and his lifelong
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   With Mas dead, Posada said, he is particularly concerned that
the anti-Castro movement is now rudderless and drifting. One of the
reasons he agreed to come forward now to discuss his activities, he
explained, was in hopes of reinvigorating the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now is a bad time,'' he said. ``Too many years.
Everybody is very old.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada said he last spoke with Mas about a month before he died
of cancer that began in the prostate and spread to the lungs and
bones. ``He was very sick then,'' he said. ``It was very sad. He
was in terrible pain. He knew he was dying. He was a very powerful
man.'' Posada paused, then continued, ``Now is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally disturbing is the attitude of American government
agencies, Posada said. Cuba is not as important an issue to the
Clinton White House as it was to earlier administrations, and many
of the veteran operatives for whom he performed _ and from whom he
collected _ favors have long since passed from the scene, leaving
him to deal with a younger, less sympathetic generation. ``It's
been a long time since I've done anything for them,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new relationship,'' he continued, with concern evident
in his voice. ``The problem is that they think the money which
helped me in the operation came from the states,'' which would be a
violation of American law. When it was suggested to him that was
indeed the case, he replied, ``Yes, it's obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   As Posada sees it, because he does not stage his anti-Castro
activities from within the United States, his activities should be
of no concern to the American authorities. ``What I do is from
Latin America, and my targets are inside Cuba,'' he said. ``I am
not a citizen, so they do not have power over me.''
</P>
<P>
   His proudest recent operation, last year's string of bombings of
hotels in Cuba, was organized in Latin America, he says. A
handwritten set of instructions faxed by Posada to his operatives
in Guatemala, however, notes that some of the money for the
bombings had come from Cuban-Americans in the United States. Posada
confirmed the authenticity of the fax, but claimed not to know the
men named in his document. ``Somebody, a friend of a friend'' gave
him the names, he said with a wink. ``A priest. You see, I'm not in
touch with the operators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But anyway,'' he predicted, ``they're going to put the finger
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada suspects that he may be questioned by the American
authorities about the hotel bombings, and he is bitter about the
way he and the Cuban exile cause have been treated over the years.
After a long courtship, he feels, he and his compatriots were
seduced and then abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   But most distressing of all is the nagging thought that his
nemesis, Fidel Castro, might outlive him, as he has already
outlived Mas. ``Maybe I pass away before Castro,'' he said with a
shrug. ``Nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed that Castro's mother lived well into her 90s and that
another relative recently celebrated her 105th birthday, Posada
groaned. ``Oh my God,'' he said. But then, shaking his head and
wagging his finger, he quoted a popular proverb, derived from the
Cuban tradition of slaughtering a hog for a holiday meal: ``A cada
lechon se le llega su Nochebuena,'' or ``Every pig gets its
Christmas Eve.''

 &HT;    Lack of training leaves jobs open
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ New development and new businesses are not the
only way a region can grow and prosper.
</P>
<P>
   An area can also look for ways to shore up holes or weaknesses
in its economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami Valley, one of the largest roadblocks to increased
prosperity is a critical lack of trained workers. A study by Wright
State University and the University of Dayton found that even in
this time of low unemployment, more than 48,000 jobs are unfilled
in the eight counties surrounding Dayton. About 12,500 of those
jobs pay at least $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is a problem for the tool and die industry,
transportation, health, retail and the skilled trades. Creation of
jobs in the Miami Valley is a weak 1.4 percent compared with more
robust 9 percent and 10 percent rates in Ohio's other metropolitan
areas and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could double the size of this business if we could just get
people,'' said Bob Long of Long Electric. ``I've run employment ads
for months and maybe I'll get one call.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of workers affects the inventory of products that
can be manufactured and sold, drives up the cost of housing
construction and remodeling and cuts off billions of dollars from
the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you could build a house in 120 days, now it can
take three months longer,'' said David Bohardt of the Homebuilders
Association of Dayton and the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage is even more critical in the tool and die industry,
which is one of the region's core industries. One tool and die job
can create two or three other jobs in the area, according to Jim
Whalen of Gem City Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton is the fourth largest center for tool and die work in
North America, behind Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago, but
it could be doing even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we produce more and sell more around the country and the
world if we had more qualified candidates? The answer is yes,''
Whalen said.
</P>
<P>
   The tool and die trade has 1,800 unfilled jobs, representing
more than a 10th of the work force of 17,000. Of those, 5,700 will
retire in the next 10 years, creating an even greater demand,
Whalen said.
</P>
<P>
   Tool work can pay $40,000 to $60,000 with four years training
out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that is just the beginning,'' Whalen said. ``It can lead
to becoming a tool inspector, a designer or even a shop owner.''
</P>
<P>
   But even high-paying jobs do not appear to be attracting people
to relocate in the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because it is an industrywide shortage,'' he said.
``Everyone in the country has the same kind of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The tool industry is trying to address the shortage with the
creation of the Tool Town foundation, which is part of the 2020
Vision plan. The foundation's goal is to build a training and
research facility called Tool Town in northeast Dayton, recruit
5,000 workers in the next five years and 1,500 each year after that
and market the area's tool expertise more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to expand business by $500 million in the region,
a 25 percent increase,'' Whalen said. ``We want to brag to the
world that we are the best.''

 &HT;    Never have so many had so much _ and so little time to enjoy it
 &HT;    (EDS: One part in a series of articles on prosperity by the
Dayton Daily News.)
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey

<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Most of us are better off, but few of us are
frivolously spending our money, vacationing in the Riviera or even
flying off to Vegas for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to money, we're a conservative bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the findings from a Dayton Daily News poll: Despite an
economy that Alan Greenspan says has ``moved beyond history,''
nearly 70 percent of residents polled at random in five area
counties said they did not take any more vacation time last year
than they did the year before, and only 12 percent took vacations
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   What the poll shows is that our '90s lifestyle is choking our
free time and, in many cases, adding more stress to our lives.
Forty-two percent said they have less free time than their parents
did at their age, and 31 percent said that the primary wage earner
in their family works more than 50 hours a week outside the home.
Thirteen percent said they work 60 hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   Libby Sanders, a heavy equipment operator at AK Steel, said she
works 12 hours a day, seven days a week to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't live on Cherry Knob Hill,'' she said. ``It's tough. I
recently had to buy a new car, so now I have payments to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sanders was one of the poll respondents who is optimistic
about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things will change for the best,'' she said. ``I've
always had hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people in this area give the economy high marks while an
even higher percentage are confident about the future.
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Peterka of Dayton isn't one of them. Peterka, who operates
a day-care center for children, said she still sees a lot of people
living ``paycheck to paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems worse to me now,'' she said. ``Most of the
people I see have to work two jobs just to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Egbert and her husband, Craig, of Washington Twp.,
operate an auto-repair business and own a nightclub. They find free
time hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty hours a week is nothing, and it seems like you're not
making any more money,'' Sherry said. ``I thought things were
easier in the '80s for some reason. It seems we have to do more
just to keep our heads above water.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, said the economy has given them extra cash and
a more comfortable lifestyle. They're living better even if they
are driving the same car.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gifford, a news anchor at WHIO-AM (1290), said he is
looking to buy a house, has been able to invest a little bit and
has also been able to ``buy a few new toys.'' Like 59 percent of
the respondents in the Daily News poll, he thinks his generation
has it better than his parents' generation. ``We certainly have a
lot more luxuries now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News poll found people here have a strong personal
attachment to the area. About 31 percent said they have ``strong''
personal ties to the area, while another 55 percent said they have
``very strong'' ties to the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The economy of the '90s has created a highly mobile workforce,
however. Twenty-two percent of those surveyed said they were ``very
likely'' to change jobs in the next five years, and 16 percent said
they were ``somewhat likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the '50s and '60s, few workers now stay put in one job or
even one career. In 1983, men age 55-64 typically spent more than
15 years with their current employer, U.S. Department of Labor
Statistics show. By 1996, the median had dropped to just over 10
years. Only about a third of America's workers have been with their
current employer 10 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband's job as a sales manager has kept the family on the
move around the country, but Reva Cosby of Centerville has used her
time in the Miami Valley to take advantage of the higher education
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   A teacher at Kiser Middle School, Cosby has earned her master's
degree at Wright State University and is working on her doctorate
in education leadership at the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this has been a good place,'' said Cosby, who has two
children. ``I think our family has a bright future. We have good
neighbors and friends I wouldn't trade and our kids have been able
to play more.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Americans still consume at a slightly higher rate
than they save and those figures are reflected locally. Twenty-five
percent said they are not able to save anything, and another 12
percent said they save less than 5 percent. Overall, 63 percent
said they are saving 10 percent or less of their income.
</P>
<P>
   But while they may not be socking money away in saving accounts,
a significant number of residents are playing the stock market in
one way or another. About 30 percent said they had invested in
mutual funds over the past year, 25 percent in stocks and 12
percent in bonds. Overall, about 41 percent said they had market
investments of some type.
</P>
<P>
   The story that emerges is that people are working hard, having
less free time than they would like but generally enjoying the
financial rewards of a strong economy. Prosperity for individuals
and families may have come at a cost to the community, however.
Fifty-three percent of the residents polled said they found no time
for volunteer work of any kind, not church work, not community
work, not political activity. Twenty-eight percent said they manage
up to five hours a week of community service.
</P>
<P>
   Public service is considered by many planners to be a key
element in building strong communities.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Dandaneau, a professor of sociology at the University of
Dayton, observed that much volunteer work in the past was done by
women who stayed at home, and that the increased demand for two-job
couples diminishes the time people can spend in community service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that people don't have the desire,'' he said. ``A lot
of people would love to trade time for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Dandaneau characterized the late 1990s as an odd time in
history, when people are not as involved in social causes like the
Civil Rights or women's movements. ``There is a sense of just
floating,'' he said. ``This is a more open society than it's ever
been. That's a real achievement built on years of struggle.
Sometimes we get complacent.''

GOVERNMENTS HOPE TO CURB POST-COLD-WAR THREAT: SMALL ARMS
</HEADLINE>
 (js) 
By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ In what diplomats say is the first endeavor of
its kind, the United States and 20 other countries will meet here
Monday to try to stop the spread of assault rifles, pistols, hand
grenades, mortars and other so-called light weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The conference reflects a growing realization among governments
that in the post-cold-war world it is not the jets and tanks but
the small arms that are the prime contributors to regional
instability, fueling nationalistic and ethnic wars where the
casualties have been in the tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first governmental conference that will try to map
out the actions to be taken to curb the proliferation of small
arms,'' said Helga Hernes, a senior official in the Norwegian
Foreign Ministry, which has brought the governments together.
``This is the disarmament issue of the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that many nongovernmental organizations, buoyed by
their successful effort to outlaw land mines, have begun a campaign
for controls on light weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath a surface agreement on the seriousness of the
problem lurk serious disagreements on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, anxious not to run afoul of the gun
lobby or the Pentagon, was initially reluctant to attend the
conference and wants to proceed slowly, preferring a sharing of
information here over plans for action, several U.S. officials in
Washington said.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the administration is determined to avoid a repeat of
the land-mines campaign _ ``the Madison Avenue approach,'' as U.S.
officials refer to it, meaning a public-relations blitz with images
of victims.
</P>
<P>
   While most governments supported the land-mine agreement, the
Clinton administration fought the ban and will not sign the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In the light-weapons arena, one of the contentious issues is
whether governments should concentrate on illicit trafficking,
which is what the Clinton administration wants to do, or should
address the legal trade as well. Many governments, as well as many
U.S. officials, consider controlling the legal trade crucial to
keeping weapons out of regions of conflict and the hands of
dictators.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States may not want immediate action, other
countries certainly do, notably Belgium, Canada and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Canada plans on Monday to propose an international treaty that
would restrict legal, as well as illicit, arms sales, Canadian
officials said. It would be the first international instrument
addressing the spread of small arms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Canada is hoping that something more will come out of this
other than just a recognition of the scope of the problem, that at
least it will mark the beginning of an action plan,'' said Eric
Hoskins, a senior adviser to Canada's Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy. Describing measures to control the spread of small arms
as ``an idea whose time has come,'' Hoskins called the Oslo
conference, which is to last two days, ``a watershed.''
</P>
<P>
   Axworthy gave the movement considerable impetus when on the eve
of the signing of the land-mines ban he declared that it was now
time to tackle small arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``All too often it is small arms, rather than the weapons
systems targeted by disarmament efforts, that cause the greatest
bloodshed,'' Axworthy said in a speech to the United Nations
General Assembly last October.
</P>
<P>
   The world's governments have adopted many treaties and
agreements to control the spread of conventional weapons, from
combat helicopters to ships and missiles, and the development of
nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But no treaty or comprehensive monitoring system exists for
small arms or light weapons. These are generally defined as weapons
that can be carried by an individual, or fired by a small crew,
including automatic rifles, submachine guns, rocket-propelled
grenade launchers, small mortars and shoulder-fired antiaircraft
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Light and easy to use, these weapons have killed hundreds of
thousands of people, often women and children, in Bosnia, Somalia,
Rwanda, the Sudan, Algeria, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. They have
also been used to arm child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the small-arms trade is ``illicit,'' meaning
that the supplier violates some law _ for example, preparing false
shipping documents to disguise the true destination _ and risks
going to jail if caught, said Michael Klare, a pioneer in research
on the small-arms trade and a professor at Hampshire College, in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to limit the conference's focus to the illicit trade,
the United States is backed by France, which is expected to attend
the meeting, as well as China and Russia, which are not attending.
Other countries here include Mali, which has proposed a moratorium
on weapons sales into west Africa; South Africa, which is awash in
assault rifles that poured into the country after wars in
neighboring states, and Colombia, which is searching for ways to
stop the flow of rifles and pistols to rebel groups and drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of tackling the legal trade as well argue that unless
governments do so it will be impossible to deal effectively with
the illicit trade because the two are inextricably linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know for a fact from our research that a lot of the weapons
sold legally get into the illegal trade,'' said an U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. official said, ``If this conference focuses only on
the illicit trade, that will do very little _ in fact, it will do
nothing _ to reduce the pool of weaponry that kills most people.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials in Washington and Europe who were willing to talk
about the meeting would do so only on the condition that they not
be identified. They said a State Department official who had spoken
publicly of the need for controls on small arms had been
reprimanded by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Steps to curb the spread of small arms include codes of conduct
that would obligate producing countries, such as the United States,
France, Britain, China and Russia, not to sell to governments with
poor human rights records or to regions where there are conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a need for ``greater transparency,'' said Ms.
Hernes, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry official. She said
governments should report their small-arms sales and purchases, as
they do now for heavy weapons, and this information should be
published.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are underlining with this meeting,'' she said, ``is
that you have to get governments to do something about small
arms.''

   CHICAGO _ The wrecking ball is swinging in Chicago. The city's
housing authority has demolished ten high-rise public-housing
buildings, including one in the notorious Robert Taylor Homes, and
has plans to demolish nearly 20 more.
</P>
<P>
   It is not merely toppling buildings; it is striking at half a
century of flawed housing policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), long considered the
country's worst public-housing agency, has a plan to move people
out of isolated, decrepit high-rise buildings into mixed-income
developments and private housing.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's new task, says its executive director, Joseph
Shuldiner, is not just housing the poor. It is providing people
with homes they can afford but can also bear to live in.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture, racism and even good intentions have conspired to
create a poverty trap in Chicago's housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, public housing was first designed in the 1930s as
transitional housing for the working poor, often with stiff
eligibility requirements that screened out the neediest.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's special problems were born in the 1950s when local
politicians, including the mayor, Richard J. Daley, began to use
public housing to segregate the city's rapidly growing black
population.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city builders had become enamored of Le Corbusier's
vision of urban buildings as ``islands in the sky.'' The result was
hulking high-rises in poor black neighborhoods, the worst of which
is an uninterrupted four-mile stretch of public housing on the
city's south side.
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Taylor Homes are the hallmark of this corridor _ a
clump of more than two dozen 16-story buildings, identical except
for the color of their brick and the way they face.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the biggest concentration of poverty in America.
New York and Puerto Rico have more public-housing units, but they
are mercifully spread among smaller, less isolated projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some 95 percent of CHA residents are on some kind of public
assistance, compared with roughly 25 percent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, CHA buildings are magnets for drugs and crime. For
a brief period in March, the U.S. Postal Service refused to deliver
letters to the Robert Taylor Homes because the postmen feared for
their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto says to deliver mail in rain, sleet, and snow, but
it doesn't say anything about dodging bullets,'' Chicago's
postmaster, Rufus Porter, explained.
</P>
<P>
   What set the wrecking ball swinging after decades of apathy and
despair? First, the CHA's legendary mismanagement and lawlessness
caused patience to snap.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the then-federal housing secretary, Henry Cisneros,
stepped in and took over the agency. Among his reasons, Cisneros
cited the fact that two boys, aged 10 and 11, had recently dropped
a five-year-old out of the 14th-floor window of a CHA building.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros gave the job of rescuing the agency to Shuldiner, who
had run both the New York and the Los Angeles housing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   To help him, Shuldiner had the recently created Hope VI program,
which provides federal money for revitalizing the worst of public
housing; it has made grants to housing authorities in 26 states,
ranging from just over $1 million in Helena, Mont., to $50 million
for the redevelopment of Chicago's Cabrini Green project.
</P>
<P>
   If Hope VI was the carrot, the Republican majority in Congress
in Washington soon provided the stick. Congress passed legislation
in 1996 creating a viability test for all large public-housing
projects more than 10 percent of whose homes are empty.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires public-housing authorities to decide whether
improving such projects is cheaper than simply giving residents
vouchers to find private housing. If not, they are to be ``removed
from the public-housing inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   A stunning 17,859 units in Chicago failed the test. Their
removal has started, in a thunderous crash.
</P>
<P>
   But the CHA balked at finding private housing for the 12,000
families affected, partly because money for the necessary vouchers
was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agency has gone back to Washington with a new plan.
This would still demolish 11,000 public-housing units, but it would
also improve existing housing and build new mixed-income
developments.
</P>
<P>
   The model is Cabrini Green, which sits near some of the city's
most valuable property.
</P>
<P>
   The CHA is building a development of which half will be private
housing, 20 percent ``affordable housing'' (for families with
between 80 percent and 100 percent of the median income) and 30
percent homes for those poor enough to qualify for full
public-housing help. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (525-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will all this make a serious difference? The evidence suggests
that it will.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, a Chicago woman who lived in public housing, Dorothy
Gautreaux, sued the CHA for using racial discrimination in its
selection of sites. As a result, roughly 30,000 CHA residents were
given homes in desegregated neighborhoods either in the city or the
surrounding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   James Rosenbaum, a sociology professor at Northwestern
University, decided to find out whether women and children who
moved to the suburbs fared better than those who stayed in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   They did. It took most of them some time to settle in, of
course. But after that more of the suburban women than of the city
ones got themselves jobs, especially if they had never worked
before.
</P>
<P>
   The effects on the children were even more pronounced. They were
more likely to graduate from high school, more likely to graduate
from college, more likely to be employed and then likely to earn
higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   The CHA plan is not nearly as radical as this. Still, it seems
reasonable to think that getting people out of bad neighborhoods
will improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the housing department in Washington has yet to approve
the Chicago plan. The CHA's scheme does not meet the letter of the
law; it takes too long; it costs too much.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Washington's hesitation may be that Cisneros, who
provided much of the push behind the Chicago plan, has left the
department.
</P>
<P>
   His successor, Andrew Cuomo, is accused of self-promotion.
(``Warm and fuzzy he is not,'' says one former CHA official.) He is
also less committed to the demolition of high-rises; to destroy
existing homes, however decrepit, clashes with his long commitment
to help the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   There are also pockets of resistance among public-housing
residents and their advocates. Some worry that private-housing
vouchers merely move the poor around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have thousands of people that you move without
addressing their condition, they're just going to be poor somewhere
else,'' says Wardell Yotaghan, a co-founder of the Coalition to
Protect Public Housing.
</P>
<P>
   Others rightly point out that demolishing buildings and
relocating residents with private-housing vouchers diminishes the
total housing stock. Cynics also suppose that the CHA has begun to
demolish buildings because the land beneath them has become
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, the Chicago plan has several things going for it.
It has the blessing of Chicago's powerful Mayor Richard M. Daley,
who knows the city has long had cause to feel bad about its public
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the young Daley can remedy one of his father's mistakes.
The mayor has offered more than praise for the CHA; he has put up
money, land and improvements in the infrastructure. The city
contributed 50 acres for the Cabrini Green redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the CHA's ideas bear the imprint of the tenants
themselves. The redevelopment plan for each project was drawn up by
a professional planner working with local residents. The residents
of the Robert Taylor Homes voted to demolish all of their 28
buildings. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this should be good news for public-housing residents. It
may also signal something deeper. With unemployment low and the
economy booming, the country is beginning to tackle some of its
most intractable problems. &QL;

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Glenn McGee quit school in the ninth grade and
spent 11 or 12 years in and out of Ohio prisons in Marion,
Mansfield and Chillicothe before landing in Dayton ``in a homeless
state'' a year and a half ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember making what I would call the fresh Dumpster runs,''
he said. ``That's how I would eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity is not just measured in stock market gains and
savings accounts; sometimes it is creating a future where there was
none.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sitting in the DePaul Center on South St. Clair Street,
with a smile that lights up a room, McGee talks about his hardest
course at Sinclair Community College _ an engineering class on
geometric tolerances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, but I got a B,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a year, McGee will graduate with an two-year degree from
Sinclair's machine industry program.
</P>
<P>
   There are 1,800 jobs unfilled in the region's tool and die
industry, more than 10 percent of the 17,000 people employed
locally in the trade. The jobs pay between $40,000 and $60,000,
according to Jim Whalen of Gem City Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   McGee has his eye on one of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of three years, McGee's own prosperity curve could
take him from homeless to a soft landing in the middle of the
middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen months ago, I never would have believed I'd be doing
what I'm doing today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is getting rich in today's economy, but opportunity
is there. A study by Wright State University and the University of
Dayton calculated that there are 48,000 jobs that are unfilled in
the region, but the key is obtaining the skills to do them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when McGee, 37, looks to the future he says he feels like
a giddy school kid.
</P>
<P>
   He has a 3.18 grade-point average at Sinclair and hopes to bring
it back up to a 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at where he's been and where he is going, it is
a miracle of him and of God,'' said Tom Stricker of the DePaul
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The center was started two years ago to take at-risk young men,
18 to 35, off the street and into decent jobs. Those accepted into
the program live at the center, learn life and study skills and
pursue advanced education. One has graduated from Sinclair and is
working in the industry. There have been 15 men go through the
program and about half have jobs, according to Stricker.
Twenty-three are now enrolled in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking for a whole lot of success from this group,''
Stricker said.
</P>
<P>
   When someone suggested the DePaul program to McGee he thought he
was too old to go back to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the closer I got to here, the more attractive it became to
me,'' he said. ``It gave me an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee said he wasn't dumb when he was growing up, but his
interest in school was diverted by girls, drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a mother and a father, but I was a spoiled child, really
a terrible child,'' he said. ``I got into a lot of trouble in
Cleveland. My mother did the best she could.''
</P>
<P>
   Years of incarceration followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said my problem was recidivism,'' McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   After living on the streets in Dayton, McGee was accepted by the
Salvation Army, where he has worked for almost a year. They
directed him to the DePaul Center program.
</P>
<P>
   During a pre-entry class, a process where counselors and
potential students size each other up, McGee spent the first day in
front of a computer. It was the beginning of what would become a
passion for math.
</P>
<P>
   ``With math, I see God's hand in all of it,'' McGee said. ``When
I see people good with math, I think that's how I want to be. I am
looking to buy my own computer, so I can get real good with the
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee's instructors had warned him about the difficulty of the
geometric tolerance class, which deals with how much certain
machine parts can vary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the B, it opened me up to CAD,'' he said, referring
to computer operated machining techniques.
</P>
<P>
   While math has come into his life, some vocabulary is leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have eliminated words like `can't' and `if,' '' McGee said.
``The only obstacles I had were ones I created in my own mind. My
only regret is that I didn't do this sooner.''

   GRAND BOIS, La. _ The people of Grand Bois say their symptoms
began almost immediately that day in March 1994 when eight tractor
trailers loaded with oil-field sludge rumbled past their tiny
Acadian community and into an adjacent waste-disposal site.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the trucks took the curve, the smell just took over the
community,'' said Clarice Friloux, a 32-year-old mother of two.
``The kids were getting off the school bus with their shirts over
their faces. They stayed sick with diarrhea and dizziness for
several days. Our noses were burning, sore throats. You'd wake up
with swollen, puffy eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   For 10 days the convoys continued, 81 trucks in all, bringing
waste laced with substances like benzene, xylene, hydrogen sulfide
and arsenic from an Exxon petroleum-treatment plant in Alabama. Men
sheathed in white protective suits unloaded the waste into a giant
open earthen pit, just 333 feet from the tin-roofed home of Lyes
Verdin.
</P>
<P>
   Verdin is a charcoal-haired bantam of a man whose Cajun accent
is as impenetrable as the humidity along Bayou LaFourche. He
maintains that his 8-year-old daughter, Angel, has suffered since
that day from chronic headaches, rashes and diarrhea so severe that
he must keep a bucket in his family car. As shipments have
continued, residents across Grand Bois have blamed ailments from
dizziness to chest pains on the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in a courtroom in nearby Thibodaux, Verdin and his
neighbors in this settlement will seek their revenge. Led by a
33-year-old New Orleans lawyer who took the case two years out of
law school, the first 11 of 301 plaintiffs _ virtually the entire
population of Grand Bois _ will present their case against Exxon
and Campbell Wells Corp., the former owners of the disposal site.
</P>
<P>
   The trial pits the grandmamas and fishermen of Grand Bois
against the most powerful industry in the state, an industry that
won a congressional exemption 18 years ago to allow it to dispose
of oil-field waste with virtually no regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The residents are seeking at least $8 million in compensatory
damages and unspecified punitive damages. Separate lawsuits have
been filed in state and federal courts seeking injunctions to shut
down the waste-disposal site.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in Thibodaux, which is expected to last at least a
month, will be watched closely by the oil industry, by federal
regulators and by the state government. Publicity about the
problems in Grand Bois (pronounced Gran BWAH) has become an
irritant for Gov. Mike Foster, who is distrusted by the residents
and who, in turn, is deeply frustrated that the community has
rejected the state's offers of medical and environmental testing.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said that without the benefit of comprehensive testing,
he remains unconvinced that the waste site is the source of the
community's health problems. That is essentially the position taken
by Exxon and Campbell Wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not discovered a problem yet,'' said Foster, a
first-term Republican who is considered friendly to business. ``I
mean, we can't identify a problem.'' Clearly exasperated, he said
he empathized with the community but added: ``I'm tired of it and I
want to get it resolved. It is not good for the state of Louisiana
to have these kinds of allegations floating around out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Here along the murky bayous of southern Louisiana, there has
long been an uneasy coexistence between the oil industry and the
vibrant, insular culture of the Cajuns and Houma Indians. It is a
place where gleaming silver petrochemical plants rise out of vast
stands of sugar cane like Oz out of the poppy fields. The gentle
breezes that sway beards of Spanish moss in the oaks may also carry
odors of sulfur and diesel across the porches of Acadian cottages.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely have the tensions been as exposed as in Grand Bois, a
community of 94 houses, too small for the maps, where residents see
the neighboring waste pits as a threat to a beloved way of life.
Folks here inevitably describe their hamlet as a single extended
family, where people trust one another enough to leave keys in
their car ignitions and where special occasions are celebrated
around kettles of boiling crawfish.
</P>
<P>
   The people fish and crab and work in the shipyards and
hospitals. Even if they wanted to move away from the 18 waste
cells, which are contained by low levees, few could afford to do so
without selling their homes. For the time being, that is
impossible. Residents have lined the main road with homemade signs
warning of toxic chemicals and depicting the Grim Reaper. The
real-estate market is, to say the least, depressed.
</P>
<P>
   The community's emotions swing from anger to sadness and fear.
``I've had my life,'' said Joyceline Dominique, a 58-year-old
grandmother of 12 who has filled five composition books with a
chronicle of her family's ailments. ``If I go, so be it. But with
the children, these are the best years of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is certain to become a battle of experts, thick with
testimony about chemical compounds and medical histories. A central
piece of evidence will be the blood and urine testing conducted by
Dr. Patricia Williams, director of the Occupational Toxicology
Outreach Program at the Louisiana State University Medical Center
in Shreveport.
</P>
<P>
   She found that 74 percent of the 99 women and children tested
had stippled red blood cells, a deformity typically caused by heavy
metal poisoning or chemical exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally you would find zero,'' Dr. Williams said. ``So when
you see such a spectrum with all these different children from
different households, you have to say there's an outside
environmental reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents' case will not be easy to prove, and not only
because of the circumstantial nature of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when memories of the 1979 gas shortage were still
vivid, Congress granted petroleum-exploration and production
companies an exemption from the hazardous-waste disposal
regulations that apply to most other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Those who question the exemption, including Carol Browner, the
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, call it a
sweetheart deal for an industry protected by powerful politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesmen, like Mark Rubin, the senior manager for
exploration and production of the American Petroleum Institute, say
the exemption was granted because only small amounts of the waste
produced by oil drilling are toxic and because stricter rules would
cost the industry more than $1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption left the regulation of oil-field waste disposal to
the states. And in Louisiana, where the petroleum industry employed
79,000 people last year, oil-field waste has been defined as
nonhazardous.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Gladstone Jones III, the confident young lawyer for
the Grand Bois residents, to prove that Exxon and Campbell Wells
were negligent in their handling of the waste, and to convince a
jury that his negligence claim outweighs the protection afforded by
the oil industry's regulatory exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew they had lots of hydrogen sulfide,'' Jones said.
``They knew they had lots of benzene. And nevertheless, because of
this law saying it was nonhazardous, they sent it anyway.'' Both
benzene and hydrogen sulfide are known toxins.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Exxon and Campbell Wells declined to comment. But it
is clear from court documents and pretrial proceedings that they
will argue that there is no scientific proof of a link between the
waste site and the community's health problems.
</P>
<P>
   They are also expected to point out that there were no
complaints from the community about similar wastes at the site in
the decade before the Exxon shipment arrived. And they will
maintain that the residents' ailments may be the result of other
health problems, like diabetes, and that any environmental toxins
could have come from other nearby sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just are no such emissions from our site,'' said Jerry
Brazzel, the division engineer for U.S. Liquids Inc., which bought
the 120-acre site from Campbell Wells in 1996 and is named in a
separate Grand Bois lawsuit. ``Now the people may have some kind of
infirmities, but there is just no scientific basis for the claims
they have made. If we had the kind of problems at our site that the
plaintiffs contend, it seems to me our employees would be getting
some of the same symptoms. And none of them have.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, state Sen. Mike Robichaux, a physician who has
championed the cause of his constituents in Grand Bois, proposed
legislation that would have shut down the oil-field waste pits. The
measure failed.
</P>
<P>
   But it succeeded in gaining attention for the problems in Grand
Bois, and Foster soon ordered state agencies to begin monitoring
air and water quality in the area. In April, he ordered that
oil-field wastes be tested across Louisiana to ultimately set new
standards for acceptable levels of toxic material.
</P>
<P>
   He also invited the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease
Registry, a division of the Federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, to study health concerns in Grand Bois.
</P>
<P>
   But residents remain skeptical, and unwilling to cooperate until
the trial concludes. They argue that Foster has been slow to act
and has generally sided with the oil industry. They also note that
the governor reported on state ethics forms that he earned more
than $200,000 in Exxon oil-lease royalties in 1997. Foster said it
was ``hogwash'' to suggest that his views on Grand Bois were
influenced by his investments.
</P>
<P>
   Without more testing, Foster said, the only demonstrable fact is
that the waste site leaves a bad odor in Grand Bois.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not unusual anywhere in south Louisiana,'' he said.
``We've got chemical plants over here, and when the wind's right,
you're going to smell them. You have a paper mill anywhere around
and you're going to smell it. That's not to say it's desirable, but
it's not a major health emergency _ usually.''

   CHICAGO _ The wrecking ball is swinging in Chicago. The city's
housing authority has demolished ten high-rise public-housing
buildings, including one in the notorious Robert Taylor Homes, and
has plans to demolish nearly 20 more.
</P>
<P>
   It is not merely toppling buildings; it is striking at half a
century of flawed housing policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA), long considered the
country's worst public-housing agency, has a plan to move people
out of isolated, decrepit high-rise buildings into mixed-income
developments and private housing.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's new task, says its executive director, Joseph
Shuldiner, is not just housing the poor. It is providing people
with homes they can afford but can also bear to live in.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture, racism and even good intentions have conspired to
create a poverty trap in Chicago's housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, public housing was first designed in the 1930s as
transitional housing for the working poor, often with stiff
eligibility requirements that screened out the neediest.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's special problems were born in the 1950s when local
politicians, including the mayor, Richard J. Daley, began to use
public housing to segregate the city's rapidly growing black
population.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city builders had become enamored of Le Corbusier's
vision of urban buildings as ``islands in the sky.'' The result was
hulking high-rises in poor black neighborhoods, the worst of which
is an uninterrupted four-mile stretch of public housing on the
city's south side.
</P>
<P>
   The Robert Taylor Homes are the hallmark of this corridor _ a
clump of more than two dozen 16-story buildings, identical except
for the color of their brick and the way they face.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the biggest concentration of poverty in America.
New York and Puerto Rico have more public-housing units, but they
are mercifully spread among smaller, less isolated projects.
</P>
<P>
   Some 95 percent of CHA residents are on some kind of public
assistance, compared with roughly 25 percent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, CHA buildings are magnets for drugs and crime. For
a brief period in March, the U.S. Postal Service refused to deliver
letters to the Robert Taylor Homes because the postmen feared for
their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto says to deliver mail in rain, sleet, and snow, but
it doesn't say anything about dodging bullets,'' Chicago's
postmaster, Rufus Porter, explained.
</P>
<P>
   What set the wrecking ball swinging after decades of apathy and
despair? First, the CHA's legendary mismanagement and lawlessness
caused patience to snap.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the then-federal housing secretary, Henry Cisneros,
stepped in and took over the agency. Among his reasons, Cisneros
cited the fact that two boys, aged 10 and 11, had recently dropped
a five-year-old out of the 14th-floor window of a CHA building.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros gave the job of rescuing the agency to Shuldiner, who
had run both the New York and the Los Angeles housing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   To help him, Shuldiner had the recently created Hope VI program,
which provides federal money for revitalizing the worst of public
housing; it has made grants to housing authorities in 26 states,
ranging from just over $1 million in Helena, Mont., to $50 million
for the redevelopment of Chicago's Cabrini Green project.
</P>
<P>
   If Hope VI was the carrot, the Republican majority in Congress
in Washington soon provided the stick. Congress passed legislation
in 1996 creating a viability test for all large public-housing
projects more than 10 percent of whose homes are empty.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires public-housing authorities to decide whether
improving such projects is cheaper than simply giving residents
vouchers to find private housing. If not, they are to be ``removed
from the public-housing inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   A stunning 17,859 units in Chicago failed the test. Their
removal has started, in a thunderous crash.
</P>
<P>
   But the CHA balked at finding private housing for the 12,000
families affected, partly because money for the necessary vouchers
was not available.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agency has gone back to Washington with a new plan.
This would still demolish 11,000 public-housing units, but it would
also improve existing housing and build new mixed-income
developments.
</P>
<P>
   The model is Cabrini Green, which sits near some of the city's
most valuable property.
</P>
<P>
   The CHA is building a development of which half will be private
housing, 20 percent ``affordable housing'' (for families with
between 80 percent and 100 percent of the median income) and 30
percent homes for those poor enough to qualify for full
public-housing help. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (525-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Will all this make a serious difference? The evidence suggests
that it will.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, a Chicago woman who lived in public housing, Dorothy
Gautreaux, sued the CHA for using racial discrimination in its
selection of sites. As a result, roughly 30,000 CHA residents were
given homes in desegregated neighborhoods either in the city or the
surrounding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   James Rosenbaum, a sociology professor at Northwestern
University, decided to find out whether women and children who
moved to the suburbs fared better than those who stayed in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   They did. It took most of them some time to settle in, of
course. But after that more of the suburban women than of the city
ones got themselves jobs, especially if they had never worked
before.
</P>
<P>
   The effects on the children were even more pronounced. They were
more likely to graduate from high school, more likely to graduate
from college, more likely to be employed and then likely to earn
higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   The CHA plan is not nearly as radical as this. Still, it seems
reasonable to think that getting people out of bad neighborhoods
will improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the housing department in Washington has yet to approve
the Chicago plan. The CHA's scheme does not meet the letter of the
law; it takes too long; it costs too much.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Washington's hesitation may be that Cisneros, who
provided much of the push behind the Chicago plan, has left the
department.
</P>
<P>
   His successor, Andrew Cuomo, is accused of self-promotion.
(``Warm and fuzzy he is not,'' says one former CHA official.) He is
also less committed to the demolition of high-rises; to destroy
existing homes, however decrepit, clashes with his long commitment
to help the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   There are also pockets of resistance among public-housing
residents and their advocates. Some worry that private-housing
vouchers merely move the poor around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have thousands of people that you move without
addressing their condition, they're just going to be poor somewhere
else,'' says Wardell Yotaghan, a co-founder of the Coalition to
Protect Public Housing.
</P>
<P>
   Others rightly point out that demolishing buildings and
relocating residents with private-housing vouchers diminishes the
total housing stock. Cynics also suppose that the CHA has begun to
demolish buildings because the land beneath them has become
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, the Chicago plan has several things going for it.
It has the blessing of Chicago's powerful Mayor Richard M. Daley,
who knows the city has long had cause to feel bad about its public
housing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the young Daley can remedy one of his father's mistakes.
The mayor has offered more than praise for the CHA; he has put up
money, land and improvements in the infrastructure. The city
contributed 50 acres for the Cabrini Green redevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the CHA's ideas bear the imprint of the tenants
themselves. The redevelopment plan for each project was drawn up by
a professional planner working with local residents. The residents
of the Robert Taylor Homes voted to demolish all of their 28
buildings. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this should be good news for public-housing residents. It
may also signal something deeper. With unemployment low and the
economy booming, the country is beginning to tackle some of its
most intractable problems. &QL;

STARS SHINE FOR FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France Brazil had the stars, the glitz and the
glamour, the Ronaldos and the Roberto Carloses and the Denilsons,
all of that.
</P>
<P>
   What it didn't have was a coherent team, and if the stirring
abilities of the Brazilians' individuals seduced the world to
believe otherwise, what occurred Sunday night at the Stade de
France set everyone straight.
</P>
<P>
   France 3, Brazil 0.
</P>
<P>
   The home team's richly deserved triumph in the World Cup final
might have been easier than anyone, even the French, had the right
to expect, but that's only because we all of us were fooling
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   We believed that any team with Ronaldo, with Roberto Carlos,
with Denilson, with Bebeto and Dunga and Rivaldo and Cafu and
Leonardo and (add your favorite name here) couldn't lose, that the
depth of talent employed by Brazil ensured that it would capture
another crown, its second in succession and its fifth since the Cup
first kicked off 68 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But talent only counts for so much, and it wasn't enough to
unlock a French defense that, by the end, was without its two
primary central backs (suspended Laurent Blanc and red-carded
Marcel Desailly); it wasn't enough to outfight the French in
midfield (where Emmanuel Petit, Christian Karembeu and Didier
Deschamps won everything); and it wasn't enough to prevent the
French (primarily Zindedine Zidane) from creating chance after
chance after chance.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more luck, France might have scored seven.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a different story, true, had Ronaldo been
fully fit, but that's just part of the problem. The Brazilians'
only hope, it appears, was for the world's best player to carry
them to the title. His bum left ankle left him in no shape to
compete, and he was never an issue in the match.
</P>
<P>
   France's heroes were many, and not all of them so obvious. Yes,
Zidane made this his Cup, with the two headers and his uncanny
ability to pick apart opposing defenses. Yes, Desailly the best
defender in the tournament, maybe the top player anchored a defense
that dominated the Brazilians, that made them its fifth shutout
victim in just seven Cup games.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the role players, and the way they responded to
adversity throughout the Cup, that made France the best team here.
</P>
<P>
   How about Lilian Thuram, the ace right back, who scored those
two goals against Croatia and, on Sunday, outbattled Roberto Carlos
on the wing?
</P>
<P>
   Or Petit, whose courageous effort all Cup in support of Zidane
and as Dechamps' right-hand man, then in the back when Desailly was
dismissed was rewarded with the final goal?
</P>
<P>
   Or Franck Leboeuf, who stepped in for Blanc and provided a
flawless performance?
</P>
<P>
   Or Bixente Lizarazu, the other
</P>
<P>
   defender, the left back who Zidane aside might have been the
best player on the field Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   Or Deschamps, the captain, or Karembeu, or snakebit Youri
Djorkaeff, or super subs Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, or
Christophe Dugarry, or Patrick Vieira whose appearance finished off
the Brazilians or Fabien Barthez, who made his case as a
world-class goalkeeper?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go through everything didn't we? in this
competition,'' said the much-maligned Aime Jacquet, the coach who
rebuilt Les Bleus
</P>
<P>
   from the world's greatest failure into champions. ``But we
overcame every obstacle. We remained calm and composed, we made the
best of the loss of Zinedine Zidane (to a two-game suspension
earlier in the Cup), of Laurent Blanc ... Marcel Desailly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've beaten adversity, and under pressure France has showed
it's a great team with a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

TOP-LEVEL TALKS STALLED IN GENERAL MOTORS STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Frustrated by deadlocked talks to end a crippling
strike at two auto parts factories here, the chief negotiator for
General Motors announced late on Sunday afternoon that he would
return to his office in Detroit, while the top union negotiator
warned that it would be difficult to settle the strike before
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The company's top negotiator, Gerald Knechtel, vice president
for North American personnel, said that GM, the world's largest
automaker, would pursue a three-week-old legal grievance against
the United Automobile Workers union. The company has accused the
union of using the parts factories to stage an illegal national
strike although GM's national agreement with the UAW has more than
a year to run. The union denies the accusation, and the issue will
go to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Knechtel also said that the company would step up a review of
its investment plans in the United States. The statement was the
latest of several veiled threats by GM to close assembly plants and
end production of some car models if the union does not accept the
company's ideas for improving productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Knechtel said GM was considering unspecified actions,
of which employees would be notified before any public
announcement. The company has said repeatedly in the last three
weeks that it might cut off health insurance coverage for 100,000
laid-off UAW workers and their families, on the ground that their
union membership made them indirect participants in a national
strike. Knechtel declined to say whether GM now planned to take
such action.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM issues,
said that he planned to stay here and expected to be able to
continue bargaining with Knechtel by telephone. Knechtel and
Shoemaker said that talks would continue among junior negotiators
at the two factories here where workers are striking and at parts
factories in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio, where workers have been
threatening to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker said ``It'll be hard to resolve this sooner than
mid-August.''
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker has consistently been more gloomy than Knechtel about
the likelihood of a settlement. He has two strong incentives to be
more gloomy: Predictions of a long strike tend to hurt GM's stock
price, which puts pressure on the company to compromise, while
union members are more likely to scrimp on household expenses and
guard their savings if no settlement is in sight. But even Knechtel
said on Sunday afternoon that he was disappointed by the lack of a
settlement, although he made no forecasts about when a deal might
be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had tried to reach a deal by Sunday night, when GM's
two-week annual summer shutdown ends. The breakdown in top-level
talks means that one of the costliest strikes in American history
will keep almost all of GM's North American assembly plants closed
for days or weeks to come, at a cost to the automaker of $400
million a week in lost after-tax profits. The automaker has laid
off 161,000 workers across North America, including 44,000 Mexican
workers, 11,700 Canadian workers and several thousand workers in
the United States represented by unions other than the UAW.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,200 workers went on strike on June 5 at a metal parts
factory here that makes hoods and fenders for pickup trucks and
sport utility vehicles and makes engine supports for most G.M. cars
and trucks. Nearly 6,000 workers walked out on June 11 at a nearby
parts factory that makes speedometers, spark plugs, engine air
filters and many other automotive components.
</P>
<P>
   Knechtel had said on Friday that GM was insisting that
settlements be reached in Dayton and Indianapolis as part of any
deal here. But on Sunday, Knechtel said that the main impasse
blocking a settlement involved an insistence by the UAW that GM
invest more money in the metal parts factory.
</P>
<P>
   Knechtel accused the union of waging the strike for ``bad
reasons,'' later explaining that ``it's for reasons involving
demands to put investment into a non-competitive business, and we
won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The union has insisted that the factory would be competitive if
the car maker spent more money to update its equipment. But GM
contends that the factory's productivity has been hurt by outdated
work rules, including a rule that allows 600 welders of engine
mountings to stop work after four-and-a-half to six-and-a-half
hours of labor, provided that they have completed enough auto
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Before high-level talks broke down on Sunday, a lower-level
negotiator provided the first details to emerge from the dispute at
the metal parts factory. The negotiator, who insisted on anonymity,
said that many union safety grievances and other minor issues have
been resolved. GM has also reached an informal understanding with
the union that the 600 welders would be required to produce more
parts before they can stop work, making it harder for workers to
finish in less than eight hours, the negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   But four sticking points remain in the talks at the metal parts
factory here, the negotiator said. First, GM wants to retain some
discretion over whether it proceeds with a $180 million investment
here that was announced last year but later placed on hold. Second,
GM has not yet fixed a timetable for the return of parts-making
equipment removed by the company from the factory over Memorial Day
weekend in preparation for a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Third, GM has also resisted union demands to move several
enormous presses here that stamp hoods and fenders out of rolls of
galvanized steel. Moving the presses would improve their speed and
productivity but require a costly redesign of a production line
here, the negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, GM has been reluctant to proceed with previous plans to
install two gigantic new presses here, each more than 100 feet long
and packed with the latest technology. The presses are among six
being made for the company in Japan because there are no steel
smelters left in the United States with the equipment to make the
enormous gears needed for the presses. GM has become leery of
installing the expensive machinery in a strike-prone factory with
relatively low efficiency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All these issues are similar to those at other factories where
GM has been quick to compromise in previous strikes. But GM
executives have become increasingly concerned that the automaker is
not keeping up with productivity gains at Ford Motor Co. or at
Chrysler Corp. which has agreed to a merger later this year with
Daimler AG.
</P>
<P>
   While any settlement here will not set a legal precedent for
changes in contracts at other local units of the UAW, the company
has been trying to show the union that it will no longer give in
easily in labor disputes. The rules that allow welders to stop work
early here were common in the industry right after World War II,
for example, but have disappeared at rival automakers.
</P>
<P>
   David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities, said that
the collapse of talks this weekend was likely to hurt GM's share
price when stock trading resumes on Monday. A lengthy and costly
strike makes GM less likely to increase its dividend or buy back
its shares, he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM dealers have virtually run out of popular sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks, although they still have plenty of
slower-selling cars. Ronald Zarrella, the company's group vice
president for North American sales, service and marketing, warned
on July 1 that if the strike lasted through the end of the month,
GM's market share could decline permanently as many customers would
start buying cars and trucks from rival automakers.

FOR BRAZILIANS, STUNNED SORROW FOLLOWED BY GRUDGING ACCEPTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ On Copacabana beach, the giant stage
had already been erected, with the festivities for Brazil's fifth
world cup victory celebration lined up for Sunday night. Thousands
of fans, many wearing green and yellow for the national flag,
gathered on the sand to watch the game, undeterred by the winter
rain.
</P>
<P>
   But as day gave way to night, Waldir Alonso, one of those who
had come to watch, fought off pessimism as France scored goal after
goal. With the last, scored in the final seconds of the game,
Alonso stared at the screen and felt a vise tighten over his heart.
He fought back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party's over,'' said Alonso, 49.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. A half hour or so later, after France raised
the World Cup trophy in triumph, drummers from a local samba school
took the stage and started pounding, and the beach broke out in
samba, almost automatically. In a nation known for its passion for
soccer and Carnaval, the reminder of the annual pleasurefest
countered the sense of loss with a drumbeat so overpowering the
only possible answer was dance.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the sorrow here was genuine, if brief. Some fans
left the beach with their faces closed to the world, disconsolate
and weeping, as it became clear Brazil would lose. Sportscasters
whose excited calls of ``gooool'' usually resemble a foghorn held
together by a g and an l, Sunday night announced points as if they
were balloons with the air being let out.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation of triumph had been steep and so widespread that
headlines warned of excessive optimism in recent days, and public
opinion polls showed Brazilians feeling better about everything
from unemployment to government. T-shirts around town read,
``Victory Is Ours,'' and the Rio government had put some 2,500
extra police on overtime for the expected party.
</P>
<P>
   With such a buildup, defeat had its crushing side, especially
for those in Paris. The Brazilian coach, Zagallo, walked out of a
televised press conference in anger. Soccer is so tied up into the
national consciousness that one broadcast ended with the announcer
telling viewers that, despite the loss, ``We don't have to be
ashamed to be Brazilian.''
</P>
<P>
   That slip was quickly smoothed over by another announcer, but
echoes of it could be heard on the sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were inferior,'' said Alonso, a set designer for a
television soap opera. ``The French deserved to win. They had a
good defense.'' Emir Sader, a sociology professor at the University
of Sao Paulo and at Rio de Janeiro State University, said Sunday
night's defeat would likely lead to a phase of introspection in
Brazil, and ``to questioning a certain omnipotence that Brazil was
feeling.'' It would probably dim the current president, Fernando
Henrique Cardoso's, bid for re-election, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo Helal, author of ``Problem, Passes and Deadlock: Soccer
and Mass Culture in Brazil,'' (1997, Vozes Publishers, Petropolis,
Brazil) agreed. ``When Brazil loses, it's a pessimism that's
total,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my country, but I know what defeat means,'' said Marcos
de Salles, a 26-year-old painter. ``This was a fair defeat.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though some here blamed overconfidence for Brazil's defeat, the
optimism also brought the fans comfort and hope for the next World
Cup in 2002. There were no widespread reports of violence by
Brazilian fans, here or in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well,'' said Fatima Santos, 52, who stared at the
screen and held her 12-year-old daughter, Roselia's, head on her
shoulder before the music started up. ``We're a country that came
from poverty to reach victory. We're a country of soccer,
illuminated by God, with a destiny. We can't win all the time. We
have to give a chance to other countries, who are also God's
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Venceslau de Souza, a 42-year-old cardiologist, wore the hat and
team colors. Forgetting the defeat, he broke into an irrepressible
samba as the band from Governor's Island, outside Rio, started up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even expect Brazil to reach the quarter finals,''
said Souza. He recalled that when the team initially left for
Paris, they appeared ill-prepared, and had stunned the nation with
their string of victories. ``I'm very proud,'' he said.

 &HT;    Braves let series go to Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami _ The Florida Marlins, in the midst of one of the biggest
dives a defending world champion has ever taken, ran the table this
weekend, defeating Denny Neagle, Greg Maddux and then finally Tom
Glavine, a 5-3 loser on Sunday, which should tell you everything
you want to know about high the team charter flew on the way to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's unbelievable,'' said Andres Galarraga, who should know.
He went the entire weekend without an RBI, just as Walt Weiss and
Michael Tucker went a combined 1-for-25 in their first series after
the All-Star break. Welcome to your second half.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating, but that's baseball,'' said Chipper Jones,
who hit his 23rd homer in the fourth inning, matching his total
from 1997. ''It's not played on paper. It's not played inside TV
sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (12-4), who had been 6-0 this season after Braves'
losses, was knocked around for 11 hits, eight of them coming in the
second and fourth innings, when Florida did all its scoring. Mike
Redmond, before this year a five-season minor-league staple in the
Marlins' system, went 3-for-3 with two RBIs and winning pitcher
Brian Meadows (8-6) even drove in the fifth run with a fake bunt
infield single.
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of weekend. Twenty-eight of Florida 35 hits
were singles. Still, the Marlins won three of four. The Braves
become the first team this year the Marlins have beaten three times
in succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through one of those things from the eighth inning
(Saturday) through today, where everything they hit found a hole,''
said manager Bobby Cox. ``And they bunched them every time, which
is good. That gives you a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, since Neagle joined the Braves on Aug. 28, 1996, no team
has ever beaten Neagle, Maddux and Glavine in any order in
succession. The idea of dropping Maddux and Glavine on consecutive
days was just as remote. Combined, they had one loss in their
previous 21 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it happens,'' said Glavine. ``We're all going to have bad
games every once in a while. That's why we don't have a lot of
losing streaks around here because chances are that all three of us
aren't going to have off-games in succession. When we do, it's a
big deal to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly the Marlins, who have now closed all the way to
within 24 1/2 games of first place.

<P>
   OTTAWA _ Every 20 years or so a Canadian prime minister nearing
the end of his time at the top has a yen to leave his mark,
physically, on the national capital.
</P>
<P>
   John Diefenbaker, Conservative prime minister from 1957-63, did
it. So did the Liberal Pierre Trudeau (1968-79 and 1980-84). Now
Jean Chretien, in office since 1993, sees his chance _ and many of
the capital's citizens are eager not to let him take it.
</P>
<P>
   Diefenbaker's legacy to Ottawa was the improvement of Sussex
Drive, to become the scene of state drives between Parliament and
the prime minister's and governor-general's residences.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau, a French-speaking Quebecker, back in the heyday of
multiculturalism invited Douglas Cardinal, a Meti (a Canadian of
mixed French and Indian descent) to design the Museum of
Civilization in Hull _ Ottawa's twin city, part of the province of
Quebec _ on the north shore of the Ottawa River; and a Jew, Moshe
Safdie, for the National Gallery of Art on the south.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien has set his heart on a scheme to demolish ``heritage''
buildings along 17 blocks of Metcalfe Street, and make a grand
boulevard 90 meters (23 feet) wide leading up to the Parliament
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded the National Capital Commission (NCC) to make this
the centerpiece of its document ``A Capital for Future
Generations,'' a vision of Ottawa for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the document was published on June 11, debate about his
proposed grande allee has swamped consideration of other worthwhile
parts of the NCC plan for the rapidly changing city.
</P>
<P>
   The NCC has been under pressure. In its 40 years of life, it has
turned the Rideau Canal into the world's longest skating rink,
planned urban bicycle paths and ski trails in Gatineau Park, and
cleared LeBreton Flats, once a timber town and the camping place of
lumberjacks and fur-trading voyageurs.
</P>
<P>
   It has helped plan and build federal offices in Hull, which was
a thriving lumber town half a century before Queen Victoria
designated Ottawa as the national capital in 1857.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the commission could have done more. Expropriation brought
into its hands about one-third of the urban space in the
national-capital region (a rough square around Ottawa-Hull).
</P>
<P>
   It has had near C$100 million ($70 million) a year to spend. But
it has failed to implement schemes that it talked of to take full
advantage of the superb sweep of the Ottawa River by the Chaudiere
Falls, and of its Gatineau and Rideau tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the NCC's budget from the Treasury Board has been cut,
its staff reduced, the management of its many properties
privatized.
</P>
<P>
   As two regional councils _ those of Ottawa-Carleton, south of
the river, and the Outaouais, north of it _ have extended their
sway over public transport, utilities and policing, and as
municipalities on the southern side prepare for amalgamation into a
single, larger Ottawa, the reason for the NCC's very existence is
being questioned and its secretiveness criticized.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, its chairman, Marcel Beaudry, planned its new
visionary document, pulling unfinished schemes together.
</P>
<P>
   Enter, last November, Chretien, eager to leave his stamp on the
city. But what stamp, when so much is changing already?
Confederation Boulevard, embracing Sussex Drive and the roads past
a cleaned-up Parliament and back through Hull, is virtually
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are building a massive new embassy on the west
side of Sussex Drive, sideways-on to the Parliament building, to
replace the old embassy across the square from it.
</P>
<P>
   That offers space on the south side of this square. Not grand
enough for Chretien, it seems. Then NCC staff showed him a sketch
of the Metcalfe boulevard, and he went for it.
</P>
<P>
   The boulevard idea, mimicking Haussmann's work in Paris and
Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, dates back to 1916, when
Parliament's buildings burned down and it had to meet in the museum
at the far end of Metcalfe Street.
</P>
<P>
   The idea resurfaced in the late 1940s, when the then-prime
minister, W.L. Mackenzie King, recruited a French planner, Jacques
Greber, who had redesigned parts of Bordeaux and Marseilles, as an
adviser. The costs have soared since then, of course; today's
estimate, expropriations included, is C$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Greber's 1950 master plan for Ottawa included parkways, a
greenbelt and relocation of the then-city center railway station,
but no grand boulevard. The old rail track became a main approach
to the center along the Rideau Canal.
</P>
<P>
   And that is right, says John Leaning, a ``heritage'' architect:
this angular approach _ the canal bends through 60 degrees in its
final stretch _ is what defines Ottawa as a romantic and informal
city in a pastoral landscape, not a classical one like Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One regional councillor, Clive Doucet, argues that Ottawa is now
linked east and west by a series of ``agoras,'' market
meeting-places; the boulevard would be a windswept absurdity in
Canada's sub-Arctic climate, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative-led city council is hostile. Forget the
boulevard, says another Ottawa architect, Barry Padolsky, and start
looking at more useful ideas from the NCC, such as developing the
Chaudiere Falls area _ where a paper mill still operates _ for
tourists and a mixed-use waterfront, including housing and a center
celebrating 19th-century logging technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCC is not a democratic body. It is
government-appointed, and depends for its clout on the prime
minister's backing and the Treasury Board's purse. So far, no
influential Liberal voices have spoken out against Chretien's grand
boulevard. &QL;

WITH TWO GOALS AND A WORLD CUP, ZIDANE LIVES UP TO HIS REPUTATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ His second header of the evening had just
touched the back of the Brazilian net, and Zinedine Zidane grabbed
the front of his French jersey and kissed his own number.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane's number, 10, is the most evocative in soccer. It implies
creativity; it implies leadership, and on the most important
evening in the history of French sport, Zidane lived up to his
number and his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   When these World Cup finals began, the 26-year-old Zidane was a
player with hundreds of moves, millions of admirers and no major
title. When this World Cup ended with a 3-0 victory over Brazil,
the gap between his ability and his resume had been bridged.
Zidane, without a goal in this tournament until Sunday night,
became the first person in 20 years to score twice in a final and
was a consistently convincing force in midfield throughout the
match.
</P>
<P>
   Watching it all from a place of honor was France's most
accomplished No. 10: Michel Platini, now the president of the
French World Cup organizing committee. Since bursting to prominence
with Bordeaux in the 1995-96 season, Zidane has often drawn
comparisons with Platini. Like his precursor, he crossed the French
border to become the playmaker for Juventus of Turin. Like his
predecessor, he can make a ball do his bidding.
</P>
<P>
   What the soft-spoken Zidane lacks is Platini's confidence off
the field, but for all his brilliance and leadership, Platini never
helped France win its first World Cup. That honor belongs to Zidane
and his now merry band of heterogenuous teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, they cover a remarkably wide cross-section of
contemporary French society. They hail from the French Antilles in
the Caribbean; from New Caledonia in the South Pacific; from French
Guiana in South America; and from Ghana in Africa. Zidane was born
in Marseille, but his parents are Kabyles from southern Algeria who
moved to France in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   That makes him a symbol in a nation with a large North African
population. But unlike many of French youths with ethnic origins in
Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, Zidane has said that he never
suffered from racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always made the necessary efforts to adapt to the
environment in which I found myself,'' he once said. ``I've never
made an attempt to make a big deal about the fact that I was
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Zidane prefers discretion, it has been impossible to
ignore him in recent months. He was the best player on the home
team, and France's largest television station affixed a mammoth
picture of him, ball on his foot, to the glittering tower that
serves as its headquarters along the right bank of the Seine river.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane grew up in the midst of very different sorts of towers in
a rough- and-tumble northern quarter of Marseille. His community
was called ``La Castellane'' and its concrete towers did not
glitter. Americans would call this ``public housing'' or more
familiarly, ``the projects.'' In France, this is known as ``la
cite'' and Zidane lived there with his parents and four siblings
until he was 13. His older brother Farid still lives there with his
wife and children, and Zidane remains the honorary president of La
Castellane's soccer club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough as a foreigner to succeed in France,'' Farid Zidane
said earlier during this World Cup. ``My brother had to do a lot,
and it did not come quickly. I think if there's a person who was of
European origin who had the same level as he did, I think he would
have had more chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Zidane left la Castellane and his family because scouts for the
French team AS Cannes believed they had spotted an exceptional
talent while watching him play left wing in the first half of a
youth match and sweeper in the second. ``I was amazed by his
ability to handle the ball,'' said Jean Varraud, one of Cannes'
scouts. ``I saw that he had feet of gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, few in Europe would argue with that
assessment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since leaving Bordeaux to become the playmaker for Juventus of
Turin in the summer of 1996, the unlikely looking midfielder with
the lumbering gait has matured into one of the sport's premier
performers: helping Juventus win the Italian league title the last
two seasons and reach the last two Champion's League finals.
</P>
<P>
   Juventus lost both those finals, just as Bordeaux had lost in
the UEFA Cup final in 1996. That was the same year that Zidane
performed poorly for France in the European Championships _ in part
because of the lingering effects of a car accident _ and the French
lost in the semifinals to the Czech Republic. But after a long
season with Juventus, Zidane arrived in France for this World Cup
with a new son (one-month-old Luca) and the highest expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do something big,'' he said. ``Winning the World Cup
is not some sort of impossible dream: not for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless until tonight, Zidane's World Cup was only a
qualified success. He received a red card against Saudi Arabia for
stepping on an opponent, which caused him to miss France's next two
games. If not for a golden goal from teammate Laurent Blanc in the
114th minute against Paraguay in the second round, Zidane might not
have had a chance to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   In the semifinal against Croatia, he was so spent that in the
later stages of the match he dropped to his knees and vomited. ``I
don't have the impression that I've failed in anyway in this World
Cup,'' he said afterward. ``It's true that I haven't scored, but I
have one match left to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He would do it twice, once in the 27th minute and once in the
first minute of injury time in the first half. He was the first
person to score in the Stade de France when it was inaugurated in
January against Spain. Now, he and this massive stadium are even
more closely linked. He and his fellow citizens also have bonded,
and as the French fans streamed into the warm summer air to begin
their collective pilgrimage to the avenue des Champs-Elysees, many
of them were still chanting Zidane's nickname: ``Zi-zou, Zi-zou,
Zi-zou.''

   OTTAWA _ Every 20 years or so a Canadian prime minister nearing
the end of his time at the top has a yen to leave his mark,
physically, on the national capital.
</P>
<P>
   John Diefenbaker, Conservative prime minister from 1957-63, did
it. So did the Liberal Pierre Trudeau (1968-79 and 1980-84). Now
Jean Chretien, in office since 1993, sees his chance _ and many of
the capital's citizens are eager not to let him take it.
</P>
<P>
   Diefenbaker's legacy to Ottawa was the improvement of Sussex
Drive, to become the scene of state drives between Parliament and
the prime minister's and governor-general's residences.
</P>
<P>
   Trudeau, a French-speaking Quebecker, back in the heyday of
multiculturalism invited Douglas Cardinal, a Meti (a Canadian of
mixed French and Indian descent) to design the Museum of
Civilization in Hull _ Ottawa's twin city, part of the province of
Quebec _ on the north shore of the Ottawa River; and a Jew, Moshe
Safdie, for the National Gallery of Art on the south.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien has set his heart on a scheme to demolish ``heritage''
buildings along 17 blocks of Metcalfe Street, and make a grand
boulevard 90 meters (23 feet) wide leading up to the Parliament
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He persuaded the National Capital Commission (NCC) to make this
the centerpiece of its document ``A Capital for Future
Generations,'' a vision of Ottawa for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since the document was published on June 11, debate about his
proposed grande allee has swamped consideration of other worthwhile
parts of the NCC plan for the rapidly changing city.
</P>
<P>
   The NCC has been under pressure. In its 40 years of life, it has
turned the Rideau Canal into the world's longest skating rink,
planned urban bicycle paths and ski trails in Gatineau Park, and
cleared LeBreton Flats, once a timber town and the camping place of
lumberjacks and fur-trading voyageurs.
</P>
<P>
   It has helped plan and build federal offices in Hull, which was
a thriving lumber town half a century before Queen Victoria
designated Ottawa as the national capital in 1857.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the commission could have done more. Expropriation brought
into its hands about one-third of the urban space in the
national-capital region (a rough square around Ottawa-Hull).
</P>
<P>
   It has had near C$100 million ($70 million) a year to spend. But
it has failed to implement schemes that it talked of to take full
advantage of the superb sweep of the Ottawa River by the Chaudiere
Falls, and of its Gatineau and Rideau tributaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the NCC's budget from the Treasury Board has been cut,
its staff reduced, the management of its many properties
privatized.
</P>
<P>
   As two regional councils _ those of Ottawa-Carleton, south of
the river, and the Outaouais, north of it _ have extended their
sway over public transport, utilities and policing, and as
municipalities on the southern side prepare for amalgamation into a
single, larger Ottawa, the reason for the NCC's very existence is
being questioned and its secretiveness criticized.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, its chairman, Marcel Beaudry, planned its new
visionary document, pulling unfinished schemes together.
</P>
<P>
   Enter, last November, Chretien, eager to leave his stamp on the
city. But what stamp, when so much is changing already?
Confederation Boulevard, embracing Sussex Drive and the roads past
a cleaned-up Parliament and back through Hull, is virtually
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are building a massive new embassy on the west
side of Sussex Drive, sideways-on to the Parliament building, to
replace the old embassy across the square from it.
</P>
<P>
   That offers space on the south side of this square. Not grand
enough for Chretien, it seems. Then NCC staff showed him a sketch
of the Metcalfe boulevard, and he went for it.
</P>
<P>
   The boulevard idea, mimicking Haussmann's work in Paris and
Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, dates back to 1916, when
Parliament's buildings burned down and it had to meet in the museum
at the far end of Metcalfe Street.
</P>
<P>
   The idea resurfaced in the late 1940s, when the then-prime
minister, W.L. Mackenzie King, recruited a French planner, Jacques
Greber, who had redesigned parts of Bordeaux and Marseilles, as an
adviser. The costs have soared since then, of course; today's
estimate, expropriations included, is C$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Greber's 1950 master plan for Ottawa included parkways, a
greenbelt and relocation of the then-city center railway station,
but no grand boulevard. The old rail track became a main approach
to the center along the Rideau Canal.
</P>
<P>
   And that is right, says John Leaning, a ``heritage'' architect:
this angular approach _ the canal bends through 60 degrees in its
final stretch _ is what defines Ottawa as a romantic and informal
city in a pastoral landscape, not a classical one like Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One regional councillor, Clive Doucet, argues that Ottawa is now
linked east and west by a series of ``agoras,'' market
meeting-places; the boulevard would be a windswept absurdity in
Canada's sub-Arctic climate, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative-led city council is hostile. Forget the
boulevard, says another Ottawa architect, Barry Padolsky, and start
looking at more useful ideas from the NCC, such as developing the
Chaudiere Falls area _ where a paper mill still operates _ for
tourists and a mixed-use waterfront, including housing and a center
celebrating 19th-century logging technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCC is not a democratic body. It is
government-appointed, and depends for its clout on the prime
minister's backing and the Treasury Board's purse. So far, no
influential Liberal voices have spoken out against Chretien's grand
boulevard. &QL;

STARS SHINE FOR FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France Brazil had the stars, the glitz and the
glamour, the Ronaldos and the Roberto Carloses and the Denilsons,
all of that.
</P>
<P>
   What it didn't have was a coherent team, and if the stirring
abilities of the Brazilians' individuals seduced the world to
believe otherwise, what occurred Sunday night at the Stade de
France set everyone straight.
</P>
<P>
   France 3, Brazil 0.
</P>
<P>
   The home team's richly deserved triumph in the World Cup final
might have been easier than anyone, even the French, had the right
to expect, but that's only because we all of us were fooling
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   We believed that any team with Ronaldo, with Roberto Carlos,
with Denilson, with Bebeto and Dunga and Rivaldo and Cafu and
Leonardo and (add your favorite name here) couldn't lose, that the
depth of talent employed by Brazil ensured that it would capture
another crown, its second in succession and its fifth since the Cup
first kicked off 68 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But talent only counts for so much, and it wasn't enough to
unlock a French defense that, by the end, was without its two
primary central backs (suspended Laurent Blanc and red-carded
Marcel Desailly); it wasn't enough to outfight the French in
midfield (where Emmanuel Petit, Christian Karembeu and Didier
Deschamps won everything); and it wasn't enough to prevent the
French (primarily Zindedine Zidane) from creating chance after
chance after chance.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more luck, France might have scored seven.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been a different story, true, had Ronaldo been
fully fit, but that's just part of the problem. The Brazilians'
only hope, it appears, was for the world's best player to carry
them to the title. His bum left ankle left him in no shape to
compete, and he was never an issue in the match.
</P>
<P>
   France's heroes were many, and not all of them so obvious. Yes,
Zidane made this his Cup, with the two headers and his uncanny
ability to pick apart opposing defenses. Yes, Desailly the best
defender in the tournament, maybe the top player anchored a defense
that dominated the Brazilians, that made them its fifth shutout
victim in just seven Cup games.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the role players, and the way they responded to
adversity throughout the Cup, that made France the best team here.
</P>
<P>
   How about Lilian Thuram, the ace right back, who scored those
two goals against Croatia and, on Sunday, outbattled Roberto Carlos
on the wing?
</P>
<P>
   Or Petit, whose courageous effort all Cup in support of Zidane
and as Dechamps' right-hand man, then in the back when Desailly was
dismissed was rewarded with the final goal?
</P>
<P>
   Or Franck Leboeuf, who stepped in for Blanc and provided a
flawless performance?
</P>
<P>
   Or Bixente Lizarazu, the other
</P>
<P>
   defender, the left back who Zidane aside might have been the
best player on the field Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   Or Deschamps, the captain, or Karembeu, or snakebit Youri
Djorkaeff, or super subs Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, or
Christophe Dugarry, or Patrick Vieira whose appearance finished off
the Brazilians or Fabien Barthez, who made his case as a
world-class goalkeeper?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go through everything didn't we? in this
competition,'' said the much-maligned Aime Jacquet, the coach who
rebuilt Les Bleus
</P>
<P>
   from the world's greatest failure into champions. ``But we
overcame every obstacle. We remained calm and composed, we made the
best of the loss of Zinedine Zidane (to a two-game suspension
earlier in the Cup), of Laurent Blanc ... Marcel Desailly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've beaten adversity, and under pressure France has showed
it's a great team with a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

VOTERS REBUKE JAPAN'S GOVERNING PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Graf 8 is new; no other changes.)  (lh) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Voters in parliamentary elections on Sunday gave Japan's
governing party a brutal drubbing, setting the stage for the
resignation of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and creating new
uncertainties about the country's political and economic course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are attributable to my lack of ability,'' a grim
Hashimoto told Japanese television early Monday morning. ``We could
not live up to the people's expectations, and it is all my
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He strongly hinted that he would resign after meeting later
Monday with officials of his Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But while the voters were apparently punishing the confusion and
lack of decisiveness in the government as it faces Japan's worst
economic crisis in more than half a century, the election result
may create more disarray than ever in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows who will lead the country _ whose economy is second
only to that of the United States in size _ as it tries to
extricate itself from recession, or what will happen to Japan's
recently announced plans to deal with its mountain of bad loans
held by banks.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be harder than ever for the Liberal Democrats to
govern Japan and push economic legislation through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   None of the main contenders for the prime minister's job is the
kind of new and dynamic leader that many Japanese say they want,
and that the United States and other countries fervently desire.
There is some risk that the job will go from a man who exhibited
little leadership to a rival who has shown absolutely none.
</P>
<P>
   In an early verdict on the result, currency traders sent the yen
plunging in trading against the dollar Monday morning. Japanese
stocks also tumbled, adding to the nation's economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The markets would have tumbled more if it were not for the
possibility that the election shock may force the Liberal Democrats
_ who have changed policy in the past in reaction to electoral
defeat _ to become more aggressive in tackling the nation's
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   There may now be more possibility of tax cuts and of another
economic stimulus package, although it is not clear that there will
be any push for the kind of market-oriented reorganization that
many economists urge.

<P>
   The elections on Sunday were for the upper house of parliament,
not the more important lower house, so they do not directly affect
Hashimoto's post as prime minister or his party's lock on power.
But he billed the election as a referendum on his leadership, and
the party won only 44 of the 126 seats up for election this year.
</P>
<P>
   That was still far more than the 27 seats won by the leading
opposition group, the Democratic Party, but far less than the 61
seats that the Liberal Democrats held going into the election.
</P>
<P>
   Other seats were won by the Communists, who did exceptionally
well as a winner of protest votes, and by independents and other
groups in Japan's deeply fragmented opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval comes at an odd time in the Japanese political
world, when the country is neither the one-party state it used to
be nor a Western-style system where parties go in and out of power.
The Liberal Democrats traditionally ran the country with only token
opposition, but they were evicted from power in 1993 after a poor
election performance and a series of defections by members of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, many thought that old-style Japanese politics were
gone forever, but a year later, the Liberal Democrats clawed their
way back to power as part of a coalition. Then Hashimoto took over
as prime minister in January 1996 and led the Liberal Democrats in
a long slog in which they managed to regain majority control of the
lower house of parliament, so that five years later the situation
is much as it was before _ but with much less sense of expectation
that the political system can be a vehicle for far-reaching change
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Sunday's vote was an unambiguous rebuke of the Liberal
Democrats, it is less clear whether it was a vote in favor of
anything. By most accounts, the voters were simply annoyed by the
Liberal Democrats' lack of strong leadership at a time of national
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest reason is the lack of economic recovery,'' Taku
Yamasaki, a Liberal Democratic leader, told NHK Television.
Yamasaki said that the top party officials, including Hashimoto and
himself, should resign, but he added that he worries about the
impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if something happens like the collapse of a financial
institution while our financial restructuring scheme is still
unfinished?'' Yamasaki mused. ``I'm very worried about the power
vacuum created by this election result.''

</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto had planned to go to Washington for a state visit
later this month, but that will almost certainly be called off or
postponed until a new leader is in place. The Liberal Democrats
will be under strong pressure to act within a week to choose a
replacement, and probably to summon parliament into session so a
new person can formally take the prime minister's post.
</P>
<P>
   The main contenders are Keizo Obuchi, the foreign minister and
leader of the largest faction in the Liberal Democratic Party;
Seiroku Kajiyama, a veteran politician who was the chief Cabinet
spokesman for a time under Hashimoto; Kiichi Miyazawa, a former
prime minister; and Yohei Kono, who had been the Liberal Democratic
leader until he resigned to make way for Hashimoto. Whoever takes
over, fundamental changes are not expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LDP has a firm lock on power in the lower house, and
that's not going to change,'' said John Neuffer, an analyst of
Japanese politics at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo,
speaking of the Liberal Democratic Party. ``Hashimoto was being
pulled around by his nose by party elders, and whoever is in there
is going to continue party-established policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuffer said that while financial markets will be jittery, the
humiliation may encourage the Liberal Democrats to become more
aggressive in tackling bad debt problems, cutting taxes and
approving a new economic stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, I think this is good for the nation and the
world, but in the short term I think everybody's going to be
nervous,'' Neuffer said.
</P>
<P>
   One important winner was the Democratic Party, which
consolidated its role as the leading opposition force. While the
party is a poorly organized and newly formed coalition of various
factions, it shows hints that it may eventually emerge as a
Western-style opposition force, distinguishing itself from the
governing party on issues and seen by voters as a credible
alternative force.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is led by Naoto Kan, who opinion polls
suggest is by far Japan's most popular politician. Kan, who made
his name as a Cabinet minister crusading against the bureaucracy,
will now push to build his party's organization so it can wrest
power from the Liberal Democrats in general elections that must be
held by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it very seriously that the new-born Democratic Party
has been given a chance by the people,'' a jubilant Kan told
reporters at his party headquarters. ``People said no to what the
Liberal Democratic Party has done. They realized that the Liberal
Democratic Party cannot reform, is totally bound by special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People rejected the bureaucracy-led government,'' Kan added,
calling for early elections for the lower house as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ichiro Ozawa, who once was the main opposition leader but now
heads only a small opposition party, said, ``I think lower house
elections are inevitable.'' The Liberal Democrats may see things
differently, however, since they would almost certainly lose ground
in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   With the election, Hashimoto becomes the latest in a series of
politicians who entered the prime minister's residence strong and
self-confident but left ignominiously with their reputations in
tatters. When Hashimoto took office, he was welcomed
enthusiastically as a dynamic leader who was an expert on policy
issues. He was thought to offer a sharp contrast to his
predecessor, Tomiichi Murayama, a grandfatherly socialist who was
widely viewed as extremely nice and extremely lackadaisical.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto initially did indeed exhibit leadership and
decisiveness, but in retrospect he chose to exercise it in the
wrong way: He pushed through an increase in the national sales tax
from 3 percent to 5 percent. It was a bold and politically
courageous attempt to put Japan's finances on a better footing, but
it turned out to be economically catastrophic, tipping the nation
into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Hashimoto proved much less firm in tackling the
recession. He eventually pushed through a large stimulus package,
but it took so long to put it into place that the economy tumbled
in the meantime and further endangered the country's weak banks.

   MIAMI _ The Cuban-American National Foundation on Sunday denied
a report in The New York Times that the group's late founder, Jorge
Mas Canosa, and other leaders financed the activities of Luis
Posada Carriles, who said he carried out a bombing campaign against
Cuba last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all false and defamatory,'' a spokeswoman for the
foundation, Ninoska Perez, told Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the foundation did not respond to telephone calls,
faxes and letters requesting interviews with its leaders to discuss
their relations with Posada. But in a statement faxed to The New
York Times on Friday, it denied financing his operations.

   ZACATECAS _ For observers of the slow adolescence of Mexican
democracy, two key questions hung over the elections held on July 5
in the northern Mexican states of Durango, Chihuahua and Zacatecas.
Would there be fraud? And what would they reveal about the three
main parties' chances for the presidency in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to both was: not much _ but that says quite a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The elections' cleanliness was loudly proclaimed. Cheating has
indeed become harder since President Ernesto Zedillo, thinly backed
by his Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), gave the Federal
Electoral Institute real independence in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Voters, for instance, must show a photo-identity card, which is
checked against a copy in the electoral register. Then, to make
sure no one votes twice, the card is hole-punched and its owner's
thumb daubed in bright and (supposedly) indelible colors.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, the new system in last summer's midterm
elections cost the PRI control of the lower house of Congress. But
doubts remain about lower-level elections; and, even if voting
itself cannot be fiddled, other things can.
</P>
<P>
   Zacatecas's state law requires few checks on campaign spending.
And many believe that Ricardo Monreal, a defector from the PRI to
the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), spent a
lot more to win his governorship than he said.
</P>
<P>
   Each party gets an allowance based on its votes in the previous
election. The PRD's slice in Zacatecas was about half that of the
right-leaning National Action Party (PAN), and a quarter of the
PRI's. Yet those parties claim it had the most publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the state capital and its environs were festooned
with at least as many posters of Monreal's grin and his campaign
slogan, ``Yes we can,'' as of his PRI rival's.
</P>
<P>
   The charge of overspending will be hard to prove or disprove:
the state electoral institute cannot demand the parties' accounts
until two months after polling day, and they need not produce
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that undermines electoral fairness is not even
illegal: the press sometimes demands a fee just to give a party
news coverage (and will happily issue a receipt, if desired).
</P>
<P>
   The PAN coordinator in Zacatecas says his party gave one local
paper 100,000 pesos ($11,000) _ ``but we are poor,'' he sighs,
hinting darkly at the richness of others, ``and it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair or foul, the results are a warning to the opposition
parties hoping to end 70 years and more of PRI hegemony in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD, which last year saw Cuauhtemoc Cardenas elected mayor
of Mexico City, is thrilled now to have won its first state
governorship. But it is a diluted triumph. Cardenas _ he too a PRI
man in his time, but a veteran of the PRD's struggles _ is one
thing, Monreal is another. He quit the PRI only after it failed to
choose him as its candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It was his own appeal, not the ideals of the PRD, let alone his
platform _ those of all the candidates were much alike _ that won
what had been a firmly PRI state. Nor was he even strictly the PRD
candidate: he was backed by a loose alliance of parties and local
groups of which the PRD was just the main component.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the PRD needs not just to win states, but to show
it can govern and transform them.
</P>
<P>
   Zacatecas may be a poor showcase. Many doubt that Monreal left
his PRI ideas and connections behind when he left the party. And
even if he did, the state congress, also elected on July 5, will
have a majority hostile to him.
</P>
<P>
   So the PRI can at least console itself at its loss of Zacatecas.
Further north, it kept control of Durango, and regained Chihuahua
from the PAN, which had won the state six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How? In Chihuahua the PRI, for the first time, held a primary
election. The result was defeat for a PRI dinosaur who would
probably have lost Sunday's election, and, instead (and in contrast
to Zacatecas) the choice, by voters rather than party hacks, of a
candidate who already had public appeal and won more in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN can also blame itself. Its governor, Francisco Barrio,
had run the state quite well and was still popular. But the party
rejected his chosen successor (Mexican politicians cannot succeed
themselves) in favor of an unimpressive man.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a silver lining for the PAN. Barrio had said he
would not seek its presidential candidacy. A solid PAN victory
might have led him to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now the outlook is better for the ambitious Vicente Fox,
governor of Guanajuato, not the most popular man within the party,
but likelier to be so with Mexicans at large.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever hopes the PRD or even the PAN may draw from these
elections, the real winner may be the PRI. It has held primaries in
some other states due to vote this year. If the PRI is learning to
use democracy as skillfully as it used to flout it, the others had
better watch out. &QL;

even if he did, the state congress, also elected on July 5, will
have a majority hostile to him.
</P>
<P>
   So the PRI can at least console itself at its loss of Zacatecas.
Further north, it kept control of Durango, and regained Chihuahua
from the PAN, which had won the state six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How? In Chihuahua the PRI, for the first time, held a primary
election. The result was defeat for a PRI dinosaur who would
probably have lost Sunday's election, and, instead (and in contrast
to Zacatecas) the choice, by voters rather than party hacks, of a
candidate who already had public appeal and won more in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN can also blame itself. Its governor, Francisco Barrio,
had run the state quite well and was still popular. But the party
rejected his chosen successor (Mexican politicians cannot succeed
themselves) in favor of an unimpressive man.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a silver lining for the PAN. Barrio had said he
would not seek its presidential candidacy. A solid PAN victory
might have led him to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now the outlook is better for the ambitious Vicente Fox,
governor of Guanajuato, not the most popular man within the party,
but likelier to be so with Mexicans at large.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever hopes the PRD or even the PAN may draw from these
elections, the real winner may be the PRI. It has held primaries in
some other states due to vote this year. If the PRI is learning to
use democracy as skillfully as it used to flout it, the others had
better watch out. &QL;

   TOKYO _ From the surface of the earth at least, nowhere could
appear less sinister than Toyama Park.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in Shinjuku Ward, in the heart of central Tokyo, it is
an unremarkable little place of trees and gravel, a spot where
salarymen take their lunchtime sandwiches and old ladies walk their
poodles. A famous university is next door; a number of hospitals
stand close by.
</P>
<P>
   But the ground beneath Toyama Park contains a secret _ a truly
horrible secret, one of the most dreadful of 20th-century Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, bureaucrats, politicians and local
people have been passing it around from one to the other, a
historical hot potato which nobody wants to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins more than 60 years ago during the seemingly
unstoppable advance of the invading Japanese Imperial Army through
Manchuria.
</P>
<P>
   In the city of Harbin, a special division was established
officially called the Prevention of Epidemics and Water Supply
Section, but better and more notoriously known as Unit 731.
</P>
<P>
   Its true function was controversial in itself _ the development
and testing of biological and chemical weapons, including anthrax
and bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   But the fearful thing about Unit 731 was the means which its
doctors used to carry out their research: experiments on live
prisoners who were deliberately infected in the name of science and
dissected while they were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the human experiments took place in Harbin but,
according to the accounts of former Unit 731 members, experiments
were also carried out in the Imperial Army's medical college and
research headquarters _ now the site of Toyama Park.
</P>
<P>
   The park is about to be dug up for the construction of a brand
new public sports ground. The project will involve excavating the
site where human experiments are believed to have taken place,
threatening to bring the horrible episode literally up to the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   For _ apart from its present-day role as a place of recreation _
Toyama Park is a mass grave. Nine years ago, 200 bodies of several
Asian races were dug up from a nearby construction site.
</P>
<P>
   Former employees claim that on the site of the park, in the
brief period after the Japanese surrender and before the American
Occupation, the bodies of murdered human guinea pigs were buried.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the numbers killed by Unit 731 in Manchuria range
from 3,000 to 30,000; most were Chinese, but they included Koreans,
Russians, American, French and Britons, and the youngest of them
were babies.
</P>
<P>
   The ``logs,'' as they were referred to by their captors, were
cut open while conscious and their organs removed. For decades the
Japanese government refused to acknowledge the existence of Unit
731, until the 1980s when increasing numbers of elderly former
members began speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues said they dug a hole ten meters deep and for a
month after the surrender they threw bodies into it,'' said one
former nurse quoted in the Asahi newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bodies included those used in germ experiments and after
the grave was filled in, they built on top of it. One of the staff,
who knew the facts, lived in the building to keep guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans to proceed with the sports center have been on hold since
February when a local citizens' group filed a petition demanding
that a full excavation be carried out before any construction goes
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many local people want this sports center,'' says Noboru
Watanabe, the group's leader. ``We're not against the plan, but we
want to prevent historical facts from being concealed.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation has degenerated into a bureaucratic farce, with
everyone agreeing that something must be done, but nobody prepared
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The council of Shinjuku Ward says that it is up to the Ministry
of Health and Welfare. The Ministry of Health and Welfare says its
the responsibility of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
</P>
<P>
   The TMG has referred the matter on to Shinjuku Ward. Members of
the Shinjuku council are divided and no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   In Toyama Park life goes uneventfully on, although a walk
through the trees or a nap on the grass will never feel quite the
same again. &QL;

 &HT;    NASCAR Notebook: Craven comeback stumbles
 &HT;    By Tom McColliste
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Reality struck Ricky Craven where it hurts
Sunday. Right in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after his dramatic comeback effort in winning the pole
for Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300, he fell on his face, finishing 29th.
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't suprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an education. We learned a lot,'' Craven said. ``This
is only the fifth time that Tony (Furr) and I have worked together.
We'll be better because of it. There's a whole lot of highs and
lows in this business. It's never predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   But his return and performance had to be. He hadn't been in a
Winston Cup car since Atlanta in March; hadn't tested; and
admittedly wasn't in tune with the highs or the lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a period of transition where we get used to each
other,'' Craven said. ``I really regret some of the decisions I
made on the chassis. Tony asked me my opinion on some things, and I
feel like that was the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were other things, too. The tire wear was ugly. We had
an oil leak that killed us there. We dumped oil on the tires. It
was just a day where we had our struggles. In the scheme of things,
it wasn't bad. It was a challenge and that's what we're looking
for. It's not over. It's another beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner's best
</P>
<P>
   Mike Skinner finally is getting better. He showed it with a
fifth-place finish, his first significant performance since
finishing eighth in the Daytona 500. ``This makes a statement that
when I get that other 25 percent (healthy), and if we can still
communicate like we did today, then we'll be good. (Crew chief)
Larry McReynolds coming over here has really been an inspiration to
me. He's the man. We think a lot a like, and today it showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield slips
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Mayfield finally had a bad day, and it was a costly one.
After rolling through 16 Winston Cup events with just one finish
out of the top 20 _ 23rd at Texas _ he finished 30th. Making
matters worse, he dropped from second to fourth in the Winston Cup
points standings and now trails Jeff Gordon by 137 points. ``I
started losing the brakes about halfway and finally hit the wall.''
He was running ninth at the time. ``We'll be back.

   ENIS, France _ Emmanuel Petit saw it on the television, so he
knew it must be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw people celebrating on the Champs Elysees,'' he said. ``I
saw people celebrating in Marseille.''
</P>
<P>
   This vision confirmed his own empirical evidence, gained in the
Stade de France late Sunday night, that France was indeed the new
World Cup champion, the first new one in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds after scoring the goal that wrapped up the 3-0 victory
over weak and wobbly Brazil, Petit had seen over 80,000 customers
(to say nothing of the volunteers, and more than a few journalists)
cheering the home team, for a victory that seemed twice as lopsided
as the actual score.
</P>
<P>
   The French people love to debate the fine points of anything,
and their team represents them perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was good, but most of the people were here because of
the big corporations,'' said Frank LeBoeuf, the shaven-headed
defender who actually writes his own stuff for the Times of London,
where he plays for the Chelsea club. ``It was easy to support us
because we were so good, but they are not the real fans.''
</P>
<P>
   There were moments after the game when the players seemed to be
revved-up aerobics instructors, jumping up and down and clapping
and doing the Jane Fonda, exhorting their fans to get the old heart
muscle pumping. But the people in the grandstands were surely on
their feet, singing and moving in place. How much more could
anybody want?
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot wait to see the parade tomorrow,'' LeBoeuf said.
</P>
<P>
   There was certainly a preview of Monday's parade in the clogged
streets of this city, at the northern edge of Paris. The man who
scored the first two goals, Zinedine Zidane, is of Algerian
heritage, and many immigrants from the third world who live in
St.-Denis already regarded Zidane as their surrogate brother or
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I know is that the Cup will stay in France for
the next four years,'' Zidane said afterward. ``We will be
celebrating tomorrow, and I'll be thinking about everyone
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The residents of St.-Denis have seen this glorious stadium rise
over them, when what they really need are jobs and housing and
education, but Sunday night Zidane brought French people together
in the street, clogging traffic, making noise, sounding very much
like fans everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   There has not been such a joyous World Cup celebration outside a
World Cup stadium since 1978, when Argentina won the World Cup on
its home grounds. Argentina was also the sixth and most recent
nation to win its first World Cup. Now there are seven champions.
The World is getting a little bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The powers in the world soccer body, known as FIFA, have
expanded the World Cup from 24 to 32 teams, partially for political
and financial reasons, but also to give representation to the
marginal nations from regions other than Europe and Latin America.
So far, the African and other nations have not been a factor late
in the tournament, but equity comes in different forms. France was
playing a polyglot lineup that truly represented this nation _ men
born in Africa, men born in the Caribbean, men of other European
ancestry. The racists and conservatives in France may hate this,
but there is no denying that France was cheering all these men last
night. When Marcel Desailly, born in Ghana, was sent off with his
second yellow card with 22 minutes left, the military band, seated
in the upper stands, began an informal rendition of the
Marseillaise, a martial anthem that was first sung during a
revolution. If the din did not equal the denizens of the upper deck
of Madison Square Garden howling during the Rangers' Stanley Cup
championship of 1994, it was lovely and moving in its own sweet
nationalistic way, and maybe Petit and LeBoeuf will see it that way
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The national team of France accomplished so much in this
tournament _ even scoring the first goal from the field during a
World Cup final since 1986. In 1990, everybody settled for a late
penalty kick because nobody wanted to see Argentina and West
Germany bear-wrestle each other any more. In 1994, Italy and Brazil
could manage nothing at all for 120 minutes before penalty kicks
gave it to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, Brazil was lucky,'' said Bebeto, the tiny Brazilian
forward. ``In 1998, France was lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   That depends on how you define luck. France was the home team,
but the players did not feel they were pushed by any outpouring of
emotion. And the French players did not feel there was anything
lucky about Ronaldo not being in the original starting lineup, then
restored shortly before game time. Brazilian team officials said
tersely that Ronaldo had not felt well in midday but was fine by
game time; some players suggested he had suffered more from nerves
than indigestion. The player who has been pumped up by his
sporting-good sponsor looked distant and weak, particularly on the
two headers by Zidane, but the French were having none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you play Brazil, they can beat you so many ways,''
Petit said. ``Maybe they were just playing with our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil wasn't playing much of anything, particularly soccer.
Then the speaker system played that old French favorite, ``We Are
the Champions,'' by Queen. Outside on the highways, drivers honked
their horns. The people were making noise. Maybe the players will
get into it soon.

RANGERS FALL TO SECOND WITH 7-5 LOSS TO ATHLETICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Ivan Rodriguez doubled into a double play
yesterday, and the Rangers ran themselves out of a brief stay in
first place in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' most heinous base running came in the fifth inning
and kept them from providing a comfortable lead for starter Darren
Oliver. Instead Oliver fell apart after a great start and the
Rangers fell, 7-5, to Jimmy Haynes and the Oakland Athletics at
Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The loss snapped the Rangers' five-game winning streak and
dropped them back to second place after the Anaheim Angels defeated
the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, hoping to reverse his poor first-half performance,
retired the first 13 batters he faced, then allowed eight of the
next 10 to reach base. Five scored, and Oliver is 4-7 with a 6.96
earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Oliver said. ``I'm so frustrated right now ...
I really don't know what to say. Things happen so quickly in this
game it's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rangers manager Johnny Oates: ``Sometimes you get out of
sync and can't get back into the groove. That shows you what he's
capable of when he's on. But there aren't a lot of Greg Madduxes
floating around out there. It's hard to do. If it was easy, there
would be more guys like him floating around.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes wasn't Maddux, either. The Rangers had nine hits against
him for two unearned runs, both coming in the eighth inning after
the Athletics had built a 7-0 lead. What hurt was having four
runners thrown out in the first five innings when the game was
scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not good,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth was the most painful, starting with Rusty Greer's
single to center. Rodriguez followed with a line drive over third
baseman Mike Blowers' head.
</P>
<P>
   The ball bounced toward the corner, but left fielder Brian
Lesher made a nice sliding stop to cut it off. Third baseman Jerry
Narron put the stop sign on Greer, but he ran through it and was
thrown out at home plate on the relay throw from shortstop Miguel
Tejada.
</P>
<P>
   Narron took the blame, saying he put up the stop sign too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have held him earlier; that's the bottom line,''
Narron said. ``I saw the left fielder slide and I didn't think he'd
come up with it cleanly.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Greer: ``I saw Lesher slide for the ball and when he slid,
I said Jerry is going to send me. So I was busting around the bag.
When I got to the bag he was still sending me. But when I got by
the bag, I saw him stopping me. If I had stopped right away, I
could have gotten back to the bag. It was bang-bang, I had to do it
right there, instead I decided to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also got too ambitious after seeing the play at the
plate. With Greer attempting to slide around the tag and catcher
Mike Macfarlane having to dive to get the out, Rodriguez broke for
third and was thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to make third, but I was running late,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit some balls hard off Haynes,'' first baseman Will Clark
said, lamenting the Rangers' missed chances. ``A lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That included the first inning, when Clark lined a two-out
single off Haynes. Juan Gonzalez hit a double into the left-field
corner but again the Lesher-to-Tejada-to-Macfarlane relay proved
effective. Clark tried to run over Macfarlane at the plate, but the
Athletics' catcher held on for the out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tejada made a great throw, Macfarlane blocked the plate and I
had nowhere to go but over him,'' Clark said. ``I couldn't go
around him and if I slide under him I don't make it.''

   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Political violence has broken out
once more in the troubled KwaZulu/Natal Province. Only this time it
is not the traditional players going at one another. A new battle
seems to be emerging between South Africa's newest political party,
headed in this area by a local strongman, and President Nelson
Mandela's party, the African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week 23 people have died near Pietermaritzburg,
including the deputy mayor of the village of Richmond, who was
gunned down along with eight other people while watching a soccer
match at a pub.
</P>
<P>
   Even the reinforced security before a visit by Mandela did not
slow the carnage. Despite police and army units' patrolling in
armored vehicles, 10 people were killed, including three youths
shot point-blank as they cowered in a hut and a young mother who
was killed with her 3-year-old daughter as they sat by their
evening fire.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting the local morgue, Mandela described the details
of what he had seen to the crowds that gathered for the funeral of
the deputy mayor and two other party supporters who were being
buried Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gone to the mortuary and I have seen people with
cracked skulls, others shot in the mouth while the others stomachs'
had been ripped apart,'' Mandela said. ``I have seen people's
brains spilled all over. This is the brutality to which people are
being subjected to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela promised to do all that he could to end the killings.
But the government is struggling to gain control of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The head of police has threatened to transfer all the local
officers if arrests are not made soon.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Mandela attributed the problems in
Richmond to a ``third force,'' a presumably white-led right-wing
group bent on fomenting black-on-black violence and destroying the
young democracy by undermining his party. ``The perpetrators are
just tools moved by third-force elements,'' Mandela said, ``and it
is these elements that must be nipped in the bud if we want to
defeat political violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the previous white-supremacist government has admitted
third-force activities, there has been no public evidence of such
an effort since then. Some experts who follow KwaZulu/Natal
politics say some remnants of such a force exist and stir up
trouble when they can. But others say blaming a ``third force'' for
problems like the soaring crime rate and the political violence is
simply politically expedient.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Richmond this week, which claimed the lives of
supporters of both the new party, the United Democratic Movement,
and the African National Congress, is the latest chapter in the
brutal political history of the province. For more than a decade
the fighting was between the congress and the Zulu-based Inkatha
Freedom Party, headed by the flamboyant Mangosuthu Buthelezi. More
than 10,000 people died as the parties wrestled for the country's
most populous province, egged on by the apartheid government, which
fed the Inkatha weapons to promote violence among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Though few analysts are willing to bet on what will happen as
the 1999 national elections grow near, the conflict between the
parties has eased in the last 18 months. When Mandela and his
deputy, Thabo Mbeki, are both out of the country, they have several
times turned to Buthelezi to be acting president.
</P>
<P>
   But in the area of Richmond, once an African National Congress
stronghold, the Inkatha party is not a factor. The conflict is
between the congress and supporters of the local strongman, Sifiso
Nkabinde, now a high-ranking member of the United Democratic
Movement, which has picked up the support of 5 percent of the
voters, according to the latest polls.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the violence in KwaZulu/Natal has been part of a
strategy to eliminate political leaders in the hope of undermining
the parties. Some of it is meant to intimidate people into staying
loyal to a party. Some is pure revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde was once an ANC stalwart, at least on the surface. But
the party expelled him last year, saying he was an apartheid-era
spy still bent on promoting violence. Nkabinde denied the charges,
but soon allied himself with the fledgling United Democratic
Movement.
</P>
<P>
   At that time the violence began to heat up, and more than 12
people died, including four ANC officials, one of whom was the
local mayor. Nkabinde appeared to have an unusual relationship with
local police. At one crime scene he did not want the bodies moved
until the press had arrived, and the officers waited, following his
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But after a special inquiry team was created, Nkabinde was
charged with several killings and jailed. Life quickly quieted down
among the huts near Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Nkabinde was acquitted and sent home. In a few days
the trouble began again. More than 40 people have died since, most
ANC supporters, although at least six members of the United
Democratic Movement have also died.
</P>
<P>
   Nkabinde has denied that he is responsible for the fighting.
``It was uttered that Nkabinde had sent people to kill,'' a
spokesman for him, Wonderboy Senzanuhle, said. ``But we are
flabbergasted by this. The UDM is sympathetic to the families who
have people who died.''

BRINGING BACK LOST SPECIES, SOME ON ETHEREAL WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Riding delicate pale green wings, with scalloped,
gossamer edges trailing in the darkness, the luna moth, one of the
most spectacular insects on earth, flew through the nights of New
York City before it succumbed to the stresses of pesticides and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Now the luna, which park rangers say has been missing from the
city for decades, will be taking flight here once again. On the
evening of July 20, the 29th anniversary of the lunar landing, the
Parks Department plans to release the first of several hundred of
these most elegant of moths in the Sheep Meadow in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the lunas, giants among moths, with wings spanning 4
inches or more, will be able to establish themselves in Manhattan
remains a question in this admittedly experimental effort that some
are hailing as brilliant and others are predicting will almost
certainly fail.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the moth release is one of a number of reintroductions
of native species to the New York City area, part of an undertaking
known as Project X. An idea of Parks Commissioner Henry Stern,
Project X has a dual mission of increasing biodiversity and drawing
more people into the parks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Urban Park Rangers, who head the project, brought
back 10 species of plants and animals to parks from which they had
disappeared (hence the name X, as in the Roman numeral). Last
year's releases got butterfly weed blooming again in Brooklyn, wood
frogs croaking in Queens and woodchucks chucking in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   This year rangers will reintroduce screech owls, bobwhite quails
and short-tailed weasels, among others. On the tentative plant list
are dazzlers like columbine, pink lady-slipper and even
prickly-pear cactus.
</P>
<P>
   But while this feel-good project may pique public interest, many
scientists expressed concern over the amount of research being done
to ensure the project's long-term success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very romantic idea to reintroduce species,'' said Dr.
Steven Handel, restoration ecologist at Rutgers University, ``but
just taking a species and putting a bunch of them in, hoping that
they will survive, is a shot in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Restoration projects can be extremely difficult. Many efforts to
bring back just a single species, done with considerably more
research, pilot projects and participating experts than the rangers
can muster, have failed over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest obstacles are the nuances of an animal's or
plant's requirements for survival, which can be very difficult, or
impossible, for biologists to identify and which may no longer even
exist in the habitat. At Inwood Hill Park in Manhattan, for
example, nearly all the salt-marsh bulrush planted last year died.
Rangers will try again in another spot this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was going to be easy,'' said Bram Gunther,
director of the Urban Park Rangers. ``But we lost it all.''
</P>
<P>
   The people for whom the species are being reintroduced can be a
problem as well. Most of the white turtlehead planted last year in
Kissena Park in Queens was also lost, much of it because of
trampling by walkers who strayed off the path. And while the
Eastern box turtles put into High Rock Park on Staten Island have
survived, there is still no sign of baby turtles.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been missteps. The Parks Department's plan to
bring the Eastern chipmunk to Central Park last year was rejected
by Health Department officials, who pointed out that these rodents
can be hosts for ticks carrying the agent that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Project X releases, however, appear to be taking
quite well to their new homes, at least so far.
</P>
<P>
   As for the coming luna moth release, reactions among biologists
varied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marvelous idea,'' said Dr. Charles Remington, an
entomologist at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale
University. ``I'd say go ahead and give it a try, because it's one
of the most beautiful lepidopterans in the whole world. I think
there's terrific potential for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dale Schweitzer, a conservation biologist specializing in
butterflies and moths who works with the Nature Conservancy, said:
``I really think that if an area does not have luna moths now, it's
probably because it's not capable of sustaining a population. At
best it's a waste, or it could be something a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts suggest that the luna moths were done in by some
combination of large-scale DDT spraying in the 1960s along with
urbanization and possibly the bright city lights.
</P>
<P>
   This time, too, the lights of the city may prove too dazzling
for these moths, biologists say, as moths are often confused by
lights, flying around them, failing to find mates and becoming easy
prey for bats and birds.
</P>
<P>
   But Remington notes that the females laden with eggs typically
do not fly to lights. Also working in the moth's favor, Remington
said, is that luna moths in the region go through two generations a
year, allowing them to establish themselves quickly. In addition,
he said, luna moths seem to manage in grimy city air.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More worrisome, Schweitzer said, is that the luna moths being
released, rather than being gathered from, say, nearby New Jersey
populations, are being bought from a breeder who mates females from
Pennsylvania with males from upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to making the introduction less likely to work,
since the moths may be adapted to different conditions from what
they will find in Central Park, the threat such moths pose is the
``pollution'' of native luna moth populations like those in New
Jersey or Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a struggling population of native lunas anywhere in
the region, and biologists say one might still exist even in
Central Park, then interbreeding with these out-of-town moths that
may be better adapted to life elsewhere could be their death knell.
</P>
<P>
   Robert DeCandido, the ranger who is overseeing the luna moth
project, said rearing local moths for release in Central Park would
have required a prohibitive amount of labor. ``They brought
peregrine falcons into the Eastern United States from all over the
world _ Africa, Argentina,'' he said. ``It's been successful. It's
a great reintroduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others questioned the aesthetic value of a night-flying
moth in the park, where many people are reluctant to stroll after
dark.
</P>
<P>
   Urban Park Rangers, well aware of their critics, say they think
it is still worth trying to restore this grand, green beauty to its
former home. (DeCandido noted that he can only hope to have lunas
to release on the 20th, at the Moon Day 29 festival, as the moths
emerge from their cocoons according to their own schedule, not the
Parks Department's. The festival will take place from 8 to 11 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   The rangers say they will continue to introduce more native
plants and animals and are on the lookout for good candidates for
next year. They note, however, that not every species once found in
the city will have a shot at coming back: black bears, rattlesnakes
and native roaches have not made the list.

GINGRICH HELPED END PANEL ON THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR ARMS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Pa., Okla., Calif. Miss., Neb.)  (js) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has criticized President
Clinton for not curbing the spread of missiles and nuclear arms,
helped to kill a special commission last month that had been
created to address that very problem.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to reports that China had shipped missile parts and
know-how to Iran and Pakistan, Gingrich said in a letter to House
members on May 14, ``Those dangerous, illegal and destabilizing
transfers have gone almost completely unacknowledged'' by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   But just before the House recessed last month for two weeks,
Gingrich and a top foreign-policy lieutenant, Rep. Benjamin Gilman
of New York, quietly killed a panel set up to streamline the
efforts of 96 federal offices that address the threat of
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Headed by John Deutch, a former director of central
intelligence, the eight-member panel had just begun to untangle the
overlapping government jurisdictions that try to combat the spread
of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the means to
deliver them. With the end of the Cold War, proliferation has
become one of the main threats to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with the No. 1 subject in the world right now,''
said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who was vice chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that challenge the commission is now dead. Aides to
Gingrich and Gilman, who heads the House International Relations
Committee, said the panel got a late start, was ineffective and was
dominated by experts picked by Democrats, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   With the commission's mandate due to expire in late June, the
Senate easily approved an extension in March, to July 29, 1999. But
Gingrich and Gilman delayed a House vote for 13 weeks, forcing the
panel to fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought up the problem less than a week before the
recess, and it was a very busy week,'' said Gingrich's spokeswoman,
Christina Martin, explaining why the House refused to throw the
panel a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the panel, as well as many in the Senate and from
past administrations, were stunned by the House snub. They say
Gingrich and Gilman are playing politics with a deadly serious
issue that cuts across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing important work and now we've been cut short,''
said Henry Cooper, a senior Pentagon official in the Bush
administration whom Gingrich appointed to the panel. ``There wasn't
any partisan substance to our deliberations.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser,
said in an interview: ``It's a shame that because of some
bureaucratic rigidities they let this thing die. They were on the
right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he found no ``substantive objection'' in the House
complaint and vowed to revive the panel this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The commission seems to have hit every pothole in the road since
it was set up in October 1996 by the Intelligence Authorization Act
to improve how the government addresses proliferation problems.
</P>
<P>
   It took Clinton 14 months to appoint his four choices to the
panel, formally known as the Commission to Assess the Organization
of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of
Mass Destruction. That delayed the first meeting until last Jan.
29.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman objected to the makeup and, in particular, to one member,
Robert Gallucci, the president's special envoy on proliferation
issues. Gilman said he feared that Gallucci would have a conflict
of interest as both a policy maker and an independent adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The four other panelists were two former Democratic
representatives, Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma and Anthony Beilenson of
California; a former Democratic senator, J. James Exon of Nebraska,
and Daniel Poneman, a former national security aide to Bush and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch said he was willing to add four members to be appointed
by Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority
leader. But Deutch said he balked at removing a current member or
limiting the panel's scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they care about nonproliferation policy but they
wanted to control how the commission approached the problem,''
Deutch said of Gingrich and his allies.
</P>
<P>
   The final blow was on June 18, when the general counsel of the
CIA ruled that unless the House acted by June 26, the panel's
authority would end.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman's aides fault Gingrich for not scheduling a floor vote on
a bill to address House Republican concerns. ``The leadership in
the House controls the legislative schedule,'' a spokesman for
Gilman, Jerry Lipson, said. ``If they decide a bill will have time
on floor, it'll have time on floor. If not, it won't.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's colleagues fault the White House. ``There is
little the commission could do to address the lack of attention
paid by the Clinton administration to the frightening issue of
nuclear-weapons proliferation,'' said Ms. Martin, Gingrich's
spokeswoman.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Majestic and historic, the dome of the U.S.
Capitol was once the favored backdrop in television commercials of
contenders for public office. But in recent years, the only
candidates who dared feature the dome in their advertisements were
challengers who made it a symbol of government gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dome is back, in all its patriotic glory.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better demonstration of how dramatically the
political climate has changed this election year than in the
commercials candidates are broadcasting around the country. After
years of shunning Washington and politics-as-usual, even incumbents
who once went out of their way to portray themselves as government
outsiders are proudly trumpeting their insider credentials, the
legislation they passed and their connections in Washington or
their state capital.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of hundreds of commercials broadcast by Democrats
and Republicans alike shows that a striking proportion of
contenders are cramming their advertisements with bland but, they
hope, convincing pitches that include insider attributes like
``experience'' and ``record'' and ``proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., this week unveiled a commercial
with this tag line: ``So much experience. So much he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Texas, the advertisements for Republican Gov. George W.
Bush emphasize that despite his accomplishments, like enacting
``the toughest juvenile justice laws,'' there is much more for him
to do.
</P>
<P>
   The slogan for the campaign of Roy Barnes, a Democratic
candidate for governor in Georgia, is typical: ``Experience and
ideas that work for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Strother, a Democratic media consultant who advises Barnes,
said the commercials he made for the Barnes campaign in 1990
pointedly did not emphasize the Democrat's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago or four years ago, when we filmed our
commercials we wouldn't film them in the marble halls of
Washington,'' Strother said. ``We actually hid incumbency from
people. But experience is no longer a liability. People don't want
to burn down government. They want somebody who can manage it _ and
they're afraid to turn it over to novices.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, a Republican media consultant, explained the shift
this way: ``Because there's less anger, voters want people who are
going to get things done. And they perceive that you get more
things done if you have real experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Several strategists explained that their emphasis on
accomplishments is not based merely on gut instinct but on focus
groups and polls showing that voters have had enough of outsiders
who claim that their naivete about the legislative process is an
asset. These days, voters often rank experience and integrity as
the two most important characteristics that they seek in a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason that both parties are reluctant to bash the
status-quo is that both Democrats and Republicans are now the
status quo themselves. In 1994, Republicans could deride the
Democratic-controlled Congress and White House. Now, they run the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years ago, every Republican was outside the temple saying,
`Tear the temple down!''' recalled Alex Castellanos, a Republican
media consultant. ``We're in the temple now.'' As a result, he
said, he and his colleagues were ``risk averse'' in their
advertising approaches. ``Why take a chance?'' he said.
```Experience that hears you' is the perfect slogan.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advertisements this year could best be described as
30-second, televised resumes. One after another, they feature
newspaper headlines telling of candidates' accomplishments or bills
they proposed. Even nonincumbents are trying to sound like
incumbents. One of the most popular gimmicks is that candidates are
offering toll-free numbers that voters can call to get booklets
listing their accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Terry, an Omaha, Neb., City Council member who won the
Republican primary for a House seat, produced an advertisement in
which he looked into the camera and made this pitch: ``All of us
running for Congress talk about what we'll do. But how do you know
we can? Well, I'm the only Republican running with a record. I've
gotten results.''
</P>
<P>
   Another trend this year is the greater hesitancy to run slashing
attack ads. Those who are lashing out are relying less on anonymous
narrators; instead, several politicians are calmly critiquing their
rivals themselves _ directly to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   When Lauch Faircloth first ran for the Senate in North Carolina
six years ago, his advertisements had a decidedly anti-Washington
cast. But now that he is a Republican incumbent, the National
Republican Senatorial Committee is running a commercial that tries
to play up Faircloth's stature as an insider who could not be
corrupted by Washington. ``Washington's a crazy city,'' the
narrator says as grainy images of the city fill the screen. ``They
pay people not to work and they even elected a convicted drug-user
mayor. But our Lauch Faircloth is shakin' up the place _ doing what
he promised.''
</P>

<P>
   The anti-incumbency fervor was always more intense at the
federal level than in state campaigns. But several consultants for
gubernatorial candidates said they, too, were dwelling on
experience and incumbency this year more than in recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci, a Republican, was lieutenant
governor before taking over from William Weld less than a year ago.
But in Cellucci's quest this year for a full term, he is already
portraying himself as an entrenched incumbent. ``Governor Cellucci
balanced eight budgets in a row,'' the announcer intones in one
commercial, ``and has taken Massachusetts from deficits to a record
surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   In his advertisements, Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, a
Democrat who faces a spirited primary challenge, ticks off what the
announcer describes as a ``real record of accomplishment,'' from
225 new state troopers to cutting the state income tax. ``It's a
good start,'' the announcer says, ``but there's more to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Though candidates are proclaiming their experience, many still
prefer to deliver their pitches outside the confines of the
wood-paneled committee hearing rooms in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   New York Rep. Charles Schumer, who is running in the Democratic
Senate primary, tries his insider pitch from a classroom. The
advertisement closes with these words scrawled on a blackboard:
``Chuck Schumer for Senate. He's done more ... He'll do more ...
For you.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set in California when Lt. Gov. Gray Davis won an
upset victory in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in June by
portraying himself as far more experienced than his two
better-financed rivals. His advisers said the slogan, ``Experience
money can't buy,'' was central to Davis' swift rise in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, Heather Wilson, a Republican candidate in a special
election for the House in New Mexico, appropriated the Davis pitch
in her own successful campaign against a wealthy Democratic state
senator, Phil Maloof. ``Experience money can't buy,'' the announcer
says. ``Heather Wilson for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who lack Washington experience are trying to play up
whatever experience they do have. In one of his commercials, Scott
Ferguson, who ran in the Democratic primary for Senate in Arkansas,
looked into the camera with this appeal: ``Arkansas doesn't need a
senator with a lot of Washington experience. We need a senator with
Arkansas experience.''
</P>
<P>
   He was defeated by former Rep. Blanche Lambert Lincoln, who
declared in her commercials that she had even more experience.
Washington experience.
</P>
<P>
   David Dixon, a Democratic media consultant, created offbeat,
original commercials that emphasized that his candidate for a House
seat in Kentucky, Jonathan Miller, was a family man. But Miller
lost the Democratic primary to Ernesto Scorsone, whose
advertisements reminded viewers that when The Lexington
Herald-Leader endorsed him ``they cited his experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to tug more on the emotional heartstrings,'' Dixon
said, ``but people want to hear more about your resume.''
</P>
<P>
   In a primary for a House seat in Ohio, two Republicans dueled
over just who had the most experience. A commercial for former Rep.
Frank Cremeans featured a shot of the Capitol dome and the slogan,
``We need a congressman with real experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But in her advertisements, Nancy Hollister countered that
Cremeans did not get much done when he was in Washington. ``You've
probably heard that former Congressman Frank Cremeans has never
passed a bill,'' the announcer intones. The advertisement went on
to list Ms. Hollister's record as lieutenant governor, with this
close: ``The bottom line: Nancy Hollister gets results.'' Ms.
Hollister won.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Schriefer, a Republican media consultant, said Washington
insiders are so in vogue that he featured former Sen. Bob Dole in a
commercial for Loleta Didrickson, who lost the Illinois Senate
primary this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used Bob Dole at the end of the ad standing in front of the
Capitol, with just a tag, `Hey Loleta, we need you out here.'''
Schriefer recalled. ``A couple of years ago, four years ago, you
wouldn't have done that.''

NO OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVE TO HASHIMOTO 
</HEADLINE>
  (With JAPAN-eLECTION) 
(lh) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto may have angered his
own citizens and the rest of the world with his reluctance to
tackle Japan's economic problems, but if he seems lackluster, the
alternatives could be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Hashimoto is expected to resign after his party's
dismal performance in parliamentary elections on Sunday, the
leading candidate to replace him is Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi.
Obuchi has never been tainted by scandal and has generally avoided
missteps, but analysts describe him as someone who could make
Hashimoto seem dynamic by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States and many Asian countries are desperately
hoping that a fresh face will emerge _ someone who will take charge
of the government and begin tough steps to revive the economy, no
one in Japan seems to see such a person in the wings. Obuchi
certainly does not fit that description, for even in a country that
has specialized in faceless leaders, Obuchi has had a career that
has not been memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obuchi has all the pizazz of a cold pizza,'' said John F.
Neuffer, a specialist in Japanese politics at the Mitsui Marine
Research Institute in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't be calling the shots,'' Neuffer added of Obuchi,
if he were to become Prime Minister. ``He'd simply be a puppet for
the party elders.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also true to some extent of Hashimoto and other
candidates who might replace him, but even by comparison to his
peers, Obuchi seems unusually colorless and malleable. He is
relatively little known in Japan and has never been associated with
major policy initiatives _ and it is unclear what he stands for.
</P>
<P>
   While Obuchi helped carry out some of Hashimoto's diplomatic
initiatives, such as warmer ties with Russia, Obuchi has been
largely a figurehead who made few decisions himself. Diplomats say
that he generally allowed the career bureaucrats in the Foreign
Ministry to make the crucial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Obuchi serving as prime minister raises some
intriguing questions about the Japanese political system. Polls
indicate that people want leadership, but the governing party may
replace a prime minister who has exhibited little leadership with a
Cabinet minister who has demonstrated none.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this puzzle, say Japanese politicians and
analysts, is that in a virtual one-party state like Japan, the key
to rising in politics is seniority and congeniality. And Obuchi,
61, is extremely senior and congenial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He succeeded his father in a parliament seat in 1963 and has
been there since, working his way up the leadership ladder. A
gentle, low-key figure, he has often played the role of a mediator
and now heads the largest faction in the governing Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   While Obuchi's lack of both charisma and obvious leadership
skills might add to the party's problem with voters, the
fundamental problem that it faces is that while Hashimoto is
unpopular, there is no one else in the party who seems a clear
improvement. Indeed, the lack of alternatives is what has kept
Hashimoto in office in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you take care of the situation after him?'' asked
Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime minister, in an interview last
week. ``Without knowing that, they can't get rid of him. Who can
succeed Hashimoto under these circumstances? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, someone will have to succeed Hashimoto, and talk is now
turning to Miyazawa as a possible emergency replacement. It would
be highly unusual to turn to a former prime minister, and he is not
the kind of fresh face that the party would like. But he is
recognized as an expert on finance and economics.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazawa's term as prime minister was not memorable _ except to
Americans, who remember President Bush throwing up in Miyazawa's
lap during a state visit to Tokyo in 1993 _ but his expertise in
finance would bring some credibility to efforts to grapple with
Japan's economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Another contender is Seiroku Kajiyama, a veteran Liberal
Democratic Politician who has called for more aggressive efforts to
tackle economic problems. Kajiyama suffers, however, from an image
of an old-style political horse-trader _ just the image that the
Liberal Democrats are trying to shed.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama caused an uproar in 1990, when he was justice minister
and told a news conference that prostitutes were taking over and
harming a district in Tokyo. He said this was ``just like in
America, where blacks move in an area and whites are chased out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate for the prime minister's job might be Yohei
Kono, a former party leader who has a fresher image than some of
his rivals but who like Obuchi appears to have more friendliness in
his belly than fire.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fretting about how much the cost of college will have soared by
the time your kids are ready for four years in ivory-tower bliss?
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly appealing strategy is a prepaid-tuition plan,
which lets parents lock in tuition money now _ regardless of what
the costs are by the time Junior matriculates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made many attractive adjustments
to these plans, so this is a good time to look them over.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, prepaid-tuition plans and tuition-savings plans are
state-run programs that allow families to pay a fixed sum of money
(in either monthly installments or a lump sum) for as many as 17 or
so years before a child is ready to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   With a prepaid plan, the money is guaranteed to cover tuition
later, regardless of the cost when a student is ready to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   With a savings plan, money is socked away now for college, but
if tuition has increased beyond what the plan anticipates, the
parents or student are responsible for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With both plans, the money grows tax-deferred and, upon
withdrawal, is taxed at the student's income rate, not the
parents'. Since most students will fall into the 15 percent
bracket, there can be considerable tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage to a prepaid-tuition plan is that parents lock
in a specific tuition price for a state school at the time they
begin investing, regardless of how much tuition increases for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the amount parents pay is based on the age of their
child and the projected year of college entrance. Parents also
select how many years of college they would like to save for and
for which type of school, but there is no need to specify a school
at the time investing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of a newborn in Mississippi, for example, can pay a lump
sum of $9,141 now or make 216 payments of $80 a month to cover four
years at a state university that begin in the year 2015 (based on
the average tuition and fees at public colleges, with a factor for
inflation).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of the lump-sum payment is that you start earning
interest on the entire amount right away.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1998, 14 states had prepaid-tuition plans, and five
had savings plans. According to the College Savings Plans Network,
in Lexington, Ky., another 20 states intend to launch programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a specific plan, call CSPN
(606-244-8175), or visit its Web site at www.csg.org/cspn.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, states are now allowed to accept
money to prepay room and board in addition to tuition. The law also
loosened the rules for which type of school and for which state the
money can be used.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the plans were once good only for publicly
supported schools in the state in which the family lived, many
states now allow families to use the money at any accredited two-
or four-year school _ public or private _ in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Junior ends up at Harvard or Bennington, you'll simply have
to pay the difference in cost. Grandparents are also allowed to set
up a plan in the state where their grandchild lives.
</P>
<P>
   The savings plan will prove too conservative for some investors
_ the plans shoot for just a 5 percent to 6 percent gain, though
the tax advantages shouldn't be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid-tuition plans offer more of a hedge against runaway
inflation. ``States monitor tuitions and make sure earnings keep up
with tuition inflation,'' says Kathy Tyson, research manager at
CSPN. ``With savings plans, states try to earn as much money as
they can on them, but there's no guarantee they'll keep up with
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child decides to pursue his or her acting dream and
forgo a college education together, there may be a considerable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Wisconsin, charge a 1 percent fee to
withdraw money from the plan. Others, such as Florida, will return
your money but without the interest it accrued _ a considerable
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more reason to insist that the little ones finish their
education. &QL;

<P>
   Fretting about how much the cost of college will have soared by
the time your kids are ready for four years in ivory-tower bliss?
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly appealing strategy is a prepaid-tuition plan,
which lets parents lock in tuition money now _ regardless of what
the costs are by the time Junior matriculates.
</P>
<P>
   The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 made many attractive adjustments
to these plans, so this is a good time to look them over.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, prepaid-tuition plans and tuition-savings plans are
state-run programs that allow families to pay a fixed sum of money
(in either monthly installments or a lump sum) for as many as 17 or
so years before a child is ready to attend college.
</P>
<P>
   With a prepaid plan, the money is guaranteed to cover tuition
later, regardless of the cost when a student is ready to enroll.
</P>
<P>
   With a savings plan, money is socked away now for college, but
if tuition has increased beyond what the plan anticipates, the
parents or student are responsible for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   With both plans, the money grows tax-deferred and, upon
withdrawal, is taxed at the student's income rate, not the
parents'. Since most students will fall into the 15 percent
bracket, there can be considerable tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   The key advantage to a prepaid-tuition plan is that parents lock
in a specific tuition price for a state school at the time they
begin investing, regardless of how much tuition increases for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the amount parents pay is based on the age of their
child and the projected year of college entrance. Parents also
select how many years of college they would like to save for and
for which type of school, but there is no need to specify a school
at the time investing begins.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of a newborn in Mississippi, for example, can pay a lump
sum of $9,141 now or make 216 payments of $80 a month to cover four
years at a state university that begin in the year 2015 (based on
the average tuition and fees at public colleges, with a factor for
inflation).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of the lump-sum payment is that you start earning
interest on the entire amount right away.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1998, 14 states had prepaid-tuition plans, and five
had savings plans. According to the College Savings Plans Network,
in Lexington, Ky., another 20 states intend to launch programs this
year.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a specific plan, call CSPN
(606-244-8175), or visit its Web site at www.csg.org/cspn.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1997 tax bill, states are now allowed to accept
money to prepay room and board in addition to tuition. The law also
loosened the rules for which type of school and for which state the
money can be used.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the plans were once good only for publicly
supported schools in the state in which the family lived, many
states now allow families to use theat any accredited two-
or four-year school _ public or private _ in the country.
</P>
<P>
   If Junior ends up at Harvard or Bennington, you'll simply have
to pay the difference in cost. Grandparents are also allowed to set
up a plan in the state where their grandchild lives.
</P>
<P>
   The savings plan will prove too conservative for some investors
_ the plans shoot for just a 5 percent to 6 percent gain, though
the tax advantages shouldn't be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Prepaid-tuition plans offer more of a hedge against runaway
inflation. ``States monitor tuitions and make sure earnings keep up
with tuition inflation,'' says Kathy Tyson, research manager at
CSPN. ``With savings plans, states try to earn as much money as
they can on them, but there's no guarantee they'll keep up with
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   If your child decides to pursue his or her acting dream and
forgo a college education together, there may be a considerable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Wisconsin, charge a 1 percent fee to
withdraw money from the plan. Others, such as Florida, will return
your money but without the interest it accrued _ a considerable
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Just one more reason to insist that the little ones finish their
education. &QL;

 By PETER L. BERNSTEIN  
 c.1998 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When an argument misses the whole point, the result is likely to
be irrelevant, confusing, or just plain wrong. Much of the debate
about the future of Social Security misses the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not whether Social Security is fundamentally sound
or fundamentally bankrupt, or whether privatizing Social Security
with some kind of giant 401(k) plan would provide us with a more
comfortable old age. At its core, the risk we face has nothing at
all to do with what we now call financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement has become a central issue of national concern
because the number of retirees is going to grow more rapidly than
the number of people of working age, and that problem intensifies
with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The great uncertainty, then, is whether the economy will be able
to produce sufficient goods and services to support the retired
baby boomers in the style to which they have been accustomed, while
still leaving enough for the younger working members of society to
live in the style to which they would like to become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the real risk is in the productivity of our economy.
</P>
<P>
   All the money in the world piled up in retirement funds will be
worthless unless the economy can provide the stuff we will want to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing accomplished by money flowing in and out of
retirement funds is the determination of who gets what, not how
much is available. Money is the ticket to the show but does not
determine what the show will be.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that more people can enjoy the show if we
can increase the number of available seats. That is why I emphasize
that the standard of living the aging baby boomers can enjoy will
ultimately depend far more on the productivity of the nation than
on the financial arrangements we concoct to fund their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then how do the financial arrangements enter the picture?
Consider the process by which we finance our everyday spending or
pay off our creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If we are regularly writing checks to pay our bills, or drawing
cash by check or from the ATM, we must be sure to have some way of
replenishing our bank accounts. Money has to come in from
somewhere, or we will go belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   People with jobs bank the wages and salaries they receive from
their employers. People who do not work must look elsewhere to
raise cash _ welfare, monthly pension-fund receipts, a friendly
relative, interest and dividends on investments, or the proceeds
from liquidating assets that have been accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Note that every one of those sources depends in turn on payments
from somewhere else. For example, the government will not mail
welfare benefits or pay the interest on its bonds unless citizens
pay their taxes or buy the bonds issued to cover budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend payments on equities won't be forthcoming unless
corporations can find a market for their output. The accumulated
assets cannot be liquidated if there are no buyers for those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   This illuminates the true function of retirement funds. A
retirement fund owns stocks and bonds and other investments but
cannot itself finance the spending of the retirees unless the fund
has money in the bank first.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, no matter how much shares of stock and no matter
how many bonds the fund owns, no pensions can be paid unless the
bonds and stocks are paying an income or unless the market is
receptive to buying the investments the fund chooses to liquidate.
</P>

Social Security.

collateral is still no guarantee that society will be able to
provide senior citizens with the wherewithal to pay for their

<P>
   Suppose, for the sake of argument, that we did reform Social

enough to satisfy the needs of both those who are employed and the
larger number who are retired.

insist upon their rightful share. Wages will escalate, either
causing inflation or disrupting the reliable flow of interest and
dividends and the vibrant market on which asset liquidation
depends. Then the purchasing power of the retirees' collateral will
be much less than today's expectations seem to promise.

<P>
   When an argument misses the whole point, the result is likely to
be irrelevant, confusing, or just plain wrong. Much of the debate
about the future of Social Security misses the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not whether Social Security is fundamentally sound
or fundamentally bankrupt, or whether privatizing Social Security
with some kind of giant 401(k) plan would provide us with a more
comfortable old age. At its core, the risk we face has nothing at
all to do with what we now call financial planning.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement has become a central issue of national concern
because the number of retirees is going to grow more rapidly than
the number of people of working age, and that problem intensifies
with the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The great uncertainty, then, is whether the economy will be able
to produce sufficient goods and services to support the retired
baby boomers in the style to which they have been accustomed, while
still leaving enough for the younger working members of society to
live in the style to which they would like to become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the real risk is in the productivity of our economy.
</P>
<P>
   All the money in the world piled up in retirement funds will be
worthless unless the economy can provide the stuff we will want to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing accomplished by money flowing in and out of
retirement funds is the determination of who gets what, not how
much is available. Money is the ticket to the show but does not
determine what the show will be.
</P>
<P>
   The important point is that more people can enjoy the show if we
can increase the number of available seats. That is why I emphasize
that the standard of living the aging baby boomers can enjoy will
ultimately depend far more on the productivity of the nation than
on the financial arrangements we concoct to fund their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Then how do the financial arrangements enter the picture?
Consider the process by which we finance our everyday spending or
pay off our creditors.
</P>
<P>
   If we are regularly writing checks to pay our bills, or drawing
cash by check or from the ATM, we must be sure to have some way of
replenishing our bank accounts. Money has to come in from
somewhere, or we will go belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   People with jobs bank the wages and salaries they receive from
their employers. People who do not work must look elsewhere to
raise cash _ welfare, monthly pension-fund receipts, a friendly
relative, interest and dividends on investments, or the proceeds
from liquidating assets that have been accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Note that every one of those sources depends in turn on payments
from somewhere else. For example, the government will not mail
welfare benefits or pay the interest on its bonds unless citizens
pay their taxes or buy the bonds issued to cover budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Dividend payments on equities won't be forthcoming unless
corporations can find a market for their output. The accumulated
assets cannot be liquidated if there are no buyers for those
assets.
</P>
<P>
   This illuminates the true function of retirement funds. A
retirement fund owns stocks and bonds and other investments but
cannot itself finance the spending of the retirees unless the fund
has money in the bank first.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, no matter how much shares of stock and no matter
how many bonds the fund owns, no pensions can be paid unless the
bonds and stocks are paying an income or unless the market is
receptive to buying the investments the fund chooses to liquidate.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, then, retirement benefits are financed from outside
the fund rather than by the fund itself. Retirement funds are
merely conduits; they determine who gets what, not how much is
available _ which means that the true function of the assets in
these funds is to serve as collateral to secure the claims of
future retirees on future production.
</P>

   But no restructuring of Social Security, no privatization or

the capital markets are buoyant.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

<P>
   Will it be different this year? Will both the market and the
Wall Street strategists who backed it last year run out of gas in
the second half of 1998? Don't count on that yet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when the market was scaling then unprecedented
heights, the optimistic voices on Wall Street loudly proclaimed,
``This time it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical comparisons that showed the market to be way
overvalued were irrelevant, announced the group, led by Abby Joseph
Cohen of Goldman Sachs. American corporations had become the most
efficient in the world, inflation was vanquished, and interest
rates were on their way down, Cohen and the others pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Despite disturbingly low dividend yields and disturbingly high
price-to-earnings rations, the stock market is cheap, they
preached.
</P>
<P>
   And they were right. For the 12 months ended April 24, the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index had appreciated a stunning 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But now, by all historical measures, the stock market is even
more stunningly overvalued. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 trades at
slightly less than 28 times trailing earnings _ a year ago many
experts called the market expensive when the price-to-earnings
ratio ran past 19.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average trades at 64 times dividends _
the yield on these stocks is a Japan-like 1.55 percent. A year ago
it seemed the height of insanity when the index traded at 55 times
dividends and the yield was 1.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. In late April, with 381 of the 500 companies in
the S&AMP;P 500 having reported their earnings for the first quarter of
1998, the average year-to-year growth rate was a meager 3.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   So what could possibly be left of the ``This time it's
different'' case? The case now rests almost completely on continued
low inflation and continued declines in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Steve Slifer, chief U.S. economist for Lehman
Brothers, believes that the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond will
fall to 5.25 percent in 1998 from about 6 percent now and then dip
even lower, to 5 percent, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation remains under control and bond yields fall, stock
prices will rise. In interest rates fall, the yield on the S&AMP;P 500
won't look quite so piddling.
</P>
<P>
   Slower earnings growth will be less of a problem, too, since
investors will compare any increase with the decline in bond
yields. A lower inflation rate will also make each dollar of
earnings more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   In short, equities will become an even more attractive
alternative to bonds and other types of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Delightful to ponder, but just how likely is that? After all,
interest rates have already dropped awfully low, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury was 7.1 percent in April 1997.
The April 1998 rate of 6 percent represents a 15 percent drop in
one year. Isn't it just wishful thinking to imagine that interest
rates will fall another 17 percent by the end of 1999?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, if you look at real interest rates instead of the
nominal figures that everybody follows. The real interest rate
takes inflation into account _ it's what the interest from a bond
or other interest-paying asset is actually worth after you subtract
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of April, for example, the nominal interest rate on a
30-year Treasury bond was 6 percent. The real rate was 6 percent
minus the current inflation rate of 1.4 percent, or 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates have actually climbed during the market's
recent seven-and-a-half-year expansion. In October 1990, the long
bond yielded almost 9 percent. But with inflation for the year at a
little over 6 percent, the real yield was just under 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive as the fall in interest rates has been since 1990
(from 9 percent to 6 percent), the decline in inflation has been
even steeper (from 6.1 percent to the current 1.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Real interest rates, consequently, haven't fallen at all.
They've actually risen, to 4.6 percent from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The high level of real rates, argues the ``This time it's
different'' crowd, is a result of scars from the horrendous
inflation of the 1970s and 1980s. Prices rose at an annual rate of
6.3 percent from 1971 to the end of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Once investors finally admit that inflation is under control for
the foreseeable future, real interest rates and thus nominal rates
will fall. Getting to a 5 percent nominal yield on the 30-year bond
is easy if inflation stays at 1.4 percent and the real rate falls
to a still-hefty 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another way to interpret the stubbornly
high real rate of interest. Investors may be justifiably skeptical
about the death of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in 30-year bonds may be demanding a 4.6 percent real
yield because they believe that the Federal Reserve won't hold the
line, that Congress won't be able to resist spending its way back
into deficit, that the current collapse of global inflation is a
temporary respite before Asian consumers renew their demand for
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run investors ignore those arguments at their
peril. But these dangers don't look capable of derailing the ``This
time it's different'' case in the short run _ for the rest of 1998
and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office is now projecting just an $8
billion surplus for the fiscal year ending in October _ a small
enough margin to discourage Congress from letting loose its most
expansive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is perched on the verge of another and deeper recession.
That will slow Asia's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is unlikely to tighten dramatically.
Chairman Alan Greenspan knows that increasing U.S. interest rates
will create bigger problems in Asia, and he vividly remembers the
last time the Federal Reserve set off a financial panic.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the ``This time it's different'' crowd still seems
to be betting the winning hand. In that way, at least, this time
it's the same. &QL;

   What a great time to be selling a house. Buyers are manic over
low interest rates. The new tax law lets sellers pocket up to
$500,000 in tax-free gains.
</P>
<P>
   But you're hardly the only seller on the block, so your chalet
could probably use, say, a grand's worth of attention. You'll
recoup the investment many times over when your house sells faster,
at the price it's really worth.
</P>
<P>
   Have a trusted friend walk through the property and point out
everything that's wrong, says Diane Shrewsberry, a real-estate
agent with Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   It'll hurt, but it's important, because you've stopped noticing
the tear in the screen, the lock that sticks, and the, uh, aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Take a walk yourself through a few builders' models, then steal
ideas, says Michael Holigan, host of the television series ``Your
New House.'' If white interiors are the rage now and you've got
busy wallpaper, start painting.
</P>
<P>
   Many buyers drive up to a house then refuse to go in because
something minor about the exterior turns them off, says
Shrewsberry.
</P>
<P>
   A new mailbox is an inexpensive way to make a good first
impression. So is a new welcome mat or even a new front door (or a
coat of paint on the old one.)
</P>
<P>
   Some more tips:
</P>
<P>
   Unclog the driveway. If your cars don't fit in the garage, park
in the street, says Ralph Roberts of Ralph R. Roberts Real Estate
in Detroit, Mich. Keep the garage door closed and trash cans out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape. Plant whatever should be blossoming that time of
year, says Daryl Jesperson, president of RE/MAX International in
Denver, Colo. De-landscape, too: Overgrown trees make a house look
small; overgrown bushes block light.
</P>
<P>
   For indoor improvements, concentrate on the kitchen and master
bath, ``where people picture they'll spend most of their time,''
says Holigan. Essential: Wallpaper bathrooms. Re-caulk around tubs
(yellow caulk shows sales). Hang new shower-curtain liners.
</P>
<P>
   Think bright. Install higher-watt bulbs in low-light areas, like
closets. Make sure every single bulb in the house works. ``It's
quite a blooper when the lights don't come on,'' says Holigan.
</P>
<P>
   Simplify. Clear kitchen counters. De-junk closets, drawers and
medicine cabinets. If the space doesn't look big enough for your
stuff, it won't look big enough for theirs, says Jesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rely on a realtor to provide info on schools in your area,
says Holigan. Leave information packets from local schools on your
kitchen counter, with your name, address, and phone number on top.
</P>
<P>
   Create a packet about your house, too, says Roberts. Have a
mortgage broker write out the cost of buying your home with various
percentages down. A buyer who might have considered the place too
expensive could realize that it is within range.
</P>
<P>
   By including the amounts of your monthly tax and utility bills,
you'll make buyers suspicious of homeowners who don't.
</P>
<P>
   A final caution: Once you've restored the house to its original
glory, be prepared to start wondering why you're moving out in the
first place. &QL;

   What a great time to be selling a house. Buyers are manic over
low interest rates. The new tax law lets sellers pocket up to
$500,000 in tax-free gains.
</P>
<P>
   But you're hardly the only seller on the block, so your chalet
could probably use, say, a grand's worth of attention. You'll
recoup the investment many times over when your house sells faster,
at the price it's really worth.
</P>
<P>
   Have a trusted friend walk through the property and point out
everything that's wrong, says Diane Shrewsberry, a real-estate
agent with Coldwell Banker.
</P>
<P>
   It'll hurt, but it's important, because you've stopped noticing
the tear in the screen, the lock that sticks, and the, uh, aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Take a walk yourself through a few builders' models, then steal
ideas, says Michael Holigan, host of the television series ``Your
New House.'' If white interiors are the rage now and you've got
busy wallpaper, start painting.
</P>
<P>
   Many buyers drive up to a house then refuse to go in because
something minor about the exterior turns them off, says
Shrewsberry.
</P>
<P>
   A new mailbox is an inexpensive way to make a good first
impression. So is a new welcome mat or even a new front door (or a
coat of paint on the old one.)
</P>
<P>
   Some more tips:
</P>
<P>
   Unclog the driveway. If your cars don't fit in the garage, park
in the street, says Ralph Roberts of Ralph R. Roberts Real Estate
in Detroit, Mich. Keep the garage door closed and trash cans out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Landscape. Plant whatever should be blossoming that time of
year, says Daryl Jesperson, president of RE/MAX International in
Denver, Colo. De-landscape, too: Overgrown trees make a house look
small; overgrown bushes block light.
</P>
<P>
   For indoor improvements, concentrate on the kitchen and master
bath, ``where people picture they'll spend most of their time,''
says Holigan. Essential: Wallpaper bathrooms. Re-caulk around tubs
(yellow caulk shows sales). Hang new shower-curtain liners.
</P>
<P>
   Think bright. Install higher-watt bulbs in low-light areas, like
closets. Make sure every single bulb in the house works. ``It's
quite a blooper when the lights don't come on,'' says Holigan.
</P>
<P>
   Simplify. Clear kitchen counters. De-junk closets, drawers and
medicine cabinets. If the space doesn't look big enough for your
stuff, it won't look big enough for theirs, says Jesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rely on a realtor to provide info on schools in your area,
says Holigan. Leave information packets from local schools on your
kitchen counter, with your name, address, and phone number on top.
</P>
<P>
   Create a packet about your house, too, says Roberts. Have a
mortgage broker write out the cost of buying your home with various
percentages down. A buyer who might have considered the place too
expensive could realize that it is within range.
</P>
<P>
   By including the amounts of your monthly tax and utility bills,
you'll make buyers suspicious of homeowners who don't.
</P>

first place. &QL;

MCDOUGAL SEEKS TO POSTPONE EMBEZZLEMENT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA JR .    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The lawyer for Susan McDougal has asked a
California state court judge to postpone her embezzlement trial,
which was scheduled to begin on Monday, after he received 1,500
pages of new evidence from prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal is charged with bilking the conductor Zubin Mehta
and his wife, Nancy, out of $150,000 between 1989 and 1992, when
Mrs. McDougal worked as their assistant and bookkeeper. Although
these charges have no connection to the Whitewater case, Mrs.
McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said he believes the California
state prosecutors are cooperating with Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic example of the office of the independent
counsel using this California prosecution to put further pressure
on my client,'' Geragos said.
</P>
<P>
   For refusing to answer questions about the Whitewater case, Mrs.
McDougal served 18 months in jail on a civil contempt of court
citation, and she has steadfastly refused to cooperate with Starr's
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Geragos said that the new California evidence, which he
described as ``a desk full of sophisticated accounting records and
ledgers,'' was delivered to his office on June 26, one day after
Mrs. McDougal was unexpectedly released from a California prison
for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hardly think it was a coincidence,'' Geragos said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, the spokesman for Starr, did not return
telephone calls on Saturday. The California prosecutor, Jeffrey
Semow, also did not return calls last weekend, but he has
repeatedly denied that he had colluded with Starr, saying he had no
idea who Susan McDougal was when she was arraigned in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Mrs. McDougal pleaded not guilty to grand theft,
check forgery and fraudulent use of credit cards, among other
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of the state case is the Mehtas' financial records,
which show several transactions in which Mrs. McDougal is accused
of making unauthorized personal purchases and charging them to her
employers. The records show that she charged hotel stays, clothes
and thousands of dollars of personal air travel, according to a
financial audit conducted by the Mehtas' accountant, Alan Byron,
who testified at Mrs. McDougal's preliminary hearing in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since a federal judge ordered her released from a California
prison on June 25, Mrs. McDougal has stayed at her parents' home in
Camden, Ark., as part of a 90-day home-detention sentence. When she
was released, she had served three and a half months of a two-year
prison sentence after she was found guilty of taking part in a
fraudulent scheme to obtain a $300,000 loan that was paid to a
company she created called Master Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the proceeds went to pay the debts of Whitewater
Development Co. in which she and her late husband, James McDougal,
were partners with President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Geragos said he needed two weeks to study the new evidence
before he would be ready to go to trial. Mrs. McDougal is also
scheduled to undergo medical tests on Monday for a severe spinal
condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's in pretty bad shape, but she's also in good spirits,''
Geragos said. ``The irony of this delay is, she can't wait to go to
trial.''

METS 5, EXPOS 2 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets' only constants for most of this season have
been starting pitching and defense. It would be foolish to argue
that Todd Hundley's long-awaited arrival could have had any effect
on the struggling bullpen Sunday, but his presence in the lineup
seems to have produced positive results already.
</P>
<P>
   So, in Hundley's second game back, the Mets put together one of
their most complete performances in quite some time en route to a
5-2 victory over the Montreal Expos at sold-out Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There was an ``effectively wild'' outing, as catcher Mike Piazza
put it, from Hideo Nomo, who struggled with his command more than
his back in tying his career high with seven walks, but allowed
just two hits and two runs in five and a third innings. Nomo said
he was not bothered by the lower back strain that forced him out of
his last start, July 1 in Toronto, after just three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who admitted he had been pressing with men on base,
delivered a run-scoring single in the first inning and gave much of
the credit to Hundley, who was hitting behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McRae's sixth home run in the last 17 games, a two-run
blast in the sixth, erased a 2-1 deficit and put the Mets (46-41)
ahead for good. Butch Huskey tied his career high with four hits
and scored two runs. And the Mets got their first strong outing
from the bullpen in weeks. Jeff Tam (who picked up his first major
league victory), Greg McMichael (whose return from the Dodgers
seems to have solidified the bullpen) and Dennis Cook (who struck
out the side in the ninth) provided three and two-thirds innings of
hitless relief.
</P>
<P>
   All of which added up to the Mets' second straight victory after
losing nine of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley went 0 for 2 with a walk and a strikeout before
departing for a pinch-hitter in the seventh with the Mets still
holding a 3-2 lead. Afterward, the converted catcher expressed
relief at finally being able to catch a couple of balls in left
field. Other than that, Hundley's contributions have been mostly
psychological thus far. But after more than a month of struggles,
maybe that is what the Mets needed most.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's meant everything,'' manager Bobby Valentine said of
Hundley's return from elbow surgery. ``The guys are feeling
confident. I feel confident. All the waiting is over. All the talk
about what happens when he gets here is over. Everyone has seen
what happens. We relax and play a good game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The most calming effect may eventually be on Piazza. Despite a
.345 batting average in his first 39 games with the Mets, coming
into Sunday, Piazza was hitting just .206 (7 for 34) with runners
in scoring position, with one home run and seven runs batted in.
Part of the problem, he said, was that he usually had men in
scoring position once a game at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I would get a guy in scoring position, it almost felt
like Little League,'' Piazza said. ``If you don't get him in, you
don't know when your next chance is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Hundley batting behind him, it takes some of the
pressure off. There was a reason why Piazza saw a 1-2 fastball from
the rookie right-hander Javier Vazquez (3-7) with Lenny Harris on
third and one out in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it,'' said Piazza, who lined that pitch to
left for a run-scoring single. ``He's a potent hitter. If you get
by me, you've got to get by him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   What Hundley provides, Piazza argued, is more balance to a
lineup that has gone through what Piazza called its offensive
``peaks and valleys.'' Just as Piazza's initial insertion into the
lineup seemed to relax the rest of the Mets after his May 22 trade
here, so has Hundley's the last two days. And maybe even a little
before, because of the new competition for playing time in the
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Both Huskey and McRae _ and even Bernard Gilkey, to a lesser
extent _ have been hitting better as of late. Huskey is 8 for 13
(.615) since the All-Star Game break. McRae, who now has 12 home
runs, quietly leads the team in extra-base hits with 32 _ one more
than Piazza has with three teams this season _ despite a .239
batting average.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Mets continue to get that kind of production behind
Piazza and Hundley, and should McMichael help right the bullpen now
that he is back in the right-handed set-up man role, the Mets
actually may be able to put their month-plus troubles behind them.
</P>
<P>
   If the last two days mean anything, that is.

EAGERNESS ON BOTH SIDES IN LATEST TOBACCO TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Colo., N.Y., Calif., N.C., Miss., S.C.)  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the recent talks aimed at reaching a new tobacco settlement,
the best clues to strategy were probably found in the five state
attorneys general with whom the tobacco industry chose to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   To cinch a new deal with the 37 states that have remaining
lawsuits, cigarette makers need, at a minimum, to get participation
from the biggest states and from those most eager to settle, and
also bring in some political figures who had participated in last
year's talks.
</P>
<P>
   So, not surprisingly, among the five attorneys general at the
recent talks was Christine Gregoire of Washington, the state with
the next case scheduled to go to trial and one that is considered
weak.
</P>
<P>
   Also present were attorneys general of Colorado and of the
nation's two largest states, New York and California. And although
his state has not sued the industry, Mike Easley of North Carolina
participated as well. He was heavily involved in negotiations that
led to last year's $368.5 billion proposed settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Most state attorneys general had celebrated the completion of
that agreement, believing that they could play a central role in
altering how cigarettes are marketed and sold. But with the
collapse of that plan in Congress, the goals of those same
officials these days are far more limited, practical and political.
</P>
<P>
   Under last year's plan, tobacco companies agreed not only to
reimburse the states for billions of dollars spent treating
tobacco-related ills, but also to allow the government to regulate
nicotine and pay penalties if youth smoking did not decline. A new
proposal under negotiation would still reimburse the states and
lead to some marketing restrictions but would not involve many of
the sweeping aspects of the previous accord, like nicotine
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The new talks, aimed at resolving the 37 state claims, which
lawyers said involved an industry proposal worth about $200 billion
over 25 years, broke down last week over money. But as state
attorneys general gather Monday outside Durango, Colo., for their
annual meeting, they will hear more details about where the talks
are headed.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those involved in the tobacco debate said they believe
that many state officials, after having their previous plan
rebuffed by Congress, are eager to accept a scaled-back settlement
rather than risk lengthy court fights with tobacco producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame these states for wanting to strike a deal,''
said Matthew Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
Kids, an advocacy group in Washington. ``They have their lawsuits
and they have every right to try to resolve them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a desire that has not escaped the cigarette industry,
which views the state lawsuits as the most politically troublesome
and potentially costly claims it faces.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the industry's position say that producers
are eager to settle as many state claims as they can, a strategy
apparently reflected in their approach to the recent talks. With
settlements in hand already with two big states, Florida and Texas,
including New York and California in the new negotiations would
ensure that a large portion of the nation's population would be
covered by settlements.
</P>
<P>
   And company lawyers were careful to talk only with those lawyers
or states that were eager to settle, said consultants familiar with
the industry's strategy. For example, one of those who participated
in the latest talks was Attorney General Gail Norton of Colorado,
who filed her lawsuit just two weeks before last year's settlement
deal was achieved and lobbied Congress to accept the deal. Her
office declined to comment on the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies, said one lawyer who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, ``wanted to do an end run around those
states where they would not get a receptive ear.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also little question that cigarette industry
negotiators are dealing with a different cast of state officials
this time, a group that may be less organized and more dispirited.
Key state leaders like Michael Moore, the Mississippi attorney
general who helped develop last year's accord, and Hubert Humphrey
III, the Minnesota attorney general, who pushed producers into
greater concessions, have settled their cases and are no longer
directly involved.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable groups were not represented at the talks. White
House officials, who were consulted last year, were kept in the
dark. In response to the new initiative, administration officials
circulated a memorandum on Friday indicating that they would press
for narrower tobacco legislation that would give the Food and Drug
Administration regulatory authority over the product.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Myers, the anti-smoking advocate who participated in last
year's talks, said he knew nothing about the discussions. And
Richard Scruggs, a plaintiffs' lawyer from Pascagoula, Miss., and
another architect of last year's deal, said he had not been told
about the new talks, even though he represents 26 states with cases
pending against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Scruggs can thank another plaintiffs' lawyer, Joe Rice of
Charleston, S.C. Rice, who also helped negotiate last year's
accord, represents the same states as Scruggs and was a central
player in the latest round of talks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who initially denied that such talks were under way, has
declined all comment. But lawyers familiar with tobacco
negotiations said cigarette producers reached out to him recently
because he is eager to settle his cases.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to restart tobacco talks presented itself last
month after a court ordered that cigarette lawyers and the
Washington state attorney general, Ms. Gregoire, hold mediation
talks aimed at resolving that state's tobacco lawsuit, which is
scheduled to go to trial in September.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire's case is believed by many legal experts to be
relatively weak, because a state judge has knocked out some of its
central claims. And tobacco lawyers apparently seized on the
possible legal calamity facing Ms. Gregoire by intimating to her
that they would settle her case only if other states were brought
into broader talks, said lawyers familiar with the discussions.
``They wanted to use her as leverage,'' one of those lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ms. Gregoire said she believed her case was
strong. Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco companies,
denied that they had brought any pressure on Ms. Gregoire.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the talks soon broadened, bringing in state
attorneys general like Dan Lungren of California and Dennis Vacco
of New York. While these states are critical because of their size,
the political fate of both men may also be affected by the role
tobacco plays in campaigns this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It has already become an issue in Lungren's bid to become
governor. He has come under sharp attack by both Gray Davis, his
Democratic opponent, and anti-tobacco groups for, among other
things, being slow in suing tobacco producers.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren was the 37th of the nation's 41 state attorneys general
to sue the industry, filing just eight days before the $368.5
billion plan was finalized last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``His record on tobacco is terrible,'' said Stanton Glantz, a
professor at the University of California at San Francisco and an
anti-tobacco advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Stutzman, a spokesman for Lungren, said the California
official believed that his record on tobacco was strong and that
the state's lawsuit had been delayed because the
Democrat-controlled Legislature had passed a bill several years ago
making it difficult for the state to bring a successful case
against cigarette makers. As a result, Lungren had to wait for the
Legislature to repeal the bill before filing his action, Stutzman
said.
</P>
<P>
   While Vacco of New York, who is running for re-election, did
file his lawsuit several months before settlement talks started
last year, he also had come under criticism for, among other
things, hiring lawyers who were also political contributors to
represent the state. Vacco's press office did not return telephone
calls on Friday but he has previously denied any connection between
the contributions and the hiring of the lawyers.

   &UR;  &LR; SAINT-DENIS, France _ The French national team now has a World
Cup trophy to go with its Legion of Honor medals. The Brazilians,
meanwhile, might find joining the French Foreign Legion a safer
alternative than returning home.
</P>
<P>
   France dominated Sunday's championship game, taking a 3-0
victory against an uninspired Brazil team, which offered its least
competitive performance in a final ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to win, we have been working for two years for
that and we fully deserved it,'' France coach Aime Jacquet said.
``We all had the same feeling, we were on the same wavelength. We
started off with poor press, and I can never forgive that, but now
everyone can see France has great players.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest of them was Zinedine Zidane, who headed in two
corner kicks in the first half, and accepted the winner's medals
from President Jacques Chirac as most of the 80,000 fans chanted
``Zizou'' amid waving France tricolor flags.
</P>
<P>
   The French became the seventh nation to capture the title, which
has been an exclusive club of Argentina, Brazil, Germany, and Italy
in the last 30 years. They maintained the tradition of European
teams winning on their continent, broken only by Brazil in 1958 in
Sweden. They also became the first home team to win the title since
Argentina in 1978 and tied for the biggest rout in the final game
with Brazil's wins over Sweden (5-2) in 1958 and Italy (4-1) in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   France offered little in the way of creative, scintillating
offense throughout the tournament, and Jacquet was criticized
heavily for his midfield-clogging, spoiling tactics. But the
players became comfortable with their identity, submerging their
urges toward an aesthetically-pleasing style to settle for
capitalizing on opponents' errors.
</P>
<P>
   And the French certainly became adept at making the opposition
pay for lack of concentration.
</P>
<P>
   There were many Brazilian failures, mostly sins of omission.
They were not proactive enough to cause problems or to put the
French defensive midfielders on their heels. Brazil's
uncharacteristic predictability allowed France to dominate the
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Brazil's problem was that Ronaldo was playing at half
speed because of leg problems. In fact, the original starting
lineup had Ronaldo on the bench and Edmundo starting, but when
coach Mario Zagallo was in the midst of explaining the situation,
he had an argument with Brazilian journalists and left the
interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was entirely dominated by France,'' Zagallo
said. ``I was cheering for the first half to end so that we could
change the style of play. France had two attacks and we had two in
the first half, and they scored on both of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   France barely had to form an offensive strategy, except to blast
some speculative long balls toward Stephane Guivarc'h.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil also was guilty of sins of commission.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Carlos, whose mistakes helped lead to goals for Denmark
and the Netherlands, again botched a clearance, giving France a
corner in the 28th minute. Instead of simply sending the ball out,
Roberto Carlos took it to the end line and attempted a bicycle
kick. He protested the linesman's ruling by grabbing the corner
flag. But that did not alter the decision, and France capitalized
as Zidane outmaneuvered Leonardo to head in Emmanuel Petit's
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane headed in another in the 46th minute, this time on a low
corner from Youri Djorkaeff. Again, the opportunity was set up by a
defensive error, this time as Junior Baiano misjudged what seemed
to be an unthreatening lofted pass from Lilian Thuram. Guivarc'h
took advantage to go in alone on Claudio Taffarel, who deflected
his low, left-footed shot for a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo had little impact on the game after a 31st-minute
collision with goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. He sent his best shot, in
the opening minutes of the second half, directly into Barthez's
hands from a difficult angle in the goal area.
</P>
<P>
   Even before that, though, Brazil seldom attacked, seldom
pressured the French defense. The result was that France was able
to settle in to a comfortable pace, and Brazil was unable change
gears until after halftime, when Denilson entered the match.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that France was able to dictate tempo and pressure the
Brazilians with a one-forward alignment indicates the Brazilians'
lack of preparation. This was a game that favored the aggressor,
and France was much more assertive.
</P>
<P>
   This was shown by Marcel Desailly, who was ejected midway
through the second half after earning a second caution. The French,
also missing suspended central defender Laurent Blanc, were
sometimes reckless in tackling, but received the benefit of the
doubt.

   I work in the publicity department of a publishing house
specializing in illustrated books, and we receive many requests for
free review copies.
</P>
<P>
   Recently we received a letter from an inmate requesting a book
for the prison library. Apparently, he had been sentenced to 10
years and enjoyed drawing.
</P>
<P>
   While debating the cost of humanitarianism against sending an
expensive book to a prisoner, a co-worker from another department,
who had been listening to the discussion, asked, ``What's he in
for?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a cat burglar,'' I replied.
</P>
<P>
   Her face darkened, and she blurted, ``Don't send it to him; he's
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you know?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get 10 years for stealing cats,'' she said.

   Kenneth Berman was taken to Winfield's Restaurant in Greenwich,

   As the party was seated, he noticed a printed, filled-in form on
the table:

   The young man walking near Arlene Cohen in Central Park
observed, with a somewhat jaundiced eye, a woman jogging by. He

   I was riding the subway recently and noticed the following
advertising placard placed by the New York City Board of Education
for a teacher recruitment program: ``Our schools need certified
bilingual professionals qualified in the areas of'' _ and it then
proceeded to list a number of educational areas.
</P>
<P>
   Six out of 10, including English as a second language, had a
little star next to them. At the bottom, there was a note stating
that the star meant ``Qualified applicants need not be bilingual.''

   Scene: A recent evening at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. Anne
Ritchie and other tired passengers waiting out a two-hour delay for
a flight to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Next gate: More tired passengers waiting out a delayed flight to
St. Louis. The St. Louis flight announcement rings out _ they will
be boarding in 10 minutes. Applause, laughter, cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the New York flight is announced, boarding in 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A lone voice cuts the silence. ``So, they want we should jump
for joy?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ritchie knew then that she was almost home.

   Gene Marks was sitting near the front of a downtown Lexington
Avenue bus when a woman, obviously in a hurry, managed to get on
the lower step and prevent the door from closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this an express?'' she gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the driver replied.
</P>
<P>
   She remained on the step, pondering her predicament aloud:
Should she board the bus or wait for a limited? The passengers
became impatient.

   Finally, she stepped up and, as she deposited her fare, said to
the driver, ``Well, will you drive fast?''

   There was a line at a bank on Madison Avenue, and waiting his
turn was a man holding the hand of his daughter.

   The girl, who appeared to be about 5 or 6 years old, looked
around and asked, ``What is this place?'' Her father explained that
it was a bank. ``What is a bank?'' was the next question.

<P>
   ``That's right, you've never been in a bank before,'' he
replied. ``A bank is what they had before there were money
machines.''

   Dear Diary:

<P>
   For the last three summers, our family, former New Yorkers, have
spent a week on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Our
daughter-in-law, Betsy Nicholas, loves to try out new recipes and
one, for yellow-fin tuna, called for a marinade using wasabi, the
Japanese herb. Our son, Paul Kessler, drove to the local
supermarket to search for it. After three unsuccessful attempts, he
found a cheerful clerk near the spice department and tried again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where can I find wasabi?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the clerk replied, ``I don't live around
here.''

steaks were delicious.

her friends walked along West Broadway toward Battery Park. Along
the way, they noticed a commotion at the corner _ four police
officers were crowded around a police cruiser. A small crowd had
gathered and Ms. Druck and friends thought perhaps a suspect was
being arrested. As they got closer, they realized that the only
suspects were the keys to the police car, which had been locked
inside.

   Robert Adams was walking behind two women, and as they were
about to pass the Methodist Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew at
86th Street and West End Avenue, they noticed a discarded pair of
new-looking crutches in the gutter.

   One of the women paused, pointed toward the church and said
``Well, they seem to be getting results.''

tied with red bows.

   A little girl approached the dog's owner and asked if she might

FRANCE CLAIMS CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ The French have a word for it _
incroyable. Les Bleus, who've always been failure's poster boys,
soccer's new world champions? Incroyable. Unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   Zizou and Lolo and Thuthu and the rest of their blue-shirted
playmates had to grab the golden trophy Sunday night, shake it over
their heads, kiss it, and tell each other, incroyable or not, that
it was true. France had beaten Brazil, 3-0, in the World Cup final
in the Stade de France, touching off the most exuberant celebration
in this country since, well, last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, wearing a bleu-blanc-rouge muffler
around his suit collar, jumped up and down like a giddy schoolboy.
Zinedine Zidane, who knocked in the first two goals with his
balding pate, embraced captain Didier Deschamps forehead to
forehead. Fabien Barthez, the black-garbed goalkeeper with the
shaved head and goatee, went to his knees, buried his face in his
hands, and wept. While the Brazilians stood in disbelief, hands on
hips, the French danced and hugged and agreed that this was indeed
incroyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here to win,'' French coach Aime Jacquet declared.
``We were not going to be satisfied just being in the final.'' Yet
nobody expected this. Not beating the world champions by three
goals. Not shutting them out despite playing a man short for the
final 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Les Bleus, who hadn't even qualified for the last two Cups, had
made history just by reaching the final. ``We aren't expected to
win,'' Deschamps had conceded. ``A victory would be a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   What even the players hadn't counted on, though, was the
groundswell of passion and patriotism that had been building from
Normandy to Languedoc for weeks and which pushed them beyond
themselves. France never has been a soccer country, possibly
because Les Bleus always have been fortune's fools, always defeated
in the big match, always decu, disappointed, and disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   But once France beat the Italians in a nerve-wracking
penalty-kick shootout and the Germans (their nemesis since 1870 or
so) were upset by the Croatians, everyone began talking about le
reve _ the dream. ``Even I am beginning to dream,'' admitted
Chirac, the cheerleader in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, everybody was sporting a blue jersey and a tricolor
face and shouting ``Allez les Bleus'' and forgetting history.
France was ready for a wild summer fling with its soccer team,
broken heart be damned.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours before the match, thousands of fans without tickets
took the Metro out to this northern working-class suburb, just to
mill around the stadium and come away with a taste. Then they went
back to Paris, to watch the match on the five giant screens that
had been set up across the city.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Stade, there was _ sacre bleu! _ a pep band playing
in the upper deck. And as soon as they stepped onto the floor of
this 80,000-seat flying saucer, Les Bleus were swept up and carried
off on a rolling wave of drums and noise and singing that never
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``On va gagner'' (We're going to win), their fans chirped, and
when Zidane scored on a header off a corner kick _ his first goal
of the tournament _ they began believing it. Then Zidane scored on
another just before the half and le jour de gloire was at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tous ensemble, tous ensemble, oui, oui'' was the chant. All
together, all together, yes, yes. What Les Bleus had done was bring
a fractious France together. They are black and white, born in
Paris and Lyon and Bordeaux and in Guadeloupe, in Senegal and
Ghana. Zidane, the beloved Zizou, is the son of Algerian immigrants
who grew up in a poor neighborhood in Marseille.
</P>
<P>
   All together, they had brought La France to the brink of
something magnifique and La France had fallen in love with them.
``We have this wonderful rapport with the country,'' Jacquet said.
``We have the whole country behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   When Marcel Desailly was sent off in the 68th minute and Les
Bleus had to play 10-on-11, tens of thousands of throats boomed out
``La Marseillaise'' again and again, urging Zizou and his copains
to keep running on tired legs. Finally here came Emmanuel Petit,
the squad's ponytailed bad boy, on a mad dash upfield, screaming
for the ball as the referee was looking at his watch, craving _ and
scoring _ a delightfully unnecessary third goal.
</P>
<P>
   That was the beau geste that capped the wild summer fling, that
got Chirac flinging up his arms in a victory salute and Michel
Platini, the organizing committee chief, pumping his fists in glee.
Platini was the star of the 1982 and 1986 teams that were stopped
just short of the final. Sunday night, for luck and solidarity, he
wore his old blue jersey beneath his blazer.
</P>
<P>
   When the weeping and the dancing and the hugging was done, Les
Bleus came up one by one, Zizou and Lolo and Thuthu and the rest,
to shake hands with Monsieur le President, to get their gold medals
and to grasp the trophy with both hands to make sure that le reve
was real.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the Pantheon, just before midnight, Voltaire nudged
Zola. ``Champion du Monde? Incroyable, n'est-ce pas?''

TINA BROWN EDITS HER CAREER TO MATCH THE ZEITGEIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs to clarify positions of Newhouse and Florio in 4th
graf.)  
(lh) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER with GERALDINE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of all the documents that passed over Tina Brown's
desk in June, two received particular attention. One was the
proposed five-year contract that would ensure she remained The New
Yorker's editor through mid-2003. The other was Brill's Content,
the ballyhooed new magazine about the press.
</P>
<P>
   The contract was an invitation to continue to edit the magazine
whose words had set it apart as an intellectual arbiter and whose
balance sheet _ over which she had little control _ had set it
apart as a financial sinkhole. Brill's Content was proof that
alternatives existed, that a high-profile editor with well-endowed
backers could create a magazine with instant impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sort of intrigued by the Brill label and the things he
had been able to do,'' Ms. Brown said in an interview. ``They did
give me additional impetus'' to think about alternatives. And
Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of the film production company
Miramax, was aggressively seeking to enlist her to create a
magazine and a company, which she would partly own.
</P>
<P>
   At Conde Nast, she remained close to S.I. Newhouse Jr., chairman
and chief executive of Advance Publications, of which Conde Nast is
a unit, but her influence no longer matched her ambitions. To the
outside world, The New Yorker's editor was winning the
public-relations battle with Conde Nast's chief executive, Steven
T. Florio, over who deserved the blame for The New Yorker's
financial woes. But within the company, Florio increasingly got his
way. She did not, and she felt vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   And Weinstein wanted her to do something she had never done, to
shape a magazine _ ``put down the editorial DNA,'' in Ms. Brown's
phrase. She would be both an owner and a participant in the profits
of the individual films or books spun off from the magazine
articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why be the owned star, if you can be the star owner?'' asked
Stephen Schiff, a screenwriter who is a friend of the editor.
</P>
<P>
   That may be an easier question to answer than the questions of
the entertainment executives who admire Ms. Brown, but do not
admire magazines. Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom Inc.,
said: ``Entertainment companies are moving away from print. They
are simply not that interested.'' But he added that if anyone could
pull off such a venture, it would be Tina Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Others who attended this weekend's annual Sun Valley meeting of
media company executives asked what good ownership is, when quality
magazines can cost $10 million, $20 million, $30 million or more to
start and often lose money for five years.
</P>
<P>
   And among journalists, eyebrows were raised about the up-front
effort to tie the fact-based craft of nonfiction to the
fantasy-based world of film. ``If the stated purpose of this is to
develop entertainment packages, that's not what journalism is,''
said Bill Kovach, the curator of the Nieman Foundation.
``Journalists survey the world to inform the citizen, not with the
idea of creating a property to entertain the citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of skepticism did not deter Ms. Brown, who said: ``I
certainly don't intend to ever compromise the journalistic
integrity of the magazine for an end game with Hollywood. If I did,
it would have a short life.''
</P>
<P>
   What she intends is to recreate the successes of her 20-year
editing career. At Tatler, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, she
constantly put new geist in the Zeitgeist. Last week, she edited
her career with the same instinct for emerging trends. Like Brill,
she is setting out to defy the odds that a new magazine will get
lost in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Like Geraldine B. Laybourne, the leading force in children's
television programming who left Walt Disney Co. and ABC last month,
Ms. Brown is leaving a large corporation to work for herself.
(Although it is also true that Ms. Brown's new company, as a unit
of Miramax, will ultimately fall under the large corporate umbrella
of Walt Disney Co.)
</P>
<P>
   Like Martha Stewart, the multimedia arbiter of all things
tasteful, Ms. Brown and her partners hope to make a magazine the
core of a lucrative empire encompassing books, movies and
television productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been an editor in chief for 20 years,'' Ms. Brown said.
``If a job was what I was going to be doing, this was the best job
in the world. But I had reached the point in my life when I wanted
to do more than a job.'' She added: ``Just thinking about this
week's magazine, fun and exciting as it was, wasn't enough to keep
me intellectually challenged. I wanted to grow in a more lateral
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, whose resume contains little in the way of financial
background, sought out Ron Galotti, the publisher of Vogue, to talk
to Weinstein. ``I said I really need to have a business partner
with me to ascertain that this isn't just high-concept without
having its feet in nitty-gritty land,'' she said. In the end,
Galotti decided to join her as a part owner of the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that was so unique about this was that it made sense
right away,'' he said. ``It's not some far-fetched idea that
required exaggerated thinking. You create a high-quality magazine
and give young writers a place to start. Tina has the sensibility
to do that more than anyone else. She has an instinct for it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``the editorial aspect of the magazine will have
no commercial overtone at all,'' and advertisers will not influence
the content of articles. But, he said, working for Miramax, a film
company with its own publishing arm, could give advertisers wider
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to one of the larger cosmetic companies,'' Galotti
said. ``They are looking to move our tentacles into the Hollywood
area.''
</P>
<P>
   A shot in a Miramax film, he said, could include such an
advertiser's products: ``I would immediately see a bathtub
surrounded by the Elizabeth Arden product or Clinique.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added, ``I think clients are looking for new
out-of-the-box ideas and ways to position products and brand their
concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the magazine might do an article on Italian
automobile executive Gianni Agnelli, while Miramax produced a
companion biography to run on the Arts &AMP; Entertainment cable
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was unfazed by business executives' predictions of
five years of losses before a magazine could be profitable. ``I
have never followed a traditional formula in my life, and I don't
believe in them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Galotti and Ms. Brown gave no details about the extent of their
ownership stake or the amount of backing Weinstein has committed to
the publication. Weinstein said only that Galotti and Ms. Brown
would have salaries and would participate in the profits from
individual films or books as well as have an ownership stake in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said in an interview that she and Weinstein ``have
been friends for some time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the kinds of movies he makes are the kind of
journalism we try to do,'' she said. ``He has this incredible gift
for making good things commercial. I found myself asking, surely
The New Yorker can't be harder to market than `The English
Patient?'''
</P>
<P>
   The remark underscored her continuing frustration at the
financial strategies employed by Conde Nast at The New Yorker.
Although she remains discreet about any direct criticism, dwelling
mostly on the closeness of her relationship with S.I. Newhouse Jr.,
her partisans on the staff of The New Yorker are scathing about
Steven Florio and dismissive of his brother, Thomas Florio, who
served as The New Yorker's president until last month.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to both Florios, Tom Florio asked his brother
for a new job, saying the presidency was far less attractive when
many of the management and production functions would be melded
into the larger Conde Nast structures. Steve Florio agreed and
suggested Tom Florio take over as publisher of Conde Nast Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown was not consulted about that move, nor about Tom
Florio's successor, David Carey. Though she repeatedly praises
Carey as ``a terrific hire,'' she also confided to friends that the
magazine would be in better financial shape if some of her
suggestions for increasing circulation revenue had been heeded a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker lost $11 million last year. But that loss masked
the steady improvement of the magazine's performance since 1993 _
when Steven Florio was the president and Tina Brown the incoming
editor. That year, it lost $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's failure to gain any authority over the business side
rankled, particularly when her name was juxtaposed with reports of
the magazine's financial losses. Her suggestions about tying The
New Yorker to new publishing or film ventures were also ignored,
although 20 of the magazine's pieces had been optioned for films
during her tenure, and at least as many were becoming books.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had made such a success editorially, and to have all the
business problems dragged across the papers and everything with it,
it was extremely dispiriting,'' said one of the magazine's editors,
speaking on condition of anonymity. At a dinner for her staff on
Thursday, Ms. Brown said, ``Sometimes in the last six months I have
felt so vulnerable and exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite this, and despite the increasing irritations
associated with the move into the new Conde Nast tower being built
in Times Square (staffers were constantly complaining about their
new accommodations, she confirmed), Ms. Brown had planned to sign
the contract as recently as mid-June, although she would have
preferred to have a shorter-term agreement.
</P>
<P>
   She never got around to asking for that, she said. Weinstein got
there first. As Ms. Brown tells it _ an account confirmed in
general by Weinstein _ he read about her coming contract renewal,
and he reminded her of conversations they had had months before
about the prospects for a new magazine. Then, feeling she had not
taken him seriously, he called her agent, attorney Morton Janklow,
during the last week of June.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown heard him out, but had other worries. Her mother, who
had been suffering from cancer for about a year, was fading
rapidly. Telling Janklow to work out some details with Weinstein,
she spent her time with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother died on June 30. Five days later Ms. Brown called
Weinstein and asked him to meet with her and Galotti in New York.
``The Monday after the Fourth of July, I surfaced after this
terrible five days,'' Ms. Brown said. ``I felt strangely strong at
the end of that experience. My head began to clear for the first
time in a long time, and I began to feel a tremendous desire to
have my motors raced.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday they met at her Manhattan brownstone and later at her
lawyer's office. The deal was completed after more than 40 hours of
discussions and contract drafting.
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 that morning, Ms. Brown called Newhouse and asked to
meet with him. She walked from The New Yorker's offices to Conde
Nast and told him of her resignation.
</P>
<P>
   A Conde Nast executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that there is a long list of possible candidates to succeed Ms.
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse has promised a selection by midweek. Among those on the
list, the executive said, were James Truman, the company's
editorial director; Peter Kaplan, the editor of The New York
Observer; David Remnick, a New Yorker writer, and Dominique
Browning, the editor of the Conde Nast magazine House &AMP; Garden.

<P>
   MIAMI _ Two years after the Bay of Pigs invasion ended in
ignominious failure on the beaches of Cuba, two young Cuban exiles
stood next to each other in the spring sun at Fort Benning, Ga.,
training for the next march on Havana.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1963, a time of feverish American plotting against Fidel
Castro's rule. The two men were among the exiles who had survived
the bungled operation to overthrow the Cuban leader and had
enlisted in the U.S. Army, confident that President Kennedy would
soon mount another attack that would banish communism from the
hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The orders never came, and both men soon quit the Army to begin
their own three-decade war against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Mas Canosa, the younger of the two, emerged as the public
face of the movement, a successful businessman who courted
presidents and politicians, raised money and relentlessly lobbied
the White House and Congress to get tough on Cuba. By the time Mas
died of cancer last November, after two decades of denying any
direct role in the military operations of exiles seeking to
destabilize Cuba, he had become perhaps the single most influential
voice in tightening America's official policy of economic and
political quarantine.
</P>
<P>
   The older man, Luis Posada Carriles, a former sugar chemist,
became a leader of the exiles' clandestine military wing, plotting
to kill Castro and planting bombs at Cuban government
installations. As Mas was building a personal fortune that
eventually exceeded $100 million, Posada remained in the shadows,
consorting with intelligence officers, anti-Castro militants and
even, declassified documents say, reputed mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he nears the end of his career as the most notorious
commando in the anti-Castro underground, Posada has for the first
time detailed his 37-year relationship with exile leaders in the
United States and with the American authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Supplemented by additional interviews and newly declassified
American intelligence reports, Posada's account is the most
detailed to date of the deadly underside of the campaign against
the Castro regime.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of taped interviews at his hideout in the Caribbean,
Posada was by turns proud, bawdy, boastful and evasive about his
work as a self-proclaimed freedom fighter, which included a series
of hotel bombings last year that plunged Cuba into tumult. He
described, sometimes selectively, the role of his sponsors in the
ostensibly nonviolent Cuban-American population, and his
complicated relationship with American officials who originally
trained him but now take a dimmer view of his activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA taught us everything _ everything,'' Posada said.
``They taught us explosives, how to kill, bomb, trained us in acts
of sabotage. When the Cubans were working for the CIA they were
called patriots. `Acciones de sabotaje' was the term they used to
classify this type of operation,'' he added, using the Spanish for
acts of sabotage. ``Now they call it terrorism. The times have
changed. We were betrayed because Americans think like Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why Posada, who has avoided interviews for most
of his career, has chosen to speak publicly. Last month, he agreed
through an intermediary to talk to a reporter, provided that the
location of the interview was described only as ``somewhere in the
Caribbean'' and that his current residences were not disclosed.
Posada, who has survived several assassination attempts, recently
told a close friend that he feared that he would not live long
enough to tell his version of events.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be photographed. At 70, he bears scant
resemblance to the last known photo of him, a 1976 snapshot that
shows a rugged man with a shock of black hair and a steely gaze.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Posada's hair is silvery gray, with dark patches.
His eyebrows, dense and unruly, slant diagonally over watchful
gray-green eyes. Age spots dot his hands and arms. A reputed
Casanova who says his companion of the last five years is more than
25 years his junior, Posada turns up for dinner in a crisply
pressed long-sleeved white linen guayabera, the traditional dress
shirt of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews, Posada often joked about his outlaw
activities. But there was also a wistful, almost melancholic tone
to the conversations with a man who has devoted his entire adult
life to a not-yet-realized goal that seems as elusive as ever.
Communism in Europe has vanished, but the 71-year old Castro is
still a true believer and still in power, with no signs that he is
losing his grip.
</P>
<P>
   No anti-communist opposition in the world has been more fervent
or as well financed as that of Cuban exiles living here. And yet,
as Posada made clear in the interviews, they have little to show
for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, the struggle between the aging leader and the
graying commandos who want to displace him seems geriatric, as out
of place in the late 1990s as the vintage American cars that still
cruise the streets of Havana. But as Posada emphasized, the hatred
of the men on the losing side of Castro's revolution has not been
dimmed by the passing of the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro will never change, never,'' he said, adding later,
``Our job is to provide inspiration and explosives to the Cuban
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a half-hour into the conversation, Posada yanked his
shirt over his head, displaying a torso ribboned with scars, the
legacy of an attempt on his life in Guatemala in 1990. Both his
arms showed holes where slugs had entered and exited; across his
upper left chest was a 10-inch gash where bullets had grazed his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me have your hand,'' he said, maneuvering a reporter's
wrist to the right side of his jaw, shattered by the same bullet
that damaged his tongue and nerves, leaving him with a crushed,
gravelly voice. ``One bullet entered here, and it exited on the
left side. My chin used to be an inch longer, very nice. I was very
handsome once.''

</P>
<P>
   Posada, who always carries a revolver with him and is described
in CIA files as an excellent marksman, blames Cuban operatives for
his maiming. But as he told the story of his life on the run and
his work for various anti-communist governments in the region, it
became clear that his decades of intrigue had left him with enemies
aplenty throughout the region, from the leftist guerrilla movements
of Venezuela, Nicaragua and El Salvador to the Guatemalan military,
whose officers he was spying on at the behest of the country's
president.
</P>
<P>
   A long period of recuperation followed the attack. But at 64, he
resumed his life's mission, doggedly determined to topple Castro.
``It's a war, a bad war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Early Years
</P>
<P>
   Luis Posada Carriles was born on Feb. 15, 1928, in the
then-elegant coastal city of Cienfuegos, one of four children in a
family that he described as upper-middle-class. His father owned a
bookstore and printing press, but moved the family to the capital
when Luis was 17 and about to enroll at the University of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the university was an intense law student named Fidel
Castro. ``He was three years ahead of me,'' Posada recalled,
describing him as tall and handsome but outfitted ``like a crazy
guy, dressed like a gangster.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his most vivid memory of Castro was his imposing the
same gangster style on student politics, relying on a band of
supporters in which ``everyone had guns'' to intimidate opponents.
</P>
<P>
   After studying medicine for two years and then chemistry, Posada
went to work for Firestone Tire and Rubber Co., first in Havana and
then in Akron, Ohio, after the revolution. His entire family,
including his parents, two brothers and a sister, remained behind,
committed to Castro's revolution.
</P>
<P>
   His 58-year-old sister, Maria Conchita Posada de Perez, joined
the Cuban army after the revolution and reached the rank of
colonel. ``She is married to a colonel in the intelligence
department,'' Posada said, savoring the irony. ``I help her with
money now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most educated Cubans his age, Posada opposed the
dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. ``To be frank, I was never
interested in politics when I was young,'' he said. ``Not until the
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1960 he had moved into open opposition to Castro, which
landed him in a military prison. According to his Cuban criminal
record, a copy of which was published a decade ago in Granma, the
official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, he then sought
political asylum at the Embassy of Argentina, left Cuba in February
1961 and immediately volunteered for the force being trained by the
CIA for the Bay of Pigs invasion two months later.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear precisely what prompted Posada to take up arms
against the revolution so heartily supported by his own family and,
initially, by the great majority of his countrymen. Asked
repeatedly to explain, he said simply: ``All communists are the
same. All are bad, a form of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the interviews, Posada wrote out his credo on a sheet
of yellow note paper. The oppression, suffering and poverty Castro
has propagated, he argued, ``gives the right to all free Cubans to
rebel in arms against the tyrant, using violence and any method
within our reach that contributes to the toppling of the nefarious
system and leads to the freedom of our fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada was sent to Guatemala to take part in a second wave of
landings in the Bay of Pigs invasion, but did not see action
because the initial invading force foundered.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1963, at the CIA's behest, Posada enrolled in officer
candidate school at Fort Benning and received instruction in
demolition, propaganda and intelligence. Fate brought him together
with Mas Canosa. ``Jorge stood next to me every day for seven
months in the line,'' recalled Posada. ``We were very close
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men left the Army after it became clear that the United
States had no intention of invading Cuba again. They settled in
Miami, the epicenter of anti-Castro activity.
</P>
<P>
   Although revolution was his passion, Mas took jobs as a milkman,
stevedore and shoe salesman before becoming involved with a
telephone cable company that became the cornerstone of his
multimillion-dollar fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Jorge when he was poor,'' Posada recalled. ``He was not
perfect, but he was a very smart guy. He had a lot of trouble with
different people, even with his own brother.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Posada added, ``I trusted him.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA Years
</P>
<P>
   While Mas was making his mark in business, Posada was building
close ties to the CIA, which was using Miami as a base of
operations against Castro.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dizzying time of conspiracies and plots, some
harebrained, some deadly serious. The agency's station in Miami was
among its largest, and its officers industriously enticed
anti-Castro Cubans to sign on with ``the company.'' Miami's
organized-crime figures, who had taken in bountiful profits under
the Batista government, were eager to bankroll the Cuban
opposition, or use the Cubans for their own ends.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, Posada spoke only obliquely about this period
and provided even fewer details in his 1994 autobiography, ``The
Roads of the Warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, newly declassified documents furnished for The New York
Times by the National Security Archive, a nonprofit research group
in Washington, make clear why: For much of that time, the CIA was
directing Posada's activities, involving itself even in such
minutiae as whether he should buy a boat. (His handlers thought
that it was a bad idea and that his cover would be better without
it.)
</P>
<P>
   The documents are part of voluminous files amassed by the 1978
House Select Committee on Assassinations as part of its
investigation into the killing of President Kennedy. Investigators
examining whether anti-Castro Cubans had any links to the 1963
assassination were permitted to read and summarize a trove of
government cablegrams and documents, all of which remain
classified.

 MIAMI: remain classified. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to those summaries, Posada provided the agency and the
FBI with a steady stream of valuable information about Cuban exile
activity in Miami. It was the CIA that directed Posada to
``establish a training camp for guerrilla ops against Castro.'' At
one point, the documents say, the agency pressed Posada to recruit
his brother Ricardo as a spy.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in the late 1970s by investigators from the House
assassinations panel, Posada said he had been trained as a CIA
operative in the Florida Keys and had quickly become a ``principal
agent.'' He said his anti-Castro group had ``worked with the
company direct'' and had had arms, boats and a network of safe
houses.
</P>
<P>
   His handling of those responsibilities evidently earned Posada
the respect of his CIA superiors and high marks in the agency
evaluations filed on him. One from the summer of 1965 deemed him
``of good character, very reliable, security-conscious,'' while
another a year later said his ``performance in all assigned tasks
has been excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Posada was deepening his relationship with
Mas, who is described in one of the CIA documents as a ``close
friend'' of his. The two were active in the exile group RECE, or
Cuban Representation in Exile, and later in a larger umbrella
alliance called CORU, or Coordinator of United Revolutionary
Organizations, both of which undertook violent actions aimed at
toppling the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   A series of July 1965 cablegrams asserts that the two men were
plotting to attack Soviet and Cuban installations abroad. One
document quotes Posada as saying that ``Jorge Mas Canosa of RECE
had paid assassin $5,000 to cover expenses of a demolition
operation in Mexico'' and that Posada himself was ``planning to
place limpet mines on a Cuban or Soviet vessel in the harbor of
Veracruz, and had 100 lbs. of C-4 explosives and detonators.''
</P>
<P>
   Mas, other documents reported, ``had in his possession 125 lbs.
of Pentol to be placed as charges on the vessels'' and had
``proposed to demolitions expert he travel to Spain, Mexico at
expense of RECE and place bombs in communist installations in those
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   By July 24, according to the cables, Posada had ``completed two
10-lb. bombs for RECE working directly with Mas Canosa.'' At that
point, the cablegrams cryptically report, Posada was ``instructed
to disengage from activities.'' There is no indication that the
operation went forward.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence files contain intriguing references to Posada's
dealings with Frank (Lefty) Rosenthal, described in one report as a
``well-known gangster'' who became the model for the fictional
crime figure at the center of the movie ``Casino.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer of 1965, Posada was ``involved in passing
silencers, C-4 explosives, detonators'' and hand grenades to
Rosenthal, according to a Defense Department intelligence report. A
year later, the report continued, Posada supplied 150 small bombs
and some fuses to Rosenthal ``under threat of bodily harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, dated 1967, drily states that ``station only
recently advised of this transaction.'' A ``memo for the record''
says the timing ``suggests Posada may have been moonlighting for
Rosenthal and only reported transactions to agency when it got
hotter.'' About that time, Rosenthal left Miami for Las Vegas after
being questioned by police in Miami about a series of unsolved
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Posada's ties with the agency had begun to
fray. A report in February 1968 complains of his ``tendency'' to
become involved in ``clandestine sabotage activities.'' A few
months later, in June 1968, Posada was questioned about
``unreported association with gangster elements'' and ``thefts from
CIA, plus other items.''
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Years
</P>
<P>
   Posada's life took a new turn in 1967, when he abruptly left
Miami and joined Venezuelan intelligence. This marked the beginning
of his years as an operative for a succession of Latin American
governments. He has not lived again in the United States, depending
instead on a web of powerful friends in the region who see to his
welfare and shield him from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   He got his job as chief of operations for Venezuelan
intelligence with the help of CIA recommendations and was
immediately sent to wipe out the leftist guerrilla movements that
Castro was supporting in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   To Posada, who believes in simple, utilitarian politics, the
work was merely an extension of his efforts to bring down Castro,
and by all accounts, he carried out his job in Venezuela with
gusto. ``I persecuted them very, very hard,'' he said of the
guerrillas, some of whom later abandoned armed struggle and now are
important political figures in Venezuela. ``Many, many people got
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada also arranged for an old friend from his CIA days,
Orlando Bosch, to ``come to Venezuela to make sabotage'' against
the Castro government. Bosch had earlier been convicted in the
United States of a bomb attack on a Polish freighter bound for Cuba
and advocated the violent overthrow of Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But a falling out with Venezuela's newly elected president,
Carlos Andres Perez, led to Posada's dismissal and prompted him to
found his own private security agency, ``the largest in
Venezuela,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time, Posada's relationship with the American
authorities was suddenly thrown into crisis by an intelligence
report that ``Posada may be involved in smuggling cocaine from
Colombia through Venezuela to Miami, also in counterfeit U.S. money
in Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, a copy of which is summarized in the
House investigators' files, the CIA decided ``not to directly
confront Posada with allegation so as not to compromise ongoing
investigation.'' But subsequent cablegrams call Posada a ``serious
potential liability.'' The agency would most likely ``terminate
association promptly if allegations prove true,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   Posada was questioned, and ``found guilty only of having the
wrong kind of friends,'' the synopsis of another report read.
Interrogators were convinced by his denial of drug trafficking, the
report concluded.

 MIAMI: report concluded. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even so, by February 1976, the agency's officers decided to
break their ties with Posada in what the documents cryptically
described as concerns about ``outstanding tax matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, Posada volunteered information to the
agency in hopes of obtaining American visas for himself and his
family. He warned that Bosch and another Cuban exile were plotting
against the nephew of Chile's deposed leftist president. In June,
Posada was calling the CIA again, ``concerning possible exile plans
to blow up Cubana airliner leaving Panama.'' He again asked for
help with his visa.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, on Oct. 6, 1976, a Cubana jetliner with 73
people aboard was blown out of the sky shortly after it took off
from the Caribbean island of Barbados. The dead included teen-agers
from Cuba's national fencing team.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, the CIA made what its records call
``unsuccessful attempts'' to reach Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Jail and an Escape
</P>
<P>
   The bombing dramatically changed Posada's fortunes.
Investigators in Venezuela traced the bomb to the plane's luggage
compartment and identified two Venezuelans who checked bags through
to Havana but got off the plane in Barbados. The men had worked for
Posada, who was arrested and charged with the bombing. Also
arrested was Bosch, who had long collaborated with Posada.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Posada maintains that he did not order the bombing
and blames a Cuban colleague in Venezuelan intelligence for the
action, which he called ``stupid.'' Bosch has defended the attack
in a published interview as ``a legitimate act of war.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired CIA official familiar with the case said in a recent
interview that ``Bosch and Posada were the primary suspects,''
adding, ``There were no other suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada was jailed in Venezuela, and for most of the next nine
years, he remained behind bars, where along with Bosch he learned
to paint.
</P>
<P>
   During the interviews, Posada emphasized that he was never
convicted of the bombing, and blamed corruption and political
influence-peddling in the Venezuelan justice system for his failure
to be freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Mas, in contrast, was flourishing, his business booming and his
political influence growing. At the behest of the Reagan
administration, he founded the Cuban-American National Foundation
in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Posada acknowledged that he might still be in jail in Venezuela
had not his friends, led by Mas, come to his rescue. In a sworn
deposition taken in a civil lawsuit, Ricardo Mas, the estranged
brother of Jorge Mas, recounted how he had traveled to Panama to
obtain the cash used to pay for the escape.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Mas was the comptroller of his brother's company, Church
&AMP; Tower, from 1972 to 1985. He said that at his brother Jorge's
instruction he deposited a check in one of the company's Panamanian
accounts and returned with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that he needed me to go down and bring back $50,000,
that it would be used to get Luis Posada Carriles out of jail, that
Carriles wanted out, that he might start talking,'' Ricardo Mas
testified. ``The guy, I guess, was breaking down, they had to get
him out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada's version of how money was raised for escape is somewhat
different. He said that a bribe for the warden had come from the
sale of his house in Venezuela and that the money from Mas had paid
for additional expenses.
</P>
<P>
   During a changing of the guard at midnight on Aug. 18, 1985,
Posada, dressed in a black jacket with a collar turned up like a
priest's, crossed the courtyard of the prison. He carried a Bible,
to strengthen the impression that he was a priest, and a satchel
containing a small survival kit of food and a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   A farmer saw him and ran to his side seeking solace, he recalled
with amusement recently. ```Father, I have a son who is ill. Could
you please pray for him?' I said, `O.K., friend, walk with me and
pray,''' and together the two men strolled out of the prison. ``It
was perfect,'' Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 days in Caracas, Venezuela, Posada said, he was taken
to Aruba aboard a shrimp boat. From there, a private plane flew him
to Costa Rica and then on to El Salvador, where Felix Rodriguez, a
Cuban-American comrade from his CIA days, was waiting for him with
a job helping the secret contra resupply operation directed by Lt.
Col. Oliver North, the White House aide.
</P>
<P>
   Posada was working for the American government again, this time
for a covert operation that had ties to the CIA and the local
military attache, but which was run by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Posada acknowledged his debt to Mas. He
wrote that ``a group from Miami, all very prominent, among them
Jorge Mas, Feliciano Foyo, Pepe Hernandez and others'' created a
``pool'' to handle his finances. Foyo, who first met Posada during
their training for the Bay of Pigs, is the longtime treasurer of
the Cuban-American Foundation, while Hernandez is the group's
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually got $2,000 to $3,000 a month from Jorge,'' Posada
elaborated recently. ``Every month someone came from Miami, and
they gave me money. But as soon as I started working with the
contras, I said stop sending me money, because I am working.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada was given a Salvadoran passport in the name of Ramon
Medina Rodriguez. He coordinated the flights of a fleet of rickety
planes that ferried supplies for the contras from the Salvadoran
air base at Ilopango to the battlefront.
</P>
<P>
   The flights ended in Oct. 1986, when Sandinista forces shot down
one of the planes and captured an American named Eugene Hasenfus,
who parachuted safely to the ground. Posada said he had
relentlessly teased Hasenfus about his habit of wearing the
parachute and had been scheduled to fly aboard the downed aircraft
but had narrowly missed the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Captured by the Nicaraguan government, Hasenfus began talking
and immediately admitted that the contra operation was being
directed by a Cuban exile known as Max Gomez whose real name was
Felix Rodriguez. It was not long before the world learned that
Ramon Medina was actually Luis Posada Carriles, the international
fugitive.

   (NYT2) YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y. -- July 12, 1998 --
IBM-WATSON-LABS-2, 7-12 -- Bernard Meyerson, a research scientist
at IBM, seeking ideas from summer interns at Summer Jam 2020, at
IBM's research headquarters, the T.J. Watson Research Center in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y. IBM's famed research division, has been
reshaped and refocused since Gerstner took over as chairman five
years ago. ``Now, the attitude is: If you've got a great idea, do
it,'' says Meyerson. ``I never would have been allowed to do this
five or six years ago.'' (Susan Farley/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT1) YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y. -- July 12, 1998 --
IBM-WATSON-LABS-1, 7-12 -- IBM chairman, Louis V. Gerstner, far
right, at a recent brainstorming session with IBM interns and
executives. IBM's famed research division, like so many parts of
the company, has been reshaped and refocused since Gerstner took
over as chairman five years ago. The doors of IBM's labs are far
more open today. IBM researchers spend about 25 percent of their
time with customers, and collaborative work with leading
universities has been stepped up. (Susan Farley/New York Times

 MIAMI: international fugitive. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, however, Posada describes his relationship with
Rodriguez as frosty. According to FBI documents obtained by the
National Security Archive, Posada was interviewed for more than six
hours at the American Embassy in Honduras regarding his role in the
Iran-contra affair and complained to FBI agents that Rodriguez
``talked too much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted me to come to Washington to testify against Oliver
North,'' he said in the recent interview. ``I refused to go,'' he
continued proudly, adding disparagingly that ``Felix went and
testified.'' Of Rodriguez he said: ``You see, he's like a boy, like
a child. Felix was an enemy of Oliver North.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guatemala Years
</P>
<P>
   At loose ends after the Iran-contra affair, Posada soon signed
on as a security consultant to Vinicio Cerezo, Guatemala's first
democratically elected civilian president in a generation. Cerezo's
biggest challenge was to curb the power of the Guatemalan military,
and Posada's reputation for loyalty and tenacity seemed to make him
the ideal choice to keep an eye on restive officers or guerrillas
who might be planning a coup or an assassination.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Posada continued to pursue his campaign
against the Cuban government, keeping in close touch with his
friends in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Posada said that during the 1980s, Gaspar Jimenez delivered
money and messages to him. Jimenez, who was jailed in the 1976
murder of a Cuban diplomat in Mexico, now works at the medical
clinic run by Dr. Alberto Hernandez, the foundation's current
chairman, according to employees there.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent Cuban exile, who has known Jimenez for 40 years,
said the money had been provided by Cuban-Americans in Miami.
Jimenez, he said, gave Posada $15,000 ``for every act of
sabotage.'' Jimenez did not respond to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Posada's activities were brought to a halt on Feb. 28, 1990,
though, when three gunmen he describes as Cuban intelligence
operatives approached his car as it was stopped in traffic in
Guatemala City and opened fire at him. He was hit by a dozen
bullets, and he survived, he said, only because he was able to
drive himself to a gasoline station and scratch out a note that
mentioned his relationship with Cerezo and asked for an ambulance
to be called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two years and three surgeries to recover,'' Posada
said. ``My last surgery was a year ago. A doctor friend from
Houston came down and operated on me at an army base in El
Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Posada said his medical bills, some $22,000, were
paid by friends in Miami. Once again, leaders of the Cuban-American
National Foundation, among them Hernandez, who succeeded Mas Canosa
as chairman of the group last November, and Foyo, the
organization's treasurer, led the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Posada acknowledged that many people besides his enemies in Cuba
had had motive to want him eliminated. Guerrilla groups in
Venezuela, the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front in El Salvador had all been victims
of his anti-communist zeal, and the Guatemalan army had long been
resentful of an outsider being brought in to advise and protect
Cerezo.
</P>
<P>
   But Posada said he was certain that his attackers were Cuban
operatives, citing information provided to him by an unidentified
friend in Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. ``They were
supposed to kidnap me and take me back to Cuba, interrogate me and
have me confess on television,'' he maintained.
</P>
<P>
   Dreading That Castro May Outlive Him
</P>
<P>
   At an age when most of his contemporaries have retired and are
doting on their grandchildren, Luis Posada Carriles has returned
with renewed vigor and determination in recent years to the
struggle that has consumed him all of his adult life. Time is
running out, he made it clear, both for him and his lifelong
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   With Mas dead, Posada said, he is particularly concerned that
the anti-Castro movement is now rudderless and drifting. One of the
reasons he agreed to come forward now to discuss his activities, he
explained, was in hopes of reinvigorating the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now is a bad time,'' he said. ``Too many years.
Everybody is very old.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada said he last spoke with Mas about a month before he died
of cancer that began in the prostate and spread to the lungs and
bones. ``He was very sick then,'' he said. ``It was very sad. He
was in terrible pain. He knew he was dying. He was a very powerful
man.'' Posada paused, then continued, ``Now is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally disturbing is the attitude of American government
agencies, Posada said. Cuba is not as important an issue to the
Clinton White House as it was to earlier administrations, and many
of the veteran operatives for whom he performed _ and from whom he
collected _ favors have long since passed from the scene, leaving
him to deal with a younger, less sympathetic generation. ``It's
been a long time since I've done anything for them,'' he lamented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new relationship,'' he continued, with concern evident
in his voice. ``The problem is that they think the money which
helped me in the operation came from the states,'' which would be a
violation of American law. When it was suggested to him that was
indeed the case, he replied, ``Yes, it's obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   As Posada sees it, because he does not stage his anti-Castro
activities from within the United States, his activities should be
of no concern to the American authorities. ``What I do is from
Latin America, and my targets are inside Cuba,'' he said. ``I am
not a citizen, so they do not have power over me.''
</P>
<P>
   His proudest recent operation, last year's string of bombings of
hotels in Cuba, was organized in Latin America, he says. A
handwritten set of instructions faxed by Posada to his operatives
in Guatemala, however, notes that some of the money for the
bombings had come from Cuban-Americans in the United States. Posada
confirmed the authenticity of the fax, but claimed not to know the
men named in his document. ``Somebody, a friend of a friend'' gave
him the names, he said with a wink. ``A priest. You see, I'm not in
touch with the operators.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But anyway,'' he predicted, ``they're going to put the finger
on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada suspects that he may be questioned by the American
authorities about the hotel bombings, and he is bitter about the
way he and the Cuban exile cause have been treated over the years.
After a long courtship, he feels, he and his compatriots were
seduced and then abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   But most distressing of all is the nagging thought that his
nemesis, Fidel Castro, might outlive him, as he has already
outlived Mas. ``Maybe I pass away before Castro,'' he said with a
shrug. ``Nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed that Castro's mother lived well into her 90s and that
another relative recently celebrated her 105th birthday, Posada
groaned. ``Oh my God,'' he said. But then, shaking his head and
wagging his finger, he quoted a popular proverb, derived from the
Cuban tradition of slaughtering a hog for a holiday meal: ``A cada
lechon se le llega su Nochebuena,'' or ``Every pig gets its
Christmas Eve.''

COMMENTARY: AT CITY HALL, SHADES OF ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What parent wouldn't be proud?
</P>
<P>
   After spending practically a lifetime laboring in the vineyards
of New York politics, Raymond Harding, leader of the Liberal Party,
now has not one but two sons serving the city in high places.
</P>
<P>
   His younger son, Russell, 34, agreed last month to head the
city's Housing Development Corp., which finances housing for low-
and middle-income families. Then last week, his older son, Robert,
40, assumed the even more impressive post of city budget director,
a position that puts him in charge of a budget larger than that of
most states.
</P>
<P>
   Could a father hope for better proof of his good example than
that his sons would, for the public good, shoulder such heavy and,
one can only presume, unfamiliar responsibilities?
</P>
<P>
   After all, until his appointment to head the housing finance
agency, Russell Harding had no background in financing housing. And
until his appointment to head the budget-writing office, Robert
Harding had no background writing budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people have had mean, cynical things to say
about both appointments. As soon as Russell, a college dropout, was
named to his $111,000-a-year position, there were cries of
``Patronage! Patronage!'' When, on top of that, Robert was then
named to his $137,000-a-year position, critics waxed practically
apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tammany had higher standards than this,'' declared Richard
Wade, the urban historian, who was once himself active in the
Liberal Party. ``How could you have a nationwide search and come up
with the kids of Ray Harding?''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rogowsky, another longtime student of New York politics
and director of City University's government internship program,
marveled at what an obvious act of cronyism the appointments seemed
to represent. ``Are there any members of the Harding family left
who need a job?'' he asked with mock concern.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference announcing Robert Harding's appointment,
Harding, pere, was challenged by reporters about his son's rather
thin-looking credentials. He scoffed at their naivete.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody thinks Rudy Giuliani would turn over the management
of a $34 billion budget for political considerations,'' he said,
``they don't know Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding has a point. To be sure, the choice of not one but two
Harding boys for high positions represents, in sheer mathematical
terms, a staggering coincidence. And yes, Harding played a critical
role in the mayor's 1993 election when he secured for the
distinctly unliberal Giuliani the Liberal Party line.
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean that the sons' appointments are a payback
to their father, whose loyalty, it could be argued, has already
been amply recompensed.
</P>
<P>
   More significant is what these all-in-the-family choices suggest
about Giuliani's narrowing circle. Rather than bringing in new
talent and outside perspectives, he appears, in his second term, to
be looking increasingly inward, drawing on a smaller and smaller
group of intimates for counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Robert Harding, until recently the city's lobbyist in
Albany, had been chosen to head the budget office, Abraham Lackman,
a former city budget director, defended him as smart and hard
working. But, he said, ``probably Bob's strongest point is that the
mayor trusts him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all administrations tend in their waning years to become
more insular. In their third, and perhaps not coincidentally final,
terms, both former Mayor Edward Koch and former Gov. Mario Cuomo
were also faulted for their circle-the-wagons style of governance.
The only difference, some say, is that in Giuliani's case, the
wagons seem to be closing in a little sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either because the circle was smaller to begin with or because
he is so terrifying to work with,'' Rogowsky speculated, ``with
Rudy it is just happening earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   When this columnist contacted Harding directly to ask about his
sons' recent appointments, he repeated his assertion that he had
nothing to do with securing them and added that it was not his
place to defend the mayor's decisions. ``I don't comment,'' he
said, ``on City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he stoop to defending himself. Instead, with the stoic
dignity that has served him so well for so many decades, he said:
``I've lived my life the best way I know how. If people find that
objectionable, there's very little I can do about it.''

FRANCE DOMINATES BRAZIL, WINS ITS FIRST WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs for correct 1950 World Cup winner to Uruguay in graf
8)  
(lh) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ The French soccer team, which had aroused
an indifferent nation with its exceptional play over the past
month, delivered an even more stunning accomplishment Sunday night,
dominating favored Brazil to win its first World Cup title. In
winning the world's largest sporting event, 3-0, France produced
the tournament's most improbable championship game upset in nearly
five decades.
</P>
<P>
   Zinedine Zidane, France's exquisite playmaker, scored his first
two goals of the competition at its most decisive moment, heading
in a pair of corner kicks and making the home team the champion of
the quadrennial tournament for the first time since Argentina
prevailed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Even after defender Marcel Desailly was ejected for receiving
his second yellow card 22 minutes from the end, France kept
attacking and produced a short-handed goal in the 93rd minute from
midfielder Emmanuel Petit. So much for the belief, held inside and
outside of France, that French athletes seldom have the confidence
or poise to win the big game.
</P>
<P>
   France clearly dominated this tournament, surrendering only two
goals in seven matches with a compact defense that pressured Brazil
Sunday night and smothered its attack in midfield. With more
precise shooting, France could have won 6-0 or 7-0. Even so, the
three-goal margin matched the largest ever in the championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not satisfied just to be in the final,'' said Aime
Jacquet, France's embattled coach. ``We've been working toward this
for two years, and we deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo, the Brazilian forward considered to be the best player
in the world, was reduced to limping immobility Sunday night by an
ankle injury and tendinitis in his knee suffered earlier in the
tournament. The team doctor, Lidio Toledo, also said that Ronaldo
felt faint after lunch Sunday but had begun to feel better after
resting.
</P>
<P>
   The ``O Estado'' newspaper of Sao Paolo, Brazil, relying on an
interview with Ronaldo's close friend and teammate, Roberto Carlos,
reported that the pressure to succeed had apparently led the
21-year-old superstar to suffer a severe case of nerves that
included vomiting and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to a hospital for treatment for his ankle before
the game, according to FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and was
not listed in the original starting lineup. With Ronaldo a
non-factor, Brazil lost a World Cup final for only the second time
in six appearances. That earlier defeat, a 2-1 loss at home to
Uruguay in the 1950 championship game, was the most unexpected
result before Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``France was better,'' said Brazil's 66-year-old coach, Mario
Zagallo. ``We suffered a major traumatic shock. Ronaldo was not fit
to play. That was a major psychological blow. Everyone was upset
and down that Ronaldo would not be able to play well. The team was
a little inhibited thinking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   With 80,000 spectators watching at Stade de France, and an
estimated 1.7 billion watching on worldwide television, France
became only the seventh team ever to win the World Cup, which began
in 1930, joining Argentina, Germany, Uruguay, Italy, England and
four-time champion Brazil in this exclusive sporting fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Frenchman, Jules Rimet, who conceived the idea of a
soccer world championship and Sunday night it was the Jules Rimet
trophy that President Jacques Chirac handed over his head to Didier
Deschamps, the exultant French captain. This was quite a turnaround
from 1994 when France failed to qualify for the World Cup, and from
1958, 1982 and 1986, when it exited prematurely in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   When this tournament began on June 10, France hardly seemed
interested that it was hosting an event that dwarfs the Olympics in
terms of international anticipation. But slowly the French grew
consumed by their soccer team, and Sunday night hundreds of
thousands gathered to celebrate along the Champs-Elysees and the
plaza at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac wore a soccer scarf around his neck, while ordinary fans
dyed their hair red, white and blue. Even some French policeman had
the country's tricolor painted on their arms in anticipation of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   At the game's conclusion, the steely defender Lilian Thuram
grabbed a tricolor, jogged to a corner of the stadium and waved it
joyously, signaling that this was not merely a victory for French
soccer, but also for French ethnic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Thuram was born in Guadeloupe. Zidane is the son of an Algerian
night watchman. Desailly was born in Ghana. Others players are of
Armenian and Polish descent. Sunday night's victory was a rebuke,
in an athletic sense anyway, of the anti-immigration stand by
Jean-Marie Le Pen and the right-wing National Front party that has
gained popularity in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under adversity, France showed that it was a great team that
could play with its heart,'' Jacquet said. ``So many players wanted
to see the French flag fluttering above us tonight.''

</P>
<P>
   Jacquet, who had been heavily criticized before the World Cup
for his defensive tactics and his inability to find reliable
scorers, has been at war with the French sports newspaper,
L'Equipe. And in his final, victorious game as coach, he showed no
signs of letting bygones be bygones.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never forgive that,'' the vindicated Jacquet said,
accusing some French journalists of ``shameless lying.'' He added:
``I think people see that France has a great team. We have
tremendous rapport with the country. I think everyone saw that
France was able to play with pride and heart and deserved
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   France played without one of its central defenders, Laurent
Blanc, who was ineligible because he received a red card in the
semifinals. But Frank Lebouef played steadily in replacement, and
the French defense was equally impregnable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just an excuse,'' Lebouef said of Ronaldo's sick
stomach. ``Brazil is always dangerous, no matter who is out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   While France attacked from the beginning, Brazil played with a
curious torpor in the first half. Ronaldo conserved his energy for
the occasional sprint, only to suffer further injury with a
high-speed collision with Fabien Barthez, the French goalkeeper.
Ronaldo was unable to jump, and though he was in the vicinity, he
was useless in attempting to stop Zidane as he headed a corner kick
over Leonardo in the 27th minute and as he repeated the maneuver
unmarked in the 46th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the first half, Zagallo said he kept wondering
whether ``I should keep Ronaldo on the pitch or take him off.'' An
argument with a reporter over this issue caused Zagallo to walk out
of his post-game news conference. Ronaldo did have one inviting
scoring chance in the second half, but he fired directly at Barthez
from point-blank range instead of at Deschamps, a midfielder who
had retreated to the goal line but could not use his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo lost both a chance to score and to put himself in the
company of such greats as Pele and Diego Maradona who brought their
teams World Cup titles and themselves acknowledgment as the
greatest players of their generation.
</P>
<P>
   There was never any question about removing Zidane, the
26-year-old French midfielder, even though he had not scored before
Sunday night's championship match. An impetuous foul cost him a red
card and a two-game suspension in the first round. But he is
everything to this French team, its best scorer and playmaker, its
unquestioned leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zidane brought light to the game and illuminated it,'' Jacquet
said. ``He scored with his head. Who could have predicted it? But
it is one of those unpredictable things that makes this a beautiful
game.''

FORTUNE MEETS TALENT: YANKEES' 10TH STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ If the New York Yankees are not the best
regular-season team in history, they might be the most fortunate,
or maybe they are so lucky because they are so good. Serendipity
and talent every day, in varying increments. Every day, it's
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees broke a ninth-inning tie with Tampa Bay on Sunday
when Chuck Knoblauch was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded, and
they went on to add six more runs, the 9-2 final score blurring the
vacillating nature of this game. The Yankees have won 10
consecutive games; they have a 65-20 record and lead their division
by 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   They are to baseball what Microsoft is to the computer industry,
and no lawyers can protect the rest of the American League. ``The
Yankees are by far the best team we've played all year,'' said
Roberto Hernandez, the Tampa Bay reliever who hit Knoblauch. ``They
do what it takes to win. They find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, a starting pitcher in the All-Star Game last
Tuesday, left Sunday's game after five innings because of what he
and the Yankees said was a bruised right big toe. Wells said he
injured the toe slipping down the stairs and banging his foot
against a wall on Wednesday in his Tampa Bay-area home. An X-ray
revealed no fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Wells has suffered gout in his right big toe in the past, but
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said there was no
indication that Wells' current trouble was related to gout. Wells
said he did not expect to miss his next scheduled start, on Friday
in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led by 2-1 when Wells departed, but Tampa Bay tied
the game in the bottom of the sixth. Relievers from both teams
pitched effectively through the eighth inning. Hernandez, the Devil
Rays' closer and one of the game's hardest throwers, took over in
the ninth, with the strategy of Tampa Bay Manager Larry Rothschild
clear: hold off the Yankees for an inning or two with his best
reliever and try to squeeze across a run.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez complicated the situation immediately, walking
Darryl Strawberry on four pitches to open the inning. After jogging
to first, Strawberry turned and looked toward the Yankees' dugout
in anticipation, and sure enough, Homer Bush sprinted out to run
for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 25, plays only rarely, and yet his job is extremely
difficult. About twice a month, he is inserted into a crucial
situation as a pinch-runner, and any hesitation or misread could be
a pivotal blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he told his wife, Monica, whose name is tattooed over
Bush's heart, that he has a difficult time staying focused in the
early innings, keeping his concentration, for he knows there's
virtually no chance he will play. Before the seventh inning,
however, Bush begins preparing for the vague possibility he will
pinch-run in the eighth or ninth; his role, he has told friends, is
something like that of a closer.
</P>
<P>
   He will start stretching, and during Saturday's game he saw Tim
Raines jog around the sofas and lounge chairs in the clubhouse
here, and Bush liked the idea; in the seventh and eighth innings
Sunday he started jogging in the clubhouse, and then running up and
down the steps that lead to the Yankees' dugout, before sprinting
onto the field to replace Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homer's never nervous,'' said Jose Cardenal, the Yankees'
first-base coach. ``He's always cool when he gets out there. He's
just very aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush edged off first, his lead four and a half steps. Chad
Curtis, the next batter, squared to bunt, and once Bush saw Curtis
get the ball down on the ground, toward the mound, he burst for
second. Hernandez fielded the ball and threw to second, but Bush,
diving in head first, reached the bag and banged into shortstop
Kevin Stocker, knocking him backward. Safe.
</P>
<P>
   Bush led off second, Curtis off first. Scott Brosius bunted, to
the left side, and Hernandez charged the ball. Rushing this time,
he whirled and fired to third and appeared to have a great chance
at getting Bush; diving head first again, Bush heard the throw
bounce off the artificial surface, glanced up and saw it slip away
from third baseman Bobby Smith. The Yankees had the bases loaded
and nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, his fastball reaching 99 miles an hour, then struck
out Ricky Ledee, the first out in the inning. Knoblauch fell behind
no balls and two strikes and made up his mind just to make contact.
Hernandez threw a ball, then decided to tempt Knoblauch with a
slider. It was 85 mph and spun right onto the top of Knoblauch's
left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch bent over briefly at home plate, his shoulder
throbbing, realizing he had just forced Bush home with the lead
run. ``The pain only lasts momentarily,'' he said, a pack of ice
wrapped against his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offense is sluggish, and yet, on consecutive
Sundays, they scored the decisive run when a batter was hit by a
pitch with the bases loaded _ they beat Baltimore 1-0 on July 5.
Bush was good enough, fast enough to create opportunity, and the
Yankees were lucky Knoblauch was hit.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Derek Jeter hit a two-run single, Tino Martinez
laced a three-run double, and soon they were showered and on their
way to Cleveland, a juggernaut in flight.

ON HIS BEST BEHAVIOR, CORONADO'S QUEST WINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Coronado's Quest behaved like a gentleman but ran
like a demon Sunday at Belmont Park, and the combination proved
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-year-old son of Forty Niner who was held out of the Kentucky
Derby in May because of his history of fractious behavior before
races, Coronado's Quest dominated four rivals and won the Dwyer
Stakes by five lengths over Ian's Thunder.
</P>
<P>
   With the second half of the racing season still to be run, he
served notice that he is a horse of championship caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This horse is the bomb,'' said the jockey Mike Smith, a
frequent victim of Coronado's Quest's violent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran great and gave a real professional performance. He
loaded well, broke well and behaved perfectly. It's nice to see
that from him, considering where we came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Shug McGaughey, who trains the colt for Stuart Janney III of
Maryland, said: ``He didn't give us any problems, and he was very
professional. I have to consider this one of his best races,
considering that we were carrying 124 pounds and also for the fact
that they really tested him.''
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey accepted the chance for future tests against the stars
of the Triple Crown campaign, with the first one probably on Aug.
9, in the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   The testers will include Real Quiet, winner of the Kentucky
Derby and the Preakness; Victory Gallop, winner of the Belmont
Stakes, who thwarted Real Quiet by a nose on the threshold of the
Triple Crown, and Favorite Trick, last year's juvenile champion and
Horse of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   For whichever horses can run a mile and a quarter, there is also
the Travers at Saratoga on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   For people drawn by his record of bad behavior, Coronado's Quest
may have been a disappointment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For people drawn by his record as a racehorse, he was a smashing
success.
</P>
<P>
   He was allowed to be saddled in a stall at the far end of the
saddling shed and to skip the customary circling of the paddock and
even the post parade. But he exhibited no roughneck tendencies. He
set the tone and the pace of the race, he withstood several
challenges as he turned for home, and he widened his lead down the
homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, Coronado's Quest had five lengths on Ian's
Thunder, a 32-1 shot who roared from last place to second.
</P>
<P>
   Ian's Thunder had three-quarters of a length on Scatmandu,
another supposedly reformed rogue who kicked and bucked before the
race while two grooms led him around the walking ring, and who then
rapped his head against the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Scatmandu paid for his rambunctiousness. After rallying wide on
the turn for home and mildly threatening Coronado's Quest, he was
forced to settle for the distinction of outrunning Rock and Roll
and the 9-1 outsider Undaunted Mettle, who had fought Coronado's
Quest for the lead for about half a mile before subsiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had dead aim,'' said Richie Migliore, the rider on
Scatmandu, ``but the winner was too much horse today. My horse got
agitated in the paddock and banged his head on the gate and got cut
up a bit. I'm not giving it as an excuse, and my hat is off to
Coronado's Quest.''
</P>
<P>
   John Kimmel, who trains Scatmandu, said his colt ``banged his
head so hard that he probably ruptured a blood vessel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was bleeding profusely from his left nostril,'' Kimmel
said. ``He was probably sucking blood into his airway, and that
compromised his finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest ran the mile and one-sixteenth in 1:42 2/5. He
paid $2.90 for a $2 bet to win and earned $90,000. He has now won
eight of his 12 races and banked $860,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The low point in his career came last winter in Florida when he
became the talk of the town with his boorish behavior before races
at Gulfstream Park. He threw Smith once, refused to let him get
into the saddle another time and generally carried on, even though
he was allowed to be saddled privately.
</P>
<P>
   But McGaughey persisted. He skipped the Kentucky Derby and its
clamorous scene, and held the colt out of the Preakness and the
Belmont because of a foot injury. But Coronado's Quest won both the
Wood and the Riva Ridge in New York, and on Sunday showed exemplary
social graces and winning speed as he captured the Dwyer.

FRANCE TOWERS OVER WORLD; IT'S NO WONDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1998 World Cup final will go down as a tremendous upset,
perhaps one of the greatest in the decades-long history of the
planet's most gripping sports tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Underdog France 3, mighty Brazil 0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quel'' surprise.
</P>
<P>
   France, a nation with precious few victories in major team
sports since Napoleon's squad had some big wins in the early 1800s,
a team sans outstanding individual players, over the one-name
magicians from the greatest soccer-playing country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incroyable.''
</P>
<P>
   A tremendous upset.
</P>
<P>
   Or was it?
</P>
<P>
   France had an unbelievably easy road to the finals, emerging on
top of the weakest group in the field, knocking off
defense-oriented squads from Paraguay and Italy (in penalty kicks),
and drawing Germany-killers Croatia in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the comeuppance would come against the gifted Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will win,'' Brazil coach Mario Zagallo said. ``Have no
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no doubt in this corner, or in many other places
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the real final was played Tuesday, when Brazil beat
Holland in one of the most entertaining matches of the six-week
tournament. All the experts said so.
</P>
<P>
   The French, though, begged to differ. They believed they could
win.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, in retrospect, we should have believed along with them.
</P>
<P>
   The first clue came in the 2-1 victory against Croatia in the
semifinal. With its forwards missing in action, France needed
offense from somewhere, anywhere. It came from the unlikeliest
source.
</P>
<P>
   Defender Lilian Thuram, who hadn't put the ball in the back of
the net in 37 international matches, scored both goals. That's the
equivalent of a .200-hitting shortstop going deep twice to put his
team in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   A team of destiny? Hogwash. But clearly something unusual was
going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had come too far to lose'' was Thuram's simple explanation.
</P>
<P>
   The second clue came when Croatia knocked off the Netherlands to
take third place. Perhaps the teams on that side of the bracket
weren't so weak after all.
</P>
<P>
   The real tipoff, though, came before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   The French players were supposed to be nervous, weren't they?
But there they were, arms draped on each other, belting out their
national anthem with gusto, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great snapshot, and a major hint that we were about to
witness something special.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxed, confident French team, buoyed by the cheers of a
once-blase nation, proceeded to do the impossible. They didn't just
beat the Brazilians, they dominated them.
</P>
<P>
   When it was ended, we had one of those rare moments that
transcend sport.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't have to be a tennis fan to get the warm fuzzies over
Jana Novotna's redemption at Wimbledon. You didn't have to be a
baseball fan to get a tear at the sight of Walt Weiss' son in the
stands at the All-Star Game after surviving a bout with the deadly
E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   And you didn't have to be a soccer fan to appreciate what the
home country did yesterday at Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, perhaps it takes an appreciation of the sport to understand
the brilliance of Zinedine Zidane's two goals, or the toughness of
the French defense _ two goals in seven matches, one on a penalty
kick? Now, that's incredible _ or how much of a rout a 3-0 result
is.
</P>
<P>
   But even a nonsoccer fan can understand the depth of feeling
when the most coveted prize in the sports world is won by the host
country.
</P>
<P>
   The lasting images from the World Cup final won't be Zidane's
two headers, or goalie Fabien Barthez's save of Ronaldo's
point-blank blast.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will be of the French celebrating in the streets,
and of the explosion of noise when French captain Didier Deschamps
held the trophy aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 World Cup gave us some great moments. It gave us
Croatia's run to the semifinals, the emergence of England teen-ager
Michael Owen, the attacking play of the Dutch, the usual quota of
superlative goals and fantastic saves. It gave us high-scoring
games, and the high drama of penalty shootouts. It gave us that
marvelous commercial with the Brazilians in the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, the 1998 World Cup gave us a great moment in
national pride. It gave us a group of competitors rising to new
heights for the greater glory of the homeland.
</P>
<P>
   An upset? Of course.
</P>
<P>
   But really, it shouldn't be that big a surprise.

A sight to behold for one and all

   By Dale Robertson
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL; 
PARIS _ One day became an entire year. And, like that, decades of
failure would be put summarily to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn broke cold and gray Sunday. Almost wintery, at least by
Houston standards. But, by 2 p.m., summer was upon us.
Prophetically, there would be blue skies for Les Bleus.
</P>
<P>
   And, by midnight, it was Christmas, New Year's Eve and Bastille
Day happening at once.
</P>
<P>
   While les bon temps had rolled rather remarkably even in the
hours leading to the kickoff, you cannot imagine the scene once
France's stunning home-field 3-0 demolition of mighty Brazil was
complete. A wait of three generations was over, and three
generations of French fans threw themselves into a frenzy of
celebration the magnitude of which never has been seen in our neck
of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Meaning from New York to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Charlemagne. Louis XIV. Napoleon. De Gaulle. Now Zidane. The
World Cup trophy, which remains the planet's most prized sporting
possession whether we Americans choose to accept it, finally
belonged to the country of its roots.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Richmond Avenue the night the Rockets beat the Knicks
and put our demons to rest? Now picture Richmond with at least a
million people descending upon its sidewalks _ six hours before
kickoff. Things, of course, got crazier afterward as the TVs
clicked off and jubilant fans flooded onto the Champs-Elyses as
well as into the Latin Quarter, turning the City of Light into the
City of Noise.
</P>
<P>
   No car horn went unhonked. No firecracker went unpopped. No
silly song went unsung. And, believe me, no l'eau de vie _ whiskey,
etc. _ went undrunk.
</P>
<P>
   Although scattered tiny pockets of sanity could be found on the
side streets of the Left Bank, the main boulevards looked as if you
had simultaneously dropped the Super Bowl, the Final Four, the
Indianapolis 500 and the Game 7s of the World Series and the NBA
Finals into New Orleans' French Quarter on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:30 a.m., three hours after the trophy presentation, the din
outside my hotel was actually building.
</P>
<P>
   The only comparable experience we've known in the United States
was the American hockey team's upset of the Russians in the 1980
Olympics. But Lake Placid lacked Paris' population base by just a
bit. As for France, it hadn't felt, or exhibited, such a national
euphoria since the Nazis shuffled out with their hands in the air.
</P>
<P>
   After some hand-wringing, I decided to spurn the offer of a
scalper's ticket costing gobs of francs, concluding it would be
better to take in the spectacle side by side with the real people,
not the nearly 80,000 high-rollers at the Stade de France out in
Saint-Denis. But finding an interesting spot from which to watch
proved infinitely more difficult than you would believe.
</P>
<P>
   The free ``football parcs'' with their giant TV screens filled
up early. The one at the Hotel de Ville (city hall) had closed its
gates five hours before the match began. And, if a bar or
restaurant owned a TV, it also had at least 10 times as many
customers as it had standing room, much less tables and chairs, or
meals.
</P>
<P>
   The throng crowded outside the Pizza Vesuvio on the
Champs-Elyses a block down from the Place Charles de Gaulle Etoile
probably numbered 2,000 by halftime. Meanwhile, one of the more
famous, usually packed bistros across the boulevard had maybe 10
customers and a larger number of waiters thinking only about
beating Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   One kind soul residing at No. 37 on the Rue des Longchamps in
the fashionable 16th arrondissement did his part for Liberty,
Egalite and Fraternity by putting his set out on the second-floor
balcony, facing the street. Within minutes, several hundred people
had gathered below, cheering his largess as well as Les Bleus, and
blocking traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I say traffic. There was none to speak of during the game
in a city where gridlock is almost de rigeur. Most graphic would be
the contrast on the Etoile, into which 12 major avenues feed and
where normally several hundred motorists at any given moment stage
a free-for-all in the closest of quarters. But shortly after
kickoff, I counted only six cars from my perch atop the Arc de
Triomphe, where I wound up watching Paris watch France win the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Superb game. Better view.
</P>
<P>
   The security staff had cleverly tuned one of its closed-circuit
TVs into the match. So, for 35 francs, and a willingness to hike
the 200-odd steps up to the terrace, I had myself a front-row seat
for the soccer and a grand old city about to stage the party of its
modern existence.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when victory was secure, the Arc turned into a billboard
of tribute to France's most glorious triumph since Napoleon's
heyday. The players' faces were being projected onto the landmark
as blue laser lights beamed CHAMPIONS CUP DU MONDE! and MERCI LES
BLEUS! onto the glowing facade.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy indeed.

   POLITICS-INCUMBENCY (Austin, Texas) _ There is no better

this election year than in the commercials candidates are
broadcasting. After years of shunning Washington and
politics-as-usual, even incumbents who once went out of their way
to portray themselves as government outsiders are proudly

one of the most spectacular insects on Earth, flew through the

One was the proposed five-year contract that would ensure she
remained The New Yorker's editor through mid-2003. The other was
Brill's Content, the ballyhooed new magazine about the press. The
contract was an invitation to continue to edit the magazine whose
words had set it apart as an intellectual arbiter and whose balance
sheet _ over which she had little control _ had set it apart as a
financial sinkhole. Brill's Content was proof that alternatives

INQUIRY WIDENS IN VANISHING OF SOCIALITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Calif., Nev., Fla., Bahamas)  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mother-and-son team of traveling con artists who
are the prime suspects in the mysterious disappearance of an
82-year-old woman from her Upper East Side town house a week ago
were apparently preparing to swindle at least one other wealthy
Manhattanite, the police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sante and Kenneth Kimes _ whom the police suspect of trying to
bilk the woman, Irene Silverman, out of her luxurious home and who
were found carrying her expired passport after she disappeared on
July 5 _ had apparently set their sights on at least one other
target in New York City, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said a speck of blood was found on the seat belt of
the Kimeses' teal-green 1997 Lincoln Town Car, and detectives are
anxiously awaiting the results of lab tests to see if the blood
matches Mrs. Silverman's DNA. The Kimeses have not been charged in
connection with Mrs. Silverman's disappearance; they are now being
held on a warrant in the passing of a bad check in Utah to buy the
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kimeses are considered suspects in a number of other
crimes in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and in Florida and the
Bahamas. And the New York City Police Department has indicated that
it believes that Mrs. Silverman was not their only intended mark in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some evidence that they were in fact looking at least
at one other person,'' Assistant Chief Kevin Farrell, the commander
of Manhattan detectives, said Sunday outside Mrs. Silverman's home
at 20 East 65th St.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said they believed that the Kimeses were trying to
cheat Mrs. Silverman, a former ballerina and wealthy socialite, out
of her town house, which she had divided into units and rented out.
Kenneth Kimes was one of her tenants, and investigators said that
he brought two notaries to the house and that Mrs. Silverman had
grown suspicious of him in the days before she vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kimes, 63, has a criminal record going back to 1961 for
crimes as varied as keeping Mexican domestic workers in virtual
slavery, stealing a mink coat from a Washington hotel, and several
counts of credit-card fraud. She and Kenneth Kimes, 23, who was
arrested on a shoplifting charge in Florida, are viewed as suspects
in a number of swindles and crimes across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities want to question the Kimeses about a missing
banker in the Bahamas who was last seen in their company, the
slaying of a Los Angeles businessman who the police believe may
have been swindled by them and a case of arson in Las Vegas that
the police believe may have been planned to enable the Kimeses to
collect the insurance. So far, the Kimeses have adamantly refused
to answer any questions, the New York police said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department came to New
York to see if they could establish a link between the Kimeses and
the murder of David Kazdin, 63, a businessman who was found dead on
March 14 in Los Angeles.

RECORD WEEKEND IN A REMARKABLE ROOKIE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYLVANIA, Ohio _ For Se Ri Pak, the astonishing 20-year-old
rookie from South Korea, winning the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic by
tying a Ladies Professional Golf Association tour record with a
phenomenal 23 under par seemed as easy for her as a walk in the
cemetery. She did everything but whistle.
</P>
<P>
   She stunned golf followers when she shot a 10-under-par 61 on
Friday to break the LPGA record for lowest single round, added a 63
on Saturday, establishing a record for lowest score on consecutive
tournament days, and finished Sunday with a 66 for a total of 261,
nine strokes ahead of Lisa Hackney and 10 ahead of her playing
partner Sunday, Karrie Webb. Her four-round total was the lowest
score ever for an LPGA event, four shots better than the former
mark, held by three golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, in white baseball cap, dark glasses, black-and-white
striped blouse and white shorts, hardly looked right, hardly looked
left. She just kept her focus _ and her shots _ straight ahead,
just as her father taught her to do when he decided that camping
out in a cemetery was just the thing to develop mental toughness in
his daughter, then about 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make her brave,'' said her father, Joon Chul Pak,
``to give her big heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He had put up a tent for them in the cemetery and then left her
to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   His wife was not thrilled with that discipline, and others
imposed on young Se Ri. ``She's going to die,'' she warned.
</P>
<P>
   But the father, seeing great potential in his daughter,
persisted. As she got better, as she won a string of amateur
tournaments in Korea, the game of golf grew more pleasurable. With
a gentle smile and a game built to a considerable degree on the
power emanating from her solid frame, she has won two straight LPGA
tournaments; her Farr Classic victory follows her win last week in
a 20-hole playoff against the amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn in the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it got scary, especially when it got really dark,
and I had to walk home alone around midnight,'' she said this
evening, recalling those days in the cemetery in her hometown of
Daejeon, about 100 miles south of Seoul. And she smiled.
</P>
<P>
   She can smile about it now. But what effect did that experience
have on her golf game today? ``No shaking,'' she said. ``Not
scared.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Her parents seemed relatively calm as well, as they, along with
a large and enthusiastic gallery, followed her while she piled up
birdies on this hot afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Her father carried and sat on a portable chair, and her mother
was nearby under a small parasol. A family friend had
responsibility for Pak's 10-week-old beagle, for which she paid,
she said, ``Three hundred bucks!''
</P>
<P>
   But she can afford it, winning $120,000 for this tournament and
jumping from fourth place to first on the LPGA tour earnings list
at $645,170, some $44,000 ahead of Liselotte Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   Pak has had the most sensational start of any woman on the tour
since Nancy Lopez won nine tournaments, including five in a row, in
1978. Pak also won the season's second major tournament, the LPGA
Championship. Not since Julie Inkster in 1984 had any rookie won
two majors in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believes she has many more worlds to try to conquer
in golf. ``I have many, many years left,'' she said, noting that
she has much work to do on her game and ``I just start.''
</P>
<P>
   What little suspense there was Sunday afternoon centered on
whether she would break the record for shooting the lowest under
par in an LPGA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is aware of the record,'' said her manager, Steve Kil, as
he walked the course. ``She hopes to break the record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I could make the record if I hit my putts, and shot my
shots,'' she said. ``But it would be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   She began the day 18 under par and needing to shoot 6 under par
for a final round of 65 (she shot a 71 in the opening round) to
break the record of 23 under par, set by Wendy Ward last year in
the Fieldcrest Classic and matched by Lisa Walters in this year's
Oldsmobile Classic, both on par-72 courses.
</P>
<P>
   She birdied the third hole, bogeyed the fourth, then birdied
Nos. 7, 8, 10 and 11. At No. 16, she sank a 25-foot birdie putt to
bring her to 23 under. She walked to the 17th tee and she slapped
outstretched palms with fans straining from the gallery ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on 17, she whacked a strong drive _ too strong. It was in
the low rough to the left. She barely got out of that jam when her
approach shot landed on the apron to the green. She needed a
40-foot putt for a birdie, and missed by inches. On 18, her pitch
shot landed about 18 feet from the pin. If she canned it, the
record was hers.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd hushed. She lined up the shot and stroked it. It
headed for the hole, and ran out of steam about a foot short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooh,'' the crowd groaned. Not Pak. She smiled, hugged Webb,
hugged her caddie, Jeff Cable, and then tossed her ball into the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Se Ri has a good attitude,'' Webb said. ``She's very patient.
I played with her several years ago when we were amateurs. She was
kind of erratic. Not anymore. She's got the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a game that has come a long way from the time her father,
a top amateur golfer in Korea, took his daughter on the course with
him and, to his surprise, saw her swing a club as if she were born
with it. He had been in the construction business, but had fallen
on difficult financial times, so he had a lot of time to work on
his daughter's burgeoning golf game.
</P>
<P>
   His attention was not necessarily met with enthusiasm from his
young charge. ``She was a teen-ager,'' he recalled, through an
interpreter. ``It was hard keeping her from going out and being
with her friends. So I became her father, her brother, her friend.
We went shopping together, we went to movies together _ and we
played golf, working on it sometimes from 5 in the morning to 11 at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, of course, even later. Like midnight, in the
cemetery.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 13:
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the House of Representatives will again take up
consideration of campaign finance reform. By now it is clear that
election-bound legislators are ready to back serious change. The
only question is whether Dick Armey, the majority leader, will keep
his promise to end the dilatory tactics that have kept a fair vote
from taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's vow deserves to be regarded gingerly, given the
Republican leadership's previous record of treachery on this issue.
Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, the Republican leader of the
reform movement, says he believes Armey will keep his word. But
Armey could prove his sincerity right away by setting a schedule
for legislative action that would lead to a straight up-or-down
vote on the core reform bill _ before the House has its next recess
in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, known as Shays-Meehan for Shays and his
Democratic co-sponsor, Martin Meehan of Massachusetts, would close
the soft-money trail that has made a mockery of campaign-finance
laws. Right now, political parties can collect unlimited amounts of
soft money for ``party building'' efforts, which have been
interpreted to cover virtually everything, including campaign
commercials masquerading as ``issue ads.'' Shays-Meehan has already
survived many leadership attempts to weaken or shelve it. But about
70 more amendments and 9 counterproposals are still in the wings.
Since most of them were offered by opponents as delaying tactics,
Armey can make them melt away if he really has the will to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment being debated on Tuesday, offered by John
Doolittle, R-Calif., is typical of opposition tactics. Its backers
are peddling the amendment as a protection for advocacy groups like
the NAACP that want to produce voter guides. But the Shays-Meehan
bill already has specific language exempting voter guides from its
provisions. The real point of the amendment is to gut the bill's
restrictions on the ability of special-interest groups to flood the
airwaves with ``issue ads'' promoting particular candidates during
the 60 days before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional addiction to soft money is reaching epic
proportions. The gaming industry alone recently poured $250,000
into the Republican Senate Campaign Committee, and the Senate
killed a proposal ending the ability of high rollers to write off
losses for tax purposes. The connection between six- and
seven-figure donations and the passage of special-interest
legislation is always fuzzy, but until the soft-money stops, voters
will have a right to be cynical about congressional motives.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies of reform have a friend in the clock, since the
Republican leadership in the Senate is equally determined to delay
the legislation to death. Given their dependence on the megabuck
campaign donations that Shays-Meehan would outlaw, the leaders can
be forced into action only by constant public pressure. When
members of Congress are on the campaign trail looking for support,
voters must demand to know not only how they voted on reform, but
also what steps they took to force a fair vote.

   Los Angeles -- As a group of female comics prepared to take the
stage at Elysium Fields, a clothing-optional club in the canyon
suburbs, one of the audience members offered a piece of advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get nervous, just try to imagine the audience in their
underwear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crowd, of course, was wearing nothing at all Sunday.
The comics, who opted to keep their clothes on, visited Elysium to
present Stand Up Against Domestic Violence, a performance
benefiting Los Angeles area women's shelters and domestic abuse
counseling programs. The event coincided with Elysium's 23rd annual
celebration of National Nude Recreation Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother really wants me to marry a Jewish man, and they're
much easier to pick out here,'' joked comedian Carol Ann Leif in
front of the 25 naked or mostly naked people gathered at Elysium's
outdoor amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   Leif admitted to being nervous about playing to an audience in
the buff, announcing, ``OK, I'm over it,'' after taking her first
look at the group.
</P>
<P>
   Leif is one of several female comics who regularly participate
in benefits for the Theatre of Hope for Abused Women. The
performers were organized by fellow comic Heidi Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   The Theatre of Hope puts on plays every Sunday at the Bitter
Truth Theater in North Hollywood, Calif., and also offers
educational plays and art therapy programs at shelters and
transitional homes for victims of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The comic activists came together to entertain the nudists
Sunday mostly because Elysium's program manager, Betty Lesley
Meltzer, has become involved with Theatre of Hope.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, Elysium is a way to get away from the stresses
of daily life, Meltzer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being into nudity is certainly a nonviolent activity. If
people are left to naturalness they are not prone to violence,''
Meltzer said. ``There's no way you can get hot around the collar
because you don't have a collar.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Gartside, a 44-year-old Arco employee from Santa Monica,
Calif., agreed, saying the atmosphere at Elysium is the perfect
antidote for domestic stress. When he and his wife, who is also a
member, get into an argument, she frequently suggests that he ``go
to the club and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's a little piece of heaven in the metropolis of Los
Angeles where there's no crime and no hate,'' Gartside said. ``Then
I go home and I give my wife a big hug. It's really simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Elysium Fields, a nonprofit educational organization, has called
its eight-acre Topanga Canyon campus home for 30 years, surviving
numerous battles with Los Angeles County over its right to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Lange, whose late father founded the club in 1968, said the
comedy show was just one of many special events it puts on. Some of
the performers wear clothes, others take it all off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a magician perform nude once, and I didn't think he'd
be able to do the tricks without any clothes, but he did,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lange said Elysium offers all sorts of educational programs, all
of them focused on teaching people about ``the wholeness of the
human body.'' The programs include yoga, water dancing, nude figure
drawing, dancing, self-hypnosis and tummy toning. Lange said she
looks forward to working with the Theatre of Hope again.
</P>
<P>
   ``For women escaping from violence, one of the biggest issues is
self-esteem. Our whole thing is about self-acceptance,'' Lange
said. ``We often get people in transition in their lives.''

`LETHAL WEAPON 4' PROVES DEADLY TO WEEKEND COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DAVE MCNARY 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles -- ``Lethal Weapon 4'' blasted the competition with
an estimated $33.1 million at 3,117 theaters nationwide during its
Friday-Sunday opening, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion-laden sequel, with Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
reprising their roles as wisecracking LAPD detectives Martin Riggs
and Roger Murtaugh, came in at the high end of expectations.
Trackers had been wary of the franchise's potential because of
recent poor performances by other sequels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lethal Weapon 4,'' carrying an impressive $120 million price
tag, opened amid a massive promo campaign highlighting such staples
as car crashes, gunplay and the well-established camaraderie
between Gibson and Glover. Reviews were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of action movie people want to see,'' said
analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital Securities. ``Even though
the franchise may seem a bit dated, Mel Gibson is still a huge
draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, head of the Reel Source tracking service, said
the addition of Chris Rock to a cast that included Joe Pesci and
Rene Russo helped bring in African-American viewers. He predicted
that ``Lethal Weapon 4'' will gross $115 million to $120 million
domestically and double that number overseas, where action films
traditionally play well.
</P>
<P>
   Best performance in the series came with ``Lethal Weapon 2'' in
1989 with $147.3 million domestically. For Warner Bros., it was the
biggest opening since ``Twister'' took in $41 million in May 1996
and an indication that the studio's unprecedented slump _ eased
recently by ``City of Angels'' and ``A Perfect Murder'' _ may have
ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio had a pretty solid opening but the real test for
`Lethal Weapon 4' will be next weekend,'' said Bucksbaum, citing
strong expected openings by Sony's costume drama ``The Mask of
Zorro'' and 20th Century Fox's goofy comedy ``There's Something
About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has taken the unusual step of showing sneak previews of
``Mary'' twice, once on Wednesday and again on Sunday. ``The buzz
on `Something About Mary' is incredible,'' Bucksbaum said. ``It's
somewhat crude, but I don't think that bothers anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney's second weekend of ``Armageddon'' delivered solid
returns, with $22.4 million at 3,136 theaters after its opening
fell short of expectations. The asteroid disaster flick has topped
$98 million in a dozen days and could match the $138 million
overall from Paramount's similar offering, the 2-month-old ``Deep
Impact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney has to be relieved that `Armageddon' clearly has decent
legs,'' Rockwell said. The studio spent $140 million to finance the
project and an additional $60 million on marketing worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks SKG's opening of ``Small Soldiers'' followed in
third, with $14 million at 2,539 sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased, especially in a crowded market like
this,'' said distribution chief James Tharp. Exit surveys after
showings of the movie of toys running amok showed strongest support
from young boys with significant backing from young girls and
parents, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's third weekend of ``Dr. Dolittle'' finished a respectable
fourth, with $12.7 million at 2,874 theaters, to give the Eddie
Murphy comedy $89 million after 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's third weekend of ``Mulan,'' with Murphy as the voice of
a wisecracking dragon, came in fifth with $6.8 million at 2,756
theaters to push its 24-day take to nearly $92 million. The
studio's 36th animated movie will finish far above the $100 million
grossed by its ``Hercules'' last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's opening of ``Madeline,'' a family comedy based on the
stories of Ludwig Bemelmans, followed in sixth with a moderate $6.6
million at 1,863 sites.
</P>
<P>
   A quartet of holdovers were battling for the seventh slot, led
by a pair of critical favorites _ Universal's third weekend of
``Out of Sight'' with $3.9 million at 1,975 theaters and
Paramount's sixth weekend of ``The Truman Show'' with $3.7 million
at 2,186 locations.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's fourth weekend of ``The X-Files'' followed in ninth, with
$3.6 million at 1,900 theaters, followed by Disney's fifth weekend
of ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' with $3.3 million at 1,961 sites.
</P>
<P>
   The overall weekend performance topped the same period last
year, led by the $30.5 million second weekend of ``Men In Black''
and the $20.5 million opening of ``Contact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was some make-up this weekend for the slow
Fourth of July and there's a lot more diversified major product,''
Rockwell said. ``The marketplace is truly crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show'' has taken in $116.4 million in 38 days,
making the Jim Carrey project the 111th highest domestic grosser in
Hollywood history, trailing ``Rocky's'' $117.2 million. ``Deep
Impact'' garnered in $400,000 at 602 screens to match ``Platoon''
for 70th place at $137.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's 30th weekend of ``Titanic'' grossed $425,000 at 463
theaters and has now taken in $589 million after 206 days.
``Titanic'' leads ``Star Wars'' as best domestic grosser by $128
million.

OLD-TIMERS RETURN FOR A DAY OF NEW YORK STICKBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MOLLY O'NEILL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cars started arriving on East 111th Street before
8 a.m. Sunday. Most were late-model vehicles. Some had license
plates from as far away as Florida. Each glided into a parking
space like a horse into a barn, instinctively and without question.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, a perfect day to play ball.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, blue and without a shred of the humidity that can cause
arthritic joints to ache, the day was also a custom-made for the
30th annual 111th Street Old-Timers' Games. And car by car, members
of the Bronx Old-Timers stickball team arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the 15 men boast more than 700 years of stickball
play, a collective batting average of .376 and six members in the
Stickball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Playing is a point of honor to this team. It is also a habit, a
reason to gather the old neighborhood, and an exercise in hope.
</P>
<P>
   Their baseball-like game was, after all, once the soul of barrio
life. The sound of their broomsticks slamming pink rubber spaldeen
balls was a signal that all was well on the streets of upper
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after several lean decades, stickball is making a comeback.
At least, that's what the old-timers say. They also say that their
annual exhibition game on East 111th Street inspires young players,
or at least shows them that the streets can be used for something
other than trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' said Charlie Ballard, 79, a retired salesman
who is, as far as anyone knows, the oldest stickball player still
in the game. ``A level playing field, one swing. That's the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the opposing team's pitcher deliver a mean lob, he
said, ``Based on my experience, you grow up playing by those rules,
you grow up a decent man.''
</P>
<P>
   Now playing his 72nd season, Ballard has a lifetime average of
.405 and is a member of the Stickball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   He and his teammates, he said, survived beat cops confiscating
their customized broomsticks _ even before they had broken a window
_ collisions with traffic, alternate-side-of-the-street parking
and, more recently, Rollerbladers.
</P>
<P>
   In moving-on-up from the old barrio, the old-timers have also
survived a veritable stickball diaspora. Still, rare is the Sunday
that local team players do not drive back to East Harlem to pick up
a game. And for the last three decades, even players who have moved
to distant states have returned for the annual game.
</P>
<P>
   Now, not everyone crowding the two blocks between Madison and
Lenox Avenues Sunday credits stickball alone for pulling nearly
5,000 people to the blocks.
</P>
<P>
   There were as well mountains of fried chicken, pulled pork, rice
and beans, empanadas, plenty of beer and a nonstop whir of blenders
whipping up fresh pineapple, coconut milk and rum. And there was
music. And families.
</P>
<P>
   Stickball, Irma Aroni said, may have brought her and her husband
together. But she was dubious about the life lessons the game
imparted. Her husband, John Nocco, has been a stickball pitcher
since ``God have mercy, forever, but at least 60 years now,'' she
said. And while stickball has been good to him, she said, facts are
facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barrio raised the old-timers decent _ it was very tight,
everybody looked after each others' kids,'' she said, motioning to
the group of five old-timers' wives with whom she stood. ``We spent
every Sunday watching them play before we were married and then
when we had young kids.'' she continued. ``But sooner or later, we
all moved up to the Bronx.''
</P>
<P>
   The stickball wives gathered every Sunday to watch the husbands
swing broomsticks, run into fire hydrants and dispute calls. But
the ball dropped with their husbands' generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of our kids played stickball,'' said Julia Martinez,
whose husband, Candido, is a utility player and switch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a barrio thing, and when they moved out of the barrio,
the kids played basketball and football,'' Mrs. Martinez said.
Besides, how could the sons compete with such all-star fathers?
Even in their seventh decade, the old-timers play like maniacs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the grandchildren, that's a different story. ``The
old-timers have mellowed, and a lot of them are trying to get the
grandchildren into it,'' Mrs. Martinez said. ``Charlie and Vito
even give stickball clinics over on 105th,'' she said, referring to
Ballard and Vito Giannone.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Having finally agreed to a playing field that including a birch
sapling as first base, a mutable second based marked only by the
opposing team's infielder and a gutter for third base, four
old-timers gathered with the wives to reminisce over the scrapbook
that Giannone had brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 1941, St. Nicholas Avenue, the day I went through a
window for that fly ball,'' said Giannone, who is also a Stickball
Hall of Fame player. He pulled up his pant leg to display the faded
scars of the resulting 16 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm not saying it wasn't a hustle,'' Ballard said. ``We
stole the brooms from fire escapes, and we played for money.
Everybody bet; the winning team took the pot.'' He said that with
one season's proceeds, he bought a kitchen suite, a bedroom suite
and a living room suite. Beneath the myth of stickball, in other
words, lurked a swindle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We poached everybody to field an unbeatable team, and then we
bragged around and got other blocks to challenge us on their turf,
which was good for us 'cause they raised a lot more money than our
block,'' Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard added that stickball has not been about money since 1967
or thereabouts. Besides, it wasn't just the money they won that
kept him and his teammates from ever getting into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had something good to live for,'' he said. ``We all
looked forward to Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people cheered for Charlie Ballard several minutes
later when he took a regulation one-bounce pitch with a long Ted
Williams stroke.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered even before the ball rocketed toward Madison Avenue
and disappeared. They kept cheering as the septuagenarians battered
their 20- and 30-year-old opponents. Again. The Old-Timers never
lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' said Ballard, softly. He gazed up to the adjacent
apartment building, where people hung cheering from the windows,
and let his blue-rimmed brown eyes rest on the crowded sidewalk,
near the spot where the teams roster had been written in chalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't lost anything yet.''

POLITICAL UNCERTAINITY SHAKES JAPANESE FINANCIAL MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With JAPAN-ELECTION and JAPAN-POLITCS)  
(lh) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's stock markets and currency tumbled Monday
morning, as investors worried about economic disarray following the
severe beating that the governing party took in parliamentary
elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's leaders have been under pressure from abroad for months
to clean up the banking system's morass of bad debts and to lift
the economy out of recession. Though they finally have the
beginnings of a blueprint to tackle the problems, the defeat of the
governing Liberal Democrats suggests that pushing through economic
legislation will be even more difficult than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncertainties are enormous,'' said Russell Jones, chief
economist at Lehman Brothers Japan. ``Who leads Japan? Are we faced
with lower house elections? What does it mean for the process of
putting through the legislation for the bank bailout and tax
cuts?''
</P>
<P>
   In the first 20 minutes of stock trading, the benchmark Nikkei
225 average fell to 15,810.09, down 279.97 points, or 1.74 percent
from its close on Friday. And the yen fell sharply against the
dollar to a one-month low, falling to 144 yen, down from 141.39 in
late trading in New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had been relatively sanguine about the prospects for
economic policy in the last couple of weeks, particularly with talk
about permanent tax reform and a cleanup of the nation's bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the resounding message of protest against the Liberal
Democrats throws into question the ability of the nation's leaders
to push through economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats will now have to work more closely with
the opposition parties to pass legislation, and this is likely to
stall the process.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan's economy was sinking in a recession this spring,
governments abroad were already criticizing the slow pace at which
Japan's parliament was pushing through a $116 billion spending plan
to spur growth _ and that was when the Liberal Democrats had a firm
hand in the governing coalition and when the opposition parties
were extremely weak.
</P>
<P>
   The election results now raise the possibility of calls for an
election in parliament's lower house, where the governing Liberal
Democratic Party currently has a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market rebounded after its initial fall, and in late
morning trading, the Nikkei benchmark stood at 16,023.58, down
66.48, or 0.4 percent, from Friday's close. The yen recovered to
trade at 142.55 near midday. Nonetheless, the market's jitters
themselves are likely to aggravate the problems for the banks and
for the government.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese have been suffering a credit squeeze as the nation's
banks have cut back on their lending around the country. The banks
have also pulled back from lending elsewhere in the region, leading
to credit squeezes in Hong Kong, South Korea and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that part of their capital cushion is made up of
stocks, so as the prices of those stocks fall, there is more
pressure on banks to trim lending to ensure they have enough
capital in proportion to those loans.

ON BASEBALL: HUNDLEY'S RETURN SHAKES UP THE METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Never before has a routine fly ball to left field at
Shea Stadium been greeted with such enthusiasm and such anxiety.
But this was Todd Hundley backtracking on Vladimir Guerrero's
climbing shot into the wind Sunday, and he is not an ordinary
outfielder nor an ordinary Met. Right now, Hundley is Mr. Met, a
sort of savior slogging around in left.
</P>
<P>
   So the fans hollered before Hundley even moved into position to
catch the ball in the third inning. He retreated to the lip where
the grass meets the warning track before reaching up to corral the
ball with both hands for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   The fans kept hollering as Hundley's decent catch apparently
obscured the fact that a catchable looper by Javier Vazquez,
Montreal's pitcher, inexplicably plopped in front of him earlier in
the third after he took two steps back when he should have charged
forward. But Hundley redeemed himself and is 2-for-2 in not being
terribly embarrassing at the new position.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get that one under my belt was a lot of relief,'' Hundley
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Relief for Hundley, for Manager Bobby Valentine and for the
peppier Mets, who stifled the dismal Expos, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight day, the Mets proved they could win,
they proved they could win while hiding Hundley's bat in left and
they proved that they could win while playing their version of
musical outfielders. Actually, Hundley's bat was totally hidden to
the 51,568 fans of baseball and Beanie Babies as he was 0-for-2
with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   But Hundley's presence was huge. Mike Piazza singled in Lenny
Harris from third with the first run when Vazquez, a rookie,
uncorked a fat, 1-2 fastball to Piazza, probably because Hundley
was swinging on deck. Butch Huskey, who lost his spot in the lineup
to Hundley on Saturday, responded with four singles in four
at-bats, and Brian McRae, whose playing status is not as tenuous
because he is the team's only true center fielder, clubbed a
game-turning, two-run homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   McRae, usually a silent sort, pumped his fist after he passed
first. Obviously, the outfield shuffling that Hundley's return has
caused has jostled some egos. Good. The often-moribund Mets needed
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a coincidence? No,'' Hundley said bluntly, when asked
whether his return inspired the other outfielders. ``We've got to
have guys who can contribute. Whatever mix is working, that's what
we're going to have to do. With me coming back and possibly taking
some of their playing time, they're going to have to kick it into
gear. It's a good, healthy situation. I'm not against them. They're
not against me. It brings out the best in all of us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hundley is right. If the Mets are going to even have a chance to
secure a wild-card berth in a season that has included too many
exasperating moments from the bullpen and too many underachieving
moments from the lineup, they need Hundley to bash and they need
the other Mets to feed off Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   So let Huskey traipse past the lineup card that included his
name in right field and suddenly announce that he was in a better
mood Sunday. Hint, hint. Let Bernard Gilkey, who pinch-hit for
Hundley in the seventh because Hundley has a pulled muscle on the
left side of his back and is still hesitant to bat right-handed,
insist that this is not a controversy. Then why did Gilkey even
raise the idea? Let McRae talk about pressure and competition being
an inherent part a major leaguer's life. Fine, then let the
competition continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure every man in here is up to the challenge,'' Gilkey
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Huskey first said that he had nothing to prove, he added:
``Of course, you want to take full advantage of your opportunities.
You can't put too much pressure on yourself. This game is tough
enough. For some reason, I relaxed today.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae minimized the internal competition before saying, ``If you
don't do the job, they're going to find someone else to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. Valentine will do that each day, no matter how he
sugarcoats it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a problem,'' Valentine claimed. ``Everyone wants to
make it a problem. The problem was when we didn't have enough
outfielders for the first 80 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, this is only two victories. Not enough reason to get
giddy or expend too much oxygen discussing the wild card. Still,
the Mets rejoiced a bit because Hundley's presence has rejuvenated
their lineup and their clubhouse. He is their leader even when he
is wearing sunglasses in the outfield instead of a catcher's mask
behind the plate. Hundley is back. The Mets should hope he helps
keep it this intense in Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think that,'' Hundley said. ``I just want to
win. The bottom line is whatever Todd Hundley has to do to help
this team win, I'll do.''

U.S. SOJOURN ENDS IN DEATH BY BURIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Only five months ago, Lucas Gomez helped the eldest
of his six brothers, Luis, make the journey from their home in
Ecuador, squeezed him into the apartment he shared with more than a
dozen compatriots in Corona, Queens, even found him a job at the
construction company where he worked.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Luis, 32, lay in an open casket, his hands folded around
a black rosary. At his feet was a bouquet of red roses and a ribbon
carrying a message from Lucas, 23. ``Siempre Te Recordare,'' it
read _ ``I will always remember you.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gomez's life in America ended Friday afternoon when he was
buried alive in a 6-foot hole. A coworker on a backhoe filled in
the pit at the TriBeCa construction site, apparently unaware that
Gomez was still underground.
</P>
<P>
   About eight hours later, when he learned his brother was
missing, Lucas Gomez _ who had been working for the same company,
Safeway Construction, at another site that day _ summoned several
friends and began digging. In 20 minutes, he recalled, they spotted
his brother's head and called the police.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office, Ellen Borakove,
Sunday described the cause of death as ``asphyxia due to burial in
earth.'' It was ruled an accident, and no one has been charged by
the police. Officials with the federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking immigration papers, Luis Gomez earned about $80 a day
and hoped someday to be able to send money to his wife and their
six children, age 2 to 13, in Ecuador, Lucas said. But first, Luis
had to pay off the the $7,000 that it took to get to America, his
brother said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, no one answered the phone at the Brooklyn
headquarters of Safeway Construction, which had been contracted by
Con Edison to check whether gas and electricity lines were
accurately marked on the utility's maps.
</P>
<P>
   According to OSHA records, Safeway Construction has been cited
at least once, in October 1994, for violating federal rules on
protecting employees during an excavation and on the operation of
hand tools.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Con Edison, Joseph Petta, said he could not
comment on Safeway's safety record, or on whether Con Edison would
continue working with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gomez worked for Safeway Construction for less than two
months, his brother said. The two were last together Friday morning
before Lucas went to work at a construction site in Astoria,
Queens, and Luis headed to lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   When Lucas returned home that evening, the answering machine was
crammed with messages from their boss, inquiring about Luis, who
had apparently disappeared shortly after noon. Lucas Gomez said he
knew then that something had gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he struggled to understand how workers could have been
unaware that his brother remained in the hole. During an
excavation, he said, someone usually checks the pit for tools. ``I
don't know how they couldn't have seen him,'' he said at the wake
Sunday at the Buen Pastor Funeral Home in Corona.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Lucas know quite what the future held for him, only that
he would need to continue working. It will cost about $6,000 to
send Luis back to his hometown, Cuenca _ almost as much as it cost
to bring him to New York.

UNATTENDED BOY DROWNS AT A BRONX BEACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The body of a 12-year-old Bronx boy who had been
swimming at Orchard Beach after it closed was found Sunday about
150 yards from shore, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The police ruled that the drowning of the boy, Hiro Lora of
Morris Heights, was accidental. It was the first drowning at a city
beach this year.
</P>
<P>
   Hiro apparently arrived at the beach with a 15-year-old girl and
her 12-year-old brother about 5:45 p.m. Saturday, said Edward
Skyler, a spokesman for the Department of Parks and Recreation.
Guillermo Neiva, the father of the siblings and the only adult
accompanying the children, stayed in his car in the parking lot and
read, according to Skyler and friends and family of Hiro.
</P>
<P>
   The beach's lifeguards go off duty at 6 p.m., and swimming is
supposed to stop then, Skyler said. The police conduct regular
sweeps of the sliver of sand to make sure no one is swimming, but
beachgoers are permitted to remain on the sand until 8 or 8:30
p.m., when the police clear the beach. Hiro and his friends, who
were at the border of Sections 8 and 9, about halfway down the
beach's 1.1 mile-long crescent, apparently continued going in and
out of the water after 6 p.m., Skyler said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's friends last saw him in knee-deep water about 8:30
p.m., the police said. At 8:45 p.m., Neiva reported Hiro missing,
and the police began a search using scuba, harbor and aviation
units. Bloodhounds tracked Hiro's scent to the water, but the
search was called off because of darkness. The search resumed
Sunday, and the police found the boy's body at 11:50 a.m., said a
Police Department spokeswoman, Officer Lee Ann Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   Parks officials said that the last drowning at the beach, which
is just west of Long Island Sound, was in 1996, when a 51-year-old
man who was intoxicated went swimming at night and drowned.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity said there
did not seem to be a strong undertow or changing currents Saturday
night. But Skyler noted that the water's depth increases sharply,
from 5 to 15 feet, about 150 yards from shore, where Hiro's body
was found.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just headed into the water and got in over his
head,'' the investigator said of the boy. ``From what I understand,
he could swim a little, but nothing spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy's friends and family, who gathered Sunday night at his
apartment to console his mother, Teresa Lora, said Neiva had
originally planned to take the children to a swimming pool, but
took them to the beach, without Ms. Lora's permission, because the
pool was closed. Neiva was among those at the Loras' apartment
Sunday night, but he refused to comment on the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Lora, a home care attendant originally from the Dominican
Republic, lay on her only child's bed Sunday night, saying that she
felt a ``big sadness.'' Her son, who she brought from the Dominican
Republic six years ago, wanted to become a doctor, she said, ``to
help poor people and build me a big house in the Dominican
Republic.'' Friends said he was a good student who often cooked for
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole family talked about his future,'' said Daulin Guzman,
18, a friend. ``He was so certain what he wanted to do.''

 &HT;    A spectacle of worldly proportions
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three billion people watched it. The Buddhist son of Algerian
immigrants scored the first two goals. Two men who work for Arsenal
in North London engineered the final goal. The winning captain
spends winters playing in Turin. The losing captain has lately been
based in Japan, which will serve as co-host with South Korea when
next this event convenes. It really is a World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous team on the planet was supposed to win again but
did not. The holders were unhorsed by a team representing a country
that deems soccer secondary to rugby. Of the 11 men who started for
France on Sunday, nine play elsewhere professionally. The Coupe de
Monde usually belongs to those nations that consider football among
life's essentials, alongside food and shelter. Which only goes to
show that passion can be overrated.
</P>
<P>
   Or can it? Belying that sophisticated reputation, France backed
its stylistically challenged team with a fervor found normally ...
well, pretty much everywhere else in the world. The rap on this
French side was that it had no strikers, no goal scorers. This was
half-right. The French played four games in the tournament's
knockout stages, and no striker scored a goal. But midfielders and
even defenders did, which only goes to show that hard work cannot
be overrated.
</P>
<P>
   The midfielder Zinedine Zidane was Sunday's star, scoring twice
on headers. Zidane's reputation as a big-game player had taken a
beating lately; he'd been nigh-invisible in consecutive Champions
League finals with his club Juventus. But those were only for
European supremacy. This was for the whole wide world. Twice Zidane
rose on precise set pieces, the Brazilians' notorious inattention
to detail finally their undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo was the invisible man this day. (Speculation holds that
he was hurt _ a knee, an ankle, something.) The Brazilian midfield
was overrun by Youri Djorkaeff. Roberto Carlos, who'd scored the
Goal of the Decade on a bending free kick against France last
summer, got nothing done. With better finishing by the hapless
Stephane Guivarc'h, the French might well have won 6-nil.
</P>
<P>
   There was no single MVP in this World Cup. There were four. The
French defenders _ Marcel Desailly and Laurent Blanc in the middle,
Lilian Thuram and Bixente Lizarazu on the wings _ draped an iron
curtain over the penalty area, yielding but two goals (one on a
penalty kick) in five weeks. The French keeper Fabien Barthez
authored all manner of tactical blunders but was never made to pay.
Even with Blanc suspended for Sunday's game, even with the mighty
Desailly ejected in the 68th minute, the French defense was so
well-grounded that fearsome Brazil could find no space.
</P>
<P>
   And then it was over, Patrick Viera feeding Emmanuel Petit to
clinch it. In all of sports, nothing matches the winning of a World
Cup for sheer spectacle. That the hosts won this one made it
exponentially stirring. As the gallant French players embraced
victory and one another, TV kept cutting to the Arc de Triomphe and
the masses gathered underneath, and it looked like the prettiest
sight in ... well, the world.

TRAFFIC DEATHS FALL SHARPLY IN NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - The number of pedestrians and bicyclists killed by
drivers in New York City declined sharply in the first five months
of year, putting the city on a pace to reach record low,
preliminary police records show.
</P>
<P>
   The figures, which were obtained by a pedestrian advocacy group,
Transportation Alternatives, show that from Jan. 1 to June 3 of
this year, 71 pedestrians and bicyclists were killed by motor
vehicles _ a 36 percent drop from the same period in 1997, in which
111 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   All year long, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has vigorously pushed
traffic enforcement as a means to make New York City safer:
instructing the police to erect pedestrian barricades, hand out
more speeding tickets, discourage jaywalking and install new signs
informing drivers that the speed limit is 30 miles per hour in most
places.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears that those efforts are beginning to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Extrapolated to year's end, the number of pedestrians and
bicyclists killed in the city would be about 168 _ which would be
significantly lower than the previous low of 245 in 1996, said John
Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised by the magnitude of the reduction,'' Kaehny
said. ``Something good is happening right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But as is so often the case in the world of statistics and data
collection, several caveats must be mentioned. For one thing, the
corresponding five-month figure for years before 1997 was not
immediately available on Sunday night, according to the police. For
another, projections are always just that, subject to unusual or
unexpected circumstances _ warmer weather in the final months of
the year, for example, meaning more people outside and more chances
of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several bits of important information that would
offer a more complete picture were not immediately available, said
Charles Komanoff, a pedestrian safety advocate and board member of
the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit group. These
include a borough-by-borough breakdown, the total number of crashes
and injuries, and the number of summonses for moving violations.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, statistical adjustments aside, there appears little
doubt about the general trend related to pedestrian deaths: down.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1898 that New York City had its first pedestrian
killed by a motor vehicle, Kaehny noted. And during the 1940s and
50s, sometimes more than 1,000 pedestrians and bicyclists were
killed a year.
</P>
<P>
   But in subsequent decades, that figure began to dwindle, thanks
to better emergency medical care and improved school busing. The
fading of the unbridled, but occasionally dangerous, game of
stickball to a warm memory also did not hurt those statistics,
Kaehny said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, traffic deaths for pedestrians and bicyclists stood at
365. Then came a drop that has since leveled off at around 250
deaths. Until this year, that is, if the numbers hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at record lows at this point, based on those
preliminary figures,'' said David Billig, a spokesman for the
city's Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   At the current pace, New York would be approaching the numbers,
per capita, posted by London, long considered a model of
pedestrian-safety policy and planning, Kaehny said. About 15 years
ago, London introduced a campaign to reduce speeding through
widespread advertising, camera-activated enforcement and speed
bumps. The results were remarkable, as the number of pedestrian
fatalities declined dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   This time, New York transportation advocates and city officials
attributed the sharp decline to the Giuliani administration's
multipronged campaign to make the city's famously incorrigible
drivers a little more law-abiding.
</P>
<P>
   In March, for instance, the city unveiled a much-publicized
``zero tolerance'' day, in which police officers used hand-held
radar guns and unmarked cruisers to catch speeding motorists, and
installed more than 1,100 new signs informing motorists of the
speed limit.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 224 speeding tickets was issued that day, more than
75 the usual daily total. And the show of force, by all accounts,
intimidated some motorists into easing up a little on the
accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these initiatives are focused on raising public awareness
about traffic safety,'' said Billig.

EDITORIAL: BAD BARGAIN IN AFGHANISTAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, July 13:
</P>
<P>
   Women are essentially under house arrest in Afghanistan. The
Taliban, a fundamentalist Islamic group that runs most of the
country, has issued edict after edict keeping women and girls from
studying, working, receiving medical care and even leaving their
homes. International organizations and private relief groups want
to help women, but to get permission they need to compromise with
the Taliban. The question of how far to go has no good answer, but
an agreement the United Nations signed recently is a terrible
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations decided a written agreement was necessary
after it had to stop all but emergency work in Afghanistan in
March. The problem was Taliban restrictions, especially one forcing
all Islamic women aid workers to be accompanied by a father,
brother or husband when in public.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement makes no progress on this front. It commits the
Taliban to refrain from arresting or harassing U.N. workers and to
allow the United Nations to build some schools and improve the
largest women's hospital, which has no medicine, equipment or
running water. In return, however, the United Nations put its
signature on language that endorses some of the Taliban's most
extreme discrimination _ for example, that resumption of health
care and education for women ``will need to be gradual.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a compromise might be justified if it were the only way to
maintain lifesaving work with women. But a spokeswoman said the
United Nations needs to be in Afghanistan to coordinate its
projects, which other groups carry out, and to maintain its
credibility with Afghans. This the agreement will not help.
</P>
<P>
   Since the agreement, the Taliban has decreed the closure of home
schools for girls older than 8. It has ordered all relief groups to
move into a compound with no running water or electricity. It has
ordered that medical care be denied to women not accompanied by a
close male relative _ which given the number of men killed in the
war, many women lack. There is no easy way to work with a
government so willing to sacrifice half its people. But the United
Nations should not lead the Taliban to believe that anyone outside
endorses its bizarre views.

VOTERS REBUKE JAPAN'S GOVERNING PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to update performance of Japanese stocks in graf 8)  (lh) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Voters in parliamentary elections on Sunday gave Japan's
governing party a brutal drubbing, setting the stage for the
resignation of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and creating new
uncertainties about the country's political and economic course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are attributable to my lack of ability,'' a grim
Hashimoto told Japanese television early Monday morning. ``We could
not live up to the people's expectations, and it is all my
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He strongly hinted that he would resign after meeting later
Monday with officials of his Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   But while the voters were apparently punishing the confusion and
lack of decisiveness in the government as it faces Japan's worst
economic crisis in more than half a century, the election result
may create more disarray than ever in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows who will lead the country _ whose economy is second
only to that of the United States in size _ as it tries to
extricate itself from recession, or what will happen to Japan's
recently announced plans to deal with its mountain of bad loans
held by banks.
</P>
<P>
   It will now be harder than ever for the Liberal Democrats to
govern Japan and push economic legislation through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   None of the main contenders for the prime minister's job is the
kind of new and dynamic leader that many Japanese say they want,
and that the United States and other countries fervently desire.
There is some risk that the job will go from a man who exhibited
little leadership to a rival who has shown absolutely none.
</P>
<P>
   In an early verdict on the result, currency traders sent the yen
plunging in trading against the dollar Monday morning. Japanese
stocks also tumbled initially, though they rebounded by midday and
the currency recovered somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   The markets would have tumbled more if it were not for the
possibility that the election shock may force the Liberal Democrats
_ who have changed policy in the past in reaction to electoral
defeat _ to become more aggressive in tackling the nation's
economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   There may now be more possibility of tax cuts and of another
economic stimulus package, although it is not clear that there will
be any push for the kind of market-oriented reorganization that
many economists urge.
</P>
<P>
   The elections on Sunday were for the upper house of parliament,
not the more important lower house, so they do not directly affect
Hashimoto's post as prime minister or his party's lock on power.
But he billed the election as a referendum on his leadership, and
the party won only 44 of the 126 seats up for election this year.
</P>
<P>
   That was still far more than the 27 seats won by the leading
opposition group, the Democratic Party, but far less than the 61
seats that the Liberal Democrats held going into the election.
</P>
<P>
   Other seats were won by the Communists, who did exceptionally
well as a winner of protest votes, and by independents and other
groups in Japan's deeply fragmented opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval comes at an odd time in the Japanese political
world, when the country is neither the one-party state it used to
be nor a Western-style system where parties go in and out of power.
The Liberal Democrats traditionally ran the country with only token
opposition, but they were evicted from power in 1993 after a poor
election performance and a series of defections by members of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, many thought that old-style Japanese politics were
gone forever, but a year later, the Liberal Democrats clawed their
way back to power as part of a coalition. Then Hashimoto took over
as prime minister in January 1996 and led the Liberal Democrats in
a long slog in which they managed to regain majority control of the
lower house of parliament, so that five years later the situation
is much as it was before _ but with much less sense of expectation
that the political system can be a vehicle for far-reaching change
any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   While Sunday's vote was an unambiguous rebuke of the Liberal
Democrats, it is less clear whether it was a vote in favor of
anything. By most accounts, the voters were simply annoyed by the
Liberal Democrats' lack of strong leadership at a time of national
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest reason is the lack of economic recovery,'' Taku
Yamasaki, a Liberal Democratic leader, told NHK Television.
Yamasaki said that the top party officials, including Hashimoto and
himself, should resign, but he added that he worries about the
impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if something happens like the collapse of a financial
institution while our financial restructuring scheme is still
unfinished?'' Yamasaki mused. ``I'm very worried about the power
vacuum created by this election result.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto had planned to go to Washington for a state visit
later this month, but that will almost certainly be called off or
postponed until a new leader is in place. The Liberal Democrats
will be under strong pressure to act within a week to choose a
replacement, and probably to summon parliament into session so a
new person can formally take the prime minister's post.
</P>
<P>
   The main contenders are Keizo Obuchi, the foreign minister and
leader of the largest faction in the Liberal Democratic Party;
Seiroku Kajiyama, a veteran politician who was the chief Cabinet
spokesman for a time under Hashimoto; Kiichi Miyazawa, a former
prime minister; and Yohei Kono, who had been the Liberal Democratic
leader until he resigned to make way for Hashimoto. Whoever takes
over, fundamental changes are not expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LDP has a firm lock on power in the lower house, and
that's not going to change,'' said John Neuffer, an analyst of
Japanese politics at the Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo,
speaking of the Liberal Democratic Party. ``Hashimoto was being
pulled around by his nose by party elders, and whoever is in there
is going to continue party-established policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuffer said that while financial markets will be jittery, the
humiliation may encourage the Liberal Democrats to become more
aggressive in tackling bad debt problems, cutting taxes and
approving a new economic stimulus package.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, I think this is good for the nation and the
world, but in the short term I think everybody's going to be
nervous,'' Neuffer said.
</P>
<P>
   One important winner was the Democratic Party, which
consolidated its role as the leading opposition force. While the
party is a poorly organized and newly formed coalition of various
factions, it shows hints that it may eventually emerge as a
Western-style opposition force, distinguishing itself from the
governing party on issues and seen by voters as a credible
alternative force.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party is led by Naoto Kan, who opinion polls
suggest is by far Japan's most popular politician. Kan, who made
his name as a Cabinet minister crusading against the bureaucracy,
will now push to build his party's organization so it can wrest
power from the Liberal Democrats in general elections that must be
held by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take it very seriously that the new-born Democratic Party
has been given a chance by the people,'' a jubilant Kan told
reporters at his party headquarters. ``People said no to what the
Liberal Democratic Party has done. They realized that the Liberal
Democratic Party cannot reform, is totally bound by special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People rejected the bureaucracy-led government,'' Kan added,
calling for early elections for the lower house as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ichiro Ozawa, who once was the main opposition leader but now
heads only a small opposition party, said, ``I think lower house
elections are inevitable.'' The Liberal Democrats may see things
differently, however, since they would almost certainly lose ground
in a general election.
</P>
<P>
   With the election, Hashimoto becomes the latest in a series of
politicians who entered the prime minister's residence strong and
self-confident but left ignominiously with their reputations in
tatters. When Hashimoto took office, he was welcomed
enthusiastically as a dynamic leader who was an expert on policy
issues. He was thought to offer a sharp contrast to his
predecessor, Tomiichi Murayama, a grandfatherly socialist who was
widely viewed as extremely nice and extremely lackadaisical.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto initially did indeed exhibit leadership and
decisiveness, but in retrospect he chose to exercise it in the
wrong way: He pushed through an increase in the national sales tax
from 3 percent to 5 percent. It was a bold and politically
courageous attempt to put Japan's finances on a better footing, but
it turned out to be economically catastrophic, tipping the nation
into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Hashimoto proved much less firm in tackling the
recession. He eventually pushed through a large stimulus package,
but it took so long to put it into place that the economy tumbled
in the meantime and further endangered the country's weak banks.

A BRUTAL NIGHT CLAIMS NELSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ If a boxing card can be measured by the number of
participants who landed in the hospital, then the show at the
Alamodome on Saturday night was brutal. And perhaps no one felt the
sting worse than Azumah Nelson, the three-time world champion who
may have fought the last fight of an illustrious career.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 39, broke his left hand in the fifth round, on his way
to losing a 12-round decision to James Leija. He was taken to
Baptist Memorial Hospital shortly after the fight for X-rays. He
followed Troy Dorsey, who went to the hospital for stitches to
close deep cuts over both eyes that brought an end to his bout
against Gabriel Ruelas at 1 minute 25 seconds of the sixth round.
</P>
<P>
   And Tracy Harris Patterson (61-6-1) went to the hospital for
stitches in his lower lip, which was severely cut by a punch from
Goyo Vargas (37-6-1) in the second round. The fight was stopped at
1:02 of the sixth round after swelling shut Patterson's right eye.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for the losers were not bright. Dorsey's loss to
Ruelas (45-4) was his eighth in his last 12 bouts and dropped his
record to 15-11-4. And in the ring after the fight, Nelson (39-5-2)
hinted that he might retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe yes, maybe no,'' Nelson said when asked whether he would
retire. ``I have to go home and think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has many things to keep him busy at his home outside
Accra, Ghana. He owns a teakwood plantation and ceramic tile and
cooking-utensil factories, and has a large family _ a wife and six
children.
</P>
<P>
   One thing was certain: there will not be a fifth fight against
Leija, because Leija does not want one. Nelson's record against
Leija is now 1-2-1. Outside of the broken hand, Nelson was not
battered in this fight. But he could not beat Leija (36-3-2) as he
had done in 1996 when he stopped him in the sixth round.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson fought cautiously during the early rounds, which he lost.
Even though he was more aggressive after the fifth round, he could
not make up the lost ground. Nelson won no more than four rounds on
any of the three judges' scorecards, and one gave Nelson only two
rounds, the fourth and the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a real tough fight, but it was nothing different from
the first three,'' Leija said. ``I had a great barrier in front of
me. In the fifth, sixth and seventh rounds, I didn't know what was
going to happen. After what happened in the sixth round in the last
fight, I was just wanting to get past the sixth round.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Leija said he was not aware that Nelson had broken his hand in
the fifth round. The hard-hitting Nelson could never bait Leija
into the kind of slugfest that would have been beneficial to him.
Nonetheless, after the fight, Leija's face looked like he had stuck
his head into a hornet's nest. Big red lumps covered his forehead,
and his right eye was completely closed. There was an accidental
head butt in the 10th round that opened a cut inside Leija's right
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Leija, his manager, Lester Bedford, and his promoter, Dan
Goosen, believe his showing against the wily Nelson has catapulted
him into the lightweight championship mix, which now includes
Arturo Gatti, Kevin Kelley, Shane Mosley and Prince Naseem Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``James is the type of fighter who fits perfectly into HBO's
130- to 135-pound picture,'' Goosen said.
</P>
<P>
   For Goosen, this fight card dovetailed nicely with his Aug. 15
pay-per-view show in El Paso, Texas. Miguel Angel Gonzalez, who
defeated Alexis Perez on a fifth-round technical knockout, will be
on the Aug. 15 show, fighting John Molina. The main event will be
Rafael Ruleas versus Kostya Tszyu in an elimination bout to
determine the No. 1 contender for the World Boxing Council's
lightweight title.
</P>
<P>
   All of the winners on Saturday night's card were Hispanic
fighters, and Goosen said he will cater to the Hispanic audience
for the El Paso show by adding the featherweights Luisito Espinosa
of the Philippines and Juan Carlos Ramirez of Juarez, Mexico, to
the card.

BURTON WARMS TO YANKEE HOSPITALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ For the second straight year, a dominating
performance by Jeff Burton turned the Jiffy Lube 300 into a game of
follow the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Burton blew by Jeff Gordon on the 78th lap and after that was
never in danger of losing his lead. Leading for 191 of the 300
laps, Burton won this NASCAR race at the New Hampshire
International Speedway for the second straight year, finishing
7.439 seconds ahead of Mark Martin. Gordon was a distant third.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, there was little excitement and even fewer meaningful
passes as Burton's No. 99 Ford Taurus roared around the 1.058-mile
oval, leading by almost a full straightaway for the final 60 laps.
Burton, the ninth different winner in 17 races on the circuit this
season, turned Sunday's fastest lap at 29.927 seconds and averaged
102.996 miles per hour in a race slowed by six cautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a dominant car,'' said Burton, whose victory was
the fourth of his Winston Cup career. ``It was just one of those
days when you mash the gas and the car goes, and you turn the wheel
and the thing steers. It's the kind of day a race driver dreams
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he ever worried that he might be caught, Burton
said: ``No. Not today. I can't say that often, but we were right
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the postponement of last week's Pepsi 400 in Daytona
Beach, Fla., because of widespread fires, Sunday's race was the
midpoint of the 33-event Winston Cup series. And with 16 races
remaining, Gordon held onto his slim lead in the championship.
Martin improved his rank in the points race from third to second,
trailing Gordon by only 52 points. Dale Jarrett, who finished
seventh, moved up to third and is 98 points behind. Jeremy
Mayfield, whose right front tire blew with only five laps left in
the race, finished 30th and fell from second to fourth in the
points competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to look at the championship now,'' said Gordon, who
led for 73 laps Sunday and has nine top-10 finishes in his last 10
races. ``Every point, every position really counts out here as
tight as the championship is. Mark Martin has been consistently
strong everywhere we've gone. We've been fortunate to finish ahead
of him a few times, but I don't expect that to happen every
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory did not improve Burton's Winston Cup
championship hopes since he remained in eighth place, 393 points
behind Gordon.

<P>
   Ricky Craven's 29th-place finish was probably not what he was
hoping for, but for him, this weekend still had its moments.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, at the place Craven considers his home track, he
climbed into the cockpit of a Winston Cup car for the first time
since his crash last March in Atlanta, where he sustained a severe
concussion, and drove his Chevrolet to the front of the field.
</P>
<P>
   As Craven entered Turn 3 on Friday afternoon, he surely did not
look like a driver who had been away from the circuit for more than
four months recuperating from post-concussion syndrome. His
pole-winning qualifying time was more than a half-second faster
than that of his teammate, Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could touch the 99,'' Gordon said of Burton's
overpowering performance. ``He was so strong. He was definitely in
a different league than us.''
