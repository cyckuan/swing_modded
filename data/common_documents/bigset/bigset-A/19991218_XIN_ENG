<HEADLINE> Maasai Cultural Museum Launched in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A museum reflecting the
culture and the way of life of Kenya's Maasai tribe was launched
Friday in the famous Maasai Mara Natural Reserve in southwestern
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to the Maasai tradition, there was no opening speech
for the launching of the museum, which started with the Maasai
custom for slaughtering a cow, and dancing and singing performed
by Maasai young men and women.
</P>
<P>
The Maasai Cultural Museum is about 260 kilometers from the
capital Nairobi. Covering an area of over 1,500 square meters, it
is on a flat ridge among the bushes, completely harmonized with
natural surroundings.
</P>
<P>
The museum consists of four Maasai-style houses built of
branches and cow dung, and two workshops.
</P>
<P>
One of the houses is decked with portraits of all prominent
Maasai elders. Two other houses, the male and female rooms,
contain items used in the daily life of the Maasai men and women.
In another house are displayed Maasai artefacts used for rites of
passage such as animal leather clothes, ceremonial hats made of
fur and feather, wedding necklaces, spears, bows and knives.
</P>
<P>
In the two workshops, one for men and one for women, tourists
can learn how to make the beautiful Maasai items including
jewellery, and how to use such items as spears, bow and arrows.
</P>
<P>
Maasai, one of the major tribes in Kenya, is mainly scattered
in the south and southwest parts bordering Tanzania and the tribe
is still living in nomadic way.
</P>
<P>
John ole Tome told Xinhua that the purpose of building the
museum is to educate Maasai children with the centuries-old rich
Maasai culture, and it will also serve as a bridge between the
Western culture and Maasai traditional culture.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Health Sector Ready to Cope With Emergency Regarding Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Health Ministry has made
an array of plans to deal with emergency regarding the millennium
problem of its computer systems, an official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Taisir Sawi, director of the National Data Center for Health and
Population, told the country's Middle East News Agency that the
ministry has adjusted all its computer systems and medical
equipment to ward off the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
An emergency department has been set up in the national center
with three telephone and three satellite lines to deal with any
mishaps, said the official, who supervises the Health Ministry plan
to redress the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
Most older computers, computerized equipment and software
programs were programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a
year. These computers may misread the year 2000 as 1900, causing
technical malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
The millennium problem might affect the computer systems for
electricity, water, payrolls, elevators and gas pumps.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has announced that its government ministries and agencies
and the public sector, including health care, have been secured
against the Y2K bug.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Double Its Size in Five Years: Gates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) - Microsoft maybe one of the world
's best-known software companies but it is not as big as people
think it is, its Chairman Bill Gates says.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview in the latest edition of Business
Voice, the Confederation of British Industry's magazine, Gates
suggests that the company has not become too large and hints that
the firm could double in size over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
"You might think we are the biggest company in the computer
industry but we are not in the top ten. By sales or by headcount
we are nowhere near the biggest," Gates admits.
</P>
<P>
"IBM has ten times as many people as we do and there are lots
of companies that have three or four times as many people. And yet
out impact has been much beyond our size," he adds.
</P>
<P>
Looking five years ahead, Gates expects: "There's a chance we
could be about double the size we are if we do our job well."
</P>
<P>
"By then some great things like readable screens, wireless
networks, handwriting and speech recognition will be quite
pervasive," he says.

<P>
LUANDA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Angola's human development
index for 1999 has reduced to 0.34 points from 0.35 in 1998,
according to a report on the human development in Angola issued by
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The civilian organizations were considered by the report as the
main force promoting the human development among the population.
</P>
<P>
In many provinces beyond the reach of the government's power,
where the population live in dire need of assistance, especially
in the central provinces, civilian organizations have been playing
prominent roles, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that the capacity of those organizations
should be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Justice Minister Paulo Tchipilica said he hopes that
the society and institutions can collaborate with the government
on the cause of eradicating poverty and creating better conditions
for the future generations.
</P>
<P>
Angola takes the 160th place in a list of 174 countries,
according to another report published by the UNDP in July this

<HEADLINE> China Abstains from Vote on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Chinese side does not favor such an approach, nor can it
support such a draft resolution. Therefore, we have no choice but
to abstain from the vote," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
China, one of the five permanent members of the Security
Council, believes that in formulating new comprehensive Council
policies towards Iraq, at least three core issues will have to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
The three core issues include a new inspection commission to
be established to replace the infamous UNSCOM and the new
institution must be "objective, impartial, transparent and
accountable."
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM, established in line with the Security Council
Resolution 687 on April 3, 1991, halted functioning after the
United States and Britain launched air strikes at Iraq last
December. Russia and China have been critical of it for acting
presumptuously without authorization by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"You may further recall that on such a crucially important
issue as its withdrawal from Iraq, UNSCOM bypassed the Council and
made the decision all on its own. It is our demand as well as firm
belief that the new inspection commission must not repeat the path
of UNSCOM. Its activities must be objective and accountable and
the Council must exercise absolute control and supervision over it,
" said the Chinese ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the yet-to-be-established new inspection
commission should be sent to Iraq on a true fact-finding mission
and the list of key remaining tasks should be reviewed and
approved by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also called on Iraq to undertake to
address these tasks in accordance with approved list and to
accomplish its disarmament obligations as soon as possible so that
the Security Council will lift all sanctions accordingly and in a
timely manner.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Qin also drew worldwide attention to the plight of
the Iraqi people, calling for prompt actions to ease their
humanitarian sufferings.
</P>
<P>
"The nine-year-long sanctions have inflicted untold physical
and psychological sufferings on Iraqi civilians, especially women
and children...the Council, therefore, has every justification to
remove, rather than prolong, the humanitarian sufferings of the
Iraqi people," he said.
</P>
<P>
China maintains that the draft resolution, reinstatement of
disarmament inspections and suspension of sanctions against Iraq
should be linked together. While Iraq is gradually honoring its
disarmament commitment and achieving progress, the Council should
move, timely, to suspend the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"If the new commission reports positively to the Council on
Iraq's cooperation in addressing the key remaining tasks, the
suspension of sanctions can and should be extended automatically,"
Ambassador Qin said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Party Demands Recounting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the main
opposition party, Mozambican National Resistance (Renamo), Friday
demanded a "manual recount" of all the results from the country's
second general elections held on December 3-5, the Mozambique News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Jose de Castro, a Renamo appointed member of the National
Elections Commission, made the call when the preliminary results
from the 11 provinces indicate a win for the ruling Mozambique
Liberation Front Party (Frelimo) and for incumbent President
Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
Castro said that his party would put a formal demand before the
election commission for a manual recount "because the computers
are giving us lots of problems."
</P>
<P>
But so far there has been just one proven instance of computer
fraud in the elections. And it was committed by Renamo technical
staff in the northern province of Nampula, who were caught
altering data to reduce the number of Chissano/Frelimo votes.
</P>
<P>
What Castro meant by a recount was to collect all the over
8,300 polling station notices, centralize them, check their
figures, and add them all up.
</P>
<P>
This would be a time-consuming business, and would certainly
postpone any definitive results into the new year.
</P>
<P>
The final results are scheduled to be officially announced
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> French Court to Judge Nazi Criminal in Absentia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- A French court will judge Nazi
criminal Alois Brunner in absentia for crimes against humanity he
committed by deporting 24,000 French Jews to death camps in
Germany and eastern European countries during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted French judicial authorities as
saying on Friday that the case of Brunner, who was described as ``
the engineers of the final solution'' of Adolf Hitler, has been
sent by the Appeal Court of Paris to the Assize Court.
</P>
<P>
Brunner was last seen in Syria years ago and it is not known
whether he is still alive today.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1912 in Austria, he was accused by the French justice
of deporting 24,000 Jews from 1943 to 1944 to death camps when he
was the chief of the Nazi concentration center in Drancy north of
Paris, which was used to temporarily jail Jews destined for death.

<HEADLINE> G8 FMs End Meeting in Discord Over Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, December 17 (Xinhua)--Foreign Ministers of the G8
nations Friday ended their two-day meeting in Berlin, passing a
statement on conflict prevention in discord over Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In their statement, ministers of the seven leading
industrialized nations and Russia said, "UN Charter confers the
primary responsibility for maintenance of international peace and
security upon the Security Council," and "UN Secretary General
also has an important role in this respect."
</P>
<P>
 G8 ministers called for "full adherence to, and when required,
further strengthening of disarmament and arms control agreement,"
saying it was "corner stones of international peace and strategic
stability."
</P>
<P>
They agreed to instruct their political directors to "use
appropriate means...to contribute to the preparation of the range
of conflict prevention issues."
</P>
<P>
Further discussion over the issue will be held at the next G8
Foreign Ministers meeting scheduled for next July in Miyazaki,
Japan
</P>
<P>
The ministers underlined the UN Charter as the first principle
to prevent armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
But not like what they said in the statement, the west again
tried to intervene in Russia's internal affair. German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer, who hosted the meeting as G8 chairman ,
said Russia's military operations in Chechnya would hurt its ties
to the west.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, representing his counterparts from the U.S., Britain,
France Italy, Canada and Japan, said Russia should stop its
military actions in Chechnya to "to avoid civilian casualties."
</P>
<P>
He also called on Russia to begin political dialogue with
Chechen authorities.
</P>
<P>
A Northern Caucasus regional conference, including all
neighboring countries and coordinated by outside body such as the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), is "
necessary for regional stability," Fischer said at the final press
briefing after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Russia to seek a "peaceful, political solution" in
Chechnya and Northern Caucasus after its Duma election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer used "Chechen war" to depict the situation there,
saying "this war is a serious threaten to the partnership to
Russia."
</P>
<P>
The west interference in Russia's interior policy was rejected
by Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who had told the
Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that the west's accusation
on Russia was based on "a shortage of objective information."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov did not take part in the final briefing for "time
constraints, " Fischer explained.

baht defense battle against international currency speculators in
May 1997,forcing the then government, headed by former prime
minister Chavalit Yoongchaiyudh, to devalue the baht two months
later, which triggered the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed in August 1997 to
provide Thailand with a 17.2 billion dollar rescue package to help
the Southeast Asian "tiger" fight the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Chuan Leekpai government, which succeeded the
former one in November 1997, managed to restore the country's
international reserves to about 32 billion dollars in two years'
time.
</P>
<P>
Thailand decided in September this year to suspend withdrawing
the remaining funds from the IMF rescue package after drawing some
14 billion dollars from it.

<HEADLINE> Britain Demands Explanation Over Japan Nuclear Energy Refusal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) - The British government on Friday
demanded a full explanation from British Nuclear Fuels Limited(
BNFL) on why Japan rejected a controversial shipment of plutonium
from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The demand was made after Japanese nuclear generator Kansai
Electric confirmed that one of its Power Station would not be
using mixed oxides from BNFL, which had already been delivered in
October, after quality assurance irregularities came to light.
</P>
<P>
"I have demanded a full explanation of this clearly
unacceptable failure by management." British Energy Minister Helen
Liddell said in a statement issued by the Department of Trade and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Liddell also met Hugh Collum, chairman of state-owned BNFL, to
discuss the government's "very grave concerns" about the
falsification of quality control data at BNFL.
</P>
<P>
"I made it clear that steps must be taken to address this
failure and to examine management performance generally. I want to
be assured that will not happen again," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear that BNFL quality control processes have gone
badly wrong," said Liddell.

RIO DE JANEIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- World football

being made against the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) by

<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Friday that it
expected the United Nations Security Council to agree a new
resolution on Iraqi sanctions at a vote on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"The new resolution on Iraq is likely to be agreed at the
United Nations at 1045 New York time," a spokesman for Prime
Minister Tony Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a tough but fair resolution," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the new resolution would include an improved oil-for-
food program to assist Iraqi civilians.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, if reached, will make an end of sanctions
conditional on Iraq's full compliance with 120 days of weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
It will automatically lift the revenue cap on Iraqi oil sales
under the oil-for-food program, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But he made no comment on how the other members of the 15-
strong Security Council were expected to vote.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's CP Companies to Form "Kitchen of World" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's agro-industrial
giant,Charoen Pokphand Group (CP), revealed its ambition to be "
kitchen of the world" by merging all of its livestock and
agricultural businesses in Thailand into one, the group announced
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Charoen Pokphand Feedmill Public Company Ltd. changed its name
to Charoen Pokphand Foods Public Company Ltd. (CPF), acquiring
three of the group's listed companies on the Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET)by share swapping in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
The delisting date of the three companies will be on December
20,1999, the group said in a press release Friday.
</P>
<P>
Six other non-listed agribusiness companies of the group were
also acquired by the new CPF in early January 1999.
</P>
<P>
CP said in the press release that CPF is "dedicated to
producing high quality food products to satisfy consumer needs the
world over."
</P>
<P>
CP executives said that a "Under CPF" sign will be labeled on
all the foodstuff produced in Thailand, from eggs, chickens, milk
to sausages and hamburgers, which will still keep their original
brand names.
</P>
<P>
The hallmark will help the consumers to recognize the company
as a whole, they said.
</P>
<P>
CPF reported sales of 39.5 billion baht (1.02 billion U.S.
dollars)and net profit of 3.3 billion baht (85.7 million dollars)
in the first nine months of this year.

<HEADLINE> British PM Hails "Incredible" Irish Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Friday hailed the first meeting of the British-Irish
Council as a historic step in the quest for peace.
</P>
<P>
"We have made incredible progress," Blair said in London after
British and Irish leaders from all parts of the British Isles and
the Irish Republic held the historic first meeting of a joint
council.
</P>
<P>
Blair said his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, and other
officials from around Britain and Northern Ireland were building a
"partnership for a new age" in the new body, called the British-
Irish Council.
</P>
<P>
The council was agreed under the landmark 1998 Good Friday
accord for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland after 30 years of
violence that has claimed 3,600 lives.
</P>
<P>
But the council also includes representatives of devolved
governments of Scotland and Wales.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Blair told the group gathered at Lancaster House in
central London that they were building a "whole new architecture
of institutional links".
</P>
<P>
"We are setting the seal on a truly unique relationship for the
future, between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the
rest of these islands," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The council, which will meet twice a year, is expected to be
primarily a talking shop, dealing with practical matters such as
the environment, crime, cultural issues, tourism and inter-
parliamentary links.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister Ahern said Ireland would be able to use
the council to "put forward politics which we might formerly have
pursued with London alone."
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon Blair, Ahern, Trimble, and the British
cabinet minister responsible for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson,
were holding a separate inter-governmental conference in the prime
minister's Downing Street residence.

<HEADLINE> Greek FM on New Spirit in Relations With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Friday that the new spirit in the relations
between Greece and Turkey had to be given a chance to bloom and
that dwelling on the past was detrimental to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on infringements of Greek air space by Turkish
fighter jets, Papandreou said that at Helsinki, they saw the
opening of a new dynamic which would allow a new long-term
strategy of improvement in the climate in Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
"We did not open the gates to paradise at Helsinki, but we did
open the gate of opportunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if they dwelt on isolated incidents and on
practices of the past, they would not be able to see the forest
for all the trees.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, formations of Turkish fighter jets reportedly
violated Greed air space over the Aegean Sea and engaged in
simulated dogfights with Greek fighters.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Turkish fighter activity had been
noted over the Aegean since the European Union (EU) summit at
Helsinki last Friday decided to attribute candidacy status to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU made Turkey a membership candidate at the Helsinki
summit, but set 2004 as a target date for a resolution of disputes
with EU member Greece over territorial rights in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean,
and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece now wants the International Court of Justice at the
Hague to arbitrate, but Turkey says it will rather resolve the
Aegean problems through bilateral talks than go to the court.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Solve Prison Congestion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 17, (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings said on Friday his government was considering to
introduce parole, suspended jail sentences and community service
to decongest the country's prisons.
</P>
<P>
The issue of congestion at Ghana's prisons, coupled with poor
conditions, has attracted public outcry with human rights
activists calling on government to improve the situation, Ghana
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings expressed regrets that undue delay in
administration of justice is creating a backlog of prisoners on
remand. This should be adequately addressed by ensuring speedy
trials of cases pending before the courts, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony welcoming 35 new officers, who are all university
 graduates, into the Ghana Prisons Service, he charged the
uniformed men to treat the inmates humanely, saying though
convicts, they are also entitled to their fundamental human
rights as other citizens.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings said they were entering the Service at a
particularly difficult moment when the country is facing economic
difficulties due to the drastic fall in prices of export
commodities and the steady rise in imported crude oil prices.

<HEADLINE> Germany, U.S. Finalize Nazi Slave Labor Compensation Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, December 17 (Xinhua)--Germany and the United States
Friday in Berlin finalized their deal on a 10-billion-mark fund to
compensate millions of slave labor victims in Nazi era, marking an
end to the 18-month negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came this week after German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder agreed to raise the contribution of his
government to 5 billion marks from the previous offer of 3 billion.
</P>
<P>
Thus the fund, formally named "the Fund for Rememberance
Reconciliation and the Future", will be composed of two equal 5-
billion-mark parts from the government and the business.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference to announce the agreement,
Schroeder hailed the German-U.S. deal would "provide German firms
with legal protection, secure jobs, and protect German-U.S.
relations
</P>
<P>
The fund is not only to provide material compensation to those
elderly survivors, but also of historical significance, said
Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"It marks a past century in which the Nazi caused the
holocaust," he said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the Nazi dictatorship had forced over 10
million people to work in public and business sectors. Today most
survivors, most over 70, are dying off.
</P>
<P>
Chief German negotiator Otto Graf Lambsdorff said his
government increased its contribution to reflect the state
responsibility for Nazi crimes.
</P>
<P>
"It was the government of the Third Reich that hunted cheap
laborers on the streets of Poland and the Ukraine," Lambsdorff
said, "here we are talking about crimes supported by state."
</P>
<P>
Lambsdorff promised the fund would be set up "as soon and
quickly as possible."
</P>
<P>
Showing U.S. support for the process, American negotiator,
deputy secretary of treasury Stuart Eizenstat announced his
government would possibly contribute 10 million dollars to the
fund.
</P>
<P>
Under the German-U.S. agreement, some 2.3 million Europeans
could benefit from the fund, including about 230,000 slave
laborers who had been forced to work in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
As an exchange, German firms will get a legal closure that
ensure them immune to further compensation claims by survivors at
the U.S. courts, Eizenstat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The German foundation should be regarded as the exclusive
remedy and the dismissal of such cases would be in our foreign
policy interests," stressed Eizenstat.
</P>
<P>
This commitment will be embedded in an Executive Agreement
between two countries and a Statement of Interest to be filed at U.
S. courts, he said.
</P>
<P>
But before the payments can be made, there are still critical
issues to be negotiated in coming months as to how to divide the
compensation among the various classes of victims.
</P>
<P>
Slave laborers in concentration camps will receive more than
the forced laborers, who were deported from their homes to work in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week ,Lambsdorff told Berlin Info Radio that he
planned to pay each former forced laborer 5,000 to 6,000 marks,
and every slave labor victims would get 15,000 marks.
</P>
<P>
To collect the money for the fund, Schroeder is trying to
convince cities and states to contribute. During World War II,
German states and cities deployed slave laborers in public sectors,
too.
</P>
<P>
German industry has also been trying to get more companies to
join the 60 to 70 firms now ready for participation, a spokesman
for German Business Community said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> (Updated) U.S., EU Pledge to Launch New Round Despite Seattle Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top leaders from the EU and U.S. President Bill Clinton made
the statement after their meeting at the White House, focusing on
regional, trade and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides note their disappointment at the failure to reach

they agree it is now important to find a way forward," they said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, the EU and the U.S. both pledge continued
readiness to work with (WTO) Director-General Mike Moore and our

the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the new round has to be "definitively
different from its predecessors."
</P>
<P>
"It should encompass the built-in agenda of agriculture and
services, further and effective market access liberalization,
support our efforts to harness globalization by strengthening and
extending WTO rules, and address the concerns of both developing
countries and civil society," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from 135 WTO members failed to launch the new
round in Seattle early this month due to sharp differences between
the developed and the developing countries, and disputes between
the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries complained that their interests are
ignored in the negotiations and the process lacks transparency.
They also insist that the labor issue should not be on the agenda
of the trade negotiations as the U.S. proposed.
</P>
<P>
In their joint statement, the U.S. and the EU stressed the need
to take full account of the lessons of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
They said work should be directed towards a set of measures
that will provide more participation by the poor countries, offer
great transparency and boost overall public support for the WTO.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, tens of thousands of anti-WTO protesters rallied in
downtown and prevented the officials from attending the meeting
earlier this month. The police had to use tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
On labor, the U.S. and the EU agreed that they will work with
other members to "engage the WTO and ILO (the International Labor
Organization) in a constructive dialogue, including consideration
of the relationship between core labor standards, further
liberalization, trade policy and social development."
</P>
<P>
Referring to environment, they said they will work together to
ensure that trade rules support and do not undermine the ability
of governments to establish and achieve high levels of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
They affirmed their commitment to "maximizing the benefits
developing countries gain from being in the WTO."
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to take forward a preferential market access
initiative for least developed WTO members," the statement said.

HARARE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Membership of the ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) (Zanu-PF) has
topped over two million, Information and Publicity Secretary of
the party Nathan Shamuyarira said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters on the second day of the third Zanu (PF)
National Congress in Harare, Shamuyarira added that the party's

The Zanu (PF) was formed in 1963 and in 1987 it merged with the
rival Zimbabwe African People's Union led by the late
Vice-President Joshua Nkomo.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Demands Clarifications From Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides on Friday asked for clarifications from the five permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council regarding the
addendum to U.N. Secretary-General's recent report on the
operations of UNFICYP (U.N. Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus).
</P>
<P>
Clerides met Friday morning the ambassadors of the five
countries -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -
- in Nicosia over the addendum, which addressed Turkey's pledge of
support to the breakaway regime in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The addendum said Turkey has voiced its support to the Turkish
Cypriots' position that UNFICYP can operate on both sides of the
island only with the consent of both parties and that the Turkish
Cypriots will request the U.N. force to work with them to "develop
modalities of UNFICYP's operations in northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
"Kibris," a Turkish Cypriot newspaper, quoted diplomatic sources
as saying that the addendum is interpreted as an acknowledgement of
the "sovereignty" of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Government Spokesman Michalis Papapetrou said the
government's stance on the addendum will be determined after
clarifications are given.
</P>
<P>
"Kibris" reported that the Turkish Cypriot side rejected at
first the Security Council resolution on extending the mandate of
UNFICYP for another six month, a move that led to the addendum.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was passed Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of UNFICYP needs to be reaffirmed and extended every
six months by the Security Council, usually accompanied by a report
from the U.N. chief on the operation of the force in its current
tenure and an addendum.
</P>
<P>
Such an addendum usually makes reference to the positions of
Greece, Britain and the Cyprus government only.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the addendum is an indirect recognition of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot regime, Papapetrou said one should wait
for clarifications from the Security Council before making any
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
The five ambassadors promised to look into the matter and return
soon with their answers.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of short-
lived coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only by
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The UNFICYP was established in 1964 and the 1,200-strong
peacekeepers are patrolling the 180-kilometer line dividing the two
rival sides.

<HEADLINE> U.S., EU Puts Joint Pressure on Russia for Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and leaders from the European Union (EU) Friday issued a joint
statement on Chechnya, increasing their pressure on Russia for its
military operation against rebels in the republic.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after a summit meeting between Clinton
and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland, which currently holds
the EU presidency, and European Commission President Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Russia's military tactics in Chechnya are
undermining its objectives, creating a humanitarian crisis,
endangering innocent civilians, and jeopardizing stability
throughout the Caucasus region," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"A military solution to the conflict is not possible...the
indiscriminate use of force against civilians is unacceptable,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned by the impact of the Chechnya conflict on
security throughout the Caucasus and stress the importance of
avoiding steps that would further undermine the regional security,
" it noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia has rejected the criticism by the Western countries of
its operation against the rebels and terrorists in its republic,
stressing that the issue is a domestic affair and the west has no
rights to interfere.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following the summit meeting at the White
House, Ahtisaari said, "The concerns that have been expressed at
the summit have been heard in Moscow."
</P>
<P>
"On this issue, we see very much eye to eye. We hope these
developments will not isolate Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and EU leaders also discussed trade issues. In a
separate statement, they pledged to launch a new round of global
trade talks despite the failure to do so in Seattle at the third
ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
However, they failed to narrow their differences over EU
restrictions on American beef and bananas that pushed the United
States to impose stiff retaliatory tariffs this year on nearly 300
million U.S. dollars in European products.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Friday the approval of a credit amounting to 182.4 million U.S.
dollars to India for the Uttar Pradesh (UP) Third District primary
education project.
</P>
<P>
Complementing other ongoing World Bank-financed primary
education programs in the state, the project will assist UP's
efforts to ensure that all six-11 year old children, especially
the socially disadvantaged, complete a five-year primary education
cycle of appropriate quality, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project will create about 1.5 million new places by the
construction of approximately 12,300 additional classrooms, 6,050
new and reconstructed schools, and the repair of about 9,000
dilapidated schools.
</P>
<P>
Key innovations under the project include the introduction of
alternative schooling options that will help ensure access to an
additional 180,000 out-of-school children in isolated hamlets and
a model cluster approach for targeted and intensive interventions
for girls' education.
</P>
<P>
Special interventions will also cover working children, school
drop-outs, children with disabilities, and other children from
socially disadvantaged groups.
</P>
<P>
To improve the quality of instruction and enhance learning
achievement levels, the project finances a holistic training
program that provides continuous support for teacher development
and follow-up professional support to teachers, para-teachers, and
alternative schooling instructors.
</P>
<P>
Total project costs are 214.7 million dollars, to which the
Indian government will provide 32.3 million dollars and the
International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's
concessionary lending affiliate, will provide an interest-free
credit of 182.4 million dollars on standard IDA terms with 35
years to maturity and 10 years grace.

<HEADLINE> British POWs Angry at Exclusion From Nazi Labor Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Former British prisoners of war
(POW who had been forced into slave labor in Germany during World
War Two, called on Friday for government action after being
excluded from a multi-billion-dollar compensation deal announced
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"British POWs have ... been totally ignored in the settlement,"
Martin Day, the lawyer representing the former prisoners, said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The deal is only for civilians and yet many POWs were forced
into slave labor and many were treated totally in contravention of
the Geneva Convention," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"I would still urge the British government to accept its own
moral responsibility to intervene in the negotiations to protect
the interests of British POWs who were forced to work for German
mines and industry in appalling conditions," Day said.
</P>
<P>
Day, who last month went to talks in Bonn in a bid to persuade
negotiators to include British POWs in the compensation package,
said the UK government must "not let the matter drop".
</P>
<P>
Of the estimated 1,000 British soldiers forced into slave labor
by the Nazis during World War two, around 500 are thought to be
still alive.
</P>
<P>
Day said he would on Friday present Britain's foreign office
with further evidence of how Germany breached the Geneva
Convention in respect of British POWs.

Russia has rejected the criticism by the Western countries of
its operation against the rebels and terrorists in Chechnya,
stressing that the issue is a domestic affair and the West has no
rights to interfere.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following the summit meeting at the White
House, Ahtisaari said, "The concerns that have been expressed at
the summit have been heard in Moscow."
</P>
<P>
"On this issue, we see very much eye to eye. We hope these
developments will not isolate Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also issued a joint statement on Southeastern
Europe. "We intend to work closely with Southeastern Europe to
take full advantage of the opportunity before us at the verge of a
new century to forge greater stability and advance the region's
integration into the Euro-Atlantic mainstream."
</P>
<P>
However, they failed to narrow their trade disputes and
differences, including those over EU restrictions on American beef
and bananas that pushed the United States to impose stiff
retaliatory tariffs this year on nearly 300 million U.S. dollars
in European products.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-EU disputes on agriculture was one of the major
reasons for the failure in Seattle to launch a new round of trade
talks. The U.S. asked the EU to remove all its farm subsidies.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government
Friday congratulated the People's Republic of China on the
forthcoming transfer of the sovereignty of Macao to China, said a
statement made by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Argentina considers that the results attained in the process of
negotiation between China and Portugal on Macao can be attributed
in a great measure to the perseverance of the Chines government in
the recovery of this territory through the peaceful way, which is
an example for the whole international community.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government thinks that the choice of the "one
country, two systems" formula will assure the preservation of the
economic system presently functioning in this region and in the
way of life of its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The Fernando de la Rua government has stated its interest in
the development of economic and commercial ties with the future
Special Administrative Region of Macao, said the statement.

<HEADLINE> Trade Among ALADI Countries Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Exports among the 12 member
countries of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI)
dropped 25.8 percent in 1999, in comparison with 1998, said Juan
Francisco Rojas Penso, general secretary of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Exports among the ALADI countries diminished from 43.213
billion dollars in 1998 to 32,038 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Among ALADI members, imports also reduced from 45.361 billion
dollars to 34.238 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, in the ALADI countries global trade with the rest of
the world, the exports increased from 251.296 billion dollars in
1998 to 255.424 billion dollars in 1999, which means a 1.6 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
ALADI countries imports from the rest of the world diminished 8.
4 percent, dropping from 286.071 billion dollars in 1998 to 262.
173 billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Rojas said that the economy of the ALADI countries as a whole
will drop this year about 0.5 percent, the first drop in this last
decade. With the exception of Bolivia, Cuba, Peru, and Mexico, the
rest will have a negative growth.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan economist said that the contraction of the trade
among the ALADI countries also thwarts the process of integration
between the Community of Andean Nations (CAN) and the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
But he forecast that the economy of the ALADI countries will
improve in the new millennium because of the recovery in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
ALADI is made up of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, Chile,
Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> IMF Completes First Off-Market Gold Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) announced Friday that it had completed the first off-
market gold sale last Tuesday under the previously announced
financing plan for debt relief and financial support for the world
's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
"We sold slightly more than 7 million ounces of gold to Brazil,
" said IMF Treasurer Eduard Brau, "and accepted it back
immediately from Brazil for payment of an obligation due the same
day. Thus, the gold did not enter the market."
</P>
<P>
The IMF retained about 342.5 million U.S. dollars on its own
account as required by the Articles of Agreement. The remainder of
the proceeds totaling 1.6 billion dollars was invested with the
Bank for International Settlements to generate income for the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
</P>
<P>
The next sale, which will amount to about 655,000 ounces, will
be completed Friday, the IMF said.

PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- In collaboration with its
European partners in the year 2000, France will conduct about 14
space launches via its Ariane rockets, said the executive officer
of the Arianespace group Jean-Marie Luton Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Our priority is to launch about five "Ariane 5" rockets and
eight or nine "Ariane 4" rockets next year," said Luton in a
interview with BFM radio.
</P>
<P>
On December 10, Arianespace sent its maiden "Ariane 5" rocket
with a scientific satellite weighing 39 tons from the French space
center in Guiana, south America.
</P>
<P>
Luton said that Arianespace's commercial results this year are
not good due to a slow-down in orders from clients and in the
delivery of satellites.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French telecommunications group Alcatel has
chosen the U.S. Boeing and its space launcher Delta for sending 40
of its 80 satellites in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Alcatel, which is allied with Boeing, expects to develop a
global telecommunications satellite network called SkyBridge by
2003.
</P>
<P>
Luton said that Arianespace is considering investing in
SkyBridge.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Brief Arafat on Syria-Israel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak will hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Sunday
evening in the West Bank city of Jericho, Israel Radio reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two leaders will discuss the issues
concerning the final-status talks and other interim issues about
Israel's troops redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm El Sheikh peace deal, Israel should have carried
out its second troops withdrawal from the West Bank on November 15
and handed over another 5 percent of the West Bank territories to
the Palestinians, but this has been stalled due to the differences
between the two sides over which areas Israel should transfer.
</P>
<P>
On the parallel track, the final-status talks were locked in
disputes over Israel's settlement expansion in the West Bank,
achieving no progress on essential issues.
</P>
<P>
Barak will also brief Arafat on the outcome of the just-
concluded Israeli-Syrian peace talks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held between Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq Al-Sharaa on Wednesday and Thursday. The unprecedented
highest level talks marked the resumption of peace negotiations
between the two rivals after a 45-month freeze.

<HEADLINE> 7 People Killed in Somali Fresh Clan Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Serious armed
confrontations erupted during the past three days between the
Sheikhal and Biyomal clans living in the Middle Jubba region of
southern Somalia, killing at least seven and wounding seven
others.
</P>
<P>
According to independent sources, heavily armed infantry
militiamen of the Biyomal clan, equipped with assault rifles and
rocket propelled grenades, Thursday attacked the Sheikhal
clansmen-dominated Homboy village, about 40 kilometers northeast
of Jamameh district.
</P>
<P>
During the fighting, the Biyomal clansmen managed to dislodge
the unprepared Sheikhal clansmen out of the village, killing four
of them and wounding three others.
</P>
<P>
The dislodged people of Sheikhal clan then called for help from
southern Somalia and they were reinforced by two battle wagons and
dozens of heavily armed militiamen who left the towns of Haramkah
and Jamameh for the battle field.
</P>
<P>
Fully prepared, the Sheikhal militiamen launched the attack to
re- capture their lost village of Hamboy on Friday. Three Biyomal
fighters were killed and four others wounded during the exchange
of fire and the Biyomal militiamen were finally driven out of the
village.
</P>
<P>
The reason for this upsurge of fighting is not stated
officially. However, sources close to the Biyomal clan indicate
that their militiamen were angered by the killing of the
well-known Biyomal Clergy man, Sheikh Abdurahman Sheikh Barreh, by
the Sheikhal militiamen a week ago at a checkpoint in Dhay Tubako
village near Jilib district.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Barreh had been the chairman of the Consultative Council
for the Islamic Court and the district commissioner of Jamameh
district.  There is no real peace tentative at the
moment, with high tension remaining in the area of the fighting
between the districts of Jamameh and Jilib.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Mohamed Ahmed Aw-Ali, spokesman of the Sheikhal
Supreme Committee, has called on both sides to secure an
unconditional cease-fire so as to open the gate for talks between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the people in the region to practice maximum
restraint at this critical moment when the humanitarian situation
is deteriorating following heavy rains and floods that devastated
the farmlands of the region.

<HEADLINE> India-China Children's Painting Exhibition Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- An India-China Children's
painting exhibition opened here Saturday with Indian External
Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh calling for improvement of
relations between the two ancient civilizations.
</P>
<P>
Good Sino-India relations would be the corner-stone for global
peace and improved welfare for the entire human race, the minister
said at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"When we speak of Sino-India relations, it is not merely the
future of these two countries, but it means future for the entire
human world," Jaswang Singh said in his address inaugurating the
10-day exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Of the over 350 paintings on display depicting various facets
of life in both countries, 110 paintings are from China and
another 240 were painted by Indian children.
</P>
<P>
Singh expressed his hope that "the relations between the two
countries should be as pleasant and as colorful as the paintings."
</P>
<P>
Good ties are Vital as the two ancient civilizations are not
only large neighbors to each other but comprise a considerable
part of the world's population, he said.
</P>
<P>
The paintings were jointly organized by China Ministry of
Culture and Indian Council for International Cooperation in
October both in China and India to celebrate the 50th anniversary
of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
While Indian children painted on the Chinese way of life both
in cities and the countryside, the Chinese children seemed to be
impressed by the famous Taj Mahal, elephants and rural Indian
women in traditional costumes.
</P>
<P>
Many paintings showed the hope of children in both countries to
further develop and enhance relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Political Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in India Lin
Shanglin said in his address that concerted efforts from the two
countries and enhanced cultural exchanges can ensure that
friendship between China and India would go on from generation to
generation.

<HEADLINE> France's Brittany Region Chooses Hero of Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- France's western region of
Brittany has chosen the lone high seas salesman Eric Tabarly as
the "Briton of the century."
</P>
<P>
Tabarly disappeared from his boat on July 13 off the coast of
Wales, Britain, during a tempest.
</P>
<P>
He was said to have been struck and knocked over board while on
the deck of his boat and his body was never recovered.
</P>
<P>
Some suspect the 66-year-old salesman had chosen his own way of
death because he had often told his friends of his intention to "
marry" the sea.
</P>
<P>
In a poll published on Saturday among 601 Britons, 80 percent
chose Tabarly as the hero of the century.
</P>
<P>
A historically Celtic region with a strong nationalist
sentiment, Brittany is known for producing good sportsmen and
singers.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that most of the Britons regard the on-
going pollution crisis off its coast, which was caused by the
incident of the oil tanker "Erika" last week, as the most
important event of the century in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) --Russian Prime Minister said here
Saturday Russia's security services will continue to play a major
role in ensuring the country's stability and security.
</P>
<P>
"Bodies of state security have always defended the national
interests of Russia," Putin told a meeting marking the Security
Service Day, which falls on next Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said such services must not be separated from the
state and "turned into some monster," the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"For several years, we gave up to an illusion that we have no
enemies and paid a dear price for that," said Putin, who headed
the Federal Security Service (FSB) before becoming prime minister
last August.
</P>
<P>
FSB is the main successor of the Soviet KGB (Committee of State
Security).
</P>
<P>
"Russia has its national interests, and we have to defend them,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
In a message read by Putin, Russian President Boris Yeltsin
greeted participants of the meeting, urging the security services
to "do everything to ensure that Russia enters the 21st century as
a strong power."
</P>
<P>
"Today extremism and international terrorism are challenging
the integrity of our country," Yeltsin said.

<HEADLINE> France to Increase Investment in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Consul General of France in
Hong Kong and Macao Jerome Pasquier said in a recent interview
that France firmly supports China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao and will continue to increase French
investment in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Pasquier said that he is confident about the future of Macao
and its return to the motherland will bring new opportunities for
French businesses there.
</P>
<P>
Pasquier believes that the "one country, two systems" concept
will work well in Macao as it did in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a historic date. I totally share the great joy and
pleasure with the Chinese people," he said.
</P>
<P>
As an envoy, Pasquier has traveled frequently between Hong Kong
and Macao since he took office in Hong Kong last year. He has also
met with Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive-designate of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR) several times.
</P>
<P>
"The people in Macao are very optimistic of Macao's future, and
the capable MSAR leaders have lots of new ideas to run things well,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return will benefit not only its own economic
development and social stability, but also the foreign trade and
investment there, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French government attaches great importance to China's
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao and will send
a high-profile delegation to attend the handover ceremony since
France is one of the biggest European investors in Macao, Pasquier
said.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a good economic presence in Macao and we have many
French companies there dealing with water supply, electricity,
waste treatment, air transport, hotel and entertainment," Pasquier
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Spokeswoman on U.N. Security Council Resolution on Iraq Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to join the
international community in making unremitting efforts to resolve
the Iraqi issue in a fair way as soon as possible, Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said here today.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations (U.N.) Security Council on December 17
adopted Resolution 1284 on the Iraqi issue, with 11 voting for,
and four abstentions, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Since December last year, the Iraqi issue has been in a
deadlock and, in order to break the deadlock, China has done a
great deal of work in and outside the Security Council, has always
taken an active part in the Security Council's consultations on
the issue and put forward many constructive propositions, she said.
</P>
<P>
Because Resolution 1284 does not satisfy the reasonable
proposals by China and several other countries in terms of setting
in motion the mechanism for suspending sanctions against Iraq and
other major issues, China, together with such Security Council
members as Russia, France and Malaysia, abstained from voting,
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China has adopted a consistent and clear-cut
stance on the Iraqi issue, and holds that Iraq should cooperate
with the United Nations, and implement relevant Security Council
resolutions in an all-round and earnest way.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Iraq, which is a sovereign state, should be respected by the
international community, she said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the international community should be fair and
objective in assessing Iraq's implementation of relevant Security
Council resolutions, and accordingly gradually ease and eventually
lift the sanctions against Iraq.

micro-electronic technology and the information industry.
</P>
<P>
 China Builds New-Technology Base in Tianjin
</P>
<P>
China has started building a new-technology base in the
northern port city of Tianjin following approval for the project
after a recent evaluation by experts.
</P>
<P>
The base, covering an area of 87 hectares, will be built
jointly by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Tianjin-
based companies and universities.
</P>
<P>
The facility will serve as an incubator for new technologies
with the goal of developing new industries.
</P>
<P>
 China Uses "Green" Citric Acid-Extracting Technique
</P>
<P>
A new method for extracting citric acid, by using a technique
called industrial iron chromatography liquid separation, has been
successfully employed in industrial production on a trial basis
for one year in China, and is expected to be widely adopted.
</P>
<P>
The technology was created by a research center of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences and was patented in late 1994. It was
put into trial use in 1998 at a pharmaceutical plant in Fuyang,
Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The environment-friendly technology produces no waste or
pollutants, a common occurrence when the old method of extracting
citric acid is used. The new method can also bring in high
economic returns at low cost.
</P>
<P>
China Launches Its First Environmental Protection Website
</P>
<P>
China launched its first website on local environmental
protection in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning
Province.
</P>
<P>
The website, in both Chinese and English, was jointly set up by
the city's administration office on environmental protection, and
the economic information center and environment engineering center
of Northeast China University.
</P>
<P>
The new site, www.syepi.com (English) and: www.syepi.com.cn (
Chinese), will provide Internet users timely data on the city's
environmental protection industry and release the latest
information about new products, research results, high-tech
developments, market management, inter-provincial exchanges, and
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
 China Creates New Hybrid Wheat
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts have successfully created a hybrid wheat using
plants of different genuses, a breakthrough for China's cell
engineering and breeding research.
</P>
<P>
According to researchers with the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
this is the first such cross-fertilization in the world, which has
attracted the notice of scientists worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The hybrid wheat was created by the combination or blend of
wheat cells with a weed originally growing in Australia, and has
been successfully planted on an experimental basis. More than 3.3
hectares of the new wheat have now been harvested.
</P>
<P>
The high-quality wheat is resistant to salt and thus able to
grow in highly saline soil, making it possible to grow wheat in
saline-alkali land, of which there are large areas in China.
</P>
<P>
 China Developing Technology to Reinforce Police
</P>
<P>
China will arm its police with advanced science and technology
to enhance overall operational capacity, according to a recently
concluded national conference on technology for police.

<HEADLINE> French Police Hunt Serial Killer in Marseilles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- French police are conducting a
manhunt in the southern city of Marseilles for a man suspected of
killing at least three young women.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the police department said a search was conducted
Saturday morning in three ghetto areas of Marseilles where a large
Algerian community is located.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-year-old Ahmed Cid Rezala is suspected of killing the
British student Isabel Peake on a night train while traveling from
the French city of Limoges to Paris on October 12. He is also
suspected of having killed a 20-year-old student of sociology in
the northern city of Amiens in late October, and Corinne Caillaux,
a 36-year-old mother, on a night train from Calais to a southern
city in France on Monday this week.
</P>
<P>
The body, assumed to be that of the sociology student who
disappeared on October 29 and whose name was not revealed, was
found Thursday in the basement of a house in a middle class
district of Amiens. An autopsy of her body will be performed on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police questioned the brother and associates of Cid Rezala in
Marseilles on Saturday. The authorities believe the killer is
hiding in the city because he does not have enough money to leave
town and his pictures are posted in every train station in France.
</P>
<P>
Rezala reportedly enjoys traveling on night trains without
purchasing a ticket. Cid Rezala was seen on the two night trains
where the murders of the two young women took place.
</P>
<P>
He was also seen in Amiens in October with a young woman who
was believed to be the dead woman discovered on Thursday under a
heap of coals.
</P>
<P>
The body of Peake was found thrown along the railway line on
the morning of October 13, while Caillaux, who was traveling with
her five-year-old son, was found dead in a sleeping car restroom
Monday night. She was reportedly stabbed 12 times with a knife.
</P>
<P>
A French citizen of Algerian origin with a face described as
menacing, Cid Rezala, was released from jail in May after serving
a prison sentence for rape with violence.

<HEADLINE> French City to Install Video Surveillance Cameras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The French city of Strasbourg
will install video surveillance cameras in all public places,
including buses, trams and schools, because of rampant violence by
the city's teenage residents.
</P>
<P>
A local budget committee voted Friday that the city will spend
12 million francs (2.1 million U.S. dollars) in two years to
develop a network of surveillance cameras in public transport
facilities.
</P>
<P>
City officials say they have found that once video cameras are
installed on buses and trams, the number of acts of vandalism,
sabotage and attack by delinquents against bus drivers drops.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Mayor of Strasbourg Roland Ries said some of the
budget will be spent on installing video cameras in other public
places, such as schools.
</P>
<P>
He said the local delinquents are shifting their field of
activities from buses and trams to schools because the latter do
not have surveillance equipment.
</P>
<P>
Strasbourg's police force is on the alert as the Christmas-New
Year season is the high time for troublemakers to burn cars and
break shop windows.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 cars were torched by delinquents in the city's
suburbs over the past few weeks, said the police.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects New U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Iraq announced on Saturday it
rejected the new U.N. Security Council resolution on Iraq, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said in a statement
that "Iraq's position regarding the deliberations held by the
Security Council after the U.S.-British aggression in December 1998
is declared and known and Iraq adheres to this stand."
</P>
<P>
"Apart from predictions and threats resulted from our position,
Iraq is fully adhering to its principled and legal stance and it is
ready to bear all consequences in defence of its sovereignty and
legitimate rights," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly declared it will reject any U.N.
resolution that falls short of total and conditional lifting of the
U.N. sanctions imposed on the country following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Aziz reiterated that Iraq had implemented all its commitments to
the U.N. resolutions in eight and a half years and it was now time
to implement the U.N. resolution 687 for the lifting of the embargo
completely and without any additional restrictions or conditions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Friday adopted a new resolution on
Iraq with 11 votes for and four abstentions. China, Russia, France
and Malaysia abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the resolution issued Friday "does not meet Iraq's
legitimate demand of lifting the embargo... It has come completely
void of any indication to the aggression Iraq has been exposed
to...through the so-called no-fly-zones imposed by America and
Britain alone."
</P>
<P>
The new resolution sets up a new arms control body, named the U.
N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) to
replace the old U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It also offered Iraq a chance to have the trade sanctions
suspended if it cooperates fully with arms inspectors and makes
progress on key disarmament tasks to be defined by the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"The real objective of America and Britain behind this
resolution is not the lifting of embargo but it is a process of
cheating world public opinion because the resolution... has a long
and complicated string of vague and new conditions which could bear
various explanations in a manner making this bad resolution not
imply an ensurance that the suspension will take place," said Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that the timings in the new U.N. resolution "
are so long in an artificial and exaggerated way."
</P>
<P>
Aziz added that such measures were meant to cope with the
internal situation in America in the year of elections, and the
intentions of America and Britain have come up to surface with the
continuation of their military aggressions in the illegitimate no-
fly zones in northern and southern Iraq and in addition to
America's interference in the internal affairs of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The new resolution "is in form and essence rewriting resolution
687 in an illegal way, a matter that means the Security Council
does not keep its resolutions and does not honor its
commitments..." he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that some permanent member states (of the Council) that
adopted a balanced stand along several months of debates, would
work for preventing the issuance of this resolution by using
'veto', but we highly appreciate their stand by abstaining to
vote," said Aziz,referring to Russia, China and France.
</P>
<P>
Aziz deplored the stand of Bahrain, the only Arab member in the
Security Council, by saying that Bahrain during two years of its
membership in the Council does not reflect the stand of the
majority of Arab countries and Arab public opinion, but it behaved
like a tail and satellite to the American-British policy.
</P>
<P>
He also castigated Brazil and Nambia by saying that these two
states were firstly adopting stands of a great deal of balance, but
they succumbed to American pressure and blackmail and joined those
who support the ill-fated resolution.

<HEADLINE> WTO to Resume Talks on New Round of Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have agreed to resume talks in mid-January on
the thorny issues blocking the launch of a new round of
multilateral trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
At their first meeting here since the failed ministerial
conference in Seattle on November 30 to December 3, the WTO
members agreed to admit Jordan as the organization's 136th member,
said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
They approved a WTO budget for the year 2000 amounting to 127.7
million Swiss francs (about 80 million U.S. dollars), a 4.5
percent rise compared to this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the developing countries preoccupied with concerns that
the 1995 WTO agreements, including a key pact on protection of
intellectual property rights, must be implemented by January 1,
the developed countries pledged not to challenge them with
disputes in the near future, Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, ministers from the WTO failed to launch a new round
of trade talks. Negotiators were unable to break a deadlock over
politically-sensitive agriculture and labor issues.
</P>
<P>
"There was agreement that...what (has) to do with the Seattle
process, should be taken up in the New Year," Rockwell told
reporters. "They will hold consultations on the Seattle process,
including the issue of deadlines raised by Pakistan and other
delegations."

launched in Egypt's Dameitta at a cost of 1 billion Egyptian pounds
(289.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The projects, to be completed later the year 2000, will raise
the number of development-related projects to 86, according to a
report by the Ministry of Housing, Construction and New
Communities.
</P>
<P>
Latest technologies will be applied to carry out water and
sanitary projects nationwide, the Al-Alam Al-Youm daily on Saturday
quoted the report as saying .
</P>
<P>
As part of the industrial and agricultural development projects,
five water and sanitary drainage stations will be built in
Dakahlia, Qalyobia, Sharqia and Ismailia governorates.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed the necessity of restructuring the water and
sanitary drainage stations nationwide and opening the door for the
private sector to enhance performance and service in this vital
area. The restructuring process will have nothing to do with the
consumption tariff or price rises, it noted.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Imposes 10 Percent Surtax on Imported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has introduced a
surtax of 10 percent on consumer imports since December 14 this
year, the country's customs officials said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The new tax is imposed on all consumer goods except
fertilizers, fuel, public transport vehicles and their spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the duty has been put in place
temporarily and will not be retroactive.
</P>
<P>
All investment items, like capital goods, will be dealt with by
 Ethiopia's Investment Authority, they said.
</P>
<P>
However, this latest regulation has reportedly met criticism
from local importers.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor newspaper Saturday quoted an unidentified
businessman, who has been in the import business for more than two
decades, as saying that the new surtax is prohibitive and will
make the already difficult business impossible.
</P>
<P>
According to the importer, the past two years have been very
difficult for Ethiopian importers who have very little profit
margins left after all the import duties and taxes have been paid.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russia Braces for Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian voters were given a
final day Saturday to ponder their choices before going to the
polls Sunday to elect the next State Duma, or lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
About 3,550 candidates from 26 political parties and blocs will
vie for half of the 450 seats on the federal ticket, while another
2,300 candidates will compete for the other half in local
electoral districts.
</P>
<P>
As required by law, campaigning for the elections ended as the
final seconds of Friday ticked away. Russians had 32 hours of
relative quiet to think over the choices they will make before
they cast their ballots from 08:00 to 20:00 local time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
What makes the vote more important is that its results will
have a decisive impact on the presidential race next June.
</P>
<P>
"These elections are a launch pad for storming the presidential
heights," said Leonid Sedov, an analyst with the All-Russia Center
for Public Opinion Research.
</P>
<P>
The results of the Sunday vote will give most of the contenders
an indication of where they stand, especially for the two leaders
of the Fatherland-All Russia bloc, former Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yury Luzhkov, who are considered anti-
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Primakov on Friday announced he would run for president, while
Luzhkov has said he might put aside his ambitions in favor of bloc
partner Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, if the pro-Kremlin Unity party does well, it will be
another plus for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, whose ratings have
soared amid the military campaign against rebels in the breakaway
republic of Chechnya. Putin has already announced his plan to join
the presidential elections next year.
</P>
<P>
The offensive was launched in September following armed
incursions by Chechen rebels into neighboring Daghestan and a
series of terrorist bombings -- also blamed on the Chechen
militants -- that killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other
Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to the nation late Friday, Prime
Minister Putin urged the Russians to make their voting decisions
carefully.
</P>
<P>
"Come to polling stations and vote, but vote for those in whom
you're firmly sure, those whom you really trust. I know it's not
easy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Putin mentioned no names of candidates or parties, he
has already said he is voting for Unity.
</P>
<P>
Besides Fatherland-All Russia and Unity, the other blocs
expected to clear the 5 percent hurdle to enter the new Duma are
the Communist Party and the liberal Yabloko party.
</P>
<P>
While Our Home is Russia, the Union of the Right Forces and a
bloc lead by ultra- nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky may make the
5 percent barrier for automatic representation, other minor
political groups stand little chance of a seat in the Duma.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest country in geographic size, Russia
covers 11 time zones. Therefore, voters in the easternmost regions
of Chukot and Kamchatka would go to the polls at 23:00 Saturday
Moscow time, while those living in the westernmost Kaliningrad are
required to end their voting before 23:00 Moscow time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the balloting started as early as December 4 in some
of the more remote regions.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of the elections will be known early Monday
morning, but the final tally will not be published until about 10
days later.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how many of the 107 million eligible voters
will actually go to the polls. Under Russian Election Law, a 25
percent turnout would ensure the vote's validity.
</P>
<P>
Russian citizens abroad, numbering 850,000, will cast their
votes in 356 polling stations overseas.
</P>
<P>
To ensure security, all Interior Ministry personnel, plus 10,
000 servicemen and 22,000 cadets under the ministry, will be on
duty Sunday. In Moscow, reserve polling stations have been set up
in preparation for any terrorist threats.
</P>
<P>
In addition, over 1,000 observers from foreign countries and
international organizations will be monitoring the balloting.

<HEADLINE>   Malaysia For Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has urged the
United Nations Security Council to work out a clear sanctions-
lifting plan that would allow Iraq to resume normal economic
relations with the international community.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian permanent representative to the UN Hasmy Agam was
quoted Saturday byBernama news agency as speaking at the UN
Security Council that his country is unable to support the UN's
Iraq Omnibus Resolution as it does not establish a definite
benchmark or a timeframe for the final lifting of the sanctions on
the Gulf country.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia feels a timeframe for the final lifting of the
sanctions ought to be as much the objective of the entire exercise
as it was for an accounting and disposing of Iraq's alleged
remaining weapons of mass destruction, Hasmy Agam stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The indefinite continuation of the sanctions violates the very
spirit and purposes of the United Nations, enshrined in its
charter... These lofty ideals ring hollow indeed in the context of
the reality of the situation in Iraq," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hasmy Agam said that nine years of punitive sanctions was far
too long for any country to bear and that the UN Security Council
had the responsibility to assess the enormity of the effects of
the sanctions on the Iraqi people and must begin the process of
dismantling them as soon as possible on Iraq's compliance with all
relevant resolutions of the Council.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have had debilitating effects on the Iraqi
population as a whole, especially the elderly, infirm and children
who were deprived of many of the most basic amenities which were
taken for granted elsewhere, he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Sports Chief to Expose Drug Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Australian sports chief
insisted to expose any drug cheats at next year's Sydney Olympics,
no matter the International Olympic Committee (IOC) likes it or
not, according Syndey-based Sunday-Telegraph on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Jackie Kelly, the federal sports minister, told the newspaper
that she would identify any drug offenders even if the IOC would
refuse.
</P>
<P>
Under the IOC's existing regulations, only the IOC's Medical
Commission is informed of any positive tests.
</P>
<P>
But Kelly said cheats should be identified to the public as
soon as the result was known.
</P>
<P>
"If I hear there's a positive I'll be chasing it down every
burrow I can because it means some athlete has walked off with
someone else's medal and that's not on," Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a shame if, subsequent to the Games, there were
allegations about the way it was done -- about test results
according to the IOC code.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi University Confers Doctorates Upon PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka University, the most
prestigious university in Bangladesh, conferred honorary
doctorates on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Nobel laureate
Professor Amartya Sen on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An honorary Doctor of Law degree was conferred on Hasina and an
honorary doctorate of science was granted to Sen, at the
university's 40th convocation, also the first since the country's
independence in 1971.
</P>
<P>
Hasina, 52, graduated from the university with a bachelor's
degree in literature in 1973, while Sen, an economist, was awarded
the Nobel Prize in Economics last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the convocation, the prime minister said law is the
basic structure of the state through which overall management of
the society will be conducted properly.
</P>
<P>
Law will be protected and applied for the interest of the
people through judiciary and executive and everybody has the right
to get the shelter of law, she said.
</P>
<P>
She called for concerted national efforts to establish rule of
law in the society and attain economic emancipation for the
teeming millions of the country. " As a disciplined nation we have
to build ourselves and move forward the trend of smooth democratic
culture and liberal humanity," she said.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here on Friday, Sen said although he was born
in India, his forefathers were sons of this soil and some of them
had tutored in Dhaka University.
</P>
<P>
Sen had announced that he would donate part of the prize money
for the welfare of the underprivileged in India and in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
University teachers belonging to the pro-BNP White Panel were
reportedly opposed to the conferment of the honorary degree on the
prime minister, arguing that the special honorary degrees were
reserved for scientists, poets, writers and people of outstanding
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD), the student wing
of the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, staged an
six-hour hartal (strike) Saturday morning to protest the
conferring of honorary degree on the prime minister. The shutdown
was supported by the four-party opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 pro-strike activists, including the JCD president
and general secretary, were arrested on Friday from their
processions, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Says Philippines Ready for Y2K Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that his administration has made all
the necessary preparations to counter the possible effects of the
Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
In a radio-TV program here, Estrada said that he has received
assurances from all government agencies and critical areas in the
private sector that they are ready for the Y2K bug, a built-in
flaw in older computer systems that would prevent them from
reading dates from January 1, 2000 onward.
</P>
<P>
"From what I see there is nothing to fear. I have consulted
many times with Secretary Filemon Uriarte of the Department of
Science and Technology and National Security Adviser Alexander
Aguirre. Both officials are keeping tabs on Y2K compliance," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Uriarte chairs the Presidential Commission on Year 2000
Compliance (Y2K Commission), while Aguirre heads the government's
Y2K contingency task force.

Elementary and primary schools were recently closed due to the
air pollution, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Over two million old vehicles which consume fuel more than the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Central Bank Urged To Reduce Interest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber
of Commerce (ZNCC) has urged the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to
reduce interest rates so as to stimulate the private sector in the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Zimbabwe News Agency on Saturday, ZNCC
President Nhlanhla Masuku said the current punitive interest rates
of over 60 percent prevailing on the market are stifling business
growth and worsening unemployment and poverty levels in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"Hard hit are the small to medium enterprises and
non-exporting firms who cannot access cheaper offshore loans
facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Masuku, the latest statistics show that the broad
money supply growth has decreased from 53.7 percent in July to 42
percent in October this year.
</P>
<P>
"This slowdown in monetary growth, coupled with expectations of
lower inflation in the new millennium, justifies a reduction in
the repo rate, which will result in other rates moving down in
sympathy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a tight monetary policy stance characterized by high
interest rates will not achieve the objective of price stability
unless it is accompanied by fiscal prudence.
</P>
<P>
"As we have pointed out before, the government is never
discouraged from domestic borrowing despite the high interest
rates. This has resulted in a serious domestic debt problem, which
has seen a 29 percent of total government expenditure being
diverted from productive purposes to meet interest payments on
this debt," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The chamber firmly urges the authorities to ensure that a
reduction in interest rates is a key figure of the millennium
economic recovery program," he said.

LUSAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambia increased its fuel
prices by 20 percent from mid-night of Friday, citing devaluation
of its currency Kwacha as the main reason for the price hike.
</P>
<P>
After the price hike, a litre of petrol is sold at 1,861 Kwacha

Some of the filling stations in the capital city are still hit

</P>
<P>
Public Relations Officer of the Energy Regulation Board (ERB)
Faidess Simunza was quoted by Zambia Daily Mail as saying here
Saturday that the hike has been prompted by the devaluation of
Kwacha.
</P>
<P>
Other factors taken into consideration are the global petroleum
price increase of an average of 37 percent between July and
December this year, said the officer.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia had to import petrol in foreign exchanges during
this period.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Speaks Before Leaving for Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has said that the Chinese Government's resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Macao and the establishment of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China mark
another important step on the road of China's full reunification.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also General Secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee and Chairman of the Central Military
Commission (CMC), made the remarks at a ceremony at the Great Hall
of the People here to see off the Chinese central government
delegation, headed by Jiang, before it was leaving for Macao.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the central government to send a delegation
with wide representation to attend the handover ceremony and
various celebrations in Macao is to demonstrate the strong
solidarity of the Chinese people of all nationalities and all the
compatriots, to illustrate the joyous mood of the Chinese people
for the return of Macao to the motherland, and to show the
resolute support of the central government and all the Chinese
people to the Macao SAR and compatriots in Macao, stressed Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Delegation members, including Zhu Rongji, Qian Qichen and Chi
Haotian, were present at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the delegation off were Li Peng, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing
and Li Lanqing, among other Party and State leaders.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the ever-growing prosperity and the rise of the
international status of China are the fundamental reason for the
return of Hong Kong and Macao, adding that the great idea of "one
country, two systems" proposed by the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping is the only correct way for China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the successful practice of the "one country, two
systems" idea in Hong Kong and Macao will serve as a model for the
solution of the Taiwan issue, and facilitate the nation's complete
reunification.
</P>
<P>
All the Chinese people are joyful for the return of Macao to
the motherland, and the world is also paying close attention to
the event, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the success of the ceremonial activities
will have profound and long-term impact on the promotion of
patriotism among the Chinese people, the consolidation of
solidarity among various nationalities in China, stepping up the
process of the full reunification of the motherland, and the grand
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
While participating in the ceremonial activities, members of
the delegation will demonstrate the glory and pride of the Chinese
people of all nationalities for the return of Macao, show the
courtesy of traditional Chinese culture, and express their deep
brotherhood to compatriots in Macao, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that during its stay in Macao, the delegation will
expound the central government's basic principles and policies
toward Macao after its return to the motherland to the compatriots
in Macao and guests from other countries.
</P>
<P>
The ceremonial activities will show a strong sense of
confidence to the outside world that the Macao SAR will surely be
able to maintain long-term stability and development and that the
prospects of Macao will be rosy under the guidance of the
principles of "one country, two systems", "Macao people governing
Macao" and a high degree of autonomy, said the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that the delegation will surely
fulfill its glorious task in Macao with the joint efforts of all
its members.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand Gears Up Y2K Preparation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 18 (Xinhua) -- With the clock ticking toward
a new millennium, Thailand has found itself in a rather
comfortable situation in countering the so-called Year 2000, or
Y2K, computer problem.
</P>
<P>
Y2K, also dubbed as millennium bug, is expected to hit older
computers that still use two digits to represent years, like 99
for 1999. There are fears that once 2000 arrives, computers could
mistake it for 1900, causing them to produce flawed data or crash.
</P>
<P>
As early as in April 1998, the Thai government had already
realized the risks that might result from the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
It then appointed the National Electronics and Computer
Technology Center to be the core agency in giving advice and
knowledge on the bug to government agencies as well as private
sector.
</P>
<P>
A National Y2K Coordinating Committee was later established to
tackle the problem. A deputy prime minister, Trairong Suwannakhiri,
was appointed to head the committee.
</P>
<P>
The government also set aside some 14 billion baht (363.6
million U.S. dollars) to correct the Y2K problems in government
agencies and state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the committee announced that all crucial
agencies in the public sector, including 31 organizations
providing essential public services and utilities, are 100 percent
Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
These organizations cover electricity and energy sector,
banking,
finance and insurance sector, telecommunication and transport
sector and social services sector.
</P>
<P>
In general, the committee said, the public and state
enterprises and organizations are deemed 80 to 100 percent Y2K
compliant.
</P>
<P>
As for the private sector, the tackling of Y2K problem is
linked to the image of the enterprises, prompting the sector to
take a more active stance.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that most large Thai factories,
especially those with foreign partners, are well prepared for the
bug.
</P>
<P>
Keeping its image in mind, Thai Airways International (THAI),
though a state enterprise, has taken pains to counter any
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, THAI spent about 300 million baht (7.5
million dollars) and deployed some 400 specialized personnel to
prepare for potential Y2K problems, its president Thamnoon Wanglee
revealed.
</P>
<P>
In October this year, the airline launched a 90-minute
simulation of a regular flight on the eve of January 1, 2000, with
Transport Minister Suthep Thaugsuban and other ministry officials
on board.
</P>
<P>
After the test, THAI announced that the national carrier is 100
percent Y2K compliant and its navigation, communications and all
flying systems will work normally when the clock strikes 12 at
midnight December 31.
</P>
<P>
However, risks are high in many small and medium-sized
enterprises, which lack funds to counter the millennium bug due to
a liquidity crunch resulting from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
These companies, particularly in the petrochemical industry,
are expected to be temporarily closed on December 31 and January 1
to avoid danger to life and property.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, they might face legal action from the authorities,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand now has been at high gear in drafting measures to
prepare for possible emergency situation at the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the 14 billion baht fund, the government has also
set aside three billion baht (77.9 million dollars) as an
emergency fund.
</P>
<P>
A Y2K National Command Center, located at the head office of
the Telephone Organization of Thailand, will be opened on December
29.
</P>
<P>
From noon on December 30, more than 100 staff will be stationed
at the command center to coordinate and monitor potential risks
around-the-clock. About 100,000 others will be deployed nationwide
to monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
A 24-hour Y2K hotline has also been set up to provide useful
information about the bug and instructions under emergency
situation.
</P>
<P>
Any public complaints or legal matters relating to Y2K
compliance will be handled by the Consumer Protection Board and
the Mediation Center on Year 2000 Problems, which is under the
Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A final test will be run on December 29 to assess the readiness
of the country.
</P>
<P>
After having done what it is able to do, Thailand now prays for
a smooth transition to the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Well Implement Foreign-Assisted Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that his administration will vigorously
pursue foreign-assisted projects to ensure their full and speedy
implementation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in his weekly radio-TV program here, Estrada
said that it was during his administration that several problem-
plagued foreign-assisted projects moved forward.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue all these projects. We are doing our best to
push through with these," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that he constantly keeps in touch with Director
General Felipe Medalla of the National Economic and Development
Authority to monitor the progress of foreign-assisted projects and
ensure that they are carried out on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was reacting to local press reports that the Asian
Development Bank, the World Bank and the Japan Bank for
International Cooperation will cut loans for the Philippines
because it failed to fully implement foreign-assisted projects.
</P>
<P>
In the same program, Medalla said that contrary to such reports,
there was no threat at all from the country's major aid donors to
put on hold pending loans to the Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he said, officials of the Philippine government
and the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank and the Japan Bank
for International Cooperation forged an agreement aimed at quickly
putting on track the implementation of existing projects funded by
these three donors.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi People Protest Over U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Iraqis, most of
them young students, took to the streets on Saturday morning to
protest over the U.N. Security Council's new comprehensive
resolution on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators shouted slogans "lift the sanctions now", "reject
the U.N. resolution", "end the sufferings of the Iraqi people" on
Baghdad's Ramadan 14th street, a famous downtown street.
</P>
<P>
Shalaan, one of the protestors, told Xinhua that Iraqis have
suffered too much under the embargo, but the U.S. and Britain do
not want to lift it, instead they want to prolong the suffering of
the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
So far the Iraqi government has not responded officially to the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Friday adopted a new comprehensive
policy on Iraq with 11 votes for and four abstentions. China,
Russia and France, three of the five permanent members of the
Council and Malaysia, one of the 10 non-permanent members,
abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stipulates the establishment of a new arms
control body -- the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection
Commission (UNMOVIC) -- in Iraq, and offers Iraq the chance to have
the trade sanctions suspended if it cooperates fully with the arms
inspectors and makes progress on key disarmament tasks to be
defined by the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly declared it will reject any U.N.
resolution that falls short of a total and unconditional lifting of
the sanctions imposed on the country following its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the new U.N. resolution, immediately after itis adopted,
the ceiling will be lifted on how much oil Iraq can sell, now set
at 5.2 billion U.S. dollars every six months under an oil-for-food
program, and restrictions on its imports of humanitarian supplies
will be eased.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Resume Suspended Aid to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has agreed to lift the hurdles for final negotiations
with the Kenyan government on the resumption of aid, Nairobi's
newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo, who announced the decision
on Friday, said a team from the IMF will visit Kenya in January
next year for detailed negotiations for a possible resumption of
the 2.05-million-U.S. dollar aid package suspended in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the IMF move is a recognition of the efforts made by
the Kenyan government in meeting the conditions set for loan
resumption to the East African country.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the IMF's Deputy Director for Africa
Goodall Gondwe is already in Kenya and will give the details of
the decision to Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since the IMF suspended the aid to Kenya two years ago, the
country's economy has undergone serious deterioration with massive
withdrawal of foreign investors. Consequently, the country's
growth rate dropped from 2.3 percent in 1997 to 1.8 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
This year's economic growth is expected to be about 1.4 percent
as a result of depressed economic activity in all sectors.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Ferrying Military Supplies With U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Defense Steven Kavuma has refuted an allegation by the rebels of
the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) that the government is using
convoys of humanitarian assistance to ferry military supplies.
</P>
<P>
"This is a lie," Kavuma told Xinhua in a telephone interview on
Saturday morning. "We have enough means to transport our troops
and support. We know the international convention and we can't
infringe them."
</P>
<P>
A report run by Saturday's Monitor daily said that the ADF
rebels have issued a two-page warning to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the
Red Cross, claiming that some of the relief including dry rations
and medical supplies, have been diverted to military purposes.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels have been launching a series of surprise attacks
on Uganda's security and civilian targets in the western districts
of Bundibugyo, Kasese and Kabarole, killing more than 20 people.
</P>
<P>
The government troops are said to be squeezing the rebels's
space in a bid to kill them. Kavuma recognized the difficulty of
the task, saying the different terrain in the region is providing
make-shift sanctuary for the rebels.

<HEADLINE> African Teenage Girls More HIV Positive Than Boys: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Recent studies in Africa have
shown that girls aged between 15-19 are about eight times more
likely to be HIV positive than boys of the same age, a report from
the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report published by Saturday's Zambia Daily
Mail newspaper, women aged between 20 and 24 are three times more
likely to be infected with HIV than men of their age.
</P>
<P>
Launched by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) resident
representative Peter McDermott, the report also said that women
aged 15-49 represent 43 percent of all new HIV infections, up from
40 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The report attributes girls' vulnerability to biological,
social and economical weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, very few young people receive the
accurate and appropriate information they need about AIDS and its
transmission.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS observed that the protection of the rights of girls and
women is critical in the context of AIDS, especially their rights
to set the terms of their own sexual activity, including its
safety and to refuse to sex altogether.

AMMAN, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has arrested 14 members of
a suspected extremist group which are based in Afghanistan but had
been planning terrorist attacks in the kingdom, the semi-official
Jordan Times Reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The number of the detainees rose to 14 after Pakistan extradited
a Jordanian, identified as Khalil Deek, to the kingdom on Thursday
at the request of Amman, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Deek is also wanted by Washington, but Jordan made the
extradition request first, so he was handed over to Amman, Jordan
Times said.

Earlier this month, the Jordanian security forces arrested 11
Jordanians, one Iraqi and one Algerian who had entered the kingdom
on forged passports after receiving military training in
Afghanistan.

All the 14 detainees were believed to be affiliated with a group
headed by the Afghanistan-based Saudi Arabian billionaire Osama Ben
Laden, who Washington said had masterminded last year's twin
bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed
224 people, including 12 Americans.

<HEADLINE> Health Experts Stress Compliance With Doctor's Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Do exactly what your
doctor suggested, your health will benefit much from it, the
American Heart Association said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Noncompliance with doctor's advice is a nation-wide hidden
health threat to the Americans, especially people with chronic
diseases, according to the association, the largest voluntary
health organization fighting cardiovascular disease and stroke.
</P>
<P>
More than half of all Americans with chronic diseases, such as
high blood pressure, do not follow their physician's medication
and lifestyle guidance, the association said.
</P>
<P>
The patients are usually told to take appropriate medical
treatment including diet, exercise, smoking cessation and
medication by healthcare provider. But 12 percent of all
prescriptions are never filled and more than half of all
prescription medications are taken improperly.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a recent study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, the association said that people who act as
doctor's advice to maintain low blood pressure and cholesterol
levels and to abstain smoking can add six to nine-and-a-half years
to their lives, compared to those who are less careful about their
health.
</P>
<P>
To heighten the public awareness of the importance of
compliance, the American Heart Association, with some four million
volunteers, has begun a campaign called the Compliance Action
Program. The program is aimed at physicians, nurses, pharmacists,
other allied health professionals and healthcare organizations, as
well as patients.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Bans Export Of Petrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
banned petrol export in any container other than a tank fixed to a
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The move announced on Friday is designed to stop people
illegally exporting the fuels such as petrol and paraffin which
are cheaper in the country than in neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
Noting that a number of people were buying paraffin and petrol
in Zimbabwean currency and exporting, Minister of Industry and
Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira stressed: "It is now illegal to export
petrol in any container other than a tank fixed to a vehicle and
paraffin in any container."
</P>
<P>
The disturbing thing was that foreigners were making several
trips a day to neighboring countries selling these products, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that "our fuel" on the domestic market was
cheaper compared to its neighboring countries because the
government subsidizes the commodities, particularly paraffin, to
make them affordable to local consumers.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Limit Vehicle Import to Euro-1 Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Ministry of
Population and Environment plans to forbid importing motor
vehicles that does not meet the Euro-1 standard in order to
improve the environmental situation in the country, the Kathmandu
Post on Saturday quoted a top ministry source as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have submitted a proposal seeking to allow the import of
only the Euro-1 standard vehicles into the country from January 1,
2000," the source said, hoping that the cabinet would endorse the
proposal in its upcoming meeting scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
Euro-1 emission norms had its genesis in Europe in the early
1990's. The norms require vehicles to belch relatively low toxic
gases than the ordinary vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A diesel vehicle meeting the norms should not exceed carbon
monoxide emission of 2.72 grams, hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide of
0.97 gram and particulate matters of 0.14 grams per kilometer.
</P>
<P>
A petrol vehicle should not exceed 2.72 grams of carbon
monoxide, 0.97 gram hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide gases per
kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the report, Minister of Environment and Population
Bhakta Bahadur Balayar said that the government was intent on
mandatorily enforcing Euro-1 emission norms in the country to
improve the environmental situation.
</P>
<P>
In what was hailed as a bold decision, the Nepali government in
September banned diesel-operated and heavily polluting three-
wheelers from the Kathmandu Valley, followed up by banning the
import of two-stroke motorbikes into the country.

The brutality was triggered by the death of an unidentified
military official who was found early on Friday, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that at least two platoons of TNI soldiers and
Brimob arrived at the place and conducted an inspection over the
incident.
</P>
<P>
"But they found no residents as local people had moved to other
place following the discovery (of the dead soldier), because they
were afraid that a revenge attack wound be launched by the
military personnel, the daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesia daily reported Saturday that in North
Aceh regency, 'rain of bullets' had been launched by unidentified
gun-men. At least two people died in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Aceh is the most-western province of Indonesia. It has been
under fire since the demand for independence and separation from
Indonesia was made by some people in the province. But the
Indonesian central government insists that it would not tolerate
any kind of separatism effort in the province.
</P>
<P>
In order to ease tension in the predominantly Moslem province,
the Indonesian government would soon implement a package of
autonomy bill which will allow the local government to enjoy its
natural resources and handle their own matters except defense,
finance and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid also agreed to try military
officials who were allegedly involved in human right abuse and
atrocities in the province.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Railway Rules out Y2K-Related Disruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Service users of the Bangladesh
Railway (BR) could rest assured with the dawning of the new
millennium, as the authorities have ruled out possibilities of
major service disruptions, The Financial Express reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"By and large, passenger and cargo operations of BR are
expected to be free from the cyber havoc as all the major
equipment requiring Y2K compliance have already undergone
necessary tests," BR director general Atikul Hossain Khan was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the software used in the operation of the railway was
now compliant, while some hardware still required compliance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Of the hardware, control devices of locomoting and generating
sets, and signaling and train-control systems were still to be
fully compliant. "We are now regularly examining the hardware base
and trying our best to achieve compliance," the director general
said, ruling out any major fiasco on this account.
</P>
<P>
He added that even if hardware compliance was not attained in
due time, services would face any setback as adequate backup
support systems have already been put in place.
</P>
<P>
The computerized wagon control system, one of the major
automated components of BR, was already Y2K compliant and the
cargo operations of the BR was totally free from the Y2K scare,
while in the passenger service area, the only thing requiring
compliance was its seat reservation and ticketing system, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bridge to Link China, Europe, Latin World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Macao is training managers from
80 small businesses in the Chinese mainland for a business trip to
Europe in next March. In return, an European economic and trade
delegation will then go to the inland areas of China via Macao for
discussions about technology transfer and investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Macao has become a link between the 1.2 billion Chinese people
and the one-sixth of world population who speak the Latin
languages, said Gary Mei-Cheong Ngai, executive director of the
Latin Foundation of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the unique cultural background of Macao
that has enjoyed close ties with the Latin world over the past
four and half centuries, Ngai is organizing exchanges of visits
between the business circles from the two major potential markets
in the world, namely China and the Latin world including south
Europe, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Since Macao is a free port located in the heart of the fastest
growing region in the world, the European Union (EU) has set up
its first Asian business consultation center in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In May 1992, the EU signed a trade cooperation agreement with
Macao. In 1993, the EU established partnership with Macao under
its international investment plan, encouraging exchanges between
small businesses in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Macao has set up an European Research Center,
with trade and economic representative offices opened in Lisbon of
Portugal and Brussels of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Latin America is also trying to use Macao as a gateway to the
Asia-Pacific market.
</P>
<P>
The Macao government has already set up the Macao Trade and
Investment Promotion Institute and the Macao Productivity and
Technology Transfer Center in order to facilitate information flow
between Macao and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
It has also been using the wide connection of overseas Chinese
and Macao-born Portuguese to reduce the gap between business
people from different continents.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the non-profitable Latin Foundation of Macao has
done a fruitful job since it was set up in 1997, Ngai said that
the private organization is planning to host a seminar on
exploring the markets in Latin America and China next year.

<HEADLINE> France to Continue Increase of Investment in Macao, French Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Consul General of France in
Hong Kong and Macao Jerome Pasquier said in a recent interview
that France firmly supports China's resumption of sovereignty over
Macao and will continue to increase French investment in Macao
after its return.
</P>
<P>
Pasquier said that he is confident about the future of Macao
and its return to China will bring new opportunities for French
businesses there.
</P>
<P>
Pasquier believed that Macao's return to the motherland will be
in a very positive direction of development and the "One Country,
Two Systems" concept will work well in Macao as it did in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a historic date, and China's recovery of
administration over Macao at the turn of the century is a good
symbol," Pasquier said. "I totally share the great joy and
pleasure with the Chinese people over the news."
</P>
<P>
As an Envoy, Pasquier has traveled frequently between Hong Kong
and Macao since he took office in Hong Kong last year. He has also
met with Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive-designate of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR) several times.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Macao are very optimistic of Macao's future, and
the new team of capable MSAR leaders have lots of new ideas to run
things well," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
With its unique multi-cultural backgrounds and scenic
attractions, Macao is an international city. And Macao's return
will benefit not only its own economic development and social
stability, but also the foreign trade and investment there, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The French government has attached great importance over Macao'
s return to China and will send a high-level delegation to attend
the ceremony in Macao since France is the biggest European
investor in Macao except Portugal, Pasquier said.
</P>
<P>
"We have had a rather good economic presence in Macao and we
have many French companies in Macao in dealing with water supply,
electricity, waste treatment, air transport, hotel and
entertainment," Pasquier said, adding that Macao's return to China
will provide a good basis for France to increase its trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason to change our foreign policy since the
system of Macao will remain unchanged," he added.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Stormy winds battered the
southern part of the Scandinavia Peninsula, especially southern
Sweden and Norway, Friday, disrupting electricity transmission,
forcing the closure of roads and delaying flights and ferry
operation.

<P>
The strong winds resulting from low atmospheric pressure above
the Atlantic Ocean hit the southern part of Scandinavia during the
day, and gained strength in the evening with a maximum speed of 34
meters per second.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Repeated heavy storms have
recently hit most parts of Yugoslavia, cutting off power and water
supplies, traffic and telephone service in some regions.
</P>
<P>
By mid-Friday, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported, it had
snowed over 24 hours in the northern and central regions of Serbia,
where snows had accumulated to 20 centimeters in depth, and even
up to one meter in some parts, paralyzing road traffic in many
places.
</P>
<P>
In Montenegro, continuous heavy snowfalls and rainfalls have
caused floods and blocked traffic. In the Montenegro capital city
of Podgorica, several hundreds families have been evacuated from
the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
In the northwestern town of Pljevlja, with 50 centimeters of
snow, public traffic routes were all blocked. Since midnight
Thursday, power supply and telephone service to half of the city
proper have been cut off. The provision of bread and milk has
been interrupted since early Friday.

The Bosnian meteorological authorities said the snowfalls
across Bosnia starting Wednesday have been the heaviest in more
than a decade.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Wishes Macao to Have a Bright Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 18 (Xinhua) --The United States wants to
maintain the continuity of the relationship between the people of
the U.S. and Macao after Macao's return to China, especially in
expanding the bilateral commerce, U.S. Consul General for Hong
Kong and Macao Michael Klosson said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see that the practice of `One Country, Two
Systems` will move in the positive direction in Macao as in Hong
Kong," Klosson said on the eve of Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Klosson, who took his current post in August this year, is
looking forward to attending the handover ceremony around the
midnight of December 19, along with two other U.S. official
representatives.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of history," Klosson told Xinhua in the interview.
</P>
<P>
The 50-year-old consul-general, a career Foreign Service
officer with 24 years of experience in East Asia, Europe and
senior U.S. State Department positions, thought Hong Kong's
situation after its return to the motherland indicates a bright
prospect of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Many people were concerned about Hong Kong's future prior to
its return on July 1, 1997, but I am glad to find the anxieties
and fears were not borne out," said Klosson.
</P>
<P>
"People see `One Country, Two Systems` implemented fairly
smoothly in Hong Kong and Hong Kong people running Hong Kong,
excluding foreign and defense affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the people in Macao don't have the same
fears that characterized many Hong Kong people's attitude leading
up to July 1,1997. The fact that things have gone in the positive
direction in Hong Kong has probably comforted people in Macao,"
Klosson said.
</P>
<P>
Klosson, having met with Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive-
designate of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR),
showed confidence in the leadership of the MSAR government, saying
"the United States is certainly hopeful that with the strong
leadership on the part of Ho, who has clear objectives to
accomplish, the legislative assembly and government of the MSAR,
Macao will see a positive evolution."
</P>
<P>
Klosson said that the U.S. has been trying to develop trade
with Macao and will continue that after its return to China.
</P>
<P>
At a reception held in Macao on September 22, 1999, Klosson
said that the U.S. currently receives nearly half of Macao's
exports and hopes to continue to serve as an important market for
Macao exporters, but is also eager to expand U.S. trade in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Klosson, who paid several visits to Macao in 1971-72 when he
was a young professor in Hong Kong, described Macao as a meeting
place between the East and West with a long history and
fascinating blend of cultures which attract more and more
Americans.
</P>
<P>
"Many more Americans have heard of Hong Kong than Macao, but
more people will know about Macao after this weekend with a lot of
attention to be paid to Macao's return to China," Klosson said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Settlement of Macao Issue Ushers in New Era for Sino- Portuguese Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What Deng said has played a guiding role ever since. Effective
cooperation between China and Portugal has contributed to a smooth
transition for Macao and its smooth return to China.
</P>
<P>
The going into force on January 15, 1988 of the Sino-Portugese
Joint Declaration marked the beginning of a transitional period
for Macao, a transition from Portuguese to Chinese rule. Over the
past 12 years, the two sides have joined hands in resolving a
series of major transition-related issues.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has pointed out, on different
occasions, that, in tackling the Macao issue, leaders of the two
nations should "take a strategic stand." He said: "The higher one
stands, the farther one can see. Ensuring a smooth transfer of
power in Macao accords with the fundamental interests of both
China and Portugal."
</P>
<P>
Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio speaks highly of the
cooperation between the two countries on the Macao issue, saying
that the Joint Declaration has set the orientation for Macao's
development, that the two countries have undertaken their
respective responsibilities and honored their commitments, and
that the results of their cooperation are very positive."
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah attributes Macao's smooth transition to
mutual trust and cooperation between China and Portugal, whose
governments have both adopted a responsible attitude toward
resolving standing issues during the period of transition and have
achieved good results.
</P>
<P>
Observers here point out that it is mutual trust and
cooperation between the two countries that has created conditions
necessary for the implementation of the policies of "one country,
two systems," "Macao people governing Macao" and "a high degree
autonomy" for Macao.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Striving to Improve Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Factories in the coastal city
of Tianjin in north China face shutdowns if they fail to meet
State standards on waste discharge by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,782 enterprises are targets of the campaign that
aims to halt further deterioration of air quality in the city,
today's China Daily said, quoting sources with the Tianjin
Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration demanded all
industries across the country stop discharging excessive
pollutants into the environment before the end of next year.
Tianjin actively responded to the demand and has set its own
deadline one year ahead.
</P>
<P>
Until now, about 99 percent of the enterprises in Tianjin have
been meeting the pollution control standard.
</P>
<P>
Others are cutting it close, running the risk of being put out
of business.
</P>
<P>
Most of the offending factories produce steel, cement,
pesticides, leather or starch, an official of the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The port city, which used to serve as a major industrial base
of north China, has achieved great improvements in its air quality.

<HEADLINE> Private Clinics To Be Protected in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 18 (Xinhua)-- Private clinics in Macao can
continue their business as usual and the rights and interests of
private doctors will be protected according to the Basic Law of
Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR) after the territory's
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Days before the handover the Licensing Office of the Macao
Health Services is still receiving applications for the open of
private clinics.
</P>
<P>
Miss Leong Pui San of the office now has got more than 70
applications to process.
</P>
<P>
Luo Xiaojin of the Association of Medicine of Macao said
private clinics, which are distributed in the residential areas,
treat over one half of patients in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show there are 444 medical doctors, most of whom
Chinese, working in private clinics of the region.

More than 70 civil servants working in the Health Services
department of the government run their own clinics or are part-
time doctors.
</P>
<P>
Most of the medical doctors in Macao are trained outside Macao,
mostly in the Chinese mainland, because Macao does not have any
medical school.

<P>
There is only one government-run hospital, Conde de Sao
Januario, and one private hospital, Kiang Wu, in Macao. The lack
of doctors, high expenses and language barriers have led to the
increase of private clinics and certified doctors.
</P>
<P>
Luo held that the private clinics will not be affected by but
benefit from the handover since the clinics will have more
opportunities to conduct exchanges and cooperation with mainland
professionals.
</P>
<P>
Macao's public health services have been improving in recent
years. The government has set up eight health care centers to
provide free medical services.
</P>
<P>
"This situation poses challenges to the private clinics," Luo
said. However, he believes the competition will help the residents
get better services.
</P>
<P>
Macao, with a population of 430,000, has a relatively advanced
medical and health care system. The average life span of Macao
people, 77.5 for male and 81.2 for female, is above the world's
average.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Groom Young Badminton Athletes in Provincial Chapters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 18 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) planned to groom young talented athletes in
provincial chapters.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult for us to maintain a training method by
centralizing the athletes in a national center like we do now. It
takes a lot of funds and is ineffective," PBSI official in charge
of athletes development Mangombar Ferdinand Siregar said.
</P>
<P>
"PBSI will also recruit coaches for the chapters, who will be
given programs and targets similar to those we give to our coaches
in the center. We will ask them to groom young athletes based on
the center's training standards. Some chapters have requested
authority to stage the training when they attended the national
congress in Semarang, Central Java, earlier this month," he said.
</P>
<P>
By adopting the new method, he said, PBSI can observe their
progress by staging an annual tournament to decide their overall
rankings.
</P>
<P>
"We can also decide which international tournaments we will
send them to by looking at their national rankings," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new method would be more effective and efficient in seeking
younger potential talent, especially for the women's teams, he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, former world number one badminton player Susi
Susanti criticized PBSI by saying that it should have recruited
younger players, aged between 14 and 16 years old, despite
admitting winners of national tournaments.
</P>
<P>
"Generally, I agree with Susi's opinion because if we don't
groom the younger players as soon as possible, it will be too late
for them to reach international standards of playing," Siregar
said.
</P>
<P>
He said with the new method, PBSI would not need to have a
promotion and relegation system to pick the best players in the
center.
</P>
<P>
PBSI plans to expel six of its 66 players in the center this
month. Three senior women's shuttlers -- Susi, Mia Audina and
Meiluawati -- have withdrawn from the center. Susi withdrew due to
pregnancy, Miamoved to the Netherlands to follow her husband while
Meiluawati had to resign due to a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said PBSI had focused its attention on five younger
athletes, who had yet to join the center, including girls singles
Chung Siang and boys singles Ignatius Rudy, who just won the
national championships in Semarang earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the annual recruitment system, which admitted
winners of national circuits, would be conducted on June 1 next
year.
</P>
<P>
Siregar said he also agreed with Susi's idea of not
specializing younger players in certain events.
</P>
<P>
"We have changed this for newly recruited players. However, we'
ll still have to observe their performance during training and
tournaments. We'll also have to discuss with players and coaches
the benefits they can gain by playing singles and doubles," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Siregar criticized the condition in the center's dormitories,
where most shuttlers had luxury cars and telephones in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
"This is an impact of metropolitan life. We can't resist it. We
call on them to open their hearts to know what their duty is," he
added

<HEADLINE> Tourism And Gambling Continue To Be MSAR's Leading  Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Macao's tourist and gambling
industry, which is well-known worldwide, will remain a leading
industry of Macao after its return to China on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR)
explicitly stipulates that Macao's existing capitalist system and
way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years and the SAR
government shall on its own make policies on tourism and
entertainment and gaming in the light of its overall interests.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and gambling industry in Macao consists mainly of
tourism, hotel, gambling and catering businesses and recreational
activities, holding an important position in the economic
structure of Macao. It provides more than 70,000 jobs, accounting
for some one third of Macao's total employed population; and it
contributes up to 42 percent of Macao's total output value,
ranking the first in its four pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
The number of travel agencies and hotels in Macao fully
indicates the prosperity of local tourism and gambling industry.
Presently it has some 120 travel agencies, over 100 hotels and
inns with more than 8,000 rooms. It also boasts over 200
entertainment and recreational facilities, including bars, dance
halls and night clubs.
</P>
<P>
Gambling plays a principal role in Macao's tourist and gambling
industry, with diversified species including lottery tickets,
casino gambling, greyhound racing and horse racing.
</P>
<P>
The history of gambling in Macao can be traced back to 150
years ago. In 1961 the then government publicly sought the
franchised right to gambling and the Macao Society of Tourism and
Entertainment (STDM) obtained the franchised right the next year
and has since operated the business up till now. In 1997 the STDM
signed a revised contract with the government for the franchised
right for the gambling industry, extending the contract to 2001.
</P>
<P>
Tourist and gambling industry entered a stage of fast
development since the early 1990s. The opening of the Macao
International Airport at the end of 1995 has afforded the tourist
industry a new opportunity for development. In 1996, Macao
received more than eight million tourists from outside Macao, a
record high, and 68,000 Macao residents travelled outside Macao. (

<TEXT>
<P>
Apart from the tax contribution, the industry has also brought
direct benefits to the government in other ways, such as providing
jobs to over 10,000 people and financing in part the public
projects, social charity and cultural undertakings. It has also
benefited many other industries to a certain extent, such as the
hotel industry, the catering business, transportation, banking and
the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
In addition to gambling, the unique features of Macao blending
both Chinese and Western cultures has attracted worldwide visitors.
</P>
<P>
"Gaming has played a significant role in the initial stages of
the development of Macao's tourism industry. Yet, we have always
had a strong conviction that Macao has more to offer to visitors
than just gaming," said Maria Helena, deputy-director of the Macao
Government Tourism Office. Only a greater emphasis on cultural
contents can establish a distinctive tourism image of Macao, she
added.
</P>
<P>
"The territory is unique because of our rich heritage
accumulated over 400 years of the coexistence of the Portuguese
and the Chinese," she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macao is exerting more influence around the world
by hosting a number of international events every year, such as
music festival, art festival, fireworks display contest, Grand
Prix car-racing and dragon-boat racing, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Ho Hau Wah, Chief Executive-designate of the future MSAR, said
that Macao should make greater efforts to develop tourism, add new
scenic spots and tourist programs, and reinforce tourism
administration after its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of this year, the number of visitors
to Macao increased five percent from the year-ago period, of which
the number of visitors from the Chinese inland areas doubled that
in the same period last year. After returning to the motherland,
Macao will enjoy a better environment for developing its tourism.
</P>
<P>
The principle of "one country, two systems" has been
successfully implemented in Hong Kong, and horse racing,
considered a typical capitalist way of life, is still on its track
two years after Hong Kong became a special administrative region.
There is every reason to believe that tourism and gambling will
continue to be a leading industry of Macao SAR.

dealing a heavy blow to the attempts by the United States and
Britain to show Iraq a unified stand of the council.

The resolution required nine votes and no veto to pass the
council which has been locked in debates for eight months. It sets

BEIJING, December 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing set up a high-tech
development park on Friday near the Capital International Airport
for returned scholars to make their economic beginnings in China,
says today's China Daily.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Germany Offers Nazi-era Slave, Forced Laborers Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Germany Friday offered 10
billion marks (5.2 billion U.S. dollars) to compensate Nazi-era
slave and forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
German chief negotiator Otto Lambsdorff told a news conference
in Berlin on Friday that a meeting of victim groups in Washington
in February would try to determine the level of individual awards.
</P>
<P>
Slave laborers who were supposed to work to death in
concentration camps would receive a much larger amount of money
than forced laborers who were deported from their home countries
to work in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The 10 billion marks will be jointly raised by the federal
government, local governments and big companies.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 top German companies, many facing legal action for
using forced labor during the war, have joined a fund for this
purpose.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Timing of Macao Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 18 (Xinhua) -- On December 20, 1999, the
Chinese government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over
Macao. How was the date of Macao's return to the motherland
decided?
</P>
<P>
Years ago, the timing of Macao's return used to be an issue of
difference between China and Portugal. At the very beginning of
its negotiations with Portugal, China made it clear that taking
into consideration of the friendship between the two countries,
China will put an interval between the handover of Macao and that
of Hong Kong so that Macao will return to China one year later
than Hong Kong. That is to say, China will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the Portuguese side insisted that Macao should have a
longer transitional period than Hong Kong. In 1986, some
Portuguese even openly suggested that the date of Macao's return
to China should be in 2017, the 460th anniversary of the
occupation of Macao by the Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
In November, 1986, the two sides failed to reach an agreement
on the timing of Macao's return when the then Chinese Vice-Foreign
Minister Zhou Nan visited Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"Accomplishing the great cause of return of Hong Kong and Macao
to the motherland by the end of the 20th century is both the
aspiration of the Chinese people and the determination of the
Chinese government," Zhou told reporters at airport at the end of
his visit to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
On December 31, 1986, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said
in a statement: "Resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Macao
before 2000 is the unshakable stand and aspiration of the one
billion Chinese people, including the compatriots in Macao. Any
proposition about Macao's return to China after 2000 are
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government took such a strong stand that Macao be
returned to China by the end of the century that the Portuguese
government had to reconsider the timing of Macao's return.
</P>
<P>
In January, 1987, the State Council of Portugal held a plenary
meeting to discuss this issue. It was concluded at the meeting
that maintaining and promoting friendship and cooperation with the
People's Republic of China is of great significance for
safeguarding the stability and prosperity in Macao, and it was
agreed at the meeting that Portugal would handover Macao to China
on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
China welcomed the decision that Portugal made. But at the same
time, China said that the date was too close to the year 2000 to
have time for handling many issues. China suggested that the
handover take place on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
On March 7, 1987, Portuguese President Mario Alberto N. L.
Soares presided over another meeting of the State Council and
accepted China's proposal.
</P>
<P>
On April 13, 1987, China and Portugal signed an Joint
Declaration on the issue of Macao in the Great Hall of the People
in Beijing. The Joint Declaration points out explicitly that the
Macao region is part of the Chinese territory and that the
Government of the People's Republic of China will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Guagua Pichincha Volcano Erupts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The Guagua Pichinhca volcano,
some 10 kilometers west of Quito, Friday spew ashes and vapor high
into the sky.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the National Polytechnic School Geophysical
Institute said the first of a series of eruptions occurred at 07:
43 local time (12:43 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Water steam and volcanic material rose some 12 kilometers above
the volcano, which is 4,794 meters above the sea level, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Quito's international airport was closed again Friday due to
the ash fallout caused by more eruptions of the Guagua Pichincha
volcano.
</P>
<P>
The Mariscal Sucre airport of the Ecuadorian capital decided to
suspend its operations until the situation becomes normal, said
civil aviation authorities.
</P>
<P>
Many national and international flights were delayed or
canceled as volcanic ash kept on falling.
</P>
<P>
The National Polytechnic School Geophysical Institute (IGEPN)
said that after early Friday morning there had been more than 10
explosions in Guagua Pichincha.
</P>
<P>
IGEPN technicians said that the volcanic eruption contained 60
percent of ashes and 40 percent of water.
</P>
<P>
School students were seen covering their nose and mouth with
gauze to filter out the ash and protecting their eyes with goggles.
</P>
<P>
Guagua Pichincha registered its biggest eruption on November 25
when it spewed 2 million tons of ashes, half of which fell onto
Quito's urban areas and the rest on the mountains.
</P>
<P>
IGEPN volcanologists said that Guagua Pichincha's explosions
could continue for months and even for years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Romania has until now
qualified with 132 athletes at the 2000 Olympic Games and aims to
be among the first 15 nations of the world, Secretary-General of
the Romanian Olympic Committee Dan Popper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the 132 athletes cover 14 athletic sports
items, to which gymnastics contributed the most. Popper also cited
boxing, athletics, rowing, swimming and weightlifting as events
where Romanians had performed well.
</P>
<P>
Popper said that foil women, wrestling, judo and canoeing did
not fare that well. However he said there were chances to a
victory in these disciplines alike.
</P>
<P>
Romanian tennis and polo players can make a breakthrough in
Sydney, Popper said, forecasting the presence of a 150-160
Romanian athletes delegation in Australia in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the results of 1999, Popper said that Romanian
athletes rounded up this year with good results, winning 24
Olympic medals, of which nine were gold, at world and European
championships. "After nearly a quarter of a century, Romanian
handball women players rejoined the Olympic family, by qualifying
for Sydney during the World Championships in Norway," Popper said.

<HEADLINE> Online Travel Sites Attract Millions of Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Online travel sites have
attracted millions of Americans since the beginning of this year's
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
According to a study released Friday by PC Data, a service
tracking Web usage information and buying patterns, Priceline.com
emerged as the top site for U.S. Internet users shopping for
information on Thanksgiving holiday air travel, with 3.2 million
unique home visitors in November. This translated into a 71
percent increase over the previous month's figures of the online
service which allows travelers to bid on airline and hotel fares.
</P>
<P>
Following Priceline were online travel sites of Travelocity and
Expedia, with 2.8 million and 2.1 million visitors respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the airline-sponsored sites, Southwest Airlines came first
with 1.5 million users, followed by American Airlines and Delta
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The study also revealed that most U.S. home Internet users
reserved their holiday flights through direct channels as opposed
to travel agents. Thirty-two percent booked flights online, while
31 percent booked flights by telephone directly through an airline.
Twenty percent booked through a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
Air travelers go online, PC Data said, because they want
information, especially want to know the shortest, easiest and
least expensive path to book their flights.
</P>
<P>
The success of the Southwest site has to do with a design that
transfers the company's reputation to the Internet, according to
PC Data. The traditionally low-cost airline fared well in the
study because its direct channel philosophy transfers easily to
the Internet, enabling it to expand its consumer base and continue
to keep its costs down.
</P>
<P>
PC Data surveyed 4,100 home-based Internet users in November.
Sixty-eight percent of the users between the ages of 18 and 34
booked their flights online or by telephone directly to an airline
compared with 56 percent between the ages of 35 and 65.

<HEADLINE> EU Sees Fine Progress By Italy in Public Account </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy can now take its place
beside four other EU countries who have sorted out their public
finances this decade by first raising taxes and then lowering them,
according to a new European Commission's (EC) report.
</P>
<P>
According to Italian news agency Ansa, in a still-unreleased
report on Italy's slow economic growth since 1990, the EC's
economic affairs division said that the improvement in the nations
' public finances had been "exceptional."
</P>
<P>
Italy's primary deficit - the part of public spending financed
by government bonds - has fallen by 9.5 percent this decade, twice
as much as any other European Union country, as a series of
deficit-slashing budgets have been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the budget-cutting came from higher taxation
concentrated around 1992-93, when the first European Monetary
Union crisis took place, and 1996-97, when Italy was chasing a
place in the euro.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, when Italian former Premier Silvio Berlusconi was in
power, the campaign to right accounts missed a beat or two, with "
a certain uncertainty in fiscal policy," the report said.
</P>
<P>
But from 1998, with public accounts vastly improved, the
emphasis had switched and governments had begun re-modulating the
tax system, reducing rates in many areas.
</P>
<P>

Flight 1243 from Detroit had just landed during light snowfall

"The nose gear and the right main landing gear are off the

about halfway up the tire."

The Boeing 737 carried six crew members and 114 passengers, who

said. However, he said he did not know why the pilot was unable to
stop the plane.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns EU on Launching New Round of Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The warning came from U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky after the leaders of both sides pledged commitment at a
summit to launching a new round of trade talks in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following the White House summit,
Barshefsky said the EU's proposals at the third ministerial
meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle earlier this
month posed a major challenge to the start of a new round.
</P>
<P>
"If Europe stays with its proposals from Seattle, a round will
simply not launch. This is going to be considerable challenge,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. demanded the removal of all farm subsidies be put on
the agenda of the next round of trade talks while the EU rejected
it.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that Europe will appreciate that it must be
flexible on these issues, certainly more flexible than
demonstrated in Seattle, if the negotiating agenda is to be
developed," Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
Pacal Lamy, the EU's trade commissioner, told reporters that
there should be no "blame games" for the failure to launch a new
round and what is important now is both sides committed themselves
to the process.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders from the EU and U.S. President Bill Clinton said
earlier Friday they continued to be committed to launching a new
round despite the failure to do so in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides note their disappointment at the failure to reach
agreement on a new round of trade negotiations at Seattle, but
they agree it is now important to find a way forward," they said
in a statement after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, the EU and the U.S. both pledge continued
readiness to work with (WTO) Director-General Mike Moore and our
partners to launch an inclusive new round as soon as possible,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the new round has to be "definitively
different from its predecessors."
</P>
<P>
"It should encompass the built-in agenda of agriculture and
services, further and effective market access liberalization,
support our efforts to harness globalization by strengthening and
extending WTO rules, and address the concerns of both developing
countries and civil society," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from 135 WTO members failed to launch the new
round in Seattle early this month due to sharp differences between
the developed and the developing countries, and disputes between
the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries complained that their interests are
ignored in the negotiations and the process lacks transparency.
They also insist that the labor issue should not be on the agenda
of the trade negotiations as the U.S. proposed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the EU stressed the need to take full account of
the lessons of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
They said work should be directed towards a set of measures
that will provide more participation by the poor countries, offer
great transparency and boost overall public support for the WTO.
</P>
<P>
In Seattle, tens of thousands of anti-WTO protesters rallied in
downtown and prevented the officials from attending the meeting
earlier this month. The police had to use tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
On labor, the U.S. and the EU agreed that they will work with
other members to "engage the WTO and ILO (The International Labor
Organization) in a constructive dialogue, including consideration
of the relationship between core labor standards, further
liberalization, trade policy and social development."
</P>
<P>
Referring to environment, they said they will work together to
ensure that trade rules support and do not undermine the ability
of governments to establish and achieve high levels of
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
They affirmed their commitment to "maximizing the benefits
developing countries gain from being in the WTO."
</P>
<P>
"We agreed to take forward a preferential market access
initiative for least developed WTO members," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
EU Commission President Romano Prodi and Martti Ahtisaari, the
president of Finland, who now holds the six-month EU presidency,
attended the summit. The 15-member EU and the U.S. held a summit
semi-annually.

<HEADLINE> Vialli Handed Euro Touchline Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli
will have to watch his side's next Champions League clash from the
stands after being given a one-match touchline ban by European
soccer governing body UEFA.
</P>
<P>
The punishment follows his outburst in the Champions League
game against Lazio in Rome, when he was ordered from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
Vialli was dismissed from the dugout during the goalless draw
after losing his temper with an official over a decision by German
referee Hellmut Krug.
</P>
<P>
Krug blew for a foul by Tore Andre Flo just as he was lining up
a shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
The normally-reserved Vialli who apologised afterwards will
have to sit in the stands for Chelsea's trip to Olympique
Marseille in March.
</P>
<P>
"I have to accept it. It's part of the game. The referee made
his decision and I have to get on with it," said Vialli.
</P>
<P>
"From my point of view it is a bit disappointing because as a
manager I like to be there for all the matches," he added.

<HEADLINE> Italian Antitrust Fines Coca Cola 30 Billion Lire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Italy's antitrust authority has
fined Coca Cola Italy 30.6 billion lire (about 16.5 million U.S.
dollars) for unfair business practices aimed at edging rival Pepsi
Cola out of a key sector of Italy's soft drinks market.
</P>
<P>
According to the authority, Coca Cola Italy offered weighty
incentives to pubs and bars to convert their draught cola taps
from Pepsi Cola to Coca Cola and gave preferential treatment to
wholesalers dealing in their beverage alone.
</P>
<P>
The moves were part of an illegal strategy "aimed at expelling
the principal competitor from the draught drinks section of the
market," abusing a position of dominance, a statement said.
</P>
<P>
Coca Cola and the Italian companies it controlled had the
national soft drinks market sewn up, the authority said, putting
the Atlanta-based company's market share at 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The authority's investigation, which started from a complaint
by Pepsi Cola, also uncovered illegal practices by Socib and Sosib,
two Italian firms authorized to bottle Coca Cola.
</P>
<P>
The two companies were fined a total of 800 million lire (about
43,000 U.S. dollars) for imposing exclusive contracts on
wholesalers, who were thus forced to purchase all their supplies
of soft drinks in one place.
</P>
<P>
The authority ordered Coca Cola to "end such practices
immediately" and gave it four months to prepare a report outlining
action taken to remedy the situation.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson 'Troublemaker' Slur Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United chairman
Martin Edwards described Friday claims of a rift between himself
and manager Sir Alex Ferguson as "nonsense".
</P>
<P>
The allegations appear in a new book - Manchester Unlimited -
by sports journalist Mihir Bose about BSkyB's attempted takeover
of the club.
</P>
<P>
Edwards is reported to have described Ferguson as a"
troublemaker" and questioned his ability to handle money.
</P>
<P>
Bose quotes a United insider who described Edwards' reaction
when BSkyB representative Sir Tim Bell suggested that Ferguson
should be kept informed of the takeover plans.
</P>
<P>
"Christ, no! You don't want to see him. He's a troublemaker,"
Edwards is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If you tell him, he'll leak everything. He's totally hostile
and I've just written him a letter warning him."
</P>
<P>
Edwards is also alleged to have reacted with similar horror
when it was suggested that Ferguson should benefit financially
from the takeover.
</P>
<P>
"Don't give him money, for Christ's sake. The man's useless,"
is what Edwards is supposed to have said.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first report that the two most powerful men in
Old Trafford do not have a close relationship.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's own book Managing My Life, saw him admit that he
found the chairman hard to deal with, particularly over finance.
</P>
<P>
And Edwards has suggested in the past that it may be better for
the club if Ferguson moved on when his managerial career was over
rather than take a seat on the board.
</P>
<P>
The chairman has refused to comment in detail about the latest
claims.
</P>
<P>
"This is a load of nonsense," he was quoted by local media as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"I will not comment on hearsay or allegations in books," he
said.

LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- West Ham's Worthington Cup
campaign is in danger after it was revealed that they fielded an
ineligible player against Aston Villa last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Omoyimni came on as a substitute in the final eight
minutes of extra time during the Upton Park quarter-final.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerian-born striker was cup-tied, having played for
Gillingham in both legs of their second round tie with Bolton.
</P>
<P>
The Hammers went on to win on penalties after the match was
drawn 2-2.
</P>
<P>
The breach means that West Ham could be forced to replay the
match, or, worse still, they could be thrown out of the
competition.

<HEADLINE> RUC Reforms to Start in New Year in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary of State Peter Mandelson said Friday that he will start
implementing the reforms of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in the
new year.
</P>
<P>
He said he also wanted to scale down security forces in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Writing in Friday's London Independent newspaper, the secretary
of state said he intended to implement the Patten proposals on
policing but he hoped "in a way that carried the support and
goodwill of both communities."
</P>
<P>
He wrote, "I am aware of the balance we must keep between, on
the one hand, scaling down the security forces' profile as quickly
as possible to reflect the huge change there has been in Northern
Ireland, while on the other, not leaving people vulnerable to
attack from dissidents on both sides who oppose progress."
</P>
<P>
A number of Patten's 175 proposals for policing reform raised
hostility from unionists in Northern Ireland, especially those
dealing with changes to the RUC's name and the badge which bears
the Irish harp and British Crown.
</P>
<P>
He said the government supported the report in principle but
key questions of how it was implemented, when it was implemented
and over what period remained to be taken by him.
</P>
<P>
When the Patten report was published in September, the Ulster
Unionist leader, David Trimble, said they hoped Mandelson would "
cherry-pick" the recommendations, setting aside the most
controversial suggestions for changing the RUC.
</P>
<P>
Trimble -- now the first minister of the new devolved
government at Stormont -- described the proposals as a "gratuitous
insult" to the memory of the more than 300 RUC officers killed
during the 30 years of the Troubles.
</P>
<P>
The report was broadly welcomed by nationalists but Sinn Fein
said its recommendations did not go far enough towards their aim
of total disbandment of the RUC.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Rehabilitate Rural Roads in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Friday that it has approved 103.9 million U.S. dollars in credit
to Vietnam to help rehabilitate rural roads and bridges in 36
provinces into reliable, all-weather roads, giving the rural poor
improved access to markets, health centers and schools.
</P>
<P>
The Rural Transport II Project will concentrate on
rehabilitating rural roads in the poorer sections of Vietnam which
lack basic, all-weather road access. Four additional provinces
will benefit under the same project through a grant of 26.2
million dollars from the British government.
</P>
<P>
In addition to improving the delivery of health care and
education services to the provinces' rural poor, improved road
access is expected to stimulate rural economic activity in the
agriculture and service sectors, which will increase rural incomes
and employment levels in the project area, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project construction and maintenance activities will
provide additional employment opportunities in rural areas beyond
the project area, the bank added.
</P>
<P>
The credit of 103.9 million dollars will be provided by the
International Development Association, World Bank's concessionary
lending affiliate, at the bank's standard rate for multi-currency
credits with 40 years to maturity and a 10-year grace period.

desertification and drought. The project may last 10 to 12 years
and Germany's total contribution is expected to reach 11 million

<HEADLINE> South Africa to Enter Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, December 17 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will
become a member of the Southern Common Market (Mercosur),
Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian foreign minister made the announcement during a
press conference at the Brazilian Trade Confederation.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Brazilian diplomacy said that he has contacted
the South African trade minister to discuss the possible admission
of South Africa into Mercosur since the Brazilian government is
seeking an alternate way after the failure of the negotiations
with the World Trade Organization in Seattle, the United States
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the most important economy of the African
continent, and is a country with which Brazil has big similarity,
said Lampreia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the admission of South Africa into Mercosur could
promote the relations of the Latin American subregional bloc with
the other countries of southern Africa, such as Mozambique, Angola,
and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
He said he will travel to South Africa in February to discuss
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, created in 1995, is made up of four member countries:
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, and two associated
countries, Chile and Bolivia.

<HEADLINE> Britain To Write Off Third World Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to write off
hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in debts owed to it by some
of the world's poorest countries, Chancellor of the Exchequer (
Finance Minister) Gordon Brown said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that as a result of the discussions I have been
having that other countries may be prepared to follow," Brown told
BBC Television.
</P>
<P>
"In return for the countries that have debts accepting that
the money that is relieved will not go to military expenditure or
to waste or bureaucracy but go to poverty reduction, we are
prepared on a case by case basis to go up to 100 percent and
therefore relieve all the debts the countries have to the United
Kingdom," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he was preparing to announce debt relief to around
two thirds of the world's 41 poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that at least 25 countries will receive help with
their debt burdens during the coming year.
</P>
<P>
In June, The Group of Seven major powers approved their biggest
international debt relief package yet which could write-off about
one third of all the loans owed by the world's poorest countries.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Security Council Adopts Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 17 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council narrowly adopted Friday a resolution which could
resume U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq under conditions of
cooperation from Baghdad, but three of the five permanent members
of the council questioned its enforceability with little hope for
Iraq to have the sanctions suspended, if not completely lifted.
</P>
<P>
The resolution passed 11-0, with four abstentions by permanent
council members China, Russia and France, along with Malaysia,
dealing a heavy blow to the attempts by the United States and
Britain to show Iraq a unified stand of the council.
</P>
<P>
The resolution required nine votes and no veto to pass the
council which has been locked in debates for eight months. It sets
up a new arms inspection agency, named the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), to replace the U.
N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM, established in April 3, 1991, has stopped
functioning since the U.S. and Britain launched air strikes at
Iraq a year ago. Baghdad barred it from returning to work,
charging it with serving the U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
The long and detailed document fell short of spelling out what
exactly Iraq should do before the suspension of the nine-year-old
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded its neighboring country
Kuwait. Russia, China and France believed that more hope should be
given to the Iraqis in exchange for their cooperation in weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
 China's Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun told
the council before the voting that at a time of no consensus among
the council members and no commitment from Iraq to cooperation,
the passage of the resolution will not help solve the protracted
issue. He demanded that the new inspection commission be objective,
impartial, transparent, accountable, more sympathetic with the
Iraqis' plight, with its mission clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
Russian Representative Sergey Lavrov stressed that the new
monitoring system must be acceptable by Iraq. "There had been
vague wording in the draft about lifting sanctions, with the
underlying purpose of endlessly postponing the lifting of
sanctions," he said.
</P>
<P>
France decided to abstain from the voting after its efforts
failed to bridge the gaps and secure a consensus among the council
's Big Five. It delayed the voting originally scheduled for last
Friday, fearing its economic interests in Iraq may be hurt if it
went along with the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The resolution is intentionally vague on exactly disarmament
tasks Iraq had to take before a suspension of sanctions. It would
suspend the sanctions against Iraq, renewable every 120 days, if
inspectors report that Baghdad had cooperated with them in all
respects and made progress in disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Russia and China wanted the sanctions to be suspended soon
after Iraq allows inspectors to return to work, while the U.S. and
Britain pressed hard for more Iraqi compliance.
</P>
<P>
British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, who sponsored the
resolution and presided over the eight-month debate on it, hailed
the vote as an "exceptional achievement" and a show of the council
's unity in seeking a new Iraq policy.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Peter Burleigh told the council, "In adopting this
resolution today, the Security Council has demonstrated that it
has the patience and the resolve to uphold the requirements it set
in resolution 687. Now we await the response from Baghdad."
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM was set up in line with Security Council resolution
687.
</P>
<P>
Reuters reported that leading Iraqi parliamentarian Khalid al-
Douri had rejected the newly adopted U.N. resolution, saying "Iraq
does not accept the new resolution and will not accept any
decision which does not lift the embargo without any restrictions
or conditions."
</P>
<P>
Khalid ak-Douri is leading the parliament's Arab and Foreign
Relations Committee.
