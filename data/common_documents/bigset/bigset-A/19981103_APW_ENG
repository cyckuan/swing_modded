Contamination scare: water authority offers compensation deal

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Authorities Tuesday agreed to pay
compensation to businesses which suffered losses during Sydney's
water contamination scare, which left bars without ice and dentists
unable to rinse out patients' mouths.
	   During on-again, off-again warnings for about six weeks from
July to September, more than 3 million residents of the city were
told to boil their tap water for at least one minute before
drinking it.
	   They were told they would be otherwise risking serious illness
from dangerous parasites.
	   There were no reports of serious illnesses caused by the
contamination, but the scare was a serious embarrassment Sydney in
the leadup to the 2000 Olympics.
	   The alerts included businesses which used tap water such as
hotels, bars, some manufacturers and retailers who sold fresh fruit
and vegetables.
	   Some businesses, including dentists, closed during the scare
while others were forced to buy bottled water.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon was preparing a class-action lawsuit
on behalf of about 400 businesses against Sydney Water Corp.
	   But the parties Tuesday presented a plan to the Federal Court
which would avoid litigation and offers compensation to claimants
who can prove they suffered financial losses as a result of the
scare.
	   Under the plan, Sydney Water will assess all claims individually
and make an offer of up to 100 percent of claimed losses. The court
was told no cap had been set, so the potential bill was unlimited.
	   Under the deal, which is yet to be approved by the court,
newspaper advertisements will be posted to attract more potential
claimants. Slater and Gordon lawyer Andrew Grech said it was
certain the compensation bill would total millions of dollars.
	   Sydney Water spokesman Colin Judge said the corporation would
not try to restrict the number of businesses which entered into the
scheme, but it would only agree to pay legitimate claims.
	   ``We want to get this right,'' Judge told Australian
broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   The scheme does not apply to individual consumers, and a hearing
for the case on behalf of people claiming compensation for illness
was set for Nov. 11.

	   UNIONDALE, New York (AP) _ Robert Reichel had a four-point game
with two goals and two assists Monday night to lead the New York
Islanders to a 6-2 victory over the Florida Panthers.
	   Bryan Smolinski added two goals and Trevor Linden and Claude
Lapointe each had a goal and assist as the Islanders moved into a
first-place tie with Philadelphia in the Atlantic Division.
	   Tommy Salo stopped 18 shots for the win.

	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Peter Forsberg broke out of his
goal-scoring drought with his first goal of the season and two
assists as Colorado stopped Carolina.
	   Goaltender Arturs Irbe, the NHL player of the month for October
after posting a 0.76 goals against average, allowed Colorado's
first shot of the game to slip under his pads and couldn't stop
Forsberg's blast from the slot over his left shoulder with 8:54
left.
	   Irbe had allowed one goal or less in six straight starts before
giving up three against Colorado.

Japan announces aid package to Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Japan will give Indonesia 4.45 billion
yen (38.6 million dollars) to help the poor and boost food
production, Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said Tuesday.
	   Komura announced the aid at a signing ceremony with his
Indonesian counterpart, Ali Alatas, at the foreign ministry in
Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
	   Indonesia has been hit hard by the economic turmoil that has
battered many Asian countries.
	   Millions of Indonesians have lost their jobs and economic
hardship from rising prices set off riots that helped oust
President Suharto in May.
	   Indonesia is now implementing democratic reforms and is
overhauling its economy in line with a multi-billion dollar rescue
package set up by the International Monetary Fund. Japan is
participating in the bailout.
	   ``I would like to pay tribute to Indonesia for its efforts taken
in the fields of political and economic reforms despite the
difficulties it faces,'' said Komura, who is on a six-day trip that
will include stops in Australia and New Zealand.
	   ``Japan is determined to support Indonesia,'' he said.
	   Japan, though itself in recession, has been called on to lead
the region to economic recovery.
	   Japan will give 3 billion yen (dlrs 26 million) to Indonesia to
help pay for expensive imports of dairy products and other
commodities for the poor, Komura said.
	   Another 1.45 billion yen (dlrs 12.6 million) will pay for
imported fertilizer, pesticides and equipment, including tractors
and irrigation pumps, to help accelerate production of rice and
other crops.
	   Crop production dropped in 1997 and earlier this year because of
the worst drought in 50 years as well as the high costs of
importing fertilizers and other chemicals.
	   The Indonesian rupiah lost 80 percent of its value earlier this
year, and although it has partly recovered.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of Muslim clerics,
politicians and students gathered at Indonesia's largest mosque
Tuesday in a rare show of unity amid ongoing political turmoil and
economic crisis.
	   ``Muslims must unite morally for the sake of Indonesia,'' said
Haji Ali Yafie, who chairs the Indonesian Ulama Association, or
MUI.
	   Organizers say 15,000 Muslim representatives took part in the
opening ceremony for the peaceful four-day gathering at Jakarta's
huge white-domed Istiqlal Mosque.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   Ali told reporters that the meeting was called to foster
cooperation among competing Islamic groups, including dozens of
Muslim-based political parties formed recently to contest
parliamentary elections next May.
	   In an opening speech, chairman of the congress Haji Amidhan
called on Muslim leaders to be united.
	   ``We are a great country and Muslims are the biggest part of
community. But (Islamic) leaders have different approaches and
methods,'' Amidhan said.
	   The elections are to be first held since protests and riots
forced former President Suharto to quit last May, ending 32
authoritarian years in power.
	   Suharto's successor President B.J. Habibie has promised the
elections will be conducted democratically under new reforms to be
debated by Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly next week.
	   The assembly is Indonesia's highest legislative body and there
are fears that next week's meeting could trigger a wave of
protests.
	   Students and others claim most of its delegates are holdovers
from the Suharto era and have no intention of supporting real
democratic change.
	   Adding to the instability is the worst economic crisis to befall
Indonesia in 30 years.
	   High inflation, mass unemployment and growing poverty have
brought misery to millions and have resulted in sporadic rioting
and looting since May.
	   Habibie, Suharto's longtime friend and former loyal subordinate,
has also been the target of student protests.
	   Habibie is among several likely candidates for the presidency to
be decided by the assembly in December 1999.

	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ Despite their reputation for
frenzied feeding, crocodiles in northern Australia are very fussy
eaters, researchers said Tuesday.
	   The death rate of crocodiles born in captivity has been high
enough to hold back a developing industry of skins and meat now
worth Australian dollars 5 million (U.S. dlrs 3 million) a year.
	   Australia has been importing crocodile meat from Papua New
Guinea to meet the demands of a growing restaurant and gourmet food
market, the Queensland state government said.
	   Queensland Department of Primary Industries researchers have
found that beef is the reptiles' favorite food, followed by
chicken, fish, pork and ham.
	   The department's Townsville research center has developed a wet
pellet food formula to feed the young crocodiles.
	   The pellet are expected to help overcome cost problems
associated with transporting refrigerated meat to the 18 commercial
crocodile farms dotted across northern Australia.

Tremor shakes the central east coast; no damage reported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ An offshore earthquake of magnitude
4.7 jolted Australia's central east coast Tuesday, but there were
no reports of damage.
	   The tremor was recorded at 3:09 a.m. (1609 GMT) by the
Queensland University Advanced Center for Earthquake Studies and
the Australian Geological Survey Organization.
	   The organization said the epicenter was at sea about 93 miles
(150 kms) northwest of the town of Rockhampton, in Queensland
state.
	   Prof. Peter Mora, the university center's director, said shaking
ground was reported on Heron Island and in Yepoon, north of
Rockhampton. Houses creaked and windows rattled, he said.
	   He said there could have been serious damage if the earthquake
had hit a more heavily populated area.

IMF approves release of dlrs 280 million to Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund has
approved the release of dlrs 280 million to the Philippines from a
dlrs 1.3 billion precautionary loan arrangement, the Philippine
central bank said Tuesday.
	   Central Bank Managing Director Amando Tetangco said the approval
was given last Friday.
	   The central bank expects to be able to draw the dlrs 280 million
either Wednesday or Thursday.
	   It will be used to increase the central bank's foreign currency
reserves, which stood at dlrs 10.6 billion at the end of September,
Tetangco said.
	   He said the IMF funds should help boost the Philippine peso,
which broke through the 40 peso-per-dollar level Tuesday to set a
new four-month high.
	   Tetangco attributed the peso's appreciation to strong dollar
inflows from foreign direct investors, stock investors and
Filipinos working overseas.
	   The stock market has experienced sharp gains over the past eight
sessions, while remittances from Filipinos working overseas have
been strong since the start of last month.
	   Currency watchers believe the IMF money will improve sentiment
for both the peso and the stock market.
	   ``This will be very significant for the peso and consequently,
local stocks,'' said Ricky Lozari, economist at Abacus Securities
Corp.
	   The IMF precautionary arrangement was agreed upon in April, and
is to be used by the central bank as a war chest to repel extreme
speculative attacks on the peso.
	   An IMF mission is expected to arrive in Manila Wednesday as part
of its regular review of the Philippines' economic performance. The
mission is expected to complete its assessment Nov. 17.

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ With officials estimating that
former hurricane Mitch has left some 7,000 people dead, residents
armed themselves with machetes and pistols while authorities
suspended constitutional liberties to fight looting.
	   Officials estimated at least 5,000 Hondurans had died and
600,000 _ 10 percent of the nation's population _ had been forced
to flee their homes. The devastation led to chaos in the nation's
capital, with long lines of people trying to get water, food and
medicine.
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin in
all of the national territory,'' the president said in a nationally
broadcast speech following the five-day passage of Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the
waters,'' the president said in a nationally broadcast speech.
``The most conservative calculations of the dead are in the
thousands, not in the hundreds.''
	   ``I ask the international community for human solidarity,'' he
said.
	   The scene was grim as well in neighboring Nicaragua, where as
many as 1,500 may have died in mudslides when the crater lake of
the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud and debris
onto villages below.
	   ``It looked like a line of helicopters flying really low and
coming at us. You could see houses, trees, everything being
covered,'' said Ricardo Antonio Garcia, a 23-year-old farmer whose
leg was amputated after being crushed in the mudslide in northwest
Nicaragua.
	   Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said the slide
apparently killed 1,000 to 1,500 people and that some 600 other
people died elsewhere in the country.
	   By late Monday, 880 bodies had been pulled out of the mudslide
area, the local Red Cross said. Local civil defense officials said
they planned to go into the disaster area on Tuesday and begin
burning bodies to reduce the risk of disease.
	   Nicaraguan Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said in a
telephone interview Tuesday night that there had been another small
mudslide on the northern slope of the volcano, but there were no
apparent casualties. About 34 houses were destroyed, he said.
	   In Honduras, ``more than 5,000 people'' probably died, Dimas
Alonzo, operations chief for the National Emergency Committee, told
a local radio station. He said the exact number would never be
known.
	   Many parts of Honduras remained cut off almost a week after
Mitch barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290
kph) winds. The storm pounded across the isthmus, dropping up to 25
inches (63 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, before
dissipating Monday in southern Mexico.
	   Flores Facusse said ``the floods and landslides erased from the
map many villages and households as well as whole neighborhoods of
cities.''
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin
throughout the national territory,'' the president said.
	   He announced a two-week ``state of exception'' suspending
constitutional liberties that allows authorities to seize property,
detain suspects and conduct unlimited searches to help officials
fight looting and vandalism. People were ordered off the streets
between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.
	   Virtually all of Honduras suffered flooding, from the lowland
marshes on the Atlantic Coast to the mountains, hills and plateaus
of the interior.
	   Floodwaters receded in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on
Monday, but some residents carried machetes and guns because of
reports that looters with automatic rifles had attacked several
houses and businesses.
	   All four bridges across the Rio Choluteca, which splits the city
of 800,000 people, were damaged and remained out of service Monday.
	   Many victims have waited days without aid.
	   To the south in northwestern Nicaragua, Miguel Angel Ortiz told
of waiting three days with his family on a hilltop under pouring
rain after a wave of mud, trees and rocks came crashing down on the
village of El Ojochal.
	   Running to the top of a hill, they were among the few in the
village lucky enough to get out in time.
	   Help never came and they finally walked out Monday because of
hunger and thirst.
	   Ortiz, 33, and his family made their way to Chichigalpa, where
doctors attended to survivors in an elementary school.
	   ``There was no food, no water and a lot of disease, a lot of
death,'' Ortiz said. ``We needed to get out of there.''
	   The international Red Cross on Monday tripled its appeal for
assistance to those hit by Mitch, to dlrs 7.4 million.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the U.S. government was
providing dlrs 2 million in food, medicine, water and other
emergency relief supplies.
	   ``We'll be looking at what else we can do,'' Clinton said.
	   At least one rescue effort led to additional deaths: the mayor
of the Honduran capital and three others died Sunday in a
helicopter crash while surveying flood damage. Tegucigalpa Mayor
Cesar Castellanos, 49, had been seen as a likely presidential
candidate in 2001.
	   A plane crash in western Guatemala blamed on the remnants of
Mitch killed 11 people, 10 of them Americans, and injured another
seven U.S. citizens, doctors said Monday.
	   Bad weather and lack of radar may have caused the crash Sunday
of the C-47 cargo plane operated by the Living Water Teaching
Mission, airport officials in Guatemala said.
	   The plane went down in heavy rain near the town of San Andreas
Xecul, 60 miles (96 km) west of Guatemala City.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard said it has searched a Italy-sized section
of the Caribbean for 31 people missing since Tuesday aboard a
282-foot (80-meter) tour schooner, the Fantome, operated by
Windjammer Barefoot Tours of Miami.
	   Officials in neighboring El Salvador were assessing the impact
of floods caused by the storm. The National Emergency Committee
listed 148 dead, 106 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own
regional affiliate in San Miguel province reported 125 dead there
alone.
	   Guatemala reported storm-related 100 deaths. Mexico reported
one.

China to take over military businesses next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ China's defense sector will lose control of its
commercial enterprises next month, including cellular phone
networks and karaoke clubs, Hong Kong media reported Tuesday.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin recently ordered China's military
out of the businesses, and the State Economic and Trade Commission
will take them over on Dec. 15, according to the Chinese-language
daily Ming Pao.
	   Businesses run by the People's Liberation Army reach into many
facets of Chinese life, by some estimates funding one-third of
Chinese military expenditures.
	   The military will decide which businesses to keep and likely
will hang onto suppliers such as factories that make soldiers'
uniforms, according to the Ming Pao report, which quoted trade
commission official Zhao Ning.
	   But China's goal is to get all strictly commercial entities out
of the hands of the military, as well as its branches, including
the military police, security and judicial departments.
	   The trade commission will decide what to do with all of the
businesses. Options include handing them over to third parties or
merging them with related companies, although some will be closed,
Zhao told an economic conference in Hong Kong on Monday.
	   Since China also wants to separate government from business, the
trade commission has no plans to run any of the companies, Zhao was
quoted as saying.
	   Zhao dismissed concerns that the separation of the military and
business would create a loss of income for the state, saying most
would still operate, just under new management.

Jezabeel wins Melbourne Cup after a betting plunge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand mare Jezabeel justified
a massive betting plunge when it scored a stirring victory in the
Aust dlrs 2.8 million (U.S. dlrs 1.75 million) Melbourne Cup at
Flemington on Tuesday.
	   Jockey Chris Munce picked Jezabeel back up in the final few
meters (yards) after fellow-mare Champagne fizzed past him about
200 meters (yards) from the winning post.
	   The five-year-old Jezabeel was heavily backed for the
3,200-meter (two-mile) handicap event by almost 100,000 punters on
course and its price closed in from 14-1 on Monday to 6-1 at the
start.
	   It was sweet revenge for Munce following the Caulfield Cup
earlier in the campaign when Jezabeel and Champagne were battered
by eventual winner Taufan's Melody but his protest was
controversially dismissed.
	   Taufan's Melody was one of a record seven non-Australasian
horses, including overnight favorite Faithful Son, and Munce was
thrilled to keep them out.
	   ``When (Champagne) shot past me I thought he'd got me beat _ I
was just glad it was not one of the Europeans,'' said Munce.
	   British horse Persian Punch finished third behind Champagne,
closely followed by compatriots Taufan's Melody and Yorkshire in
fourth and fifth.
	   But Faithful Son, ridden by star jockey Frankie Dettori, faded
in the straight and was seventh in the 24-horse field in its first
run over the 3,200 meters (two miles).
	   Faithful Son is owned by the world's No.1 racehorse owner Sheikh
Mohammed bin Rasheed Al Maktoum of Dubai, who attended the race,
and trained at his Godolphin operation in England by Saeed bin
Suroor.
	   ``He ran a really great race,'' said Bin Suroor. ``He didn't
stay but we're happy with that. We'll come back for the race but
maybe with a different horse.''
	   Punters nationwide spent about Aust dlrs 150 million (93
million) on the race through betting agencies and bookmakers on
course. Millions more were spent in office sweeps.
	   The host state of Victoria has a public holiday for the race
which is always held on the first Tuesday in November. In other
states the nation almost comes to a standstill to watch the race on
television.
	   The Cup buildup was dominated by the seven non-Australasian
entrants, with five from Britain and two based in Singapore. The
decision to allow one of internationals, Yorkshire, into the race
ahead of two better qualified locals drew widespread criticism.
	   Bart Cummings, who has won a record 10 Melbourne Cups as
trainer, said a quota should be placed on the imports.
	   ``One could be invited from the UK, one from Europe, one from
Asia and one perhaps from the USA. That would be four and that
should be quite adequate,'' Cummings said.
	   Racing Victoria's international racing manager Les Benton said
the inclusion of overseas horses was the right decision.
	   ``I think (it) is fantastic for Australia,'' Benton said. ``It
ensures that our race is recognized internationally.''
	   Singapore-based Three Crowns, trained by Malcolm Thwaites,
suffered a broken leg as the field headed for home.

Philippine stocks rise on peso, Wall Street gains; index up 2.7
</HEADLINE>
percent

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose further
Tuesday, buoyed by a strong peso and overnight gains on Wall
Street, traders said. The main index rose 2.7 percent to its
highest level in nearly four months.
	   Traders said the peso's strong performance bolstered investor
sentiment in the stock market. The dollar broke its key support
level of 40 pesos, falling as low as 39.85 pesos in morning
trading, largely on strong dollar inflows.
	   At midday the dollar averaged 39.978 pesos, down from Friday's
average of 40.398 pesos.
	   Markets were closed Monday for a national holiday.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 114.05-point surge Monday
also provided investors with another reason to accumulate Manila
stocks, traders said.
	   ``We're playing catch-up with foreign markets. Wall Street has
been strong in the past two trading days. Asian markets were also
higher Monday when the Manila market was closed,'' said Fitzgerald
Aklan, assistant vice president for institutional sales of
Orion-Squire Securities Inc.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 46.60 points,
or 2.7 percent, to 1,801.64, its highest closing level in nearly
four months. The main index advanced by 86.08 points, or 5.2
percent, on Friday.
	   Tuesday's advance brought the index's total gain to 333.95
points, or 23 percent, since Oct. 21.
	   Metro Pacific shares surged 48 centavos, or 35 percent, to 1.84
pesos after newspaper reports said Hong Kong's First Pacific has
confirmed it has been acquiring Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co. shares and intends to continue to buy more.
	   First Pacific is the parent company of Metro Pacific.
	   The news further fueled market speculation that First Pacific
plans to take a substantial stake in PLDT.
	   PLDT shares finished up 45 pesos, or 4.7 percent, at 1,010
pesos.
	   In currency trading, dealers said the peso is gaining strength
because of expectations of continued strong dollar inflows, both
from foreign investors and remittances from overseas contract
workers.
	   Traders said the expected completion this month of a buyout by
Switzerland's Nestle SA of San Miguel Corp.'s 45 percent interest
in Nestle Philippines Inc., and First Pacific's expected buy-in of
PLDT are predicted to flood the market with dollars.
	   The Nestle deal is valued at half a billion dollars, and the
PLDT deal may bring in over dlrs 700 million.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ With officials estimating that
former hurricane Mitch has left some 7,000 people dead, residents
armed themselves with machetes and pistols while authorities
suspended constitutional liberties to fight looting.
	   Officials estimated at least 5,000 Hondurans had died and
600,000 _ 10 percent of the nation's population _ had been forced
to flee their homes. The devastation led to chaos in the nation's
capital, with long lines of people trying to get water, food and
medicine.
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin in
all of the national territory,'' the president said in a nationally
broadcast speech following the five-day passage of Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the
waters,'' the president said in a nationally broadcast speech.
``The most conservative calculations of the dead are in the
thousands, not in the hundreds.''
	   ``I ask the international community for human solidarity,'' he
said.
	   The scene was grim as well in neighboring Nicaragua, where as
many as 1,500 may have died in mudslides when the crater lake of
the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud and debris
onto villages below.
	   ``It looked like a line of helicopters flying really low and
coming at us. You could see houses, trees, everything being
covered,'' said Ricardo Antonio Garcia, a 23-year-old farmer whose
leg was amputated after being crushed in the mudslide in northwest
Nicaragua.
	   Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said the slide
apparently killed 1,000 to 1,500 people and that some 600 other
people died elsewhere in the country.
	   By late Monday, 880 bodies had been pulled out of the mudslide
area, the local Red Cross said. Local civil defense officials said
they planned to go into the disaster area on Tuesday and begin
burning bodies to reduce the risk of disease.
	   Nicaraguan Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said in a
telephone interview Monday night that there had been another small
mudslide on the northern slope of the volcano, but there were no
apparent casualties. About 34 houses were destroyed, he said.

a local radio station. He said the exact number would never be
known.
	   Many parts of Honduras remained cut off almost a week after
Mitch barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290
kph) winds. The storm pounded across the isthmus, dropping up to 25
inches (63 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, before
dissipating Monday in southern Mexico.

American base employee suspect in hit-and-run
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An American who works on a major U.S. naval base is
a suspect in a hit-and-run in southwestern Japan that left a woman
slightly injured, police said Tuesday.
	   Police spokesman Shiro Tsuruta said the car driven by the
American struck 71-year-old Keiko Taniguchi's motorcycle Sunday
night in Sasebo, 982 kilometers (609 miles) southwest of Tokyo,
police said.
	   The American, a civilian worker on Sasebo naval base, was not
arrested because the woman's injuries were minor, but he may face
hit-and-run charges, police said.
	   The accident in Sasebo comes just two days after a hit-and-run
on the southernmost island of Okinawa, in which a U.S. Marine is a
suspect.
	   The man, whose moped was knocked down by the van that the Marine
was allegedly driving, suffered a bruised hand but no serious
injuries.
	   Last month, another Marine was charged with drunken driving and
hit-and-run in a separate accident on Okinawa that killed an
18-year-old high school student.
	   About 47,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan under a security
pact between the two nations.
	   Many Okinawans harbor hard feelings toward the heavy U.S.
military presence on the island, 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)
southwest of Tokyo, where most of the troops are assigned.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ International observers reiterated
their demands Tuesday to be given seats in the corruption and
sexual misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim.
	   U.N. Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy, himself on trial in Malaysia
for defamation, said Malaysia was hurting its international image
by barring dozens of human rights, judicial and diplomatic
observers from the trial.
	   ``By not allowing the international community to come in and
observe the trial, the prime minister is undermining the name of
the country,'' Param said outside the red-brick High Court on
Tuesday.
	   Anwar, sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 as
his deputy and finance minister, is on trial for corruption and
illegal sexual acts. He has pleaded innocent and says the charges
are politically motivated.
	   Judge Augustine Paul ruled before the trial began Monday that
international observers would not be given special observer status
and could watch the trial on a first-come, first-serve basis.
	   Most of them could not get into the small courtroom.
	   Paul called the appeal by Anwar's lawyers on behalf of the
observers an ``insult to the court.''
	   ``There is no reason to let foreigners check us,'' he said.
	   Representatives of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch
did get seats in the public gallery. Special status would have
meant reserved seats and allowing them to formally report on the
trial.
	   Anwar's trial has generated international concern after he
appeared with a black eye and bruises during his arraignment. Anwar
said he was beaten by police the night of his arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Adnan Buyong Nasution, an Indonesian attorney with the
Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, said his group
intended to appeal to the country's chief justice.
	   ``I'm concerned with the openness of the trial,'' Adnan said.
``If it really is an open trial, then everyone should be allowed
in.''
	   The United States has also complained. A U.S. diplomat and other
representatives of foreign embassies were turned away Monday.

	   CHICHIGALPA, Nicaragua (AP) _ First there was a roar, then a
monstrous wave of mud on the horizon. In an instant, it swallowed
entire towns in its path.
	   ``The wave was coming up in the air; it looked like a line of
helicopters'' flying in low over the village of El Ojochal,
survivor Miguel Angel Ortiz said as he sat in a child's chair at a
shelter in an elementary school in Chichigalpa, about 6 miles (10
kms) away.
	   Ortiz, 33, described how he and his family ran up a hill and
watched destruction pass by below: a rushing mass of mud, rocks and
trees turning their home town into a desert Friday morning, killing
as many as 1,500 people.
	   For three days, they were trapped on that hilltop under driving
rain without food or drinking water. The mud that covered El
Ojochal and seven other villages in a miles-wide
(kilometerers-wide) swath was too mushy to walk over safely.
	   The crater lake high above them on the Casitas volcano had
overflowed after days of pounding rains _ sometimes as much as 4
inches (10 centimeters) per hour fell _ and the two rivers that
drain the lake had joined to form one massive deluge.
	   Other El Ojochal survivors, 45 in all, straggled to the hilltop,
now an island in a sea of mud. The healthier, injured men among
them made brief, desperate forays onto the quaking mud to look for
survivors and rescue the injured.
	   They found nine. ``The injured people stank because their wounds
were so infected, and the dead stank even worse,'' Ortiz recalled.
	   They walked out Monday, because the ground had firmed up some
and ``because we would have died there if we had not,'' Ortiz said.
	   Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said the slide
apparently killed 1,000 to 1,500 people in several communities near
the city of Posoltega, at the foot of the Casitas volcano. The
country's preliminary death toll stood at 1,330, with 1,903
missing.
	   ``We perhaps will never know how many people died,'' he said.
	   By late Monday, 808 bodies had been pulled out of the mudslide
area, the local Red Cross said.
	   Nicaraguan Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said in a
telephone interview Monday night that there had been another small
mudslide on the northern slope of the volcano, but there were no
apparent casualties. About 34 houses were destroyed, he said.
	   Central American officials on Monday estimated more than 7,000
people died in floods and mudslides triggered by Mitch, one of the
strongest hurricanes ever to hit the Caribbean.
	   The first relief helicopters reached the region Sunday. They
found decomposing bodies everywhere, some with just limbs sticking
out of the mud.
	   At first soldiers struggled to bury bodies where they lay. But
with the fear of epidemics growing, volunteer brigades began
setting out from Chichigalpa on Monday to burn bodies.
	   ``We need the government to send us gasoline if they want to
avoid an epidemic,'' said Robert Lopez Marcia, a member of
Chichigalpa's emergency commission. One crew set out for its grisly
task Monday with only a 5-gallon (18-liter) jug of alcohol as fuel.
	   At an improvised shelter in a Chichigalpa elementary school
doctors stitched wounds and performed other minor surgery on people
evacuated from the mountains. The doctors were in desperate need of
medicine, antibiotics and bandages, and there was little clean
water or food.
	   Throughout the schoolhouse, children lay on desks with bloody
bandages on their heads.
	   Chichigalpa Mayor Elijio Palacio said ``the only thing the
federal government does is ask us for numbers every half hour _ how
many dead, how many injured _ but they don't send us anything.''
	   All along the Pan American highway, thousands of people walked
Monday in the pouring rain, some coming out of the disaster area,
some going in to look for family members.
	   But few got very far; dozens of bridges were washed out by mud
and bystanders pitched in to help cars and ox carts that got stuck
in the mud.
	   Eric Rio, 26, and his wife, Ruth Reyes, 25, hiked into the area
known as Barrio Chamorro to check on family and friends who lived
there.
	   They walked several hours through deep mud. The streets were
littered with bodies. ``We saw about 10 bodies, all very
decomposed,'' said Rio.

Hong Kong bankers visit Beijing amid concerns over investment

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chief executive of Hong Kong's de facto
central bank and a delegation of top commercial bankers visited
Beijing on Tuesday, reportedly to seek assurances from China's
central bank that financial problems in mainland investment
institutions won't get out of hand.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the People's Bank of China
confirmed talks were taking place but refused to comment further.
	   The Hong Kong Standard reported Tuesday that the chief executive
of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam, and the commercial
bankers wanted to get a better explanation of problems in China's
international trust and investment corporations, known as
``Itics.''
	   Hong Kong bankers have been worried since last month, when the
Chinese central bank ordered the closure of Guangdong International
Trust and Investment Corp. when it went into default on debt
repayments.
	   The Itics, which are investment arms for Chinese provincial
governments, got into trouble by making loans on numerous projects
that the politicians backed but the marketplace did not need _ such
as too many power plants and flashy apartment complexes that are
largely unoccupied.
	   China's central bank announced Monday that the Itics
collectively owed at least U.S. dlrs 10 billion through June, and
possibly more because some foreign debts have not been registered
properly.
	   Many Itics channeled deals through Hong Kong to circumvent
mainland disclosure rules.

Remains of U.S. soldiers killed in Korean War to be returned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Remains believed to be those of
several American soldiers killed during the Korean War will be
returned by North Korea Friday.
	   The U.N. Military Command said Tuesday the remains will be
turned over at the border village of Panmunjom inside the
demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea.
	   The skeletal remains were unearthed by a joint U.S.-North Korea
recovery team.
	   Twenty sets of remains have been unearthed and returned by North
Korea since the North began allowing U.S. forensic experts to
search in its territory in 1996.
	   The recovery of American war dead is a key U.S. demand for
improving relations with North Korea.
	   More than 50,000 American soldiers were killed in the 1950-53
Korean War, and about 8,100 are still unaccounted for.
	   The U.N. Command consists of troops from the United States and
15 other allies which fought on South Korea's side in the war.

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ With flood waters receding and
communications improving, Central Americans are discovering the
massive devastation inflicted by Hurricane Mitch: officials
estimated about 7,000 had died in the region.
	   The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, where an
estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 _ 10 percent of the
population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's
storm. Countless more were lacking fresh water, food and medicine.
	   President Carlos Flores Facusse said Monday ``the floods and
landslides erased from the map many villages and households as well
as whole neighborhoods of cities.'' He appealed for international
help.
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin in
all of the national territory,'' he said in a nationally broadcast
speech.
	   ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the
waters,'' the president said in a nationally broadcast speech.
``The most conservative calculations of the dead are in the
thousands, not in the hundreds.''
	   Responding to widespread looting and vandalism, Flores Facusse
announced a two-week ``state of exception'' suspending
constitutional liberties that allows authorities the right to seize
property, detain suspects and unlimited searches. People were
ordered off the streets between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.
	   Many parts of Honduras remained cut off almost a week after
Mitch barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290
kph) winds. The storm pounded across the isthmus, dropping up to 25
inches (63 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, before
dissipating Monday in southern Mexico.
	   Virtually all of Honduras suffered flooding, from the lowland
marshes on the Atlantic Coast to the mountains, hills and plateaus
of the interior.
	   In neighboring Nicaragua, the death toll was also high. Official
preliminary figures showed 1,330 dead and 1,903 missing nationwide.
	   As many as 1,500 people may have died in mudslides when the
crater lake of the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud
and debris onto villages below.
	   ``It looked like a line of helicopters flying really low and
coming at us. You could see houses, trees, everything being
covered,'' said Ricardo Antonio Garcia, a 23-year-old farmer whose
leg was amputated after being crushed in the mudslide in northwest
Nicaragua.
	   By late Monday, soldiers had found 808 bodies out of the
mudslide stricken area. Local civil defense officials said they
planned to go into the disaster area on Tuesday and burn bodies to
cut down on the risk of disease.
	   Nicaraguan Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said in a
telephone interview Monday night that there had been another small
mudslide on the northern slope of the volcano, but there were no
apparent casualties. About 34 houses were destroyed, he said.
	   Miguel Angel Ortiz told of waiting three days with his family on
a hilltop under pouring rain after a wave of mud, trees and rocks
crashed down on the village of El Ojochal.
	   Running to the top of a hill, they were among few in the village
lucky enough to get out in time.
	   Help never came and they finally walked out Monday because of
hunger and thirst.
	   Ortiz, 33, and his family made their way to Chichigalpa, where
doctors attended to survivors in an elementary school.
	   ``There was no food, no water and a lot of disease, a lot of
death,'' Ortiz said. ``We needed to get out of there.''
	   Among the hurricane casualties in other Central American
countries, El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174
dead, 96 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own regional
affiliate in San Miguel province reported 125 dead there alone.
	   Guatemala reported storm-related 100 deaths. Mexico reported
one.
	   A plane crash in western Guatemala blamed on the remnants of
Mitch killed 11 people, 10 of them Americans, and injured another
seven U.S. citizens Sunday, doctors said.
	   Bad weather and lack of radar may have caused the crash Sunday
of the C-47 cargo plane operated by the Living Water Teaching
Mission, airport officials in Guatemala said.
	   The plane went down in heavy rain near San Andreas Xecul, 60
miles (96 km) west of Guatemala City.
	   The International Red Cross on Monday tripled its appeal for
assistance to dlrs 7.4 million.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the U.S. government was
providing dlrs 2 million in food, medicine, water and other relief
supplies.

China looking for Asian Games gold in taekwondo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China hopes to win its first Asian Games gold in
the kick-fighting martial art of taekwondo in the games next month
in Thailand, the official China Sports Daily newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   The team of six women and three men will be China's first to
compete in taekwondo at the Asian Games, the report said.
	   China only began developing taekwondo in 1995, a year after the
last Asian Games, the newspaper said.
	   China picked up one silver and one bronze medal at the 1997
world championships and won a gold, silver and five bronze medals
at the Asian championships this year, the report said.
	   With South Korea, Taiwan and Iran _ the strongest taekwondo
nations _ all competing in the upcoming games, ``the Chinese team's
goal is to go all out to win one gold medal,'' it said.
	   Head coach Chen Liren was quoted as saying that a recent
decision by the sports' international federation to adjust weight
categories for competitions would affect China's women. The team
would not be dominant at any weight, he said.
	   ``Strong competitors at the Asian Games will be as numerous as
trees in a forest,'' Chen was quoted as saying.

Police arrest 23 protesters in Indonesia's Aceh province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Police in a northwestern province
arrested 23 people suspected of taking part in a riot in which
Indonesian flags at government and military offices were torn down,
a military official said Tuesday.
	   Alleged separatist rebel supporters fired shots at government
buildings during the demonstration Monday in the town of
Lhokseumawe in Aceh, said military spokesman Lt. Halkis. No one was
injured.
	   The military has been accused of widespread abuses in Aceh while
trying to suppress a small band of guerrillas since the late 1980s.
	   Armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto has apologized for any
wrongdoing and has withdrawn some soldiers from the region.
	   Lhokseumawe, an industrial town 2,100 kilometers (1300 miles)
northwest of Jakarta, was hit by riots in August set off by rising
resentment toward the military.
	   In the protest Monday, hundreds of demonstrators tore up dozens
of red and white Indonesian flags at government offices as well as
a police station and a military post, Halkis said.
	   ``It seems the inciters are likely from the rebel side since
they had weapons,'' he said.
	   The Indonesian military has said it wants to hand over security
to community leaders in Aceh, but will reinforce its presence if
order cannot be maintained.
	   The military is stepping up security in Jakarta ahead of a
government assembly next week that is expected to issue guidelines
for general elections scheduled for 1999.
	   Student leaders who say democratic reforms aren't moving fast
enough are planning to protest at the assembly, which will be held
in the Parliament building. Students occupied the building during
protests in May that helped oust former President Suharto

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Wrangling over legal
technicalities dominated day two of the sensational corruption and
sexual misconduct trial of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim on Tuesday.
	   As lawyers met with Anwar in the morning, before the trial
resumed in the afternoon, there was still confusion over whether
High Court Judge Augustine Paul had ruled against a defense motion
to dismiss the charges.
	   Anwar arrived in court in a blue police truck, flanked by escort
vehicles, for the second day to face charges of abuse of power and
illicit sex.
	   Riot police with shields and tear-gas launchers stood guard
across the street from the red-brick High Court at Independence
Square, where Anwar led a huge anti-government protest just hours
before his arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He vehemently denies the charges and says they were
cooked up to undermine his challenge to the 17-year leadership of
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir said he sacked his handpicked successor because he was
morally unfit to lead the Southeast Asian nation.
	   During the opening day Monday, Anwar's attorneys argued that the
first four graft charges were invalid because the lower house of
Parliament had repealed the special anti-corruption law under which
he was charged.
	   Paul appeared to have dismissed the request, saying that the law
was still under review by the upper house of Parliament so it was
still on the books.
	   Defense attorney Nordin Zulkifli was quoted by the national news
agency Bernama, however, as saying the lawyers would seek
clarification on Paul's ruling. If the judge had dismissed the
defense request, they would file an appeal.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of observers clamored to get into the court.
	   ``By not allowing the international community to come in and
observe the trial, the prime minister is undermining the name of
the country,'' U.N. Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy, Param told The
Associated Press outside the court.
	   Hundreds of foreign reporters and human rights and judiciary
activists have flocked to the Malaysian capital to observe the
trial, which has come to represent the demand for political reforms
and greater freedom of speech and assembly.
	   Anwar's case generated international concern after he appeared
with a black eye and bruises during his arraignment. He accused
police of beating him on the night of his arrest.
	   But many of the observers have not been allowed into the small
courtroom, which holds only some 80 people.

Singapore industries urge government: cut business costs 30
</HEADLINE>
percent &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A group representing Singapore industries urged
the government Tuesday to slash business costs by about 30 percent
to help them cope with the economic downturn, a reduction
considerably higher than the government's expected target.
	   Singapore Confederation of Industries president Robin Lau said
the government should reduce employers' mandatory contributions to
the state-run pension system from 20 percent of a worker's salary
to 5 percent, and should cut a host of levies and fees.
	   Lau argued that ``what is critically needed are some short-term
measures to help local companies tide over until the recovery comes
along,'' Dow Jones Newswires reported.
	   The government is expected to announce wide-ranging measures to
lighten the burden on companies later this month, targeting mainly
wages and the pension fund. It has said it would aim for a 15
percent overall reduction in business costs.
	   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong recently recommended that company
contributions to the mandatory pension fund be slashed in half, to
10 percent of an employee's salary.
	   A cut in the 26 percent corporate tax rate, as well as
reductions in state-controlled fees and charges, are also among
measures that may be adopted.
	   A recent survey of confederation members confirmed that the high
cost of wages and lack of new orders are their greatest concerns,
said Lau, though other business costs needed trimming.
	   ``Although high wage costs is the top concern, our respondents
have indicated that non-wage costs must also be cut if companies
are to survive the economic downturn,'' he said.
	   Land rentals, port fees, road-use charges, utilities and
telecommunications charges should all be reduced, he said.
	   A government panel examining ways of improving Singapore's
competitiveness is scheduled to issue recommendations Nov. 11, and
Parliament is expected to debate the cost-cutting package at the
end of the month.

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Kidnappers freed a
Chinese-Filipino businessman in central Cebu province and another
trader in the southern Philippines after ransoms were paid,
officials said Tuesday.
	   Regan King, manager of a heavy equipment company owned by his
father, was released Monday night after his family paid 2 million
pesos (dlrs 50,000) to his abductors, said Panfilo Lacson, chief of
the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force.
	   Lacson said authorities were attempting to arrest the
kidnappers. King was seized at gunpoint by four men and forced into
a car in Cebu city on Oct. 21.
	   In Zamboanga del Sur, suspected Muslim separatist rebels
released Michael Diaz, whose family owns several fisheries, after
his family paid at least 200,000 pesos (dlrs 5,000), police said.
	   The money covered the expenses incurred by the rebels in keeping
Diaz for nearly two months after abducting him in Naga town in
August, the officials said.
	   Army Col. Reynaldo Alcasid, a provincial military official, said
the abductors initially demanded 5 million pesos (dlrs 125,000).
	   At least nine people, including an Italian priest, remain in the
hands of kidnap gangs in the southern region of Mindanao, where
many Muslim separatist guerrillas and bandits have been implicated
in abductions.
	   Lacson suggested that the kidnapped Italian missionary, the Rev.
Luciano Benedetti, may be freed soon. Benedetti, 54, from Treviso,
was kidnapped Sept. 8 by suspected Muslim rebels in Sibuco in
Zamboanga del Norte province and his kidnappers are demanding a
ransom of 7 million pesos (dlrs 179,000).
	   President Joseph Estrada has launched a high-profile campaign
against kidnappings and scored a major victory last month with the
rescue of several victims and the arrest of their alleged abductors
in Manila.
	   Estrada promised upon taking office in June to end the
kidnappings within six months.
	   Lacson said that target remains attainable. ``Of course we could
not have a zero crime rate but we could minimize it to the fullest
extent,'' he said.

Lightning strikes boat killing family of 10
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A family of 10 died instantly when
lightning struck the boat in which they were travelling on a lake
in northeastern Uganda, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The independent Monitor said Samuel Okoche, his two wives and
their seven children were returning home from the village of
Kapiri, 230 kilometers (145 miles) northeast of Kampala, when a
bolt of lightning struck the boat.
	   ``The bodies were buried by relatives and friends after
performing a ritual to appease the gods so that no such incident
takes place in the area again,'' the newspaper quoted a local clan
leader as saying.
	   Deputy police spokesman Eric Naigambi said he had no information
on the incident that reportedly occurred in remote Kumi district
but said he would check.
	   In many African countries, newspapers often find out about
disasters before police do because of their extensive networks of
stringers who phone in reports.
	   Newspapers have been reporting an increase in the number of
people being struck by lightning during the East African rainy
season.

Police test hemp beauty products from Body Shop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Body Shop is selling a line of beauty
products that contain hemp _ a drug-free cousin of the marijuana
plant _ but police have taken a few samples to the lab just to make
sure the chain isn't marketing any illegal substances.
	   As a government chemist assists in an investigation launched by
the police narcotics bureau, The Body Shop continues to sell its
products, while getting a wealth of free publicity in local
newspapers.
	   ``You'd have to smoke a hemp joint the size of a telephone pole
to get the least buzz and you'd die from carbon monoxide first,''
Body Shop founder Anita Roddick was quoted as telling the Hong Kong
Standard.
	   The retailer last made headlines in the territory when
advertisements featuring a naked female doll were banned from
subway stops.
	   Like soybeans, hemp yields an oil from its seeds that can be
turned into cooking oil, cosmetics and plastics. Seeds can also be
ground for flour and livestock seed.
	   Cultivation and sale of industrial hemp is legal in several
countries, including Poland, Romania and China.

Hamas: More than 300 supporters have been arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ More than 300 suspected Islamic
militants have been arrested by Palestinian police since last
week's suicide attack on an Israeli convoy, a leader of the Islamic
militant group said Tuesday.
	   Over the weekend, Palestinian security forces said they had
rounded up more than 100 followers of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad
groups, but have refused to update the figure.
	   Ismail Hanieh, a Hamas leader, said that more than 300 activists
have been arrested since last Thursday's bombing in which an
Israeli soldier and the assailant, a 19-year-old Hamas activist
from the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Jebaliya, were killed.
	   Hanieh was among those rounded up, but was released after
several days. On Tuesday, the spokesman of Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar,
was also freed, Palestinian security officials said.

One Russian peacekeeper killed, four wounded in Abkhazia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A Russian peacekeeper was killed and
four others wounded when their armored personnel carrier hit a
landmine in Georgia's breakaway region of Abkhazia, officials said
Tuesday.
	   The attack occurred Monday night near the village of Kvishona in
Abkhazia's Ghali district, located near the border with Georgia,
said Yuri Belousov, a spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping force.
	   Belousov said the people who laid the mine had not been
identified, but an investigation was under way.
	   As they have done after similar attacks in the past, Abkhazian
separatists in the region blamed the pro-government Georgian
militia for the attack _ a charge they denied.
	   Georgia lost the lush Black Sea province of Abkhazia to
secessionist forces in 1993 after more than a year of fierce
fighting. About 250,000 Georgians were forced to flee their homes.
	   Russian peacekeepers have kept the two sides apart since June
1994, enforcing the Ghali security zone between Abkhazia and the
rest of Georgia. But the peacekeepers have been unable to stem
frequent outbursts of violence that continue to plague the region,
and often fall victim to attacks.

Russian stowaway makes way back to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian stowaway making his way back from the
United States was found Tuesday aboard a Russian trawler arriving
in Russia's Far East, a news report said.
	   The man was found on the trawler as it underwent a routine
inspection by border guards in the port of Anadyr, located about
6,700 kilometers (4,200 miles) northeast of Moscow on the Chukotka
peninsula.
	   The peninsula extends into the Bering Sea, ending less than 100
kilometers (60 miles) from Alaska.
	   The man said he was a fisherman from Kamchatka who had been
stuck in the United States when his ship left Seattle with his
passport, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Police have begun an investigation, and are unsure why the man
did not appeal to the Russian consulate in Seattle for help,
ITAR-Tass said.

Army, police to scrap some of their businesses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The army and police have banned their
units from engaging in services or trading, but that doesn't mean
they are getting out of business entirely, Tuesday's Youth
newspaper quoted senior government officials as saying.
	   The move is designed to eliminate the possibility of either
group abusing its power to engage in smuggling or graft.
	   The Defense Ministry has told the army it cannot run service or
trading companies, but is allowing it to engage in reforestation or
offshore fishing in remote areas or islands.
	   Defense Minister Pham Van Tra was quoted as saying economic
activities are and will continue to be a major task of the army,
along with ensuring the country's security, a combination that
helps the army trim expenses for national defense.
	   The ministry now has nearly 300 enterprises ranging from hotels
to consumer goods manufacturing.
	   Meanwhile, Police Minister Le Minh Huong said his force should
engage only in enterprises that produce equipment for the police
forces.
	   ``If police are involved in services, trading or commercial
activities, graft would certainly occur,'' Huong said.
	   Huong said his ministry is reviewing its business. Some
enterprises will be dissolved, while others may be allowed to go
bankrupt or be sold off.

Official newspaper urges Iraqis to prepare to fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-UN-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stepped up its rhetoric against the
United States on Tuesday, with a state-run newspaper urging the
country to prepare to battle ``the U.S. monster'' regardless of the
sacrifices.
	   Meanwhile, three monitoring teams from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency went into the field to check
three previously declared weapons sites, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline
Cross said.
	   She said a technical team from the U.N. Special Commission _
which looks into biological and chemical weapons as well as
long-range missiles _ went out to deal with a problem involving a
camera or a sensor. She gave no other details.
	   Iraq over the weekend said it was halting the work of UNSCOM
monitors, in essence breaking ties with the group charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   But it has continued to allow nuclear monitors to work, and has
let technical teams ensure that U.N. equipment continues to
function.
	   The U.N. Security Council has declared the action against UNSCOM
a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions, and U.S. President
Clinton warned Monday that the military action was a possibility,
saying ``no options are off the table.''
	   The call for preparations for a battle came in a front-page
editorial in Al-Iraq daily.
	   ``There will be no compromise in our decision to halt
cooperation with Special Commission and its spies,'' the paper
said. ``This decision compels us to fight in a battle to redeem our
rights.''
	   The paper said Iraq was certain that the coming battle over the
inspections will end in ``victory'' for Baghdad and ``humiliation''
for the United States.
	   It urged Arab nations and other countries friendly to Iraq to
rally behind Baghdad ``to defeat the U.S. monster'' because winning
the forthcoming battle with Washington will not only be fruitful
for Iraq ``but for the whole world, which America is pushing to the
abyss.''
	   Al-Iraq concluded: ``There will be no backing down this time no
matter the sacrifices.''
	   The government has said it will not allow U.N. inspections to
resume until the Security Council agrees to deal with trade
sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   It also says the UNSCOM director, Richard Butler, should be
replaced and that its teams be more balanced, a reference to Iraq's
long-standing complaint that there are too many American and
British monitors.
	   The sanctions _ which limit the sale of oil, Iraq's financial
mainstay _ have devastated the economy.
	   The Security Council has said the sanctions will not be lifted
until the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of
non-conventional weapons.
	   Iraq's media are daily heaping scorn on the United States, which
it accuses of pressuring the United Nations to prolong the
sanctions.
	   The English-language Baghdad Observer insisted the country was
``acting in self-defense.''
	   In an editorial headlined ``Iraq victim of U.S. aggression,''
the Observer said: ``The only way out of this vicious circle is to
set a definite timetable for the total lifting of the unjust
embargo.''

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The former chief of the country's
top police unit was the first witness called in the sensational
corruption and sexual misconduct trial of ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday.
	   Mohd. Said Awang, former chief of the Special Branch, was the
first of 52 prosecution witnesses to take the stand in the
government case against the jailed dissident.
	   Defense lawyers opened their case Monday by asking the judge to
hold Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in contempt of court for
saying publicly that Anwar should be convicted.
	   Mahathir was also on the witness list, but it was unclear
whether he would actually be called.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were cooked up to
undermine his growing challenge to the 17-year leadership of
Mahathir.
	   Mahathir said he sacked his handpicked successor because he was
morally unfit to lead the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Since his sacking Sept. 2, Anwar led an unprecedented
anti-government movement in which tens of thousands of supporters
gathered at his rallies.
	   Even after his arrest Sept. 20, the demonstrations continued. A
full-scale riot broke out on Oct. 24 when police launched tear gas
into a mosque and protesters retaliated by throwing rocks and
bricks at police.
	   Anwar arrived in court in a blue police truck, flanked by escort
vehicles, for the second day.
	   Riot police with shields and tear-gas launchers stood guard
across the street from the red-brick High Court at Independence
Square, where Anwar led a huge anti-government protest just hours
before his arrest.
	   His supporters said Tuesday they wanted to maintain calm during
the trial to ensure Anwar gets a fair hearing.
	   ``It's unlikely that people will do anything while the trial is
on,'' said Syed Husin Ali, the leader of the opposition group
People's Party of Malaysia.
	   During the opening day Monday, Anwar's attorneys argued the
first four graft charges were invalid because the lower house of
Parliament had repealed the special anti-corruption law under which
he was charged.
	   Paul dismissed the request, saying that the law was still under
review by the upper house of Parliament so it was still on the
books.
	   On Tuesday, defense attorneys appealed Paul's ruling. The judge
told them they would have to take it to the appeals court and
ordered the first witness called.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of observers clamored for a second day to get
into the courtroom.
	   ``By not allowing the international community to come in and
observe the trial, the prime minister is undermining the name of
the country,'' U.N. Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy told The
Associated Press foreign reporters and human rights and judiciary
activists have flocked to the Malaysian capital to observe the
trial.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A militant student leader was arrested
at the border by South Korean intelligence agents Tuesday after
returning home from an illegal visit to North Korea.
	   Hwang Son, 23, a senior at Seoul's Duksong Women's University,
faced charges of violating South Korea's national security law,
which outlaws visits to the communist country without government
approval.
	   The Agency for National Security Planning allowed no South
Korean news media to cover Hwang's return home through the neutral
village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone that separates
the two Koreas.
	   North Korean officials ``exchanged warm farewells with Hwang and
hugged her'' before she crossed the heavily guarded border, said
the North's official Korean Central News Agency.
	   Hwang visited North Korea in August along with a male student
leader to promote national unification. It was not known whether or
when the male student would return home.
	   About a dozen South Korean students, representing the nation's
most militant student group, Hanchongryon, have flouted government
warnings of punishment and visited North Korea in past years.
	   All the students were given a hero's welcome in North Korea.
Tens of thousands of people turned out in Pyongyang, the North
Korean capital, to see Hwang off Tuesday, KCNA said.
	   But the South has accused the students of playing into
anti-Seoul propaganda of the North. All were arrested when they
returned and served brief prison terms.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945, and they fought a bloody war in 1950-53.
Their border is sealed and there are no direct means of
communication between them.
	   South Koreans and North Koreans are banned from traveling to the
other side without government approval, which is rarely given.

NYC Marathon champion concerned about future schedule

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Kagwe, two-time winner of the New York City
Marathon, has a dilemma: Which races should he run?
	   Should he try and run the 1999 World Championships or the 2000
Olympics, or both?
	   ``I'm a little sore, a little happy, a little concerned and a
little homesick,'' Kagwe said Monday, a day after beating fellow
Kenyan Joseph Chebet by three seconds in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 45
seconds, the second-closest finish in the race's 29-year history.
	   ``I'm concerned about the future of my running _ which race to
choose, whether to run the Olympic Games and the World
Championships.''
	   Selection for the Kenyan team is extremely difficult because the
country has so many good marathoners.
	   In addition to Kagwe, there are Ondoro Osoro, winner of the
Chicago Marathon in 2:06:54, the third-fastest time in history and
the best-ever for a first-time marathoner; Moses Tanui, two-time
winner of the Boston Marathon; Chebet, runner-up to Tanui this year
at Boston and second to Kagwe the past two years in New York;
Josephat Kiprono, second in the Berlin Marathon in 2:07:26 to world
record-setter Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil, and Elijah Lagat and
Samson Kandie, the 1-2 finishers in the Praha Marathon.
	   In the past, a country has been permitted a maximum of three
marathoners at the Olympics and World Championships. Next year,
though, the worlds will allow five per country.
	   How the unpredictable Kenyan federation will select its runners
still is uncertain. Often, the Boston Marathon is the selection
race, but not always.
	   That's why Kagwe, who finished fifth at Boston this year, is
planning to run at Boston again in 1999. That doesn't necessarily
mean that if Kagwe qualifies for the team, he will go to Seville,
Spain, for the World Championships because the race is too close to
New York, where he wants to go for a third consecutive victory.
	   ``He's not that interested in the World Championships,'' his
agent, Lisa Buster, said Monday.
	   ``He wants to run the Olympics. That's his ultimate goal.''
	   Kagwe was disappointed in 1995 when he won the Pittsburgh
Marathon in a course-record 2:10:24, but was bypassed for the World
Championship team.
	   ``He wasn't very happy,'' Buster said. ``It was very political.
Two other runners with times of 2:17 were selected ahead of him.''
	   Kagwe is scheduled to go home to Kenya tonight and remain there
until February, when he will return to his U.S. training base in
Norristown, Pa., and prepare for Boston.
	   ``It usually takes him two months to get ready,'' Buster said.
	   Kagwe was a marked man in Sunday's New York City Marathon.
Wherever he went, the rest of the contenders tried to follow.
	   ``He had to change his strategy during the race,'' Buster said,
``because nobody wanted to go. The other runners were looking at
him.
	   ``One of our other runners, Julius Kariuki, tried to take people
with him by going to the front, but the other runners didn't go
after him. The others had a lot of respect for Kagwe and were
waiting for him.''
	   Kagwe didn't shake loose until the final 400 meters, when he
swept past Chebet and outsprinted him to the finish line.
	   ``I knew I was strong,'' Kagwe said. ``When he passed, I didn't
get distressed. I knew I could keep up with his speed.''
	   Italy's Franca Fiacconi was the women's winner in 2:25:17.
	   Overall, there were 32,456 starters and 31,456 finishers.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A shark pulled up in a net bit the right knee of a
Japanese fisherman, seriously injuring him, Japan's coast guard
said Tuesday.
	   Tadashi Kodama, 52, was transported by military plane to a
hospital in Iwakuni, southwestern Japan, because of his profuse
bleeding, said coast guard spokesman Mamoru Watanabe. Iwakuni is
710 kilometers (440 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   The two-meter (six-foot) shark suddenly attacked Kodama Monday
night after it was pulled aboard his tuna boat, the 14-ton
Yoshiro-maru, about 740 kilometers (460 miles) off the coast in the
Pacific Ocean,
	   Kodama's recovery was expected to take at least two months.
Japanese fishing boats sometimes net sharks, but serious injuries
are rare.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
that he will not convene his Cabinet to approve the Mideast peace
deal until the Palestinians have presented a complete blueprint for
fighting Islamic militant groups.
	   The Cabinet meeting was scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. (1100 gmt)
Tuesday to debate the land-for-security agreement, with a vote
expected on Wednesday.
	   If the meeting is postponed, the 12-week timetable of the
agreement would likely be disrupted. The clock was to have started
ticking on Monday, but implementation was delayed at the request of
Netanyahu who told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat he could not
proceed without approval by his Cabinet and the Israeli Knesset.

Lull in anti-government protests likely during trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Anwar's Trial &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The uneasy calm in Malaysia's
capital since an anti-government demonstration turned ugly 10 days
ago will soon end, opposition leaders said Tuesday.
	   Still, they said, few protests were likely during the abuse of
power and sexual misconduct trial of ousted deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Protest organizers were meeting this week to discuss ways to
sustain the momentum of Anwar's reform movement. The weekly
demonstrations have flagged since the Oct. 24 rally when riot
police fired water cannons and tear gas to disperse a
stone-throwing crowd.
	   Nearly 270 people were arrested for the violence. Shops and cars
were damaged in the area and traders say they've lost up to 50
percent of business.
	   A similar protest was scheduled last Saturday. But the turnout
was a fraction of the several thousand Anwar supporters who have
gathered regularly since his arrest Sept. 20.
	   ``I don't think there will be protests every week. That's too
optimistic,'' said Tian Chua, chairman of a new coalition of 23
reform groups and five opposition parties.
	   But he denied that the heavy police deployment, mass arrests and
tear gas were deterring Anwar supporters.
	   Chua said organizers made a ``tactical error'' last Saturday in
asking protesters to assemble at many points instead of
congregating on one downtown street.
	   A protest is being planned for Saturday, he said. And this time
protest organizers were expected to fix one place where pro-Anwar
activists could assemble.
	   But it was unlikely there would be demonstrations in front of
the High Court while Anwar is in the dock facing 10 counts of
corruption and illegal sexual acts, Chua said.
	   When the trial started Monday, about 200 hundred people gathered
near the courthouse, which was ringed by armed riot police. But
they quickly dispersed when police blocked their access to the
court.
	   ``It's unlikely that people will do anything (violent) while the
trial is on,'' said Syed Husin Ali, leader of the opposition
People's Party of Malaysia.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has repeatedly accused pro-Anwar
groups of trying to derail the trial and even those who were
organizing the anti-government rallies would have to be mindful of
that, he said.
	   The opposition Islamic group, Parti Islam SeMalaysia, however,
plans to go ahead with small meetings inside its regional offices
to keep up the momentum of the anti-Mahathir campaign, Chua said.
	   Leaders of the party are traveling to towns and villages as part
of a road show, he said.
	   Most young Malaysians had never witnessed political protests
until Anwar was sacked by Mahathir on Sept. 2. The last riot in the
capital occurred in 1969.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, hours after an unprecedented rally
of 30,000 people at Kuala Lumpur's Independence Square demanded an
end to Mahathir's 17-year rule.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
that he will not convene his Cabinet to approve the Mideast peace
deal until the Palestinians have presented a complete blueprint for
fighting Islamic militant groups.
	   The Cabinet meeting was scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. (1100 GMT)
Tuesday to debate the land-for-security agreement, with a vote
expected on Wednesday.
	   If the meeting is postponed, the 12-week timetable of the
agreement would likely be disrupted. The clock was to have started
ticking on Monday, but implementation was delayed at the request of
Netanyahu who told Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat he could not
proceed without approval by his Cabinet and the Israeli Knesset.
	   Arafat agreed to the delay, and Netanyahu assured the
Palestinian leader that he would do his best to carry out the first
Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank on or around Nov. 16, the
original date stipulated in the agreement.

Lion to be killed after rescue from private zoo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A lion rescued from a private zoo was so
abused it developed an incurable spinal injury and will have to be
killed to relieve his misery, zoo and wildlife officials said
Tuesday.
	   Sonu, an 11-year-old male, was seized in March from a traveling
zoo where he had been kept cramped in a cage so small it resulted
in painful injuries to his backbone and hind legs, Uttar Pradesh
state chief wildlife warden R.L. Singh said. Six months of
treatment in Lucknow's public Prince of Wales Zoological Gardens
proved unsuccessful.
	   ``He will never be able to walk or lead a normal life,'' zoo
director Suresh Singh said. ``Moreover, he is also in acute pain
and is being fed painkillers continuously.
	   R.L. Singh said Sonu would be killed Nov. 10 or 11 with an
overdose of tranquilizers.
	   Sonu was seized from one of the 38 traveling zoos operating in
Uttar Pradesh that lost their licenses earlier this year. Some of
the zoo owners could face charges under wildlife protection laws.

China condemns Jordan over Taiwan visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China criticized Jordan on Tuesday for receiving
rival Taiwan's foreign minister and urged the Middle East country
not to allow visits by high-ranking Taiwanese again.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao reminded Jordan
that it pledged not to have diplomatic contacts with Taiwan as part
of an agreement opening formal ties between Amman and Beijing.
	   The visit by a ``high-ranking political figure'' from Taiwan
``not only severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, it
also undermines the credibility of the Jordanian government in the
world,'' Zhu said at a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Taiwanese Foreign Minister Jason Hu visited Jordan and other
Middle East countries over the weekend in a foray to pierce
Beijing's diplomatic blockade of the island.
	   ``The Chinese government hereby expresses its strong
dissatisfaction and regret over this action of the Jordanian
government and urges the Jordanian side to take immediate and
effective measures to prevent similar events from happening
again,'' Zhu said.
	   China claims Taiwan, whose government split with Beijing in the
Chinese civil war in 1949. Efforts to keep Taiwan diplomatically
isolated have quickened in recent years, leaving the island with
only 26 diplomatic partners. Tonga switched ties to Beijing over
the weekend, the third nation in a year to desert Taiwan.
	   Zhu said Taiwan's attempts to carve out a separate identity are
increasingly meeting with disfavor.
	   Taiwan has refused to release details of Foreign Minister Hu's
travels to minimize the diplomatic fallout for his Middle East
hosts.
	   China has long had good relations with many of the region's Arab
nations and has built strong ties with Israel since normalizing
ties in 1992.

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Seven bandits posing as policemen
raided a Buddhist shrine in southern Sri Lanka, tied up the monks
and took away cash and seven bronze Buddha statues, the area's
police chief said Tuesday.
	   ``The treasure hunters had planned the operation well,'' said
Hakmana police chief Kamal Nayanaranga.
	   The men, two of them dressed in police uniforms, told the head
priest they had come to look for deserters from the Sri Lankan
army, which is fighting Tamil separatist rebels. They gathered all
the men in the temple, including five monks, inside a room and tied
them up during the Saturday night robbery.
	   Hakmana is about 160 kilometers (99 miles) south of Colombo.
	   Sri Lanka, a predominantly Buddhist nation of 18.5 million
people, has more than 10,000 Buddhist shrines. Antique Buddha
statues can fetch high prices.

Judge rejects appeal to let Hong Kong tycoon leave Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China urged Taiwan to let indicted Hong
Kong property tycoon Lim Por Yen go home, but a judge refused
Tuesday, saying Lim must stay in Taiwan at least until authorities
conclude their bribery case against him.
	   Lim has been bailed out of jail after being charged in Taiwan's
biggest-ever alleged bribery, but the tycoon must remain in Taiwan.
He has complained this is interfering with his ability to manage
his business interests.
	   A semi-official Chinese agency, the Association for Relations
across the Taiwan Straits, appealed to Taiwan on Monday, saying Lim
should be free to leave on humanitarian grounds. But Judge Yen
Chin-min quickly rejected the idea.
	   ``In any advanced country, it is only normal to bar someone
suspected of committing a severe crime from leaving the country,''
Yen said Tuesday.
	   The judge also disputed Lim's contentions that he can't get his
work done.
	   ``I believe he can make use of modern facilities and control his
business from here,'' Yen said.
	   Lim, head of Hong Kong's Lai Sun Group, was detained last
December at Taipei's international airport while trying to board a
flight to Hong Kong. He was freed on bail but ordered to stay in
Taiwan as his case proceeds.
	   Lim was indicted in March on charges of paying 55.7 million Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 7 million) in bribes to a Taipei County
official to help Lim's Taiwan-registered company obtain too much
money in a government land deal.
	   Lim says he paid the money to a private consultant and did not
question how it was spent.
	   The judge said he will proceed rapidly and hopes to deliver
verdicts in Lim's case next month.

Official newspaper urges Iraqis to prepare to fight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With UN-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stepped up its rhetoric against the
United States on Tuesday, with a state-run newspaper urging the
country to prepare to battle ``the U.S. monster'' regardless of the
sacrifices.
	   Meanwhile, three monitoring teams from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency went to check three previously
declared weapons sites, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said.
	   She said a technical team from the U.N. Special Commission _
which looks into biological and chemical weapons as well as
long-range missiles _ went out to deal with a problem involving a
camera or a sensor. She gave no other details.
	   Iraq over the weekend said it was halting the work of UNSCOM
monitors, in essence breaking ties with the group charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   But it has continued to allow nuclear monitors to work, and has
let technical teams ensure that U.N. equipment continues to
function.
	   The U.N. Security Council has declared the action against UNSCOM
a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions, and U.S. President
Clinton warned Monday that military action was a possibility,
saying ``no options are off the table.''
	   The call for preparations for a battle came in a front-page
editorial in Al-Iraq daily.
	   ``There will be no compromise in our decision to halt
cooperation with Special Commission and its spies,'' the paper
said. ``This decision compels us to fight in a battle to redeem our
rights.''
	   The paper said Iraq was certain that the coming battle over the
inspections will end in ``victory'' for Baghdad and ``humiliation''
for the United States.
	   It urged Arab nations and other countries friendly to Iraq to
rally behind Baghdad ``to defeat the U.S. monster'' because winning
the forthcoming battle with Washington will not only be fruitful
for Iraq ``but for the whole world, which America is pushing to the
abyss.''
	   Al-Iraq concluded: ``There will be no backing down this time no
matter the sacrifices.''
	   The government has said it will not allow U.N. inspections to
resume until the Security Council agrees to deal with trade
sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   It also says the UNSCOM director, Richard Butler, should be
replaced and that its teams be more balanced, a reference to Iraq's
long-standing complaint that there are too many American and
British monitors.
	   The sanctions _ which limit the sale of oil, Iraq's financial
mainstay _ have devastated the economy.
	   The Security Council has said the sanctions will not be lifted
until the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of
non-conventional weapons.
	   Iraq's media are daily heaping scorn on the United States, which
it accuses of pressuring the United Nations to prolong the
sanctions.
	   The English-language Baghdad Observer insisted the country was
``acting in self-defense.''
	   In an editorial headlined ``Iraq victim of U.S. aggression,''
the Observer said: ``The only way out of this vicious circle is to
set a definite timetable for the total lifting of the unjust
embargo.''

Hamas: More than 300 supporters have been arrested
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ More than 300 suspected Islamic
militants have been arrested by Palestinian police since last
week's suicide attack on an Israeli convoy, a leader of the Islamic
militant group said Tuesday.
	   Over the weekend, Palestinian security forces said they had
rounded up more than 100 followers of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad
groups, but have refused to update the figure.
	   Ismail Hanieh, a Hamas leader, said that more than 300 activists
have been arrested since last Thursday's bombing in which an
Israeli soldier and the assailant, a 19-year-old Hamas activist
from the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Jebaliya, were killed.
	   Hanieh was among those rounded up, but was released after
several days. On Tuesday, the spokesman of Hamas, Mahmoud Zahar,
was also freed, Palestinian security officials said.

China expels U.S. citizen who met dissident's sister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities detained and expelled a
China-born U.S. citizen who met an imprisoned dissident's sister, a
U.S.-based opposition group said Tuesday.
	   Yan Dunzheng, who lives in New York, returned to China on a
valid visa but was expelled Sunday after being detained in the
eastern province of Shandong, the Chinese Democracy and Justice
Party said in a statement.
	   It said Yan was detained after he met the sister of a detained
dissident, Sun Weibang. Sun, a businessman, is serving a 12-year
prison term for involvement in pro-democracy protests in 1989.
	   Police in Qingdao, Shandong, held Yan for a night and half a day
before he was expelled, the Democracy and Justice Party said.

	   The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said he held
Israel responsible for any delays.
	   ``We have an agreement. Two centimeters above Netanyahu's
signature it says that the agreement is entering into force 10 days
afterwards,'' Erekat said Monday evening, after Netanyahu aides
first raised the possibility that the Cabinet meeting might be
delayed.

meeting in the Gaza Strip with Arafat deputy Mahmoud Abbas and the

	   In a related development, a leader of the Islamic militant group
Hamas said Tuesday that more than 300 activists have been rounded
up by Palestinian security forces since last week's suicide attack
on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip.
	   Earlier this week, Palestinian security official said they had
arrested more than 100 suspected Islamic militants, but have

	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar was released Tuesday after several
days in detention, but Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin remained
under house arrest, Palestinian security officials said.

Thailand gives laid-off workers free medical care
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The millions of Thai workers and family
members who lost their livelihoods due to the severe economic
crisis will receive free health care for a year, Public Health
Ministry officials said Tuesday.
	   The medical coverage is part of the government's program to ease
social woes _ including a skyrocketing suicide rate _ caused by the
crisis, which has spread globally since erupting in Thailand in
July 1997. The government believes 1.5 million Thais have lost
their jobs.
	   Winai Viriyakitja, director-general of the mental health
department, said that the strains of unemployment were feeding
depression and drug use that have caused a soaring suicide rate. He
estimated that one Thai was committing suicide per hour.
	   To be eligible for the medical care, the unemployed need to
apply through local labor offices. The health care is free only at
government-run hospitals.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The chief executive of Hong Kong's central bank
visited Beijing on Tuesday, reportedly to seek assurances from
China's central bank that financial problems in mainland investment
institutions won't get out of hand.
	   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the People's Bank of China
confirmed talks were taking place but they would not say anything
about the topic.
	   The Hong Kong Standard reported Tuesday that the chief executive
of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam, and a group of the
territory's commercial bankers visited Beijing to get a better
explanation of problems in China's international trust and
investment corporations, known as ``Itics.''
	   Hong Kong bankers have been worried since last month, when the
Chinese central bank ordered the closure of Guangdong International
Trust and Investment Corp. when it went into default on debt
repayments.
	   The Itics are investment arms for Chinese provincial
governments, and they got into trouble by making loans on numerous
projects that the politicians backed but the marketplace did not
need _ such as too many power plants and flashy apartment complexes
that are largely unoccupied.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Singapore's plans to launch a futures contract
based on Hong Kong stock prices ran into stiff opposition from the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which reportedly is trying to block
important price information from its potential competitor.
	   Hong Kong market officials have asked the financial information
provider Reuters to withhold real-time stock price information
needed by the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, the South
China Morning Post reported Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong executives worry their share prices could be pushed up
and down by futures traders in Singapore, in dealings beyond their
regulatory reach. Their strategy seems to be to halt the planned
market by choking off the information it needs.
	   The exchange approached Reuters because it supplies stock price
information to Morgan Stanley Capital International to calculate
the MSCI Hong Kong Index, which tracks the value of Hong Kong
shares, the newspaper said.
	   The Singapore market plans to launch an MSCI Hong Kong Index
futures contract on Nov. 23 to compete with futures trading in Hong
Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index.
	   Both Reuters and the Hong Kong market would confirm only parts
of the Post's story.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund has
approved the release to the Philippines of around dlrs 280 million
from a dlrs 1.3 billion precautionary loan arrangement, the
Philippine central bank said Tuesday.
	   Central Bank Managing Director Amando Tetangco said the approval
was given last Friday.
	   The central bank expects to be able to draw the dlrs 280 million
either Wednesday or Thursday. It will be used to increase the
central bank's foreign currency reserves, which stood at dlrs 10.6
billion at the end of September, Tetangco said.
	   He said the IMF funds should help boost the Philippine peso,
which broke through the 40 peso-per-dollar level Tuesday to set a
new four-month high.
	   Tetangco attributed the peso's appreciation to strong dollar
inflows from foreign direct investors, stock investors and
Filipinos working overseas.
	   Currency traders said they believe the IMF money will improve
sentiment for both the peso and the stock market.
	   The IMF precautionary arrangement was agreed upon in April, and
is to be used by the central bank as a war chest to repel extreme
speculative attacks on the peso.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A group representing Singapore industries urged
the government Tuesday to slash business costs by about 30 percent
to help them cope with the economic downturn, a reduction
considerably higher than the government's expected target.
	   Singapore Confederation of Industries president Robin Lau said
the government should reduce employers' mandatory contributions to
the state-run pension system from 20 percent of a worker's salary
to 5 percent, and should cut a host of levies and fees.
	   The government is expected to announce wide-ranging measures to
lighten the burden on companies later this month, targeting mainly
wages and the pension fund. It has said it would aim for a 15
percent overall reduction in business costs.
	   Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong recently recommended that company
contributions to the mandatory pension fund be slashed in half, to
10 percent of an employee's salary.
	   A cut in the 26 percent corporate tax rate, as well as
reductions in state-controlled fees and charges, are also among
measures that may be adopted.
	   A government panel examining ways of improving Singapore's
competitiveness is scheduled to issue recommendations Nov. 11, and
Parliament is expected to debate the cost-cutting package at the
end of the month.
	    &UR; _____
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will offer foreigners who take
a stake in three nationalized banks up to a seven-year guarantee on
non-performing loans at those failed institutions, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   Kitti Patpong-pibul, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand,
said his bank would decide on a case-by-case basis whether to make
guarantees to foreign investors in three banks, according to The
Nation newspaper.
	   The government plans to sell three nationalized commercial
lenders by the end of this year under the terms of a bank sector
recapitalization plan announced on Aug. 14.
	   The sale comes in wake of the country's worst financial and
economic crisis in modern times.
	   The guarantees would apply to foreign buyers taking a
controlling stake in Bangkok Metropolitan Bank PCL, Siam City Bank
PCL and Radhanasin Bank PCL.
	   Authorities have said as much as 75 percent of each bank's
shares could be sold to foreigners. Thus far, foreign investors
have been slow to move in, fearing huge losses at the nationalized
banks for the foreseeable future.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - The American ambassador said Tuesday
he did not know of any evidence indicating that a U.S.-based mining
company operating in Indonesia had broken a U.S. anti-corruption
law.
	   Ambassador Stapleton Roy made the remarks after discussing
efforts to combat corruption in a meeting with Indonesian Attorney
General Andi Ghalib.
	   Freeport Indonesia, a unit of New Orleans-based Freeport-McMoran
Copper and Gold Inc., operates the world's largest copper and gold
deposit mine in the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya, the western
half of New Guinea island.
	   The attorney general's office is investigating the alleged
involvement of Indonesian senior economic minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita in a 1991 share transaction between Freeport and an
Indonesian conglomerate, the Bakrie group.
	   The deal led to the renewal of Freeport's operating contract
with the Indonesian government that year.
	   Ghalib said Roy informed him that Freeport chairman James Moffet
will come to Indonesia in the next few days, but has yet to set a
time to meet with government prosecutors investigating the case.

National Front No. 2 to run for mayor of Marseille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Bruno Megret, the No. 2 leader of the far-right
National Front, said Tuesday that he plans to run for mayor of the
French port of Marseille in elections set for 2001.
	   Megret said National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen agreed with
the election bid, which if successful would increase the Front's
influence in southern France, where it already controls four city
halls.
	   ``This time the National Front is mobilizing to win,'' Megret
said Tuesday on Radio Monte Carlo, confirming an editorial in the
Marseille Liberte newspaper in which he indicated he would run.
	   In the last regional elections, the Front won nearly 28 percent
of the vote in Marseille, France's third largest city and its
biggest Mediterranean port.
	   Megret said he wanted to reverse Marseille's decline, which he
said was due in part to rising crime, immigration, high taxes and a
loss of jobs.
	   The National Front has won about 15 percent of the vote in
recent French elections, although it scored as high as a third of
the vote in some regional races this spring.
	   A racist, nationalist movement, the Front is seeking an end to
immigration to France, which it blames for high crime rates and
unemployment. It also opposes the new European single currency.

20 years in exile, Iranian empress dreams of going home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The shah's widow, Empress Farah, says she
dreams about returning to Iran after 20 years in exile.
	   Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Farah left Iran on Jan. 16, 1979,
as riots engulfed the country. Soon after, the revolution brought
to power the Islamic republic and the royal couple never returned.
	   Farah, who lives in France, was asked in a rare television
interview Monday night about the return that has so far eluded her.
	   Eyes brimming with tears, the 60-year-old empress spoke about an
incident in which she accidentally tasted grains of Iranian soil
stuck to dried fruit brought from her country.
	   ``I hope that I can be able to cross the border and see the
mountains of Iran,'' she said. ``Then I think I will kiss the
ground.''
	   The Iranian government has long asked that the royal family's
wealth be returned and that some of its members be tried in court.
In recent years, the demands have subsided, but the return of any
Pahlavis who still claim the throne remains out of the question.
	   Farah remains bitter at political friends who she says abandoned
the pro-Western Pahlavis during the revolution.
	   ``The world is cruel to the losers,'' she said in the three-hour
interview on the private Murr TV station.
	   Until his death of cancer in Egypt in 1980, the shah and his
family sought refuge in several countries, including the United
States. But the list quickly shrunk as Iran's new regime pressured
host countries and threatened to kill the royal couple.
	   Perhaps the most prominent part of the journey in exile was the
shah's cancer treatment in the United States. That stop
precipitated in angry students occupying the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
on Nov. 4, 1979, and taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.

Court of arbitration lifts suspension of Olympic judo champion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ The Court of Arbitration for Sport
has provisionally lifted an indefinite suspension imposed on French
Olympic judo champion Djamel Bouras.
	   The French Judo Federation suspended Olympic champion Djamel
Bouras for a year from last October for testing positive for the
anabolic steroid nandrolone ahead of the World Judo Championship.
	   When that suspension ended last month, the International Judo
Federation decided to extend it until the world governing body's
executive committee ruled on the case.
	   Bouras then appealed to the CAS, which on Monday lifted the
suspension pending a final decision.
	   The court ``considered that the suspension of indefinite
duration imposed on the athlete could cause him damage that would
be difficult to repair'' if the international federation finally
decided not to extend Bouras' suspension.
	   The court of arbitration said it expects to make a final ruling
on the case late this year or at the beginning of next year.
	   Nandrolone has been forbidden by the International Olympic
Committee since 1974. Since 1996, a level superior to two nanograms
in urine tests has been proscribed.
	   Bouras was tested Oct. 2 last year, ahead of the World Judo
Championships held in Paris later that month.

Hong Kong share prices close sharply higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed sharply higher
Tuesday, boosted by optimism about the territory's economy and an
overnight rally on Wall Street.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 188.44 points, or 1.9
percent, closing at 10,358.52. On Monday, the index had gained
15.14 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 12.12 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.55 billion), up from Monday's 7.84 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.0 billion).
	   Brokers said investors have become increasingly optimistic about
Hong Kong's economy following a rebound in the property market and
a stabilization of interest rates.
	   The Hong Kong market was also boosted by sharp overnight gains
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 114.05
points _ or 1.3 percent _ to 8,706.15.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong rose 1.75 Hong Kong dollars to
55.00, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 50 cents to 53.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 6.50 dollars to
184.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 75 cents to 67.50.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 75 cents to 56.50, and Cathay
Pacific was unchanged at 7.95.

Indonesia's ruling party appears split over whether to apologize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with denial by party chairman; CORRECTS year to 1971,
graf 11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's ruling Golkar Party
appeared split Tuesday over whether to apologize for its role in
keeping authoritarian former President Suharto in power for three
decades.
	   Newspaper reports quoted the party's deputy chairman, Marzuki
Darusman, as saying sorry for Golkar's past performance.
	   ``I want to apologize on behalf of Golkar for all of the
mistakes it made in the past,'' The Jakarta Post quoted him as
saying at a political seminar in the capital Monday.
	   Darusman said Golkar needed to rebuild its relations with the
Indonesian people ahead of elections next year.
	   However, party chairman Akbar Tanjung said Tuesday that
Darusman's comments did not represent an official apology by the
party.
	   Akbar, who is also the government's state secretary and a
Cabinet minister, told reporters at the Presidential Palace that
Golkar did not need to say sorry.
	   Opponents have criticized Golkar for playing a major role in
Suharto's regime, which has been accused of corruption and human
rights abuses.
	   Many say it should seek forgiveness from Indonesians for past
wrongs and for allowing Indonesia to slide into the current
economic crisis.
	   Protests and riots forced the old autocrat to quit in May amid
the economic turmoil.
	   During Suharto's era, Golkar was only one of three political
parties allowed to contest what were tightly controlled elections
every five years.
	   It has overwhelmingly dominated the Parliament since 1971. At
the most recent election in 1997, it won more than 70 percent of
the vote.
	   However, Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has
promised political reforms and fresh democratic elections,
scheduled next May.
	   The reforms are to be discussed next week by the People's
Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest legislative body.
	   Critics have questioned how far Habibie and the assembly will
push the reform process.
	   Nevertheless, it is certain that Habibie will allow many new
political parties to contest the ballot.
	   Analysts say Golkar will probably lose its huge parliamentary
majority at the May election, largely because of its past record.
	   This is even though it has undergone extensive reform within its
own ranks to cut its links with Suharto's legacy.
	   It has dumped Suharto as its patron and has purged its ranks of
many of his closest aides.

Ferry towed to safety after fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ An Estonian truck ferry was towed to
safety in Sweden Tuesday after a fire in the engine room left it
disabled and drifting in strong winds.
	   The 36 crew members and 15 truck drivers on the Kapella were not
injured. The Estonian shipping company Tallink's ferry was en route
from Paldiski, Estonia, to Kapellskaer, 80 kilometers (50 miles)
north of Stockholm and had reached islands off the Swedish coast
when the fire started late Monday.
	   When the ship was disabled, anchors were dropped but they
started dragging in the heavy weather. A Finnish Coast Guard boat
helped keep the ferry from crashing against rocks in the rough
water.
	   ``But the towline snapped between the two ships and Kapella was
very close to running aground,'' said deputy chief Christer Tjaeder
of the Stockholm Sea Rescue Center to the news agency TT.
	   Two Swedish ships reached the place and towed the ferry toward
land.
	   It was not immediately clear what caused the fire in the engine
room.
	   Last month two passenger ferries were damaged while traveling
across the Baltic.
	   No one was injured on Viking Line's Gabriella or Estline's
Baltic Kristina but the incidents were a reminder of the 1994
disaster when the ferry Estonia sank and 852 people were killed.

Chechen leader claims Russian financier paid ransom for hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov claimed a
prominent Russian financier has been paying large ransoms to win
the release of hostages held in the breakaway territory, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   Boris Berezovsky, one of Russia's wealthiest and most
controversial businessmen, has claimed credit for freeing a number
of hostages held in Chechnya, including the recent release of an
British couple held for more than a year.
	   ``In circumvention of the Chechen government, he comes with
suitcases full of money and heaps of computers and bails out the
captives,'' Maskhadov said in an interview with the Komsomolskaya
Pravda newspaper published Tuesday. ``This only stimulates the
appetites of gangsters and discredits my nation.''
	   Whenever hostages are released, there are rumors about possible
ransom payments, but the parties involved rarely provide details.
	   Berezovsky has never acknowledged paying ransom. He has said
that he and others have been sending humanitarian and medical aid,
computers and school textbooks to Chechnya, and in return, senior
Chechen officials have put more emphasis on identifying and
locating kidnappers.
	   Ruslan Aushev, the president of Ingushetia, a region bordering
Chechnya, said hostage takers were receiving material rewards for
freeing their captives. Aushev said Maskhadov's opponents in
Chechnya, such as renegade warlord Salman Raduyev, were the main
beneficiaries.
	   Hostages are ``exchanged for computers, with which Raduyev's
residence is now crammed,'' Aushev told the newspaper. Raduyev ``is
now better equipped than some Russian special services.''
	   Chechnya has seen an explosion of violence and kidnappings for
ransom since its 1994-1996 independence war with Russia. About 100
people are still held, including three Britons, a New Zealander and
a Turk.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war, but no country has recognized its independence claim. Moscow
insists the territory remains part of Russia.

Netanyahu links Cabinet approval of peace deal to security plan

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new disruption, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Tuesday that he will not present the new Mideast
peace agreement to his Cabinet for approval until the Palestinians
have submitted a complete blueprint for fighting terrorism.
	   Netanyahu's announcement came just three hours before government
ministers were to have convened to discuss the 12-week
land-for-security agreement that is already a day behind schedule.
	   Implementation cannot begin until the agreement has been
approved by Israel's Cabinet and the parliament.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily to Netanyahu's ultimatum.
	   ``Instead of playing these sorry political games, he (Netanyahu)
should just stand up and say ... I won't implement what I have
signed,'' said Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   The Palestinians have said they have handed a security work plan
to the United States, as required. The United States has promised
to brief Israel on the plan, but not present it as a document.
	   Netanyahu said Tuesday that an important element was missing,
reportedly the chapter on how the Palestinian Authority would
dismantle the infrastructure of terror groups.
	   Netanyahu said he would not convene the Cabinet ministers until
he has seen the complete blueprint. ``There are three hours until
the convening of the government session,'' Netanyahu said.
	   ``If I receive it (the guarantees), I'll convene the government.
I'll wait until I see it. I won't show the ministers an incomplete
agreement,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu appeared to be contradicting Clinton administration
officials who said the Palestinians have lived up to their
commitments. ``The necessary plans were provided on time, prior to
entry into force (of the agreement),'' U.S. State Department
spokesman James Rubin said Monday.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry Schwartz refused comment on
Netanyahu's announcement, referring reporters to Rubin's statement.
	   The latest crisis came only a day after Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat overcame another hurdle in a rare
show of good will.
	   On Monday, the day the peace accord was to go into effect,
Arafat agreed to a request by Netanyahu to delay the start for
several days so the agreement could be approved by the Cabinet and
the Knesset. The Knesset vote to be held on Nov. 12.
	   Netanyahu, in turn, told Arafat that despite the delay he would
do his best to carry out the first Israeli troop pullback in the
West Bank on or around Nov. 16, the original date stipulated in the
agreement.
	   As Netanyahu made Tuesday's announcement, his defense minister,
Yitzhak Mordechai, met in the Gaza Strip with Arafat deputy Mahmoud
Abbas and the Palestinian security chief in Gaza, Mohammed Dahlan
who played a key role in putting together the anti-terror plan.
	   It was not immediately clear whether the three could resolve the
dispute in time for the Cabinet to convene on schedule.
	   In a related development, a leader of the Islamic militant group
Hamas said Tuesday that more than 300 activists have been rounded
up by Palestinian security forces since last week's suicide attack
on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip.
	   Earlier this week, Palestinian security official said they had
arrested more than 100 suspected Islamic militants, but have
refused to update the figure since then.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar was released Tuesday after several
days in detention, but Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin remained
under house arrest, Palestinian security officials said.
	   A senior Arafat aide, meanwhile, said Palestinian security
agents have foiled attempts by Iran to assassinate Arafat and
senior Palestinian Authority officials.
	   Iran is training and funding a secret Hamas group to carry out
the assassinations as well as suicide bombings in Israel, said
Tayyeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of the Palestinian
Authority.
	   Last week, Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khameni, attacked Arafat
during a sermon, calling him a traitor for signing the latest peace
agreement with Israel.

China urges Iraq to allow U.N. weapons inspections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Iraq Tuesday to end its latest
standoff with U.N. weapons inspectors, and said cooperation would
be the quickest way to end ruinous economic sanctions.
	   Treading the cautious path China has followed in previous
confrontations between Iraq and the U.N. Security Council over the
inspections, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao asked
all sides to exercise restraint.
	   The United States has suggested military retaliation may be an
option in responding to Iraq's decision to end contacts with the
inspectors.
	   ``We express our concern and disquiet over this decision by Iraq
and appeal to it to resume its comprehensive cooperation with'' the
U.N. inspectors, Zhu said at a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Zhu repeated that Iraq should comply with U.N. resolutions and
the council should fairly evaluate inspection work done so far and
``gradually lift the sanctions.''
	   He said that dialogue, not confrontation, would be ``conducive
to the early conclusion of arms inspection in Iraq.''
	   The Security Council imposed the economic sanctions on Iraq
after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. After the Gulf War, the Security
Council made lifting the sanctions dependent on Baghdad's
dismantling suspected nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
programs.
	   In previous standoffs, China, along with other permanent council
members Russia and France, has resisted efforts by the United
States and Britain to threaten Iraq with a military strike.

Five killed in stabbing spree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Five people, including three children,
were killed and another was seriously injured in a stabbing spree
in southern Bac Lieu province, a provincial police officer said
Tuesday.
	   Cao Thanh Vang, 24, committed suicide by hanging after the
incident Saturday, said police officer Nguyen Trung Kien. The
victims included Vang's wife, sister-in-law, nephew and a
neighbor's two sons.
	   Another neighbor, the only surviving witness, was comatose and
in critical condition with a fractured skull. Doctors reported her
chances of survival were slim, Kien said.
	   Police are investigating the motive for the killing spree and
suspect that it might be related to the drowning death a week
earlier of Vang's 15-month-old child due to his wife's
carelessness, Kien said.
	   He said Vang left a few words on a suicide note, but that it was
illegible because of bloodstains.
	   The deadly attack came a day after a man in the central
highlands province of Daklak was convicted and sentenced to death
for killing 11 people, including eight children, and injuring six
others in a stabbing spree in August.

Illegal Antarctic fishermen are pirates, Australia warns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Antarctic nations must act
immediately against fishing pirates to save Antarctic ecosystems
and some species from possible extinction, Australia's Environment
Minister Robert Hill warned Tuesday.
	   Modern day pirates poaching in Antarctic waters are threatening
the Patagonian toothfish and wild sea birds such as the albatross,
Hill said.
	   Speaking at a conference of the Commission for the Conservation
of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in the southern city of
Hobart, Hill called for tough international measures to combat
illegal trade in protected Antarctic species.
	   ``The challenge comes predominantly from modern day pirates who
seek to pillage the resources of the area with no concern for the
environmental damage they cause and the devastation of fish stocks
and sea bird populations,'' Hill said.
	   ``If the plunder continues, the world will lose a valuable
natural and economic resource.''
	   Fish stocks in some regions have become so depleted that they
are approaching commercial extinction, and illegal fishers are
killing huge numbers of sea birds, including thousands of
endangered albatrosses, Hill said.
	   ``The impact that this decimation of bird and fish populations
will have on the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic ecosystems is not
precisely known, but it can only be great,'' he said.
	   ``Stocks and ecosystems are unlikely to recover for decades, if
at all.''
	   The commission was established to protect the living marine
resources of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters.
	   The Royal Australian Navy has arrested the crews of three
vessels allegedly caught taking Patagonian toothfish illegally in
Australia's Antarctic waters in recent months.
	   Environmental groups claim illegal fishing in the region, mainly
by Norwegians, South Americans and Spaniards, is at crisis level.
	   Hill urged other commission members to be equally vigilant. He
warned that traditional approaches, such as flag and port controls,
are not enough.
	   ``We must be able to track the trade in illegally and legally
caught fish,'' Hill said. ``We must strengthen measures to outlaw
illegal fishers and prevent them trading their ill-gotten goods.''

Swiss release one suspect in Kosovo arms-smuggling case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has released one of six
people arrested last week in the breakup of a smuggling ring which
was organizing arms shipments to Serbia's Kosovo province, a
spokesman for the federal prosecutor's office said Tuesday.
	   Four people from the former Yugoslavia, a Swiss woman and a
national of an Arab country were arrested in an operation starting
last Monday. The arrests were accompanied by house searches in
several states.
	   A half-ton of ammunition, several weapons and 230,000 Swiss
francs (dlrs 172,000) in cash were seized.
	   The federal prosecutor's office said the suspects had been
negotiating ``a planned arms deal to the value of several million
U.S. dollars for the resistance movement (against Yugoslav
government forces) in Kosovo.''
	   Spokesman Dominique Reymond declined to give details of the
suspect released Friday or the reasons for the release.
	   Customs officers in Albania seized two containers from
Switzerland in connection with the investigation. The shipments
contained ``modern weapons'' among other things.
	   Kosovo Albanian organizations in Switzerland have denied any
link to the smuggling ring.
	   A Swiss-based political representative of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army, Bardhyl Mahmuti, said the rebels didn't buy
weapons in Switzerland.

20 years in exile, Iranian empress dreams of going home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The shah's widow, Empress Farah Diba,
says she dreams about returning to Iran after 20 years in exile.
	   Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Farah left Iran on Jan. 16, 1979,
as riots engulfed the country. Soon after, the revolution brought
to power the Islamic republic and the royal couple never returned.
	   Farah, who lives in France, was asked in a rare television
interview Monday night about how she would feel about returning.
	   Eyes brimming with tears, the 60-year-old empress spoke about an
incident in which she accidentally tasted grains of Iranian soil
stuck to dried fruit brought from her country.
	   ``I hope that I can be able to cross the border and see the
mountains of Iran,'' she said. ``Then I think I will kiss the
ground.''
	   The Iranian government has long asked that the royal family's
wealth be returned and that some of its members be tried in court.
In recent years, the demands have subsided, but the return of any
Pahlavis who still claim the throne remains impossible.
	   Farah remains bitter at political friends who she says abandoned
the pro-Western Pahlavis during the revolution.
	   ``The world is cruel to the losers,'' she said in the three-hour
interview on the private Murr TV station.
	   Until his death of cancer in Egypt in 1980, the shah and his
family sought refuge in several countries, including the United
States. But the list quickly shrunk as Iran's new regime pressured
host countries and threatened to kill the royal couple.
	   Perhaps the most prominent part of the journey in exile was the
shah's cancer treatment in the United States. That stop
precipitated in angry students occupying the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
on Nov. 4, 1979, and taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ More than 300 villagers suffering from
malaria in northern India died because government doctors gave them
medicines that had expired and were no longer effective, officials
admitted Tuesday.
	   The deaths occurred in September and October in 30 villages in
Uttar Pradesh state. The patients showed symptoms of malaria _
intermittent high fever, followed by profuse sweating and cramps _
but were not responding to anti-malarial treatment. Malaria is
spread through mosquito bites and is fairly simple to treat.
	   ``We were baffled and thought the disease causing virus to be a
new strain,'' said state director-general of health H.C. Vaish.
	   ``It was only last week that we found out that the entire batch
of chloroquine tablets being administered to patients were
useless,'' said Vaish. The expiry dates printed on the back of the
medicines was November 1996, Vaish said.
	   A preliminary investigation following the discovery has fixed
the blame on junior and middle-ranking officials of the medical
supplies department. Vaish said a wider inquiry would be ordered
and those responsible punished.
	   A fresh batch of chloroquine tablets was sent to treat 200
patients still suffering from malaria.

Thailand to urge farmers to plant less rice because of drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai farmers, who have made their
country the world's top rice exporter, will be asked to plant less
rice because there is not enough water to support a second crop, an
irrigation official said Tuesday.
	   The country is suffering one of the worst droughts in years, due
partly to the El Nino weather phenomenon. Water levels in
Thailand's two major dams are unusually low, and medium-size dams
are at the lowest level in a decade.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda, who are grappling with the country's worst
economic crisis in years, came to the decision to reduce the rice
crop in a meeting with government agencies Monday, said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   An Irrigation Department official, confirming newspaper reports,
said the Agriculture Ministry will urge the farmers to reduce the
second and third rice yield of the year by half.
	   The government fears that the cuts could raise tensions between
farmers and authorities, since rice prices have been good for the
past year _ one of the brighter spots in a largely bleak economic
picture.
	   Thailand exports an average of 5 million tons of rice a year, a
third of its total production.

Reorganization at Dutch telecom giant will cost 3,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch telecommunications giant
Royal KPN NV said Tuesday it will eliminate 3,000 jobs as part of a
cost-cutting restructuring program.
	   KPN said the reorganization, which was announced in April and
will cost 800 million guilders (dlrs 427.8 million) this year, is
aimed at enhancing its efficiency.
	   The company will cut 4,000 jobs in the coming three years but
also will create 1,000 new positions in growth sectors such as
Internet activities and mobile telephone and information
technology.
	   KPN said the deepest cuts would be made in the fields of fixed
network operations, construction and maintenance, at directory
inquiries and its installation business.
	   A further 1,000 jobs will be lost in KPN's corporate office and
service units.
	   KPN said forced redundancies will ``probably be unavoidable.''

NYC Marathon champion concerned about future schedule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS to correct slug
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Kagwe, two-time winner of the New York City
Marathon, has a dilemma: Which races should he run?
	   Should he try and run the 1999 World Championships or the 2000
Olympics, or both?
	   ``I'm a little sore, a little happy, a little concerned and a
little homesick,'' Kagwe said Monday, a day after beating fellow
Kenyan Joseph Chebet by three seconds in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 45
seconds, the second-closest finish in the race's 29-year history.
	   ``I'm concerned about the future of my running _ which race to
choose, whether to run the Olympic Games and the World
Championships.''
	   Selection for the Kenyan team is extremely difficult because the
country has so many good marathoners.
	   In addition to Kagwe, there are Ondoro Osoro, winner of the
Chicago Marathon in 2:06:54, the third-fastest time in history and
the best-ever for a first-time marathoner; Moses Tanui, two-time
winner of the Boston Marathon; Chebet, runner-up to Tanui this year
at Boston and second to Kagwe the past two years in New York;
Josephat Kiprono, second in the Berlin Marathon in 2:07:26 to world
record-setter Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil, and Elijah Lagat and
Samson Kandie, the 1-2 finishers in the Praha Marathon.
	   In the past, a country has been permitted a maximum of three
marathoners at the Olympics and World Championships. Next year,
though, the worlds will allow five per country.
	   How the unpredictable Kenyan federation will select its runners
still is uncertain. Often, the Boston Marathon is the selection
race, but not always.
	   That's why Kagwe, who finished fifth at Boston this year, is
planning to run at Boston again in 1999. That doesn't necessarily
mean that if Kagwe qualifies for the team, he will go to Seville,
Spain, for the World Championships because the race is too close to
New York, where he wants to go for a third consecutive victory.
	   ``He's not that interested in the World Championships,'' his
agent, Lisa Buster, said Monday.
	   ``He wants to run the Olympics. That's his ultimate goal.''
	   Kagwe was disappointed in 1995 when he won the Pittsburgh
Marathon in a course-record 2:10:24, but was bypassed for the World
Championship team.
	   ``He wasn't very happy,'' Buster said. ``It was very political.
Two other runners with times of 2:17 were selected ahead of him.''
	   Kagwe is scheduled to go home to Kenya tonight and remain there
until February, when he will return to his U.S. training base in
Norristown, Pa., and prepare for Boston.
	   ``It usually takes him two months to get ready,'' Buster said.
	   Kagwe was a marked man in Sunday's New York City Marathon.
Wherever he went, the rest of the contenders tried to follow.
	   ``He had to change his strategy during the race,'' Buster said,
``because nobody wanted to go. The other runners were looking at
him.
	   ``One of our other runners, Julius Kariuki, tried to take people
with him by going to the front, but the other runners didn't go
after him. The others had a lot of respect for Kagwe and were
waiting for him.''
	   Kagwe didn't shake loose until the final 400 meters, when he
swept past Chebet and outsprinted him to the finish line.
	   ``I knew I was strong,'' Kagwe said. ``When he passed, I didn't
get distressed. I knew I could keep up with his speed.''
	   Italy's Franca Fiacconi was the women's winner in 2:25:17.
	   Overall, there were 32,456 starters and 31,456 finishers.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first witness in the
corruption and sexual misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim said
Tuesday that the ousted deputy prime minister asked police to
tamper with evidence that he had committed adultery and sodomy.
	   Mohamed Said Awang, former chief of the country's top police
unit, the Special Branch, was the first of 52 prosecution witnesses
expected to take the stand in the government case against the
ousted finance minister.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were cooked up to
undermine his growing challenge to the 17-year leadership of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mohamed testified that the Special Branch had launched operation
Solid Grip, an investigation into sexual misconduct by Anwar, back
in 1992. That was before he was named deputy prime minister and
finance minister in 1993.
	   It wasn't until August 1997, however, that the investigation
turned serious with a letter and a sworn statement that accused
Anwar of adultery and sodomy.
	   Anwar got police officers to force retractions by the writers of
the two statements, the prosecution said.
	   The statement by Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, said
Anwar sodomized him 15 times. The other, by Ummi Hasilda Ali, the
sister of the wife of Anwar's private secretary, said her sister
had sex with Anwar.
	   Both statements were also sent to Mahathir, who said he fired
Anwar after he himself talked to people who said they had sex with
his handpicked successor.
	   Mahathir said Anwar was morally unfit to run the Southeast Asian
nation and dumped him on Sept. 2.
	   ``Whatever witnesses and documents the prosecution will bring to
the court will prove beyond doubt that the accused abused the
position as deputy prime minister and finance minister for his own
personal gain,'' Abdul Gani Batail, the chief prosecutor, said in
his opening statement.
	   It was unclear whether the police who are alleged to have forced
the retractions would be charged with any crime.
	   Defense lawyers on Monday opened their case by asking the judge
to hold Mahathir in contempt of court for saying publicly that
Anwar should be convicted.
	   Mahathir was also on the witness list, but it was doubtful he
would actually be called.
	   Since his sacking, Anwar led an unprecedented anti-government
movement in which tens of thousands of supporters gathered at his
rallies.
	   Even after his arrest on Sept. 20, the demonstrations continued.
A full-scale riot broke out on Oct. 24 when police launched tear
gas into a mosque and protesters retaliated by throwing rocks and
bricks at police.
	   On Tuesday, riot police with shields and tear-gas launchers
stood guard across the street from the red-brick High Court at
Independence Square, where Anwar led a huge anti-government protest
just hours before his arrest.
	   His supporters said they wanted to maintain calm during the
trial to ensure Anwar gets a fair hearing.
	   ``It's unlikely that people will do anything while the trial is
on,'' said Syed Husin Ali, the leader of the opposition group,
People's Party of Malaysia.
	   During the opening day Monday, Anwar's attorneys argued that the
first four graft charges were invalid because the lower house of
Parliament had repealed the special anti-corruption law under which
he was charged.
	   Paul dismissed the request. The defense said it would take the
motion to an appeals court.
	   The first four corruption charges will be heard before the trial
adjourns Nov. 14, as Malaysia plays host to 20 world leaders in the
capital for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. When the
trial resumes, the fifth graft charge and the five sex charges will
be heard.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of observers clamored for a second day to get
into the courtroom.
	   ``By not allowing the international community to come in and
observe the trial, the prime minister is undermining the name of
the country,'' U.N. Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy told The
Associated Press outside the court.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been among international
leaders who have expressed concern over Anwar's plight after he
appeared at his arraignment with bruises and a black eye, alleging
police brutality.

Russian leaders set conditions for ratifying disarmament treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament will not ratify the START-II
nuclear treaty unless the government promises to build a new
generation of nuclear missiles, a top official said Tuesday.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, the hard-line chairman of the parliament's
security commission, said the government must guarantee it will
replace the RS-18 and RS-20, two powerful missile types which would
be deactivated under START-II, with the new Topol-M, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Unless the Topol-M missiles are introduced within two years of
dismantling the older missiles, Ilyukhin said he is ``not
convinced'' that the treaty will be ratified, Interfax said.
	   Ilyukhin's comments came after Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov met with lawmakers to ask them once again to pass START
II.
	   The agreement to cut nuclear arms that has been stalled by the
Communist-dominated Russian parliament for years. The agreement was
signed in 1993 and was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996.
	   Despite deep financial crisis, Russian military officials have
said they plan to overhaul the country's nuclear missile arsenal
with the Topol-M, at a cost of dlrs 30 million each, even though
one of them malfunctioned and exploded in a test launch last week.

U.S. envoy holds Kosovo talks

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Hill in Pristina, UNHCR quotes. Trims

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A week after NATO's decision not to
strike against Yugoslavia, the U.N. refugee organization said
Tuesday thousands of displaced people in Kosovo province had found
shelter, as shuttle diplomacy talks moved into a second round.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill traveled to the provincial capital
Pristina Tuesday to continue discussions with ethnic Albanian
representatives.
	   On Monday, Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch after
arriving from the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has led international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 others have been forced from
their homes since Serb authorities launched a crackdown on Albanian
militants in February.
	   The number of people camped out in the open, however, has
dropped considerably, since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
pulled his troops out of the province last week, said Jacques
Franquin, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
in Geneva.
	   Franquin said the number of people living in the open is now put
at ``a few hundred,'' but cautioned the numbers are ``very
approximate,'' as many of the displaced have not returned to their
own homes, but are staying in villages with neighbors and
relatives.
	   As part of an Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to order
troops back to their barracks and dismantle police barricades,
allowing for people to return safely.
	   On Monday, people along a central road north of Malisevo, 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that Serb
police were preventing them from returning to their villages.
Several reported that police shot at them when they attempted to
return to family homes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, claimed that the Serb military on Monday
shelled the village of Jablanica, 55 kilometers (35 miles)
southwest of Pristina, for the third straight day.
	   According to UNHCR reports, the situation in the Istok and
Srbica areas northwest of Pristina is still volatile, with a number
of police checkpoints remaining, Franquin said.
	   In Belgrade Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Julia Taft was
meeting with Yugoslav government officials and representatives of
media organizations that have been banned under a new, harsh media
law.
	   Last week, Taft visited refugees in Kosovo to assess the
humanitarian situation there.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stepped up its rhetoric against the
United States on Tuesday, with a state-run newspaper urging the
country to prepare to battle ``the U.S. monster'' regardless of the
sacrifices.
	   Meanwhile, three monitoring teams from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency went into the field to check
three previously declared weapons sites, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline
Cross said.
	   She said a technical team from the U.N. Special Commission _
which looks into biological and chemical weapons as well as
long-range missiles _ went out to deal with a problem involving a
camera or a sensor. She gave no other details.
	   Iraq over the weekend said it was halting the work of UNSCOM
monitors, in essence breaking ties with the group charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   But it has continued to allow nuclear monitors to work, and has
let technical teams ensure that U.N. equipment continues to
function.
	   The U.N. Security Council has declared the action against UNSCOM
a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions, and U.S. President
Clinton warned Monday that the military action was a possibility,
saying ``no options are off the table.''
	   The call for preparations for a battle came in a front-page
editorial in Al-Iraq daily.
	   ``There will be no compromise in our decision to halt
cooperation with Special Commission and its spies,'' the paper
said. ``This decision compels us to fight in a battle to redeem our
rights.''
	   The paper said Iraq was certain that the coming battle over the
inspections will end in ``victory'' for Baghdad and ``humiliation''
for the United States.
	   It urged Arab nations and other countries friendly to Iraq to
rally behind Baghdad ``to defeat the U.S. monster'' because winning
the forthcoming battle with Washington will not only be fruitful
for Iraq ``but for the whole world, which America is pushing to the
abyss.''
	   Al-Iraq concluded: ``There will be no backing down this time no
matter the sacrifices.''
	   At midmorning, about 100 women _ mostly covered in black dresses
and head scarves of observant Muslims _ staged a symbolic funeral
for 60 children that the Health Ministry said had died in recent
days.
	   Such demonstrations, organized by the government, are staged
several times a month to protest the U.N. trade sanctions, which
Iraq says has left the country without adequate food and medicine.
	   As they marched, the women shouted: ``Today we bury them,
tomorrow we will avenge them'' and ``America is the enemy of God.''
	   One of their banners read: ``Down America, down Britain because
you are killing Iraqi children.''
	   Iraq accuses the United States and Britain of working to prolong
the sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The government has said it will not allow inspections to
resume until the Security Council agrees to deal with the
sanctions.
	   It also says the UNSCOM director, Richard Butler, should be
replaced and that its teams be more balanced, a reference to Iraq's
long-standing complaint that there are too many American and
British monitors.
	   The sanctions _ which limit the sale of oil, Iraq's financial
mainstay _ have devastated the economy.
	   The Security Council has said the sanctions will not be lifted
until the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of
non-conventional weapons.

U.N. approves more Iraqi contracts for oil spare parts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has approved 36 more
contracts for spare parts that Iraq says it needs for urgent repair
of its oil facilities, the U.N. humanitarian office said Tuesday.
	   The contracts were valued at dlrs 15.5 million, bringing total
approvals to 111 contracts worth dlrs 87.9 million, the office said
in a statement.
	   The oil parts are being funded by the special, U.N.-approved
oil-for-food program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities
of oil to buy needed food, medicine and other necessities.
	   Iraq has been given approval to buy dlrs 300 million worth of
spare parts for its oil industry. It says that without them, it
cannot increase oil output to meet its U.N. target of selling dlrs
5.2 billion worth of oil in a six-month period.
	   The statement said that 78 contracts valued at dlrs 38.9 million
remained on hold. Iraq so far has submitted 277 contracts worth
dlrs 155 million for approval, the statement added.
	   It said that Iraq has sold dlrs 2.57 billion worth of oil during
the current, six-month phase of the oil-for-food program, far below
its dlrs 5.2 billion target. The current phase ends Nov. 25, and

South Korea to strengthen punishment for illegal wiretapping

government's publishing statement, 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government, under fire for an
almost threefold increase in the number of wiretaps in the past
year, promised Tuesday to crack down on the practice.
	   ``We will perfectly protect your communication secrets. Please
make phone calls without feeling nervous,'' the ministers of
justice, home affairs and defense and the head of the national
intelligence agency said in a statement.
	   The presidential office said the government will publish the
statement in major newspapers.
	   The officials said the ruling coalition headed by President Kim
Dae-jung would revise the law on wiretapping and strengthen
punishment for its violation.
	   Saying that wiretapping is sometimes necessary in cases of
spying, drug smuggling and kidnapping, they promised to make sure
that officials receive court approval first.
	   Court approval is already mandatory, but civil rights groups
accuse officials of widely ignoring the requirement or using a
loophole in the law to avoid having to apply for permission.
	   Under current law, investigators can start wiretapping without
court approval in an ``emergency,'' but have to receive
authorization within 48 hours. Many wiretaps end within that time.
	   Opposition parties want emergencies to be defined more clearly,
the range of crimes in which wiretapping is permitted to be limited
and the period of unauthorized wiretapping shortened.
	   The ruling National Congress for New Politics said 1,795
wiretappings were recorded in 1995, 2,444 in 1996 and 6,002 last
year. For the first half of this year, the figure reached 3,580.
	   Despite the sharp increases last year and this year, the party
said it could find no wrongdoing.
	   The government's wiretapping became a hot issue after the
opposition raised the issue at the National Assembly in an audit
session for state-run Korea Telecom, the nation's monopoly local
phone operator, last month.

Indonesia's ruling party appears split over whether to apologize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comment, quote from party chairman, grafs 6-7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's ruling Golkar Party
appeared split Tuesday over whether to apologize for its role in
keeping authoritarian former President Suharto in power for three
decades.
	   Newspaper reports quoted the party's deputy chairman, Marzuki
Darusman, as saying sorry for Golkar's past performance.
	   ``I want to apologize on behalf of Golkar for all of the
mistakes it made in the past,'' The Jakarta Post quoted him as
saying at a political seminar in the capital Monday.
	   Darusman said Golkar needed to rebuild its relations with the
Indonesian people ahead of elections next year.
	   However, party chairman Akbar Tanjung said Tuesday that
Darusman's comments did not represent an official apology by the
party.
	   Akbar, who is also the government's state secretary and a
Cabinet minister, told reporters at the Presidential Palace that
Golkar did not need to say sorry as it was unclear what it should
apologize for.
	   ``Officially and organizationally, Golkar has never
apologized,'' he was quoted as saying by the official Antara news
agency.
	   Opponents have criticized Golkar for playing a major role in
Suharto's regime, which has been accused of corruption and human
rights abuses.
	   Many say it should seek forgiveness from Indonesians for past
wrongs and for allowing Indonesia to slide into the current
economic crisis.
	   Protests and riots forced the old autocrat to quit in May amid
the economic turmoil.
	   During Suharto's era, Golkar was one of only three political
parties allowed to contest what were tightly controlled elections
every five years.
	   It has overwhelmingly dominated the Parliament since 1971. At
the most recent election in 1997, it won more than 70 percent of
the vote.
	   However, Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has
promised political reforms and fresh democratic elections,
scheduled next May.
	   The reforms are to be discussed next week by the People's
Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest legislative body.
	   Critics have questioned how far Habibie and the assembly will
push the reform process.
	   Nevertheless, it is certain that Habibie will allow many new
political parties to contest the election.
	   Analysts say Golkar will probably lose its huge parliamentary
majority at the May election, largely because of its past record.
	   This is even though it has undergone extensive reform within its
own ranks to cut its links with Suharto's legacy.
	   It has dumped Suharto as its patron and has purged its ranks of
many of his closest aides.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first witness in the
corruption and sexual misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim said
Tuesday the ousted deputy prime minister asked police to tamper
with evidence showing he had committed adultery and sodomy.
	   Mohamed Said Awang, former chief of the country's top police
unit, the Special Branch, was the first of 52 prosecution witnesses
expected to take the stand in the government case against the
jailed dissident.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were cooked up to
undermine his growing challenge to the 17-year leadership of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mohamed testified that the Special Branch had launched operation
Solid Grip, an investigation into sexual misconduct by Anwar, back
in 1992. That was before he was named deputy prime minister and
finance minister in 1993.
	   It wasn't until August 1997, however, that the investigation
turned serious with a letter and a sworn statement that accused
Anwar of adultery and sodomy.
	   Anwar got police officers to force retractions by the writers of
the two statements, the prosecution said.
	   The statement by Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, said
Anwar sodomized him 15 times. The other, by Ummi Hasilda Ali, the
sister of the wife of Anwar's private secretary, said her sister
had sex with Anwar.
	   Both statements were also sent to Mahathir, who said he fired
Anwar after he himself talked to people who said they had sex with
his handpicked successor.
	   Mahathir said Anwar was morally unfit to run the Southeast Asian
nation and dumped him on Sept. 2.
	   ``Whatever witnesses and documents the prosecution will bring to
the court will prove beyond doubt that the accused abused the
position as deputy prime minister and finance minister for his own
personal gain,'' Abdul Gani Patail, the chief prosecutor, said in
his opening statement.
	   It was unclear whether the police who are alleged to have forced
the retractions would be charged with any crime.
	   ``A poison-pen letter has become evidence,'' snapped Anwar, just
after the trial adjourned and he was whisked off to the lock-up in
the court basement.
	   Earlier, Anwar's mother could be seen hunched over during the
humiliating testimony. At one point, Anwar mouthed to her, ``Have
you eaten?''
	   Defense lawyers on Monday opened their case by asking the judge
to hold Mahathir in contempt of court for saying publicly that
Anwar should be convicted.
	   Mahathir was also on the witness list, but it was doubtful he
would actually be called.
	   After his sacking, Anwar led an unprecedented anti-government
movement in which tens of thousands of supporters gathered at his
rallies.
	   Even after his arrest on Sept. 20, the demonstrations continued.
A full-scale riot broke out on Oct. 24 when police launched tear
gas into a mosque and protesters retaliated by throwing rocks and
bricks at police.
	   On Tuesday, riot police with shields and tear-gas launchers
stood guard across the street from the red-brick High Court at
Independence Square, where Anwar led a huge anti-government protest
just hours before his arrest.
	   His supporters said they wanted to maintain calm during the
trial to ensure Anwar gets a fair hearing.
	   ``It's unlikely that people will do anything while the trial is
on,'' said Syed Husin Ali, the leader of the opposition group,
People's Party of Malaysia.
	   During the opening day Monday, Anwar's attorneys argued the
first four graft charges were invalid because the lower house of
Parliament had repealed the special anti-corruption law under which
he was charged.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul dismissed the request. The
defense said it would take the motion to an appeals court.
	   The first four corruption charges will be heard before the trial
adjourns Nov. 14, as Malaysia plays host to 20 world leaders in the
capital for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. When the
trial resumes, the fifth graft charge and the five sex charges will
be heard.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of observers clamored for a second day to get
into the courtroom.
	   ``By not allowing the international community to come in and
observe the trial, the prime minister is undermining the name of
the country,'' U.N. Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy told The
Associated Press outside the court.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been among international
leaders who have expressed concern over Anwar's plight after he
appeared at his arraignment with bruises and a black eye, alleging
police brutality.

India, Pakistan talk about everything but Kashmir
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Negotiations that begin this week in New
Delhi on trade, terrorism, drug trafficking and other issues will
be a tough test of India's contention that it doesn't need to talk
about Kashmir to improve relations with uneasy neighbor Pakistan.
	   Pakistan made a concession when it agreed to the New Delhi
talks, but now insists they're merely a sideshow to negotiations on
the Kashmir territorial dispute that has fueled two wars.
	   Pakistan's top foreign office bureaucrat and his Indian
counterpart discussed Kashmir in the Pakistani capital last month,
but their consultations yielded little more than pledges to meet
again in February.
	   Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf told The
Associated Press on Monday he expected no breakthroughs in New
Delhi, saying there could be no increased cooperation until the
``core Kashmir problem'' is solved.
	   India nonetheless tried to ensure an optimistic atmosphere,
announcing Monday that it would soon release 39 Pakistani fishermen
who were detained Oct. 24 for violating Indian waters.
	   India and Pakistan both routinely detain each others' fishermen,
and efforts to speed releases were expected to get a boost during
the New Delhi talks.
	   The Kashmir dispute, though, shadows many of the issues on the
New Delhi agenda. On Thursday, the first day of talks, officials
will discuss a water-sharing project involving a Kashmiri river.
The next day, Siachen, a glacier battlefield in Kashmir, comes up
for discussion between defense ministry officials.
	   An Indian foreign ministry official, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity, said the best that could be hoped for was
an agreement to stop the almost daily skirmishing across Siachen.
	   The two countries cannot even agree on whether they agreed to
withdraw troops from the glacier when they last met on the issue,
in 1992.
	   In all, six days of talks are scheduled between Thursday and
Nov. 13 on issues ranging from the tangled Siachen dispute to
starting bus service between the Indian capital and the Pakistani
border city of Lahore.
	   Bharat Karnad, a national security expert at New Delhi's
independent Center for Policy Research, said the talks with the
most potential are probably those focusing on trade, scheduled for
Nov. 10.
	   Among other things, officials were to discuss a proposal for
cash-strapped Pakistan to sell electricity to India.
	   ``It's a great hook to tempt the Pakistanis on an issue that
makes economic sense to them. Once that's settled ... I think
you'll see more give and take on both sides,'' Karnad said. ``It's
a great beginning. If there's going to be any advancement at all in
the political realm, it's going to come in the wake of trade ties.
I think the Pakistanis are slowly coming to realize this.''

Myanmar opposition member resigns from parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A member of Myanmar's chief opposition
party has resigned as a member of the parliament elected in 1990
but never allowed by the military government to meet, a state-run
newspaper said Tuesday.
	   Min Thu Wun, 89, a scholar and poet, cited age as his reason for
stepping down, the newspaper New Light of Myanmar said.
	   But the resignation adds to the dozens of members of the
parliament who have quit in recent years. Some have accused the
government of pressuring them to resign.
	   Min Thu Wun is the second member of parliament for the National
League for Democracy, headed by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San
Suu Kyi, to have quit since Suu Kyi stepped up a campaign against
the military government in July.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military
since 1962. Suu Kyi rose to prominence in anti-government uprisings
in 1988 that were bloodily suppressed. The military allowed
elections in 1990 but never honored the results after the
opposition won in a landslide.

Reorganization at Dutch telecom giant will cost 3,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch telecommunications giant
Royal KPN NV said Tuesday that it will eliminate 3,000 jobs as part
of a cost-cutting restructuring program.
	   KPN said the reorganization, which was announced in April and
will cost 800 million guilders (dlrs 427.8 million) this year, is
meant to enhance its efficiency.
	   The company will cut 4,000 jobs in the coming three years but
also will create 1,000 new positions in growth sectors such as
Internet activities and mobile telephone and information
technology.
	   KPN said the deepest cuts will be made in the fields of fixed
network operations, construction and maintenance, at directory
inquiries and in its installation business.
	   Included in the cuts are 1,000 jobs in KPN's corporate office
and service units.
	   KPN said layoffs will ``probably be unavoidable.''

Official: Iran funds and trains militants trying to kill Arafat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security forces have in
recent months foiled Iranian-backed attempts by Islamic militants
to assassinate Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and senior members
of his government, a senior Arafat aide said Tuesday.
	   Iran is training and funding a secret cell within the Islamic
militant group Hamas to carry out the assassinations and suicide
bombings in Israel, Tayyeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of
the Palestinian Authority, told The Associated Press.
	   ``We arrested several of these people who had plans detailing
the assassinations,'' Abdel Rahim said.
	   The most recent arrest came in October when Palestinian
intelligence agents arrested a Hamas activist, Jamal Natche, in the
West Bank town of Hebron. Natche was given orders by Iran to kill
Arafat, Abdel Rahim said, but did not provide details.
	   As a result of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
agreement, there have been mounting threats against Arafat, both by
Hamas in the Palestinian areas and by radical Muslim leaders
abroad.
	   Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, has called Arafat a
traitor. The leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group in Lebanon,
Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, said Arafat's hands should be chopped off
for signing the agreement.
	   The Hamas military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, warned Arafat of
``the wrath of vengeance'' for his crackdown on Hamas, imposed
after last week's suicide attack by the group on an Israeli convoy.
	   On Monday, the 69-year-old Arafat dismissed the threats with a
wave of his hand. ``It is not the first time and it won't be the
last. I don't care,'' said Arafat, who has survived several
attempts on his life during his decades as Palestinian leader.
	   Israeli media reports said the CIA has given Arafat's security
chiefs, Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan. instructions on how to
deal with the new situation. However, Abdel Rahim said security for
Arafat has not been beefed up in response to the threats.
	   Rajoub would only say that Palestinian security forces,
especially Arafat's bodyguard detail, known as Force 17, is always
alert. Several of Arafat's bodyguards have received training in the
United States.
	   With no designated successor, Arafat's sudden death would create
chaos within Palestinian society. Such a situation would seriously
threaten a already shaky peace process.
	   Iran is an outspoken foe of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords and has close ties to Hamas which has carried out more than
a suicide bombings in Israel, effectively disrupting the peace
process at critical moments.
	   Abdel Rahim said the Palestinian Authority was determined to
stop Iran from meddling in Palestinian affairs. ``We won't allow
Iran to create an Afghanistan in our areas,'' Abdel Rahim said,
referring to the civil war-torn Asian nation.
	   The Palestinian daily Al Quds which is close to the Palestinian
Authority wrote in an editorial that it found Khamenei's attacks on
Arafat ``very shocking.''
	   ``We wished the statements by Khamenei had not been made and we
still hope that the government of Iran will appreciate efforts made
by the Palestinians to maintain good relations with Iran,'' the
newspaper said.

German magazine defends use of Hitler in ads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Responding to public protest, Germany's most
influential newsmagazine defended on Tuesday its use of an Adolf
Hitler portrait in ads promoting its series about the 20th century.
	   Newspapers that ran the full-page ads this week _ and Der
Spiegel magazine itself _ reported complaints from readers that the
head shot of Hitler, without any explanatory text, amounted to ``a
glorification of a war criminal.''
	   The ads feature a photo of Hitler above the line ``Look history
in the face.'' Only on the next page, under a photo of a crying
Hitler youth member meant to reflect the Nazi era's dark side, is
there a reference to the 50-part Spiegel series, which began this
week.
	   Spiegel spokesman Matthias Schmolz said magazine editors
anticipated some controversy, but felt Hitler could not be ignored.
	   ``He stands, probably like no one else, for German history in
the 20th century, certainly very disastrous and unspeakable,
naturally,'' he said. ``But as far as that goes I believe he's a
good choice, because it makes clear what the series is about.''
	   He said the editors decided to limit the Hitler ads to
newspapers, though, ``to avoid just such misunderstandings.'' Other
figures such as Vladimir Lenin and John F. Kennedy appear on
outdoor billboards.
	   To complaints that neo-Nazis could use the newspaper ads as
posters, Schmolz said only: ``Whoever does that, we feel sorry for
them.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three bombs exploded, killing one man, and a
fourth device was deactivated in a western Tajikistan town, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   The first blast went off near the office of the Interior
Ministry in the town of Kurgan-Tyube on Monday night, killing a
driver working for the regional prosecutor's office, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Another bomb exploded near a weapons storage facility belonging
to the Kurgan-Tyube police department, while the third went off
near a downtown market. No one was injured in those two blasts.
	   Local police detonated a fourth bomb Tuesday morning, also in
Kurgan-Tyube, located 95 kilometers (58 miles) of the Tajik capital
Dushanbe.
	   Police have detained a number of suspects, Interfax said,
without providing further details.
	   Tajikistan's five-year civil war formally ended last year but
the country still suffers from periodic outburts of violence.

Thorpe, Crawley get batting practice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Graham Thorpe and Steve Crawley scored
half centuries Tuesday as England used the final day of its match
against Western Australia for batting practice.
	   Western Australian captain Justin Langer set England a chase of
282 off 63 overs and the Ashes tourists were 192 for four at the
close.
	   While Langer was upset that England failed to chase the target,
the team was obviously content to play some batsmen into form ahead
of the five-test series starting Nov. 20 in Brisbane.
	   Thorpe, who missed most of the northern summer with a bad back
injury, continued his encouraging return with an unbeaten 64,
giving his test hopes a significant boost. Crawley made a polished
65 including seven boundaries.
	   ``What's the point of playing a game if you don't play a game to
win,'' Langer said. ``I hope England play with the same attitude
throughout the summer because if they do it will be long summer for
them.''
	   England coach David Lloyd said the team had work to do to match
Australia in the tests.
	   ``It would have been absolutely terrific if we could have come
away with a resounding victory but you have to acknowledge we have
to find our legs,'' Lloyd said. ``We need to be sharper ... the
players would be the first to acknowledge that we have got work to
do in all departments.''
	   Captain Nasser Hussain narrowly escaped serious injury during
his innings of 28. He was hit on the face by a short ball from
paceman Shane Jurgensen. Blood spurted from his nose but his helmet
absorbed most of the impact.
	   The blow followed a worse injury to Mark Butcher, who required
10 stitches and took no further part in the game after being hit
above the eye in the first innings.
	   England's next match is against South Australia in Adelaide from
Saturday.

Confidence vote looms for Greek government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led following vote expected after 2200 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Parliament headed toward a government
confidence vote Tuesday following days of debate that exposed deep
rifts in the governing Socialist party.
	   But Premier Costas Simitis appeared almost certain to survive
the vote in the 300-seat chamber, where his party has a comfortable
majority.
	   Socialists are expected give near-unanimous backing to Simitis
although some party dissenters harshly criticized the government's
strict belt-tightening measures _ aimed at earning Greece a place
in the European Union's single currency group.
	   Simitis, who is midway through his four-year term, called the
confidence vote after the Socialists lost ground to the more
conservative New Democracy opposition in municipal elections last
month. He intended the vote to represent a stamp of approval for
the government's policies.
	   But it also was a possible dress rehearsal for an important
party congress in March, when Socialist hard-liners are expected to
intensify their challenges to Simitis.
	   The dissenting bloc _ joined by Defense Minister Akis
Tzochatzopoulos _ accuse Simitis of breaking with the Socialists'
populist roots to concentrate on economic reforms in the EU's
poorest nation.
	   Tzochatzopoulos predicted eroding support for the Socialist
party unless it ``sides with the people once again.'' The
Socialists have led Greece for 14 of the past 17 years.
	   But Simitis insists that Greece risks becoming a second-tier
economy unless it can meet EU fiscal goals. Among Greece's
challenges is lowering inflation and trimming the state debt.
	   But some labor unions and leftist groups have fought back with
strikes and protests. Some recent firebombings have hit financial
targets such as tax offices.
	   ``Our government is determined to press ahead,'' Simitis told
lawmakers when debate on the confidence vote opened Sunday.
	   Greece is the only country of the 15-member EU that failed to
qualify for the first round of monetary union. Britain, Denmark and
Sweden opted out of joining.

Observers still demanding seats in dissident trial

 &UR; Eds: ADDS grafs 8-9 with observer saying too many courtroom
irregularities &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar's Trial &QL; 
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ International observers were still
demanding Tuesday to be given seats in the corruption and sexual
misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim.
	   U.N. Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy, himself on trial in Malaysia
for defamation, said Malaysia was hurting its image by barring
dozens of international human rights, judicial and diplomatic
observers from the trial.
	   ``By not allowing the international community to come in and
observe the trial, the prime minister is undermining the name of
the country,'' Param said outside the red-brick High Court Tuesday.
	   Judge Augustine Paul ruled before the trial formally began
Monday that international observers would not be given special
observer status and could watch the trial on a first-come,
first-serve basis. But most could not get into the small courtroom.
	   Paul called the appeal by Anwar's lawyers on behalf of the
observers an ``insult to the court.''
	   ``There is no reason to let foreigners check us,'' he said.
	   Representatives of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch
did get seats in the public gallery. Special status would have
meant reserved seats and allowing them to formally report on the
the trial.
	   Adnan Buyong Nasution, an Indonesian attorney with the
Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists, managed to get a
seat in the courtroom Tuesday.
	   ``This trial doesn't impress me at all,'' he said. ``It's full
of irregularities. The judge isn't responsive enough in a case
fraught with heavy political impact.''
	   Anwar, sacked by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2 as
his deputy and finance minister, is on trial for alleged corruption
and illegal sexual acts.
	   His case generated international concern after he appeared with
a black eye and bruises during his arraignment. Anwar, who has
pleaded innocent to the charges, which he calls politically
motivated, said he was beaten by police the night of his arrest
Sept. 20.
	   ``If Malaysia wants to be in the Security Council of the United
Nations and also play an important role in the international global
community, why is it afraid of letting foreign observers in?''
Param said.
	   Last month, Malaysia was granted one of 10 non-permanent seats
on the U.N. Security Council.
	   The United States complained loudly Monday about a U.S. diplomat
and other representatives of foreign embassies being turned away
from the proceedings.
	   ``We believe that given the enormous interest in this trial, it
is in Malaysia's interest to follow the policy announced by the
High Court and allow spectators to observe the trial on a
first-come, first-serve basis, including representatives of the
international and local organizations, as well as diplomats,'' said
State Department spokesman James Rubin.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A week after NATO's decision not to
strike against Yugoslavia, the U.N. refugee organization said
Tuesday thousands of displaced people in Kosovo province had found
shelter, as shuttle diplomacy talks moved into a second round.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova in the provincial capital Pristina Tuesday for
discussions on a draft agreement.
	   On Monday, Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch after
arriving from the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has led international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 others have been forced from
their homes since Serb authorities launched a crackdown on Albanian
militants in February.
	   The number of people camped out in the open, however, has
dropped considerably, since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
pulled his troops out of the province last week, said Jacques
Franquin, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
in Geneva.
	   Franquin said the number of people living in the open is now put
at ``a few hundred,'' but cautioned the numbers are ``very
approximate,'' as many of the displaced have not returned to their
own homes, but are staying in villages with neighbors and
relatives.
	   As part of an Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to order
troops back to their barracks and dismantle police barricades,
allowing for people to return safely.
	   On Tuesday, however, a regional command of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army claimed that Serb forces have not been withdrawing
as planned from their checkpoints in the west of the province.
	   In a statement faxed to the ethnic Albanian media Tuesday, a KLA
regional command, claimed Serb forces have re-grouped and
re-located to positions further off the main roads. It also said
the Serbs were harassing and shooting at Albanians trying to return
to their villages.
	   ``If provocations, attacks and murder of civilians continue, the
(KLA) will be forced to take defensive measures,'' said the
statement.
	   The KLA statement also claimed Serb police buried nine ethnic
Albanians in the border town of Junik Monday. The Albanians were
reportedly killed recently in clashes at the border.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed and there
was no immediate response from the Serb side.
	   Serbian sources in the province reported Tuesday that the KLA
attacked overnight an ethnic Albanian family for ``its known
loyalty to Serbia.''
	   According to testimonies from the Sopa family members, four
uniformed KLA members riddled their home in the village Malo
Gracko, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Pristina with bullets.
The head of the family, Fehmi Sopa was seriously wounded and was in
a coma in a Pristina hospital, said the Serbian Media Center.
	   In Belgrade Tuesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia
Taft was meeting with Yugoslav government officials and
representatives of media organizations that have been banned under
a new, harsh media law.
	   Last week, Taft visited refugees in Kosovo to assess the
humanitarian situation there.

China looking for Asian Games gold in taekwondo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with swimming world record holder in training in grafs
8-9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China hopes to win its first Asian Games gold
medal in the martial art of taekwondo next month in Thailand, the
official newspaper China Sports Daily said Tuesday.
	   The team of six women and three men will be China's first to
compete in taekwondo at the Asian Games, the report said.
	   China only began developing taekwondo in 1995, a year after the
last Asian Games, the newspaper said.
	   China picked up one silver and one bronze medal at the 1997
world championships and won a gold, silver and five bronze medals
at the Asian championships this year, the report said.
	   With South Korea, Taiwan and Iran _ the strongest taekwondo
nations _ all competing in the upcoming games, ``the Chinese team's
goal is to go all out to win one gold medal,'' it said.
	   Head coach Chen Liren was quoted as saying that a recent
decision by the sport's international federation to adjust weight
categories for competitions would affect China's women. The team
would not be dominant at any weight, he said.
	   ``Strong competitors at the Asian Games will be as numerous as
trees in a forest,'' Chen was quoted as saying.
	   Meanwhile, world record holder Wu Yanyan has been swimming an
average 11 kilometers (7 miles) a day at a camp in southwest China
where she is in training for the games, the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   But the 20-year-old Wu, who shattered the 200-meter individual
medley record at China's national games in October 1997, said it
would be difficult for her to reach her peak at the Asian Games
because she has recently had stamina problems, Xinhua added.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stepped up its rhetoric against the
United States on Tuesday, with a state-run newspaper urging the
country to prepare to battle ``the U.S. monster'' regardless of the
sacrifices.
	   Iraq was certain that the battle over the inspections would end
in ``victory'' for Baghdad and ``humiliation'' for the United
States, the Al-Iraq daily said in a front-page editorial.
	   The oratory followed the weekend's announcement that Iraq was
halting the work of U.N. weapons inspectors monitors, in essence
breaking ties with the group responsible for eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   But it has continued to allow nuclear monitors to work, and has
let technical teams ensure that U.N. equipment continues to
function.
	   Three monitoring teams from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency went into the field Tuesday to
check three previously declared weapons sites, U.N. spokeswoman
Caroline Cross said.
	   And a technical team of weapons inspectors from the U.N. Special
Commission, known as UNSCOM, went out to deal with a problem
involving a camera or a sensor. She gave no other details.
	   Iraq accuses the United States and Britain of working to prolong
the sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The government has said it will not allow inspections to
resume until the Security Council agrees to deal with the
sanctions.
	   It also says the UNSCOM director, Richard Butler, should be
replaced and that its teams should be more balanced. One
longstanding Iraqi complaint is that there are too many American
and British monitors.
	   The sanctions, which limit the sale of oil, Iraq's financial
mainstay, have devastated the economy.
	   The Security Council has said the sanctions will not be lifted
until the U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of
non-conventional weapons.
	   The U.N. Security Council has declared the decision to ban
inspections a ``flagrant violation'' of U.N. resolutions, and U.S.
President Bill Clinton warned on Monday that military action was
possible.
	   Tuesday's response was succinct: ``There will be no compromise
in our decision to halt cooperation with the Special Commission and
its spies,'' the paper said. ``This decision compels us to fight in
a battle to redeem our rights.''
	   It urged Arab nations and other countries friendly to Iraq to
rally behind Baghdad ``to defeat the U.S. monster'' because winning
will not only be fruitful for Iraq ``but for the whole world, which
America is pushing to the abyss.''
	   Al-Iraq concluded: ``There will be no backing down this time no
matter the sacrifices.''
	   At midmorning, about 100 women mostly covered in the black
dresses and head scarves of observant Muslims staged a symbolic
funeral for 60 children that the Health Ministry said died in
recent days.
	   Such demonstrations, organized by the government, are staged
several times a month to protest the U.N. trade sanctions, which
Iraq says have left the country without adequate food and medicine.
	   As they marched, the women shouted, ``Today we bury them,
tomorrow we will avenge them'' and ``America is the enemy of God.''
	   One of their banners read: ``Down America, down Britain because
you are killing Iraqi children.''

Judges claim politicians meddle in judicial system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A top magistrate openly accused the
president's office of meddling in politically sensitive cases,
media reported Tuesday.
	   In yet another sign that Romania's judicial system is suspected
of bowing to political interests, the general secretary of the
Magistrates Association, Viorica Costiniu, said the presidential
office had obtained access to confidential files through the
justice ministry. She did not specify which cases.
	   Since communism was overthrown in 1989, there have been repeated
allegations that political leaders intervene in certain sensitive
cases. Officials elected two years ago vowed to allow the judicial
system to function independently, but corruption continues.
	   Last week, during a visit to Norway, Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu said that Romania's magistrates were ``communists,''
prompting the magistrates to respond.
	   Speaking on private Antena 1 TV late Monday, Costiniu also said
chiefs of police or prosecutors often telephone judges before some
trials open, suggesting solutions to the case.
	   Bucharest daily Ziua Tuesday said it was impossible for honest
magistrates to survive in the system, forcing many to abandon the
profession ``at an alarming rate'' to become lawyers and public
notaries.
	   A judge in Romania's Supreme Court of Justice, Maria Coca-Cozma,
who heads the magistrate's association told reporters at a news
conference Monday that judges ``who oppose interference are
intimidated and threatened'' by top prosecutors.
	   She cited two cases, where she said judges had come under
pressure. One involved a huge cigarette smuggling scandal in April
in which security officers close to President Emil Constantinescu
were charged and the other was the case of Syrian businessman who
was charged with massive fraud and had close links to former
President Ion Iliescu.
	   The Magistrates Association represents some 2,450 civil and
military judges. Almost three-quarters were appointed after 1989.

Chilean exile files compaint against Pinochet in German city of

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ A Chilean exile has filed a complaint
against former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet accusing him
of responsibility for her arrest and torture in Chile in 1973,
prosecutors said Tuesday.
	   The woman, a Chilean who has since gained German citizenship,
accused Pinochet of depriving her of personal liberty and causing
bodily harm during her arrest and torture.
	   Prosecutors were determining whether Germany has jurisdiction in
the case since the woman was not a German citizen at the time of
her arrest and torture, and also whether the charges were still
valid 25 years after the fact, spokeswoman Regine Appenrodt said.
	   The legal action was the latest by Chilean exiles who claim to
have suffered under Pinochet's 17-year rule since Britain's High
Court ruled illegal the dictator's arrest in London on a Spanish
warrant seeking his extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping
and torture.
	   Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, is expected to rule
this week on an appeal to the High Court ruling that Pinochet is
immune from prosecution as a former head of state.
	   But, meanwhile, Chilean exiles in Belgium, Norway, Switzerland
and France have independently filed similar complaints seeking
Pinochet's prosecution or extradition.
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says more
than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's
rule.

Pakistan holds Australia in Champions Trophy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan fought back to hold Australia
to a 4-4 tie in the 20th Champions Trophy men's field hockey
tournament Tuesday.
	   Pakistan was down 3-1 late in the second half until quick goals
by Atif Bashir and Sohail Abbas tied the score.
	   However, Troy Elder gave Australia a 4-3 advantage when he
received a well-timed pass from Scott Webster. With only two
minutes left on the clock, Bashir once again rescued Pakistan and
got the much-needed equalizer off a fine pass from Imran Yousuf.
	   Earlier, Australia opened the scoring with Brent Livermore's
ninth minute field goal, and captain Jay Stacy doubled the lead
with a penalty score.
	   Pakistan narrowed the gap to 2-1 just before halftime when
Naveed Iqbal capitalized on a fine cross from Haider Hussain.
	   Stacy scored his second goal four minutes into the second half
when a powerful shot off his team's seventh short corner beat
Pakistan custodian Mohammad Qasim.
	   Australia now has five points after three matches with one
victory and two draws. Pakistan, beaten 4-3 in its opening match
against South Korea, has two points following tie games against
Spain and Australia.
	   Result: Australia 4 (Brent Livermore (9th min), Jay Stacy (12th
min, 40th min), Troy Elder (67th min); Pakistan 4 (Naveed Iqbal
(34th min), Atif Bashir (60th min, 68th min), Sohail Abbas (65th
min).
	   Teams: Pakistan: Mohammad Usman (captain), Aamir Saleem, Babar
Abdullah, Sohail Abbas, Ali Raza, Imran Yousuf, Waseem Ahmed,
Haider Hussain, Muhammad Sarwar, Kamran Ashraf, Naveed Iqbal, Anis
Ahmed, Muhammad Qasim, Asad Ali Qureshi, Atif Bashir.
	   Australia: Adam Commens, Jason Duff, Troy Elder, James Elmer,
Lachlan Dreher, Ben Taylor, Jay Stacy (captain), Daniel Sproule,
Lachlan Vivian-Taylor, Mark Hickman, Scott Webster, Stephen Holt,
Matthew Wells, Murray Richards, Brent Livermore, Dean Butler.

	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Two children died when police fired live
ammunition and tear gas to disperse striking miners who staged a
violent protest in the central town Luanshya, news reports said.
	   The reports said 30 people were arrested after fighting running
battles with police Monday in the mining town in the northern
Copperbelt province.
	   A strike by some 6,000 miners at the state-owned Roan Mining
Corporation of Zambia turned violent when angry strikers and their
families marched to the mine's administrative offices to demand
housing allowances and other benefits.
	   Riot police intervened after shops and properties were trashed
and looted by strikers on their way through Luanshya to the copper
mining plant.
	   The dead were a 12-year-old boy shot in the head and an infant
who choked on tear gas, the reports said.
	   A third person, identified as Samuel Chansa, 22, was seriously
hurt when a tear gas canister was fired at him at point blank range
and lodged in his chest.
	   --
	   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo was
calm but tense Tuesday after a day of rioting triggered by a
massive 67 percent increase in gasoline prices.
	   Police and residents said taxivans and buses, at the center of
protest riots Monday, were operating reduced schedules after
pushing up their fares by more than 40 percent since fuel price
were raised on Saturday.
	   Police spokesman Alfred Musengi said 27 people were arrested for
public violence Monday. Another 20 were injured in the unrest and
19 vehicles, including five buses, were damaged.
	   The violence began after taxivan and bus crews, striking to
protest the gasoline hikes, turned on commuters who hitched rides
in private vehicles.
	   Commuters and stone-throwing youths retaliated in sporadic
disturbances that spread through five township suburbs, police
said. Calm was restored by nightfall.
	   Most of the industrial city's businesses were crippled by the
violence.
	   Saturday's gasoline hikes, blamed on the slide of the Zimbabwe
currency against the U.S. dollar, were the largest single increase
since Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980.
	   They were expected to have a ripple effect through the economy
and increase the likelihood of more social unrest as economic
hardships worsen.
	   --
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The next round of a national polio
immunization campaign targeting at least nine million children
under age 5 begins Friday in Ethiopia, where polio is still
endemic.
	   Health Minister Adem Ibrahim said Monday the incidence of polio
has dramatically declined worldwide, but Ethiopia was among nine
countries, including neighboring Somali, Sudan and Kenya, where
polio remained endemic and still paralyzes thousands of children
every year.
	   He said the government had budgeted dlrs 5.8 million and another
dlrs 6.9 million has been contributed by international donors for
the campaign.
	   Ibrahim said 90,000 health workers and volunteers were expected
to participate in the vaccination campaign, which will be carried
out at more than 30,000 vaccination posts in hospitals, health
centers, local administration offices, schools, churches, mosques
and markets.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A joint South
African-Mozambican has netted more than 100 tons of illegal weapons
and munitions, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Operation Rachel IV's hauls included two B10 cannons, 19 types
of assault rifles, anti-personnel mines, grenades and mortar
rounds, The Star reported.
	   All the caches found in the cross-border operation were
booby-trapped, the newspaper said.
	   Most of the hardware originated in former Eastern bloc
countries, said operation commander Suiker Britz. The illicit
weaponry was destroyed by explosives. It was unclear who had cached
them or why.
	   --
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Sweden's King Karl XVI Gustav and
Queen Silvia were expected to start their tour of Africa in
Mozambique because the country has best rebounded from years of
war.
	   About 50 Swedish business leaders were to accompany the royal
couple.
	   The delegation on Wednesday was expected to participate in a
conference on cooperation between Mozambique and Sweden. The couple
were expected in maputo on Tuesday.
	   Mozambique, a former Portugese colony, ended a 16-year civil war
in 1992 and held its first democratic national elections in 1994.

Singapore bank cuts prime lending rate, others to follow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Development Bank of Singapore also cutting rate,
4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Two of Singapore's big four banks announced
Tuesday they were cutting their prime lending rate by half a
percentage point, paving the way for other local institutions to
follow suit.
	   United Overseas Bank reduced the rate it charges its best
customers to 6.5 percent effective Tuesday, its third cut in less
than two months and the biggest single cut since local banks began
lowering their lending rates recently.
	   The Singapore stock market reacted jubilantly, with the
benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index rising 4.4 percent in the
first 15 minutes of trading before giving up most of its gains on
profit-taking. The index closed 0.33 point higher at 1,263.47.
	   Later Tuesday, the Development Bank of Singapore Ltd. announced
an identical cut, effective Wednesday.
	   Singapore's other two major local banks _ Oversea-Chinese
Banking Corp. and Overseas Union Bank _ are expected to follow.
	   Singapore's three-month interbank rates have plunged to near
three-year lows of 2 percent, pulling down the prime lending rate
in the process, market observers said.
	   Local banks usually adjust their prime rate when it exceeds the
interbank rate by 2 to 3 percentage points.
	   In early October, the major local banks lowered their prime
rates by a quarter percentage point to 7 percent, following an
identical cut in early September.
	   The gradual lowering of lending rates is expected to aid
businesses in need of capital and ease homeowners' mortgage
payments, which had risen to relatively high levels during the
economic crisis.
	   Mounting global pressure for lower interest rates and faltering
domestic demand for loans will continue to put pressure on
Singapore's prime lending rate, said analysts.

Gucci ex-wife pleads naivete as murder trial draws to end
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with final statements &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of slain fashion heir Maurizio
Gucci made a final plea of innocence Tuesday before a packed
courtroom, saying she was naive and involved in his murder against
her will.
	   A verdict from the panel of two judges and five citizens is
expected later in the day.
	   Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli is accused of murdering her
ex-husband to gain control of his fortune. The prosecution has
asked for the maximum sentence in Italy: life imprisonment.
	   Also on trial for murder are her longtime psychic adviser,
Giuseppina Auriemma, the doorman of a seedy hotel, a debt-ridden
pizzeria owner accused of pulling the trigger, and an unemployed
auto worker accused of driving the getaway car.
	   All but Gucci's ex-wife and the pizzeria owner have confessed.
	   Gucci, 46, was shot to death March 27, 1995, outside his Milan
office. He was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of the fashion
company known for its leather goods and double ``G'' logo.
	   Maurizio Gucci was the last Gucci to hold a stake in the
company, but he sold out for dlrs 120 million in 1993 after a long
history of family discord.
	   With its sordid courtroom revelations about greed, betrayal and
shameless social climbing, the five-month trial has aired a seamy
side of Milan, the chic capital of Italy's fashion industry.
	   Prosecution witnesses testified that Reggiani Martinelli wasn't
satisfied with her dlrs 860,000 a year in alimony and wanted all of
her ex-husband's money.
	   Pale and drawn, Reggiani Martinelli pointed her finger Tuesday
at Auriemma, whom she says arranged the murder, then blackmailed
her for dlrs 375,000.
	   ``I have been naive to the point of stupidity,'' she told a
packed courtroom that included her son and mother. ``I found myself
involved against my will. I deny categorically that I was an
accomplice.''
	   The once-glamorous Reggiani Martinelli said Auriemma, a
Neapolitan of humble origins, used her to satisfy an obsessive
hunger for money and power.
	   ``Never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken coop. Sooner
or later it will get hungry,'' she said.
	   Reggiani Martinelli, 50, has admitted threatening Gucci and
repeatedly seeking someone to kill him, but says she never went
through with the plan.
	   Auriemma has admitted arranging Gucci's murder but testified
that she did it at Reggiani Martinelli's behest. She made no final
statement Tuesday.
	   The driver of the getaway car, Orazio Cicala, and hotel doorman
Ivano Savioni, who acted as a go-between, both made public pleas
for forgiveness. Alleged triggerman Benedetto Ceraulo again
maintained his innocence.
	   ``I've reflected a lot over these long months,'' Savioni told
the court. ``I know that I face many long years in prison for what
I've done. I ask the pardon of Gucci's children and am horrified
that things went so much father than I intended.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the latest disruption of the new Mideast
peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday
postponed a Cabinet meeting during which the accord was to have
been ratified.
	   Netanyahu said he ordered the delay because the Palestinians
have not submitted a complete blueprint for fighting terrorism, but
would not say what was missing from the security plan.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai later explained that Israel
is holding out for a list of 30 wanted Palestinians the Palestinian
Authority has promised to arrest as part of the peace agreement.
Israel also wants a timetable for the arrests, Mordechai said.
	   Implementation of the 12-week land-for-security agreement cannot
begin until it has been approved by Israel's Cabinet and the
parliament. The original startup date for the agreement was Monday.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily to Netanyahu's decision to
postpone the Cabinet meeting, which was initially was scheduled for
1 p.m. (1100 gmt) Tuesday.
	   ``Instead of playing these sorry political games, he (Netanyahu)
should just stand up and say ... I won't implement what I have
signed,'' said Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu would try to work out the problem in
a telephone call to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Netanyahu
adviser David Bar-Illan said he hoped the dispute could be resolved
quickly and that the Americans were in touch with the Israelis.
	   The Palestinians have said they have handed a security work plan
to the United States, as required. The United States has promised
to brief Israel on the plan, but not present it as a document.
	   Netanyahu appeared to be contradicting the Clinton
administration when he said Tuesday that the Palestinians had not
delivered everything they had promised.
	   James Rubin, the U.S. State Department spokesman, said Monday
that ``the necessary plans were provided on time, prior to entry
into force (of the agreement).''
	   The approval of the peace agreement in Israel's Cabinet does not
appear to be a certainty, with at least six of the 18 Cabinet
ministers reportedly undecided and three opposed to the plan.
	   In hopes of broadening support, Netanyahu on Monday released
four U.S. letters of guarantees to Israel.
	   In one letter, the United States addresses a key Israeli
concern, Arafat's plan to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state
in May, the end of the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy.
	   In the letter, U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker says the United
States opposes such an act, though he doesn't say whether
Washington would eventually recognize such a Palestinian entity.
	   The Palestinians, in turn, were assured that in disputes with
Israel over implementation, U.S. officials would ``vouch for'' the
Palestinians publicly whenever appropriate, said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   The latest crisis came only a day after Netanyahu and Arafat
overcame another hurdle in a rare show of good will.
	   On Monday, the day the peace accord was to go into effect,
Arafat agreed to a request by Netanyahu to delay the start for
several days so the agreement could be approved by the Cabinet and
the Knesset. The Knesset vote to be held on Nov. 12.
	   Netanyahu, in turn, told Arafat that despite the delay he would
do his best to carry out the first Israeli troop pullback in the
West Bank on or around Nov. 16, the original date stipulated in the
agreement.
	   In a related development, a leader of the Islamic militant group
Hamas said Tuesday that more than 300 activists have been rounded
up by Palestinian security forces since last week's suicide attack
on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip.
	   Earlier this week, Palestinian security official said they had
arrested more than 100 suspected Islamic militants, but have
refused to update the figure since then.
	   Hamas spokesman Mahmoud Zahar was released Tuesday after several
days in detention, but Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin remained
under house arrest, Palestinian security officials said.
	   A senior Arafat aide, meanwhile, said Palestinian security
agents have foiled Iranian-backed attempts by Hamas to assassinate
Arafat and senior Palestinian Authority officials.
	   Iran is training and funding a secret Hamas group to carry out
the assassinations as well as suicide bombings in Israel, said
Tayyeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of the Palestinian
Authority.
	   Last week, Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, attacked
Arafat during a sermon, calling him a traitor for signing the
latest peace agreement with Israel.

Kyrgyzstan sends arms destined for Afghanistan back to Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan has sent 17
train cars filled with weapons and headed to Afghanistan back to
Iran, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Customs officials in the southern Kyrgyz town of Osh discovered
the arms, disguised as humanitarian cargo, after realizing that the
accompanying documents had been forged, the Interfax news agency
reported, citing the Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry.
	   Officials said the arms and ammunition were going to factions
fighting against the Taliban militia, which controls most of
Afghanistan.
	   A similar incident was reported Oct. 9, when Kyrgyzstan customs
officials seized 700 tons of ammunition said to be on its way to
Afghanistan from Iran.
	   Kyrgyzstan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia
fear an influx of refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, and
possibly a spillover of fighting that has wracked that country.
	   Iran, meanwhile, has been at odds with the Taliban since they
took control of the Afghan capital in 1996.

Taipei mayor denies charges as campaign grows nastier

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ With his re-election campaign growing
increasingly nasty, Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian's supporters lashed
out Tuesday against accusations that he made frequent illicit
visits to the gambling enclave of Macau.
	   City council deputy Lin Jui-tu's charges that Chen flew secretly
to Macau by helicopter during stopovers in Hong Kong were
``ridiculous in the extreme,'' Chen spokesman Luo Wen-jia told
reporters, minutes after Lin restated his claims at a news
conference.
	   Lin, a former Chen supporter who has since fallen out with the
mayor, promised to produce ``official'' information that would
prove his claims by the end of November, just before the Dec. 5
elections. However, Lin declined to renew earlier accusations that
Chen had gambled and visited prostitutes while in Macau.
	   Chen's main opponent, Ma Ying-jeou of the Nationalists, denied
any involvement with Lin, and accused Chen of adopting a double
standard on such personal attacks.
	   ``If Mayor Chen doesn't want people insulting him, then he
shouldn't go around freely insulting others,'' Ma told reporters.
	   Chen did not respond to the accusations in person, but earlier
denied ever visiting Macau.
	   Chen's private life is particularly sensitive because his wife,
Wu Shu-chen, was paralyzed from the waist down in what was widely
considered a politically motivated attack. Respect for Wu and
Chen's apparent devotion to her boosted his standing among some
voters otherwise repelled by his sometimes abrasive style.
	   That support could dry up if Lin's accusations manage to plant
doubts among voters about Chen's integrity, said Pang Chien-kuo, a
city council deputy for the opposition New Party.
	   But Sisy Chen, a former spokeswoman for Chen's party, the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, said few voters would
believe the accusations, which she labeled ``toilet talk.''
	   ``Public lives of public figures are targets of negative
campaigning. Chen should call for a reflection on our worsening
election culture,'' said Sisy Chen, who is not related to the
mayor.
	   Chen is lagging at the polls and has shown himself to be more
vulnerable than widely thought before the campaign began. The sides
have exchanged accusations ranging from spying for China to
extortion and visiting brothels, forcing the resignation of one top
Chen adviser.
	   The Taipei race is the most prominent election in year-end polls
for the national legislature and the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung
cities and their councils.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Shuttle diplomacy in Kosovo entered
another round on Tuesday with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill traveling
to the provincial capital of Pristina to talk with representatives
of the ethnic Albanian majority.
	   Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch on Monday
after arriving from the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has led international
efforts to find a political solution for the secessionist Serbian
province.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
more have been forced from their homes since February, when Serb
authorities launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants in
the southern Serbian province where ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1. Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Also Tuesday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft was
meeting in Belgrade with Yugoslav government officials and
representatives of media organizations that were banned under a
harsh new media law.
	   Last week, Taft visited refugees in Kosovo to assess the
humanitarian situation.
	   The number of people camped out in the open has dropped
considerably since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pulled his
troops out of the province last week, said Jacques Franquin, a
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva.
	   Franquin said the number of people living in the open is
estimated to be a few hundred, but cautioned that the numbers are
very approximate, as many people have not returned to their own
homes, but are staying in villages with neighbors and relatives.
	   As part of an Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to order
troops back to their barracks and dismantle police barricades,
allowing people to return home in safety.
	   But on Tuesday a regional command of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army claimed that Serb forces have not been withdrawing from their
checkpoints in the west of the province.
	   In a statement faxed to the ethnic Albanian media, a KLA
regional command statement claimed that Serb forces have re-grouped
and re-located to positions farther off the main roads. It also
said the Serbs were harassing and shooting at ethnic Albanians
trying to return to their villages.
	   ``If provocations, attacks and murder of civilians continue, the
(KLA) will be forced to take defensive measures,'' said the
statement.
	   The KLA statement also claimed Serb police buried nine ethnic
Albanians in the border town of Junik on Monday. The Albanians were
reportedly killed recently in border clashes.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed and there
was no immediate response from the Serb side.
	   Serbian sources in the province reported Tuesday that the KLA
attacked an ethnic Albanian family overnight for ``its known
loyalty to Serbia.''
	   According to testimony from the Sopa family, four uniformed KLA
members riddled their home with bullets. The head of the family,
Fehmi Sopa, was in a coma in a Pristina hospital, said the Serbian
Media Center. The family lives in the village of Malo Gracko, 20
kilometers (13 miles) south of Pristina.

India's international carrier seeks government bail-out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's state-controlled international
carrier asked for a 10-billion-rupee (dlrs 238 million) government
bail-out Tuesday as well as official help finding a private
investor to pour in another 7.7 billion rupees (dlrs 183 billion),
Press Trust of India reported.
	   ``This is the only possible way in which Air India could improve
its economic position and come out of the red,'' the airline's
managing director, Michael Mascarenhas, was quoted as saying.
	   Mascarenhas blamed the airline's losses, estimated at 1.47
billion rupees (dlrs 35 million) in the quarter ending in August,
on high wage bills and other ``non-operating'' costs.
	   India's civil aviation minister announced last month that the
government would sell stock in Air India as well as its domestic
carrier Indian Airlines, both of which have been losing money.

China rejects talk of Dalai Lama visit, but says channels open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Tuesday rejected a possible pilgrimage
by the Dalai Lama to a famous Buddhist retreat and seemed skeptical
about a speech the exiled Tibetan leader is expected to give in the
United States.
	   Aides to the Dalai Lama have said he will respond to Chinese
overtures for negotiations some time during his four-day stay in
Washington, which starts Saturday.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao reiterated
Tuesday that China and the Dalai Lama have ``channels for contacts
and the door for negotiations is always open.''
	   He repeated Beijing's conditions for talks: an end by the Dalai
Lama to perceived support for separatism in Tibet and a statement
that the Chinese-ruled Himalayan region is part of a China united
under Beijing's control.
	   In response to a reporter's question, he denied reported plans
to allow the Dalai Lama to visit Wutai, a sacred Buddhist mountain
in northern China, and then travel to Beijing for talks with
Chinese leaders. It would be his first visit to China since fleeing
Tibet amid a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959.
	   Talks through intermediaries were restarted 20 years ago but
foundered as unrest flared inside Tibet in the late 1980s.
	   It is unclear how far the Dalai Lama will have to go to satisfy
Beijing and in what venue. The Dalai Lama has long said he supports
genuine autonomy, not independence for Tibet.
	   China has also expressed anger at the Dalai Lama's speeches and
travels abroad and the world scrutiny they have drawn to China's
often harsh 49-year rule of Tibet.
	   ``The contacts and talks between the central government and the
Dalai Lama are entirely an internal affair of China,'' Zhu said at
a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   ``The problem now is the Dalai Lama should not continue to
create an international clamor,'' Zhu said. ``He should do some
concrete deeds to show that he has changed his mind and does not
propose the independence of Tibet.''

China hopes APEC will increase technical sharing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China expressed hope Tuesday that Asian and
Pacific economies will agree to increased sharing of scientific and
economic expertise at an upcoming summit meeting.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin will attend the gathering of
regional leaders at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Malaysia on Nov. 17-18, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
announced Tuesday.
	   Zhu noted that the meeting comes amid a deepening of the
financial turmoil that has roiled the region for 16 months. He
added that the summit will be a good chance to find ways to
``overcome the crisis, restore economic growth and strengthen the
international financial system.''
	   ``APEC is the most important organization for regional economic
cooperation and should play a role in solving this urgent and
important issue in the region,'' Zhu said.
	   ``We also hope that an APEC agenda for science and technology
cooperation will be signed and implemented in real earnest,'' he
said at a twice-weekly media briefing.
	   Although Zhu provided no details of the pact, China for years
has pressed the wealthier members in APEC to provide greater access
to scientific and technical know-how to the less-developed
partners.
	   APEC's 21 members include economic powerhouses like the United
States and struggling countries like Indonesia.

Israeli suspect in killing of Palestinian turns himself in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli man suspected of bludgeoning to
death an elderly Palestinian farmer in the West Bank was ordered
held for six days after surrendering to authorities, police said
Tuesday.
	   The suspect, Gur Hamel, had been on the run since the killing of
Mohammed Zalout, whose body was found Oct. 26 near the Jewish
settlement of Itamar where Gur lived from time to time.
	   Israeli radio reports have quoted Itamar settlers as saying that
Hamel was an extremist whose request to become a permanent resident
of Itamar was turned down.
	   On Monday, Hamel surrendered to Israeli police, with legislator
Benny Elon of the far-right Moledet Party serving as mediator.
	   A magistrate ordered Hamel held for six days for questioning and
to reconstruct the killing, police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said.

	   ECHALLENS, Switzerland (AP) _ A retired schoolteacher aged 105
received an order to attend elementary school when a computer cut a
century off his age, a local official said Tuesday.
	   The mix-up occurred because a list of local inhabitants
delivered to education authorities contained only the last two
figures of his date of birth, Echallens town hall secretary Roland
Dougoud said.
	   Born in 1893, the man earlier this year joined 65 local
five-year-olds in receiving a letter ordering him to start
schooling.
	   ``We have changed the computer program in question,'' Dougoud
said.
	   Millions of computer around the world must be reprogrammed to
recognize the year 2000. Normally, they read only a year's last two
digits, which could make them assume it is 1900.
	   Experts disagree on whether the glitch represents a looming
disaster or a temporary annoyance. But they say it has potential to
play havoc with computer systems.

Croatia to institute drug tests in soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Mandatory drug tests will be introduced
in the Croatian soccer league starting next week, the national
federation said Tuesday.
	   The decision follows the controversy that arose when two Croatia
Zagreb players refused to undergo doping controls last weekend.
	   Mark Viduka and Tomislav Butina refused to submit to the tests
after their club's 1-1 tie against Hajduk Split. Two Hajduk players
were tested.
	   The tests were ordered by Ante Vrdoljak, head of Croatia's
Olympic Committee. He said the match should be annulled and the
game awarded to Hajduk because of the refusal by Zagreb players to
be tested.
	   But Zlatko Canjuga, executive director of Zagreb, said he team's
management just wanted ``to protect'' the players.
	   ``The aim was not to avoid the doping control, but the
introduction of doping control should be prepared, it takes some
time,'' he said.
	   Canjuga, a high-ranking member of President Franjo Tudjman's
ruling party, accused Vrdoljak of trying to ``push his way into
soccer.''
	   Some papers speculated the controversy stemmed from long-term
animosity between Canjuga and Vrdoljak.
	   The national soccer federation said in a statement Tuesday that
only the federation has the authority to institute doping controls,
not the Olympic Committee.
	   ``The doping control is already envisaged by our statutes, as it
is the requirement of UEFA and FIFA,'' the statement said. ``We did
ask our medical teams to work on the procedure for carrying out
doping controls and we expect to see it done by next Monday.''
	   ``We did not expect that we would come into the timing
discrepancy with the Olympic Committee's decision,'' the statement
said, adding that the different timing led to ``this
misunderstanding.''
	   ``We are sorry for that, but such a thing would not be repeated
because the doping control will be regulated by us as of Monday.''

Chechen leader claims Russian financier paid ransom for hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Interior Minister comments in new grafs 6-8. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov claimed a
prominent Russian financier has been paying large ransoms to win
the release of hostages held in the breakaway territory, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   Boris Berezovsky, one of Russia's wealthiest and most
controversial businessmen, has claimed credit for freeing a number
of hostages held in Chechnya, including the recent release of an
British couple held for more than a year. But he has never
acknowledged paying ransoms.
	   ``In circumvention of the Chechen government, he comes with
suitcases full of money and heaps of computers and bails out the
captives,'' Maskhadov said in an interview with the Komsomolskaya
Pravda newspaper published Tuesday. ``This only stimulates the
appetites of gangsters and discredits my nation.''
	   Whenever hostages are released, there are rumors about possible
ransom payments, but the parties involved rarely provide details.
	   Berezovsky has said that he and others have been sending
humanitarian and medical aid, computers and school textbooks to
Chechnya, and in return, senior Chechen officials have put more
emphasis on identifying and locating kidnappers.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin praised
Berezovsky for his help in winning the release of hostages in
Chechnya, and said no ransom had been paid for 55 Russian soldiers
who have been freed from Chechnya in recent months.
	   The soldiers were taken during the 1994-6 war between Russia and
Chechnya, and in some cases, were abducted by Chechens from
neighboring regions after the war.
	   Stepashin said that Russian and Chechen police agreed to
cooperate in combating kidnappings. Previous such agreements have
failed to halt the kidnappings.
	   Ruslan Aushev, the president of Ingushetia, a region bordering
Chechnya, said hostage takers were receiving material rewards for
freeing their captives. Aushev said Maskhadov's opponents in
Chechnya, such as renegade warlord Salman Raduyev, were the main
beneficiaries.
	   Hostages are ``exchanged for computers, with which Raduyev's
residence is now crammed,'' Aushev told the newspaper. Raduyev ``is
now better equipped than some Russian special services.''
	   Chechnya has seen an explosion of violence and kidnappings for
ransom since its 1994-1996 independence war with Russia. About 100
people are still held, including three Britons, a New Zealander and
a Turk.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since the end of the
war, but no country has recognized its independence claim. Moscow
insists the territory remains part of Russia.

Gucci ex-wife pleads naivete as murder trial draws to end
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of slain fashion heir Maurizio
Gucci made a final plea of innocence Tuesday before a packed
courtroom, saying she was naive and involved in his murder against
her will.
	   A verdict from the panel of two judges and five citizens is
expected later in the day.
	   Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli is accused of murdering her
ex-husband to gain control of his fortune. The prosecution has
asked for the maximum sentence in Italy: life imprisonment.
	   Also on trial for murder are her longtime psychic adviser,
Giuseppina Auriemma, the doorman of a seedy hotel, a debt-ridden
pizzeria owner accused of pulling the trigger, and an unemployed
auto worker accused of driving the getaway car.
	   All but Gucci's ex-wife and the pizzeria owner have confessed.
	   Gucci, 46, was shot to death March 27, 1995, outside his Milan
office. He was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of the fashion
company known for its leather goods and double ``G'' logo.
	   Maurizio Gucci was the last Gucci to hold a stake in the
company, but he sold out for dlrs 120 million in 1993 after a long
history of family discord.
	   With its sordid courtroom revelations about greed, betrayal and
shameless social climbing, the five-month trial has aired a seamy
side of Milan, the chic capital of Italy's fashion industry.
	   Prosecution witnesses testified that Reggiani Martinelli wasn't
satisfied with her dlrs 860,000 a year in alimony and wanted all of
her ex-husband's money.
	   Pale and drawn, Reggiani Martinelli pointed her finger Tuesday
at Auriemma, whom she says arranged the murder, then blackmailed
her for dlrs 375,000.
	   ``I have been naive to the point of stupidity,'' she told a
packed courtroom that included her son and mother. ``I found myself
involved against my will. I deny categorically that I was an
accomplice.''
	   The once-glamorous Reggiani Martinelli said Auriemma, a
Neapolitan of humble origins, used her to satisfy an obsessive
hunger for money and power.
	   ``Never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken coop. Sooner
or later it will get hungry,'' she said.
	   Reggiani Martinelli, 50, has admitted threatening Gucci and
repeatedly seeking someone to kill him, but says she never went
through with the plan.
	   Auriemma has admitted arranging Gucci's murder but testified
that she did it at Reggiani Martinelli's behest. She made no final
statement Tuesday.
	   The driver of the getaway car, Orazio Cicala, and hotel doorman
Ivano Savioni, who acted as a go-between, both made public pleas
for forgiveness. Alleged triggerman Benedetto Ceraulo again
maintained his innocence.
	   ``I've reflected a lot over these long months,'' Savioni told
the court. ``I know that I face many long years in prison for what
I've done. I ask the pardon of Gucci's children and am horrified
that things went so much farther than I intended.''

Estrada disappointed over barring of Philippine lawmakers in Anwar

trial &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar's Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Tuesday
he was disappointed that Filipino lawmakers were barred from
observing the trial of Malaysian dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Estrada was the first Asian leader to express concern over the
treatment of Anwar, whom he considers a personal friend.
	   Three Filipino congressmen who had fought the late dictator
Ferdinand Marcos were not allowed to enter the courtroom when the
trial of the sacked deputy prime minister opened Monday in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   ``Of course it's quite disappointing,'' Estrada told reporters
asking his reaction. ``But unfortunately, we cannot interfere with
the domestic problems of other countries. They have their own sets
of rules and regulations, so we cannot in any way interfere.''
	   Malaysian Judge Augustine Paul has ruled that international
observers would not be given special observer status and could
watch the trial on a first-come, first-serve basis.
	   ``There is no reason to let foreigners check us,'' he said.
	   Estrada and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, who also
expressed support for Anwar, said they would jointly write
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to ask him to hold Anwar
under house arrest rather than in jail.
	   Estrada also has said he will express his concern for Anwar when
he meets Mahathir later this month during a summit of Asia-Pacific
leaders in Malaysia.
	   ``There is no such thing as an independent court under a
dictatorship,'' the independent newspaper Today said in an
editorial Tuesday.
	   ``Thousands of Malaysians and hundreds of foreigners called
Mahathir's bluff yesterday, and it was the prime minister who
clearly lost in his own deal. As skeptics won even more
credibility, the initial actions of Malaysian officials _ those in
the judiciary included _ did not inspire confidence, and can only
warrant even more scrutiny in the days to come,'' it said.
	   Senate President Pro Tempore Blas Ople said he had kept an open
mind about the quality of justice in Malaysia before the court
decided to bar foreign observers.
	   ``The court decision to bar foreign observers can only mean that
the court is blindly following orders from political authorities,
and is therefore incapacitated from judging the case fairly and
objectively,'' he said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mostly higher
Tuesday, with share prices surging in Hong Kong and Manila on the
back of overnight gains on Wall Street. Japanese financial markets
were closed for Culture Day, a national holiday. Hong Kong's Hang
Seng Index, rose 188.44 points, or 1.9 percent, closing at
10,358.52. Brokers said investors have become increasingly
optimistic about Hong Kong's economy since a rebound in the
property market and a stabilization of interest rates. Philippine
shares soared on the back of a strong peso. The 30-share Philippine
Stock Exchange Index rose 46.60 points, or 2.7 percent, to
1,801.64. Tuesday's advance brought the total gain of the index to
333.95 points, or 23 percent, since Oct. 21. In currency trading,
the dollar averaged 39.907 pesos, down from Friday's average of
40.398. Indonesian shares also soared on expectations that the
government may further cut interest rates this week. (ASIAN
MARKETS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Japan will give Indonesia 4.45 billion
yen (38.6 million dollars) to help the poor and boost food
production, Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said Tuesday.
Komura announced the aid at a signing ceremony with his Indonesian
counterpart, Ali Alatas, at the foreign ministry in Jakarta, the
Indonesian capital. Indonesia has been hit hard by the economic
turmoil that has battered many Asian countries. Millions of
Indonesians have lost their jobs and economic hardship from rising
prices set off riots that helped oust President Suharto in May.
Indonesia is now implementing democratic reforms and is overhauling
its economy in line with a multibillion dollar rescue package set
up by the International Monetary Fund. Japan is participating in
the bailout. ``Japan is determined to support Indonesia,'' Komura
said. (INDONESIA-JAPAN)
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's state-controlled international
carrier asked for a 10-billion-rupee (dlrs 238 million) government
bailout Tuesday as well as official help finding a private investor
to pour in another 7.7 billion rupees (dlrs 183 billion), Press
Trust of India reported. The airline's managing director, Michael
Mascarenhas, blamed the airline's losses, estimated at 1.47 billion
rupees (dlrs 35 million) in the quarter ending in August, on high
wage bills and other ``non-operating'' costs. India's civil
aviation minister announced last month that the government would
sell stock in Air India as well as its domestic carrier Indian
Airlines, both of which have been losing money. (INDIA-TROUBLED

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch telecommunications giant
Royal KPN NV said Tuesday that it will eliminate 3,000 jobs as part
of a cost-cutting restructuring program. KPN said the
reorganization, which was announced in April and will cost 800
million guilders (dlrs 427.8 million) this year, is meant to
enhance its efficiency. The company will cut 4,000 jobs in the
coming three years but also will create 1,000 new positions in
growth sectors such as Internet activities and mobile telephone and
information technology. KPN said the deepest cuts will be made in
the fields of fixed network operations, construction and
maintenance, at directory inquiries and in its installation
business. (NETHERLANDS-TELECOM LAYOFFS)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund has
approved the release of dlrs 280 million to the Philippines from a
dlrs 1.3 billion precautionary loan arrangement, the Philippine
central bank said Tuesday. Central Bank Managing Director Amando
Tetangco said approval came Friday, and that the central bank
expects to be able to draw the dlrs 280 million this week. It will
be used to increase the central bank's foreign currency reserves _
dlrs 10.6 billion at the end of September, Tetangco said. He said
the IMF funds should help boost the Philippine peso, which broke
through the 40 peso-per-dollar level Tuesday to set a new
four-month high. Tetangco attributed the peso's appreciation to
strong dollar inflows from foreign direct investors, stock
investors and Filipinos working overseas. (PHILIPPINES-IMF)

U.S. Congo peace envoys kept waiting to see Mugabe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Senior American diplomats, on a mission
to seek a cease-fire in the Congo war, were kept waiting for
several hours Tuesday for a meeting with Zimbabwe President Robert
Mugabe.
	   Mugabe, seen as a main belligerent in fighting has that already
embroiled troops from as many as eight countries and threatens to
escalate, was instead chairing a regular Cabinet meeting, U.S.
officials said.
	   President Bill Clinton's top Africa official, Susan Rice,
arrived in Harare late Monday on a seven-nation Africa trip aimed
at ending hostilities in Congo. Zimbabwe has deployed 6,000 troops
in the vast, mineral-rich country to support Congo President
Laurent Kabila against rebels. Angola and Namibia have also sent
troops to aid Kabila.
	   U.S. officials said that by early afternoon, Rice was still
waiting for notice when Mugabe would be available.
	   Rice's mission has so far also taken her to Angola, Congo and
Zambia, but it appeared to have made little progress.
	   Kabila and Mugabe have sharply criticized U.S. efforts to broker
a Congo peace agreement, arguing that Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
deployed troops to repel an invasion by rebels backed by Rwandan
and Ugandan troops.
	   Mugabe has described U.S. calls for the withdrawal of all
foreign troops from Congo as ``absolutely abominable'' and demanded
Rwanda and Uganda withdraw first, saying that would lead to the
collapse of the rebel campaign and bring peace.
	   Rwanda's refusal to publicly admit having troops in Congo has
been cited by Kabila and his allies as a major stumbling block to
peace in Congo. Kabila says he cannot negotiate with the rebels who
are puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. The rebels say only direct
negotiations with Kabila can end war.
	   Uganda acknowledges it has troops in Congo, but says they are
there to strike at Congo-based Ugandan rebels.
	   Mugabe announced Sunday an allied offensive on rebel strongholds
in eastern Congo was making gains and would ``clear the enemy''
from Congolese territory.
	   Rice, met on arrival Monday by low-ranking Zimbabwe officials,
said she wanted to meet with Mugabe and ``hear his thoughts'' on
the fighting.
	   The U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs was
expected to leave late Tuesday for Rwanda and hold talks there with
President Pasteur Bizimungu and Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, who is the
vice president, minister of defense and the chief architect of
Rwanda's policy in Congo.
	   Rice, accompanied by Clinton's special assistant, Gayle Smith
and his special envoy to the Great Lakes region, Howard Wolpe, is
scheduled to travel Wednesday to Entebbe airport in Uganda, to meet
with officials of that country.
	   The three-month rebellion by ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members
of Congolese army and opposition politicians has sucked in many of
Congo's neighbors.
	   In August, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia pushed the rebels away
from Congo's capital, Kinshasa, in the western side of the nation.
Since then, the rebels have rebounded, making steady gains from
their eastern strongholds against copper-rich southern Katanga
Province and Mbuji-Mayi, capital of diamond-rich Eastern Kasai.
	   Rwanda, which backs the rebels with troops and arms, accuses
Kabila of anti-Tutsi hatred and failing to rid the common border of
former Hutu soldiers and militiamen responsible for the 1994
genocide of 500,000 people in Rwanda.
	   The slaughter ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in July
1994, but Hutu
	   rebels continued to use eastern Congo to regroup and launch
cross-border attacks into Rwanda.
	   The rebels said Monday they had repelled an attack at Kabalo,
600 kilometers (375 miles) southwest of Rwandan border, but gave no
details. Fighting was also reported around rebel-held Kalemie on
Lake Tanganyika.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ With floodwaters receding and
communications improving, Central Americans are discovering
Hurricane Mitch's devastation: officials estimated about 7,000 had
died in the region. The greatest losses were reported in Honduras,
where an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 _ 10 percent of
the population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's
storm. Countless more were lacking fresh water, food and medicine.
President Carlos Flores Facusse noted that floods and landslides
erased from the map entire villages and appealed for international
help. ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin
in all of the national territory,'' he said Monday. In neighboring
Nicaragua, the death toll was also high. Official preliminary
figures showed 1,330 dead and 1,903 missing nationwide. As many as
1,500 people may have died in mudslides when the crater lake of the
Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud and debris onto
villages below. (MITCH)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Hope for a big victory by either major
American party appeared unlikely as Republicans and Democrats
wrapped up campaigns for Tuesday's elections. At stake was control
of Congress, three dozen state governorships and hundreds of lesser
offices. President Bill Clinton campaigned right up to the last day
for Democrats, hoping to keep Republicans from strengthening their
hold on the House and Senate, as well as their control of the
impeachment process that threatens his six-year presidency. ``This
is not an ordinary time and thus it is not an ordinary election,''
Clinton said in a White House speech. In a series of interviews and
appearances, he appealed to traditionally Democratic black and
Hispanic voters to go to the polls. House Speaker Newt Gingrich was
campaigning at home in Georgia after a year of traveling to 48
states for fellow Republicans. His own seat was secure, but his
future as a leader could depend on the national totals.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first witness in the
corruption and sexual misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim said
Tuesday the ousted deputy prime minister asked Malaysian police to
tamper with evidence showing he had committed adultery and sodomy.
Mohamed Said Awang, former chief of the country's top police unit,
the Special Branch, was the first of 52 prosecution witnesses
expected to take the stand in the government case against the
jailed dissident. Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five
counts of illegal sex acts. He denies the charges and says they
were cooked up to undermine his growing challenge to the 17-year
leadership of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. While under
investigation, Anwar got police officers to force retractions by
the a personal driver and the wife of his private secretary who
wrote statements accusing him of illegal sex acts, prosecutors
said. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR TRIAL)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq stepped up its rhetoric against the
United States on Tuesday, with a state-run newspaper urging the
country to prepare to battle ``the U.S. monster'' regardless of the
sacrifices. Iraq was certain that the battle over the inspections
would end in ``victory'' for Baghdad and ``humiliation'' for the
United States, the Al-Iraq daily said in a front-page editorial.
The oratory followed a weekend announcement that Iraq was halting
the work of U.N. weapons inspectors, in essence breaking ties with
the group responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. But it has continued to let nuclear monitors work, and
has let technical teams ensure that U.N. equipment continues to
function. Iraq accuses the United States and Britain of working to
prolong the sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. (IRAQ-UN)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A row over the contents of a Palestinian
plan to fight terrorism may stall Israeli government approval
Tuesday of the latest Mideast accord. In a new disruption, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he will not present the
new Mideast peace agreement to his Cabinet for approval until the
Palestinians have submitted a complete blueprint for fighting
terrorism. Netanyahu's announcement came just three hours before
government ministers were to have convened to discuss the 12-week
land-for-security agreement that is already a day behind schedule.
Implementation cannot begin until the agreement has been approved
by Israel's Cabinet and the parliament. The Palestinians reacted
angrily to Netanyahu's ultimatum. The Palestinians have said they
have handed a security work plan to the United States, as required.
The United States has promised to brief Israel on the plan, but not
present it as a document. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)

Millennium bug gets 105-year-old man summons to school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ECHALLENS, Switzerland (AP) _ A retired Swiss schoolteacher,
aged 105, received an order to attend elementary school when a
computer cut a century off his age, a local official said Tuesday.
	   The mix-up occurred because a list of local inhabitants
delivered to education authorities contained only the last two
figures of his date of birth, Echallens town hall secretary Roland
Dougoud said.
	   The man, born in 1893, and 65 local 5-year-olds all received a
letter earlier this year ordering them to start school.
	   ``We have changed the computer program in question,'' Dougoud
said.
	   Millions of computer around the world must be reprogrammed to
recognize the year 2000. Normally, they read only a year's last two
digits, which could make them assume it is 1900.
	   Experts disagree on whether the glitch represents a looming
disaster or a temporary annoyance. But they say it has potential to
play havoc with computer systems.

German aiming to show best arts to Britain, keyed to state visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Germany's embassy has launched a cultural
offensive to show off the best of German arts to Britain, keyed to
a forthcoming state visit by President Roman Herzog.
	   A program of more than 50 events called the ``German Season,''
which started last month and will run through January, encompasses
musicians, dancers, singers, writers, filmmakers, artists,
photographers and academic lecturers.
	   Highlights are visits from the Pina Bausch Dance Company of
Wuppertal and the Frankfurt Ballet.
	   Renaissance German scientific instruments will be exhibited at
the British Museum, while the British Library will display books
demonstrating centuries of Britain-Germany cultural ties.
	   The president's wife, Christiane Herzog, is organizing a fashion
show of German clothes worn by German models, and German star Boris
Becker will play an exhibition tennis match, perhaps against Greg
Rusedski or Tim Henman.
	   The Herzogs will be guests of Queen Elizabeth II and stay at
Windsor Castle during the Dec. 1-4 visit.
	   ``The state visit is the first by a German president for 12
years and provides us with an opportunity to draw attention to
German arts,'' ambassador Gebhardt von Moltke said.
	   ``One German concert in the rich London music scene wouldn't
have much notice taken of it, but many concerts would certainly
draw many different people,'' he said. ``There was a festival of
German culture in London in the early 1980s, but I think this
program is more elaborate and the first time the embassy has
combined things.''
	   At the Imperial War Museum, Herzog will open a 50th anniversary
exhibition about the Berlin Air Lift, when the Western Allies kept
the city supplied through a Soviet blockade for nearly a year.
	   German officials are keen to develop good relations with Britain
because of the legacy of distrust after two world wars.

French pork producers to receive government aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Hoping to head off more protests, the French
government said Tuesday it would provide 150 million francs (dlrs
27 million) in extra aid to French pork producers.
	   With the price of pork at 5.17 francs (95 cents) a kilo (2.2
pounds), a package of three thick pork chops can be easily had at a
French grocery store for about 9 francs (dlrs 1.60).
	   Because of falling demand and overproduction, French pork
producers say they can't cover their costs with such low prices and
have been pressuring the government to come to their rescue.
	   The government agreed to give 100 million francs (dlrs 18
million) in September to pig farmers. That wasn't enough, and after
last week's protests, pork producers plan new protests Friday.
	   Protest leaders said Tuesday the nationwide demonstrations would
still be held Friday.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security forces have in
recent months foiled Iranian-backed attempts by Islamic militants
to assassinate Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and senior members
of his government, a senior Arafat aide said Tuesday.
	   Iran is training and funding a secret cell within the Islamic
militant group Hamas to carry out the assassinations and suicide
bombings in Israel, Tayyeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of
the Palestinian Authority, told The Associated Press.
	   ``We arrested several of these people who had plans detailing
the assassinations,'' Abdel Rahim said.
	   The most recent arrest came in October when Palestinian
intelligence agents arrested a Hamas activist, Jamal Natche, in the
West Bank town of Hebron. Natche was given orders by Iran to kill
Arafat, Abdel Rahim said, but did not provide details.
	   As a result of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
agreement, there have been mounting threats against Arafat, both by
Hamas in the Palestinian areas and by radical Muslim leaders
abroad.
	   Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, has called Arafat a
traitor. The leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group in Lebanon,
Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, said Arafat's hands should be chopped off
for signing the agreement.
	   The Hamas military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, warned Arafat of
``the wrath of vengeance'' for his crackdown on Hamas, imposed
after last week's suicide attack by the group on an Israeli convoy.
	   On Monday, the 69-year-old Arafat dismissed the threats with a
wave of his hand. ``It is not the first time and it won't be the
last. I don't care,'' said Arafat, who has survived several
attempts on his life during his decades as Palestinian leader.
	   Israeli media reports said the CIA has given Arafat's security
chiefs, Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan. instructions on how to
deal with the new situation. However, Abdel Rahim said security for
Arafat has not been beefed up in response to the threats.
	   Rajoub would only say that Palestinian security forces,
especially Arafat's bodyguard detail, known as Force 17, is always
alert. Several of Arafat's bodyguards have received training in the
United States.
	   With no designated successor, Arafat's sudden death would create
chaos within Palestinian society. Such a situation would seriously
threaten a already shaky peace process.
	   Iran is an outspoken foe of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords and has close ties to Hamas which has carried out more than
a dozen suicide bombings in Israel, effectively disrupting the
peace process at critical moments.
	   Abdel Rahim said the Palestinian Authority was determined to
stop Iran from meddling in Palestinian affairs. ``We won't allow
Iran to create an Afghanistan in our areas,'' Abdel Rahim said,
referring to the civil war-torn Asian nation.
	   The Palestinian daily Al Quds which is close to the Palestinian
Authority wrote in an editorial that it found Khamenei's attacks on
Arafat ``very shocking.''
	   ``We wished the statements by Khamenei had not been made and we
still hope that the government of Iran will appreciate efforts made
by the Palestinians to maintain good relations with Iran,'' the
newspaper said.

Holland shuts out South Korea in Champions Trophy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ World and Olympic champions Holland shut
out South Korea on Tuesday, brightening their hopes of winning the
20th Champions Trophy in the men's field hockey tournament in
Lahore.
	   Holland is in the lead with nine points after three wins in as
many games.
	   They are firm favorites to clinch the title. South Korea has
four points after three games.
	   Piet Hein Geeris was twice on target, while a goal each came
from the sticks of Teun de Nooijer, Remco van Wijk and Marten
Eikelboom.
	   South Korea _ with a victory over Pakistan and a draw against
Australia in previous matches _ looked strong in the opening
minutes of play but quickly folded.
	   Forwards Kim Jeong Kui and captain Park Shin Heun were smartly
checked by a strong Dutch defense.
	   Jeroen Delmee worked hard from the right flank before he set up
an easy scoring opportunity for Hein Geeris in the 30th minute.
Geeris pushed the ball in the empty goal off a parallel pass.
	   At half time it was 1-0. But six minutes into the second half,
Geeris scored with a powerful hit from the top of the striking
circle which beat South Korean keeper Ku Jin Soo.
	   South Korea missed its scoring chances.
	   Holland's Van Wijk scored off a 48th minute short corner, while
Eikelboom completed the tally with a brilliant field goal in the
69th minute. The Dutch striker, after beating two defenders, scored
from a sharp angle to enhance his team's victory.
	   Result: Holland 5 (Piet Hein Geeris (30th min, 41st min), Teun
de Nooijer (45th min), Remco van Wijk (48th min), Marten Eikelboom
(69th min); South Korea 0.
	   Teams: South Korea: Ku Jin Soo, Kim Young Bae, Hang Beung Kook,
Kim Young Kui, Cho Myung Jun, Jeong Jin Dong, Hong Kyung Seob, Park
Shin Heun (captain), Song Seong Tae, Kang Keon Wook, Jeong Yong
Kyun, Lim Jeong Woo, Kim Jeong Chul, Yoo Moon Ki, Yeo Woon Kon, Ko
Dong Sik.
	   Holland: Bram Lomans, Danny Bree, Erik Jazet, Peter Windi,

Kashima beats Iwata 1-0 to keep lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Brazilian Mazinho kicked in the winning goal as the
Kashima Antlers beat Jubilo Iwata 1-0 Tuesday and widened their
lead in the second stage of the 18-team Japanese professional
soccer league.
	   Kashima, which has won 11 games in a row, has 37 points from 13
victories against two defeats. It is four points ahead of
second-place Iwata, the first stage winner, with two matches left
in the 17-match second stage.
	   Iwata has 33 points from 11 victories against four defeats.
	   Kashima will clinch the second-stage title if it beats Verdy
Kawasaki in the regulation 90 minutes, or if Iwata loses to Kashima
Reysol, in Saturday's matches.
	   The winner of the second stage will meet Iwata, the 1997
J-League champion, for the season's overall championship in matches
Nov. 21 and Nov. 28.
	   Playing before 16,000 spectators at Kashima, Mazinho, or
Waldemar Aureliano de Oliveira Filho, scored the winning goal in
the 43rd minute after Brazilian teammate Bismarck Barreto Faria
took a free kick and Iwata goalkeeper Tomoaki Ogami fumbled the
ball.
	   Iwata, led by Brazilian Dunga, or Carlos Caetano Bledom Verri,
attempted eight shots in the second half, but Kashima defended
well. Iwata had only three shots in the first half.
	   The Yokohama Marinos moved into third place from fifth by edging
the Urawa Reds 3-2 at Mizuho on two last-minute goals _ Shoji Jo's
second of the game, followed seconds later by Akihiro Endo's game
winner.
	   The Shimizu S-Pulse beat Verdy Kawasaki 4-2 in a penalty
shootout after a scoreless tie in the 90-minute regulation time and
two 15-minute extra periods.
	   At Expo '70 Stadium, Takashi Hirano scored three goals, leading
the Nagoya Grampus Eight to a 3-2 victory over Gamba Osaka.
	   In other matches, Consadole Sapporo beat Vissel Kobe 3-0,
Bellmare Hiratsuka beat Kashiwa Reysol 3-1, Kyoto Purple Sanga beat
Cerezo Osaka 2-1, the Yokohama Flugels beat Sanfrecce Hiroshima 2-1
and Avispa Fukuoka beat JEF United Ichihara 2-1.

Ancient Buddha wounded in Afghanistan fighting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ One of Afghanistan's ancient
treasures, a statue of a Buddha, was damaged in fighting between
the Taliban religious army and its Shiite Muslim opponents, say
eyewitnesses who fled the central Afghan valley that is home to the
image.
	   ``A rocket hit the small female Buddha in the face during the
fighting,'' said Abdul Rahim, who reached the Afghan capital from
the central province of Bamyan in September and fled last month to
northwestern Pakistan.
	   The rocket slammed into the Buddha's stone chin, leaving a
gaping hole.
	   Other eyewitnesses, who didn't want to give their names for fear
of retribution by the Taliban, also said recently that the 35-meter
(105-foot) statue was hit in the face and the groin.
	   The statue is one of two giant stone Buddhas that have been
tucked away in the craggy canyons of Afghanistan's Bamyan province
for nearly 2,000 years.
	   The second statue, which at 55 meters (165 feet) looms over the
valley, is said to be the world's tallest standing Buddha.
Residents say the smaller statue is a woman and the taller one, a
man.
	   ''We call her Shah Mama,'' said Rahim. ''Already she had no
face, no eyes, no lips.''
	   Centuries ago, the invading Muslim soldiers who converted the
region to Islam sliced away the faces of the two Buddhas, believing
images were sacrilegious.
	   Some strict Muslims consider images such as statues or
photographs offensive to Islam. In Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, where
a harsh brand of Islam has been imposed, photography is forbidden
and offenders are publicly beaten.
	   Rahim said the damage to the smaller statue took place in
September during a protracted battle for control of the area.
	   Other witnesses said there were two attacks on the smaller
Buddha _ on the face and on the groin.
	   The damage occurred despite an order from the Taliban's
reclusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, who told his soldiers to
protect the 2,000-year-old statues as ancient treasures to be
preserved and out of respect.
	   Two years ago, front-line Taliban commanders threatened to
destroy the two archeological treasurers if they gained control of
Bamyan. The threat generated an outcry from Muslim and non-Muslim
countries alike. It also generated a promise from the Taliban
leadership to protect the statues.
	   ``Preservation of history is a Taliban duty,'' Abdur Rahman
Huttaqi, a spokesman for the religious army, said at the time.
	   The Taliban religious army rules roughly 90 percent of
Afghanistan, where they have imposed a strict brand of Islamic law
that bars women from working, bans most forms of light
entertainment and requires men to wear beards.
	   The remaining 10 percent is ruled by an anti-Taliban alliance
made up mostly of the country's minority religious groups like
Hazaras or Shiite Muslims from the Hazarajat region of Afghanistan,
ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and Turkmen.

British papers say Tyson to fight Botha on Jan. 16 in Vegas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mike Tyson will make his comeback against South
Africa's Francois Botha in Las Vegas on Jan. 16, two British
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The Sun and The Independent said Tyson has signed a contract for
the fight with the promoters America Presents, who are expected to
announce details later Tuesday in New York.
	   The Independent said the fight would be held at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas.
	   The fight would mark Tyson's first appearance in the ring since
his suspension 15 months ago for biting Evander Holyfield's ears
during their world title fight.
	   Tyson's boxing license was restored last month by the Nevada
State Athletic Commission.
	   Botha is the No. 1 contender for Holyfield's IBF title.
Holyfield also holds the WBA crown.
	   Botha has lost only once in 37 fights, stopped in the 12th round
by Michael Moorder in an IBF title challenge two years ago.
	   The Sun said Germany's Axel Schultz had signed a contract to
fight Tyson first, but he was deemed unacceptable by Showtime, the
cable company which features Tyson's fights.
	   The Sun and Independent said Botha is being handled by British
fight promoter Frank Warren.
	   A spokesman for Warren would not confirm the Tyson-Botha fight
Tuesday, saying only that Warren's company is ``advising'' Botha
until January.

Kidnap victim snatches grenade, gun to secure his freedom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A kidnapped man won his freedom
Tuesday by snatching a hand grenade and an assault rifle from his
abductors, who fled, police reported.
	   Kong Teng, 43, an Interior Ministry official, had been abducted
for ransom and hidden by two men in a house in central Phnom Penh.
Kidnappings are commonplace in the Cambodian capital.
	   Police said Kong Teng took his chances by wrestling and
successfully taking a hand grenade and a Kalashnikov rifle from his
abductors. He tossed the grenade and fired the gun into the air.
	   The kidnappers escaped and no one was hurt.

Poll:a third of Russians think another revolution possible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About one third of Russians think the 1917
revolution could be repeated in modern Russia as the country
continues to lurch from crisis to crisis, according to a poll
released Tuesday.
	   The Russian Public Opinion Center said 34 percent of those
surveyed in a nationwide poll think another revolution is possible,
while 54 percent said it would never be repeated, according to the
Interfax News Agency.
	   Another 12 percent were undecided. The report did not give a
margin of error for the poll.
	   The Nov. 7 anniversary of the revolution still is a public
holiday in Russia.
	   The poll said 50 percent of those surveyed regard the event as
just a day off, while 39 percent see it as a holiday to be
celebrated. Another 11 percent were undecided.

Council of Europe opens trim new human rights court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The Council of Europe inaugurates a
streamlined European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France,
Tuesday which it hopes will deal faster with a rapidly increasing
number of citizens' complaints.
	   ``We're hoping the new system will speed up the procedure quite
dramatically,'' said Council of Europe spokeswoman Kathy Burton.
Under the old court system set up in 1950, rulings often took
years.
	   The new court will also be working full-time, unlike the old one
which opened one week a month and handled about 100 cases a year,
Burton said.
	   Already this year, 4,791 cases have been registered, the Council
of Europe said in a statement.
	   Under the new system, a human rights commission which examined
cases before they went to court will be scrapped so cases come
before judges sooner.
	   The court rules on infringements of the 1950 European Human
Rights Convention which is signed by all 40 nations in the Council
of Europe. Citizens from those nations can bring cases to the
European court after they have exhausted legal options in their
home countries.
	   The court has 40 judges, one from each of the member countries.

Chief justice rejects prosecution plea for more time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya's chief justice Tuesday rejected a
prosecution request that the second trial for the murder of a
British tourist in a famous game reserve a decade ago be postponed
until next year because it is not ready to proceed.
	   ``If the prosecution is not ready to go on, you should not have
charged him until you are ready. I am not accepting such delays,''
Chief Justice Zachaeus Chesoni told prosecutor Momanyi Bwononga.
	   ``Here, it is the liberty of a citizen at stake, and it must be
treated with a lot of seriousness.''
	   Chesoni said the case will be mentioned Wednesday for the
purpose of fixing an early hearing date.
	   He said once the trial begins it will be heard on a daily basis.
	   Last week, the case was referred from a lower court to the chief
justice to name a judge and set a date for the trial in the high
court.
	   Former game warden Simon Ole Makallah has pleaded not guilty to
charges that he murdered Julie Ward in the Maasai Mara game reserve
between Sept. 6 and 13, 1988.
	   Makallah, 49, is currently an assistant director at the Kenya
Wildlife Service. He was a game warden in the Maasai Mara at the
time of Ward's death and served as a witness for the prosecution in
the first murder trial that ended in acquittal of two men charged
with the death.
	   ``You want the accused to remain in custody until January;, put
yourself in his shoes. You cannot put an accused person through
psychological and sleepless nights waiting for the trial,'' Chesoni
said.
	   The prosecution has said it would need about a month to call the
43 witnesses it has assembled.
	   In June 1992 after the acquittal of two park rangers, Justice
Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a flawed
investigation.
	   Makallah's attorneys have said they will call 12 witnesses.
	   Makallah was arrested July 17 in connection with the slaying of
the 28-year-old Ward, whose mutilated and charred remains were
found Sept. 13, 1988 in the reserve near the Tanzanian border.
	   Officials first claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild
animals.
	   Although Attorney General Amos Wako told a news conference with
Ward's father, John, a day after the arrest that there was
sufficient evidence to hold Makallah, he was not formally charged
until two months later and was denied bail.

Thailand to urge farmers to plant less rice because of drought
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Irrigation Department chief outlining water
allocation plan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai farmers, who have made their
country the world's top rice exporter, will be asked to plant less
rice because there is not enough water to support new crops,
irrigation officials said Tuesday.
	   The country is suffering one of the worst droughts in years, due
partly to the El Nino weather phenomenon. Water levels in
Thailand's two major dams are unusually low, and medium-size dams
are at the lowest level in a decade.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda, who are grappling with the country's worst
economic crisis in years, came to the decision to reduce the rice
crop in a meeting with government agencies Monday.
	   Chaiwat Prechawit, deputy director general of the Irrigation
Department, said the department had been told to come up with a
water allocation plan. It would give the highest water priority to
households, followed by crops that use less water than rice.
	   ``I don't think it will affect the country's exports very much
because we are talking about second and third yield, which has yet
to be planted,'' Chaiwat said. ``Farmers still have options to
plant other crops that use less water.''
	   The Agriculture Ministry will urge the farmers to reduce the
second and third rice yield of the year by half.
	   The government fears that the cuts could raise tensions between
farmers and authorities, since rice prices have been good for the
past year _ one of the brighter spots in a largely bleak economic
picture.
	   Thailand exports an average of 5 million tons of rice a year, a
third of its total production.

Moldovan currency plummets, businesses close
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Hundreds of stores, restaurants and gas
stations closed in a panic Tuesday after the Moldovan currency lost
roughly half its value in one day.
	   The nosedive by the Moldovan leu was the worst drop since the
country gained independence in 1991 from the Soviet Union, and it
came a day after the Central Bank said it would stop propping up
the currency.
	   The bank had already spent dlrs 120 million, almost half the
country's meager hard currency reserves, in a bid to defend the
Moldovan currency, officials said.
	   The leu dropped from 6.4 to 10 against the U.S. dollar from
Monday to Tuesday. That prompted commercial banks to cease all hard
currency operations, while most stores, restaurants, and gas
stations closed down.
	   The few restaurants that remained open were demanding hard
currency payments, which is illegal. The few currency exchange
offices still operating were selling one dollar for up to 13
Moldovan lei.
	   Gasoline prices almost doubled from 2.7 to 5.0 lei for one liter
(0.26 gallons) of gas.
	   Several former Soviet republics, including Russia, have been
beset by economic shocks, including tumbling currencies, in recent
months.

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose further
Tuesday, buoyed by a strong peso and overnight gains on Wall
Street, traders said. The main index rose 2.7 percent to its
highest level in nearly four months.
	   The peso also hit a new four-month high of 39.680 pesos per
dollar, its highest level since reaching 39.210 pesos on June 10.
	   The dollar averaged 39.907 pesos for the day, down from Friday's
average of 40.398 pesos. The market was closed Monday for a
holiday.
	   Traders said the peso's strong performance encouraged investors
in the stock market.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 114.05-point surge Monday
also provided investors with another reason to accumulate Manila
stocks, traders said.
	   ``We're playing catch-up with foreign markets. Wall Street has
been strong in the past two trading days. Asian markets were also
higher Monday when the Manila market was closed,'' said Fitzgerald
Aklan, assistant vice president for institutional sales of
Orion-Squire Securities Inc.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 46.60 points
to 1,801.64. The main index advanced by 86.08 points, or 5.2
percent, on Friday.
	   Tuesday's advance brought the index's total gain to 333.95
points, or 23 percent, since Oct. 21.
	   Metro Pacific shares surged 48 centavos, or 35 percent, to 1.84
pesos after newspaper reports said Hong Kong's First Pacific has
confirmed it has been acquiring Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co. shares and intends to buy more.
	   First Pacific is the parent company of Metro Pacific.
	   The news further fueled market speculation that First Pacific
plans to take a substantial stake in PLDT.
	   PLDT shares finished up 45 pesos, or 4.7 percent, at 1,010
pesos.
	   In currency trading, Central Bank Managing Director Amando
Tetangco attributed the peso's gains to dollar inflows from foreign
direct investors, stock investors and Filipinos working overseas.
	   Traders expect the peso to continue to appreciate since more
dollar inflows are expected in the coming days.
	   For one, a dlrs 280 million loan from the International Monetary
Fund is expected to be released either Wednesday or Thursday.
	   Traders said the expected completion this month of a buyout by
Switzerland's Nestle SA of San Miguel Corp.'s 45 percent interest
in Nestle Philippines Inc., and First Pacific's expected buy-in of
PLDT are also predicted to flood the market with dollars.
	   The Nestle deal is valued at half a billion dollars, and the
PLDT deal may bring in more than dlrs 700 million.

Reports:Japanese premier's visit to Russia to go ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will meet
with President Boris Yeltsin despite reports the Russian leader
would cancel the meeting because of ill health, according to
reports Tuesday.
	   Kremlin officials said that Yeltsin will meet with Obuchi in
Moscow on Nov. 12, Russian news agencies reported. Obuchi's visit
would go ahead as planned despite foreign media reports that it
would rescheduled, they said.
	   Yeltsin is resting at a Black Sea resort after his latest bout
of ill health. Officials say the Russian leader is suffering from
high blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Opposition leaders claim that Yeltsin, dogged by heart trouble
and other health problems for years, is not capable of performing
his duties and should step down. Yeltsin insists he will stay in
office until his term expires in 2000.

Philippine business association, labor groups agree to limit

layoffs and strikes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine employers signed an
agreement Tuesday with labor groups to limit layoffs in exchange
for restraint in strikes to lessen the effects of the regional
financial crisis.
	   The ``social accord,'' effective for a year beginning Nov. 3,
was signed at the presidential palace by the Employers'
Confederation of the Philippines and labor groups headed by the
moderate Trade Union Congress of the Philippines and the militant
Labor Advisory and Consultative Council.
	   ECOP President Miguel Varela said the agreement, witnessed by
President Joseph Estrada, allows management and labor to share
``sacrifices for the common objective of sustaining the viability
of business and at the same time protecting the jobs of workers
during these trying times.''
	   Estrada said the accord is the first of its kind in the
Philippines and will encourage more foreign investment in the
country.
	   ``In times of crises, we Filipinos can rise above narrow
self-interests and band together in order to meet and address
common dangers and challenges,'' Estrada said.
	   TUCP President Democrito Mendoza said the agreement does not ban
workers from work stoppages but only ``commits them to resort to
strikes sparingly.''
	   Alberto Fenix, president of the Philippine Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, said the agreement represents the ``changing mind set
of employers and a less confrontational labor.''
	   The agreement, which is renewable by mutual consent, is intended
to cope with the effects of the economic slowdown caused by the
Asian currency crisis that began in July last year.

Police arrest five Peace Now activists at construction site
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli peace activists protested Tuesday
against the construction of a Jewish neighborhood in traditionally
Arab east Jerusalem and five demonstrators were arrested after
stepping in fron of a bulldozer.
	   The protest in the Ras al-Amud neighborhood was organized by
Peace Now, which advocates the creation of a Palestinian capital in
east Jerusalem, the sector Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The four-acre (1.6 hectare) construction site is owned by Miami
millionaire Irving Moskowitz. A supporter of Jewish settlers,
Moskowitz plans to build 132 units on the plot overlooking Al Aqsa
Mosque and the Jewish Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives.
	   On Tuesday, about 30 Peace Now demonstrators chanted slogans
from behind a police barricade for an hour before some members
crossed into the site and blocked a bulldozer. Five protesters were
arrested.
	   Hagit Yaari, a spokeswoman for Peace Now, said that the building
project threatens to derail the peace process.
	   On Monday, two Palestinians were hospitalized after a scuffle
with police on the site. Faisal Husseini, a senior Palestinian
Authority official, and his bodyguards were blocked by some 80
Israeli police officers as they tried to stop the work. After both
sides began pushing and shoving, the police clubbed the
Palestinians.

 &UR; Gov't authorizes future talks with groups close to ETA &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on Tuesday
authorized talks with organizations linked to the armed Basque
separatist group ETA, in the first official indication that the
government is prepared to negotiate an end to the 30-year-old
conflict.
	   ``We cannot say anything yet about the how, who and when,'' a
spokesman for Aznar's office said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
	   The Basque peace process was ushered in nearly two months ago
when ETA proclaimed its first ever indefinite cease-fire in its
campaign for a Basque homeland straddling northern Spain and
southern France.
	   ``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take
place with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' the spokesman said.
	   The government had previously refused to consider dialogue with
ETA or legal organizations linked to it, but following September's
truce has gradually softened its position with regard to possible
peace negotiations.
	   ETA, which stands in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   Before the truce, the group had begun targeting town councilors
from Aznar's Popular Party in retaliation for the government's
hard-line policies, killing six since July last year.

International investigators find illegal property transactions

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix coding &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Muslim religious leaders,
army and police officers are among those suspected of illegally
buying or selling property owned by the state and of other scams,
international officials said Tuesday.
	   The results of the investigation in the central Bosnian town of
Bugojno gave substance to international concern about suspected
corruption accompanying the selloff of state property to private
owners across the country.
	   ``The investigation in Bugojno was conducted to see how
widespread the problems are, but they exist everywhere else,'' said
Alexandra Stiglmayer, a spokeswoman for Bosnia's top international
mediator, Carlos Westendorp.
	   Westendorp's office reacted to allegations of massive corruption
in the Muslim-dominated central town 70 kilometers (43,8 miles)
northwest of Sarajevo and launched the investigation in August.
	   Reconstruction, allocation and privatization of state-owned
apartments, buildings and land, were specifically targeted.
	   The recently completed investigation ``revealed a disturbing
series of illegal property transactions as well as illegal
demolition of buildings belonging to (non-Muslim) displaced persons
and refugees,'' said Stiglmayer.
	   Governments of the two Bosnian substates _ the Serb Republic and
the Muslim-Croat federation _ have still not established a complete
legislation necessary for the privatization process, yet, some
state banks, hotels, buildings and land, have already changed
hands.
	   Western diplomats say there are indications that in some cases,
local and higher-level officials have profited illegally.
	   Results of the Bugojno investigation, obtained by The Associated
Press, revealed several cases in which the Muslim religious Islamic
Community, the Muslim-dominated third federal army Corps, some
police officials and private citizens illegally bought or sold
property owned by the state, or Bosnian Serb or Croat refugees.
	   Profits from the illegal dealings amounted to hundreds of
thousands of dollars or more, according to investigators' findings.
	   ``These activities clearly violate existing laws and indicate
corruption,'' Stiglmayer said.
	   She said the results were presented to the federal government,
Bugojno Mayor Dzevad Mlaco, and the office of the regional
prosecutor.
	   ``Appropriate actions'' against culprits were demanded from all
these institutions, Stiglmayer said.
	   Due suspicions of a ``widespread pattern'' of similar corruption
across the country, the investigation team will be asked to look at
other municipalities, she said.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Senior American diplomats pressed
forward their mission Tuesday to seek a cease-fire in the Congo
war, but continued to receive a frosty welcome.
	   President Bill Clinton's top Africa official, Susan Rice, was
kept waiting for several hours Tuesday for a meeting with Zimbabwe
President Robert Mugabe, who has deployed 6,000 troops to Congo to
support its President Laurent Kabila against rebels. Angola and
Namibia have also sent troops to aid Kabila.
	   Mugabe was instead chairing a regular Cabinet meeting, U.S.
officials said. By early afternoon, Rice was still waiting for
notice when Mugabe would be available.
	   Rice has so far also visited Angola, Congo and Zambia, but
appeared to have made little progress at ending a war that has
already embroiled troops from as many as eight countries and
threatens to escalate.
	   During her three-day visit to Angola last week, Rice failed to
gain a meeting with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. He
was due to meet her just before she left, but then he called an
extraordinary Cabinet meeting for the same time.

Report: Taiwanese candidates seek protection from gangs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Taiwan-Election Accusations &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Nearly a quarter of candidates in next
month's general elections have sought police protection in an
indication of growing organized crime involvement in Taiwan's
polls, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Of 308 candidates, 63 have applied for police guards and more
requests are expected, the Independence Evening News reported.
Those numbers do not include candidates from the two largest
cities, Taipei and Kaohsiung, and the outlying Quemoy and Matsu
island groups, which are administered separately.
	   The degree of fear is a sign of increased involvement in this
year's polls by gangs, who use strong-arm tactics to intimidate
rivals of candidates they back and sometimes run for office
themselves, the paper said, quoting a local elected official, Chang
Ching-fang.
	   Candidates with ties to the underworld were in position to take
15 or more of the 176 directly elected seats, it quoted Chang
saying. The highest percentages of candidates seeking protection
was in southeastern Taitung County, the Penghu islands and central
Chiayi County, the paper said.
	   Taiwan has an estimated 126 organized crime groups with more
than 5,000 members engaged in businesses ranging from construction
to drug running. Government at all levels in Taiwan is believed to
be heavily infiltrated by the gangs, which use political influence
to avoid prosecution and steer government contracts their way.
	   Justice Minister Cheng Chung-mo has warned gangsters to stay out
of the electoral process this year, rounding up suspected gang
bosses and enacting new measures to trace campaign funding and
force politicians to sever gang links.

Russia, China, North Korea sign border agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia, China, and North Korea signed an agreement
that will partly settle border disputes along the Tumen River,
where boundaries from the countries meet, a news report said.
	   The agreement, which clarifies a section of border between
Russia and China near the river, was the result of six rounds of
talks between the three sides. Agreements on other segments along
the river, shared by Russia and North Korea, will be signed soon,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``The agreement is of vital importance,'' said Genrikh Kireyev,
head of the Russian delegation to the talks. He said the talks
would lead to greater stability in the region and cut down on
misunderstandings.
	   The Tumen River marks the Chinese and North Korean frontier and
then, for its last 15 kilometers (10 miles) to the Sea of Japan,
the North Korean-Russian border.
	   Russia and North Korea have sometimes disagreed over land in the
region because of the river's tendency to change course slightly
over time.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The first witness in the
corruption and sexual misconduct trial of Anwar Ibrahim said
Tuesday the ousted deputy prime minister asked police to tamper
with evidence showing he had committed adultery and sodomy.
	   Mohamed Said Awang, former chief of the country's top police
unit, the Special Branch, was the first of 52 prosecution witnesses
expected to take the stand in the government case against the
jailed dissident.
	   ``He (Anwar) talked to me about a certain letter containing wild
allegations.'' Mohamed told the court. ``He asked me to see him
alone.''
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were cooked up to
undermine his growing challenge to the 17-year leadership of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mohamed testified that the Special Branch had launched operation
Solid Grip, an investigation into sexual misconduct by Anwar, back
in 1992. That was before he was named deputy prime minister and
finance minister in 1993.
	   It wasn't until August 1997, however, that the investigation
turned serious with a letter and a sworn statement that accused
Anwar of adultery and sodomy.
	   Anwar got police officers to force retractions by the writers of
the two statements, the prosecution said.
	   The statement by Anwar's personal driver, Azizan Abu Bakar, said
Anwar sodomized him 15 times. The other, by Ummi Hasilda Ali, the
sister of Anwar's private secretary, said her brother's wife had
sex with Anwar.
	   Both statements were also sent to Mahathir, who said he fired
Anwar after he himself talked to people who said they had sex with
his handpicked successor.
	   Mahathir said Anwar was morally unfit to run the Southeast Asian
nation and dumped him on Sept. 2.
	   ``Whatever witnesses and documents the prosecution will bring to
the court will prove beyond doubt that the accused abused the
position as deputy prime minister and finance minister for his own
personal gain,'' Abdul Gani Patail, the chief prosecutor, said in
his opening statement.
	   It was unclear whether the police who are alleged to have forced
the retractions would be charged with any crime.
	   ``A poison-pen letter has become evidence,'' snapped Anwar, just
after the trial adjourned and he was whisked off to the lock-up in
the court basement.
	   Earlier, Anwar's mother could be seen hunched over during the
humiliating testimony. At one point, Anwar mouthed to her, ``Have
you eaten?''
	   Defense lawyers on Monday opened their case by asking the judge
to hold Mahathir in contempt of court for saying publicly that
Anwar should be convicted.
	   Mahathir was also on the witness list, but it was doubtful he
would actually be called.
	   After his sacking, Anwar led an unprecedented anti-government
movement in which tens of thousands of supporters gathered at his
rallies.
	   Even after his arrest on Sept. 20, the demonstrations continued.
A full-scale riot broke out on Oct. 24 when police launched tear
gas into a mosque and protesters retaliated by throwing rocks and
bricks at police.
	   On Tuesday, riot police with shields and tear-gas launchers
stood guard across the street from the red-brick High Court at
Independence Square, where Anwar led a huge anti-government protest
just hours before his arrest.
	   His supporters said they wanted to maintain calm during the
trial to ensure Anwar gets a fair hearing.
	   ``It's unlikely that people will do anything while the trial is
on,'' said Syed Husin Ali, the leader of the opposition group,
People's Party of Malaysia.
	   During the opening day Monday, Anwar's attorneys argued the
first four graft charges were invalid because the lower house of
Parliament had repealed the special anti-corruption law under which
he was charged.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul dismissed the request. The
defense said it would take the motion to an appeals court.
	   The first four corruption charges will be heard before the trial
adjourns Nov. 14, as Malaysia plays host to 20 world leaders in the
capital for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. When the
trial resumes, the fifth graft charge and the five sex charges will
be heard.
	   Meanwhile, dozens of observers clamored for a second day to get
into the courtroom.
	   ``By not allowing the international community to come in and
observe the trial, the prime minister is undermining the name of
the country,'' U.N. Rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy told The
Associated Press outside the court.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been among international
leaders who have expressed concern over Anwar's plight after he
appeared at his arraignment with bruises and a black eye, alleging
police brutality.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Canadian model Linda Evangelista was
described in press reports Tuesday as overweight and unsteady on
her feet following an appearance at a Portuguese fashion show.
	   Evangelista, 33, was the headline attraction at the Portugal
Fashion event in the northern city Oporto on Sunday night.
	   Daily paper Publico described her as ``beautiful but clumsy.''
	   Another daily, Jornal de Noticias, said she was ``a great
disappointment'' and described her as ``visibly pregnant.''
	   In general the papers said she appeared lethargic, tripped on
the hem of a long white dress, and that one of the dresses she wore
had to be altered to make it bigger.
	   She reportedly left the show before the finale, in which she was
due to appear.

Injured Yemeni men survive one car accident, die in the second
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Three injured Yemeni men on their way to the
hospital survived one car accident but died in a second one just
minutes later, the daily al-Thawra reported Tuesday.
	   The men, who were hurt in a knife fight, were on their way to
the hospital Monday when the driver lost control of the car. It
plunged into a valley near the capital San`a, the paper said.
	   The driver, his two sons and his brother died, while the three
men sustained further injuries, it said.
	   A second car arrived at the scene, picking up the men to take
them to the hospital. But his car fell into a ravine meters (yards)
away from the site of the first accident, it said.
	   The three injured men, the driver and one of the car's
passengers died, while the other three passengers were injured.
	   Both accidents were blamed on speeding at night, the paper
quoted a police official as saying.

Council of Europe opens trim new human rights court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The Council of Europe hopes a
streamlined European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France,
to be inaugurated Tuesday will more rapidly handle citizen
complaints.
	   ``We're hoping the new system will speed up the procedure quite
dramatically,'' said Council of Europe spokeswoman Kathy Burton.
Under the old court system set up in 1950, rulings often took
years.
	   The new court will also be working full-time, unlike the old one
which opened one week a month and handled about 100 cases a year,
Burton said.
	   Already this year, 4,791 cases have been registered, the Council
of Europe said in a statement.
	   The new system scraps a human rights commission that reviewed
cases so they can get to judges sooner.
	   The court rules on infringements of the 1950 European Human
Rights Convention, which covers all 40 nations in the Council of
Europe. Citizens from those nations can bring cases to the European
court after they have exhausted legal options in their home
countries.
	   The court has 40 judges, one from each of the member countries.

Philippines says release of IMF loan will boost investor
</HEADLINE>
confidence &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from central bank governor &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The release this week of the first
portion of an International Monetary Fund standby loan to the
Philippines will boost investors' confidence in the country, the
central bank governor said Tuesday.
	   ``Foreign investors are convinced that we are on track with our
program with the IMF,'' Gabriel Singson said.
	   Last Friday, the IMF approved the release of around dlrs 280
million from a dlrs 1.3 billion standby credit arrangement. Singson
said the approval was given after the Philippines passed several
economic performance indicators such as money supply, net
international reserves and external borrowing ceilings.
	   He said the IMF commended the Philippines for being able to
implement its economic programs despite the difficulties caused by
the regional financial crisis.
	   He added that the IMF noted that the Philippine economy has
fared better that other countries affected by the crisis.
	   The standby borrowing arrangement was agreed upon in April, with
the money intended to be used by the Philippine central bank as a
war chest to repel extreme speculative attacks on the peso.
	   Central Bank Managing Director Amando Tetangco said it expects
to be able to draw the dlrs 280 million either Wednesday or
Thursday. It will be used to increase the central bank's foreign
currency reserves, which stood at dlrs 10.6 billion at the end of
September, he said.
	   He said the IMF funds should help boost the Philippine peso,
which broke through the 40 peso-per-dollar level Tuesday, setting a
new four-month high.
	   Currency watchers believe the IMF money will improve sentiment
for both the peso and the stock market.
	   ``This will be very significant for the peso and consequently,
local stocks,'' said Ricky Lozari, economist at Abacus Securities
Corp.
	   An IMF mission is expected to arrive in Manila Wednesday as part
of its regular review of the Philippines' economic performance. The
mission is expected to complete its assessment Nov. 17.

Child rape on rise in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Child rape is on the rise in Vietnam, with
five defendants sentenced to death and 63 others to life in prison
in the first nine months of the year, the Afternoon News reported
Tuesday.
	   The paper quoted court statistics as saying that before 1990,
child-rape crimes made up only 4 to 6 percent of the rape cases.
The figure rose to 14.6 percent in 1993 and 16.6 percent in 1994.
	   This year, courts have handled 548 defendants in 479 child-rape
cases, accounting for 60 percent of all rape cases, the paper said.
	   Of those cases, 393 have been brought to trial, involving 434
defendants. In addition to the death and life sentences, 91
defendants were convicted and given seven to 10 years in prison,
while 183 face 10 years to 20 years.
	   The National Assembly, the country's legislature, has revised
the Criminal Code to toughen penalties for child rape.

French President Jacques Chirac praises King Hussein
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FONTAINBLEAU, France (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac
praised King Hussein of Jordan for his role in the Middle East
agreement reached at Wye Plantation last month.
	   Hussein attended the summit and urged Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to reach a
settlement.
	   ``Thanks to him, peace was able to find its chance again,'' said
Chirac, referring to Hussein, who is suffering from non-hodgkins
lymphoma cancer.
	   Chirac was speaking in Fontainbleau during ceremonies marking
international efforts to improve the environment which were
attended by Hussein's wife, Queen Noor.
	   The French president also wished Hussein success in his battle
to fight cancer. The Jordanian king, 63, has been receiving
treatment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, since July.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ One of Afghanistan's ancient
treasures _ a 35-meter (105-foot) statue of a female Buddha _ was
wounded during fighting between the Taliban religious army and its
Shiite Muslim opponents, say eyewitnesses who fled.
	   ``A rocket hit the small female Buddha in the face during the
fighting,'' in September said Abdul Rahim, who last month reached
the Afghan capital from central Bamyan province where the statue
was located. He then fled to northwestern Pakistan.
	   ``We call her Shah Mama,'' said Rahim. ``Already she had no
face, no eyes, no lips.''
	   The rocket hit the Buddha's stone chin, leaving a gaping hole.
	   Other eyewitnesses, who didn't want to give their names fearing
retribution by the Taliban, said the giant statue was intentionally
damaged in the face and the groin.
	   One Taliban soldier, who wouldn't give his name, said a soldier
fired from a tank at the statue. ``It was with a tank ... but the
Buddha is okay,'' he said.
	   This despite an order from the Taliban's reclusive leader,
Mullah Mohammed Omar, who told his soldiers to protect the 2,000
year old statues as ancient treasures to be preserved and out of
respect for Buddhas.
	   The statue is one of two giant stone Buddhas that have been
tucked away in the craggy canyons of central Afghanistan's Bamyan
province for nearly 2,000 years.
	   The second statue. whose 55-meter (165-foot) frame looms over
the valley, is said to be the world's tallest standing Buddha.
Residents of the area say the smaller statue is a woman and the
taller one, a man.
	   Centuries ago, invading Muslim soldiers who converted the region
to Islam sliced away the faces of the two Buddhas, believing images
were sacrilegious.
	   Some strict Muslims consider images, such as statues or
photographs, offensive to Islam. In Taliban-ruled Afghanistan where
a harsh brand of Islam has been imposed, photography has been
forbidden and offenders are publicly beaten.
	   Two years ago Taliban commanders threatened to destroy the two
archeological treasures if they gained control of Bamyan. The
threat generated an international outcry from Muslim and non-Muslim
countries. It also generated a promise from the Taliban leadership
to protect the statues.
	   The Taliban religious army rules roughly 90 percent of
Afghanistan, where they have imposed a strict brand of Islamic law
that prohibits women from working, bans most forms of light
entertainment, requires men to wear beards and imposes harsh
punishments for a variety of crimes.
	   The remaining 10 percent is ruled by an anti-Taliban alliance,
made up mostly of the country's minority religious groups like
Hazaras or Shiite Muslims from the Hazarajat region of Afghanistan,
as well as ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and Turkmen.

Turkish comedian goes on hunger strike to protest censorship

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ One of Turkey's leading comedians went
on a hunger strike Tuesday to protest a censorship law that let the
government order a TV station that aired his show shut down for a
day.
	   ``This censorship law must change; we expect this from
Parliament,'' Levent Kirca said in an interview as he went on a
hunger strike outside his theater in downtown Istanbul. ``I will
keep this up until I collapse.''
	   The state radio and television board,ordered Kanal D off the air
for 24 hour after Kirca's show mocked Women and Family Affairs
Minister Isilay Saygin for making a public declaration of her
virginity last month.
	   It said the skit was ``hurtful'' and an ``assault on Saygin's
personality.'' Saygin, 52, grabbed public attention earlier this
year when she proposed virginity tests for girls in state homes and
orphanages.
	   The board, which is empowered to black out stations it judges to
be politically biased, slanderous or offensive, has not yet said
when the shutdown will take place.
	   The head of the board, Kutlu Savas, issued a statement Tuesday
defending the decision. ``The board cannot be expected to tolerate
personal insults...and programs involving so much sexuality they
could hurt children.''
	   Kirca's show has been on for over a decade and has been praised
for tackling touchy subjects like corruption, military coups and
torture. Kirca put the show on hold after the board's decision.
	   The four-year-old board has come under increasing criticism by
both mainstream and pro-Islamic stations for hindering freedom of
expression.

Mahathir calls for regulations on international ratings agencies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
called Tuesday for controls on international credit ratings
agencies, suggesting they were conspiring to keep developing
countries down.
	   ``We need to have regulation,'' the prime minister said. ``They
are causing damage to economies. ... They have so much power and we
cannot do anything about them.''
	   Malaysia's recession-hit economy has received several credit
rating downgrades from the top two international ratings agencies,
and Mahathir said this has made it difficult for Malaysia to raise
funds.
	   After Malaysia introduced sweeping capital controls, Moody's and
Standard and Poor's cut their Malaysia ratings to one-notch above
junk status.
	   Mahathir said their methods for downgrading were not transparent
enough.
	   ``I won't say there is a conspiracy, but the result seems like a
collusion,'' he said. ``It looks like they are preventing economies
... from recovering.
	   Mahathir recently indicated that the two local rating agencies _
Rating Agency Malaysia and Malaysia Rating Corp. _ would be
regulated.
	   Malaysia imposed capital controls last month that pegged the
currency to 3.8 ringgit to the dollar. It was an effort to prevent
the ringgit trading overseas and force people to bring their money
back into Malaysia to help boost the badly sagging economy.
	   Mahathir said Malaysia would keep the controls until currency
trading was brought under control.
	   ``We want to keep the currency controls until the world imposes
a regime that's not a threat to the international exchange order,''
Mahathir said.

Hong Kong Stock Exchange hopes to keep data from Singapore market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Singapore's plans to launch a futures contract
based on Hong Kong stock prices ran into stiff opposition from the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which reportedly is trying to block
important price information from its potential competitor.
	   Hong Kong market officials have asked the financial information
provider Reuters to withhold real-time stock price information
needed by the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, the South
China Morning Post reported Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong executives worry that their share prices could be
pushed up and down by futures traders in Singapore, in dealings
beyond their regulatory reach. Their strategy seems to be to halt
the planned market by choking off the information it needs.
	   The exchange approached Reuters because it supplies stock price
information to Morgan Stanley Capital International to calculate
the MSCI Hong Kong Index, which tracks the value of Hong Kong
shares, the newspaper said.
	   The Singapore market plans to launch an MSCI Hong Kong Index
futures contract on Nov. 23 to compete with futures trading in Hong
Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index.
	   Both Reuters and the Hong Kong market would confirm only parts
of the Post's story.
	   Reuters said in a statement it was ``made aware of certain
concerns about the use of exchange data by a Reuters customer.''
	   The Reuters manager in charge of Hong Kong and Macau, David Lim,
confirmed to The Associated Press that an issue had arisen over
Singapore's plans to launch trading of the Hong Kong index. He
declined elaboration.
	   The exchange would confirm only that it had discussed the terms
of an information dissemination contract with a real-time quote
provider, spokeswoman Karen Wong said. Wong would not identify
Reuters as the company, and she declined further comment.
	   The exchange warned Reuters that it would not provide it with
real-time price information if Reuters provided data to MSCI that
``damaged the stability'' of the Hong Kong stock market, the Post
reported.
	   Dow Jones Newswires quoted someone it identified as a source
close to the exchange as saying the exchange supplies price data to
information providers like Reuters to supply to traders, but not
for the compilation of rival stock indexes.

Communists push for medical inspection of Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hardliners in Russia's parliament were demanding
details of Boris Yeltsin's health, while the recuperating president
held private talks Tuesday with his defense minister in southern
Russia.
	   The lower house of Russia's parliament, the State Duma, will
consider a bill Thursday that would require Yeltsin to undergo a
medical checkup. If the bill is approved, presidential doctors
would have to release their conclusions following an exam.
	   The bill requires the check-up be carried out by the medical
department of Yeltsin's office, not an independent team. To become
a law, the bill would have to be approved by the upper house and
Yeltsin himself, who is almost certain to veto it.
	   The president's envoy to parliament, Alexander Kotenkov, said
the bill had little chance of success.
	   ``Apart from being tactless, the document is illegal,'' he said
on Tuesday.
	   Kotenkov and other critics of the bill said a specific reference
to Yeltsin effectively turns it into an administrative directive to
the presidential doctors _ something that the Duma has no right to
pass.
	   Communist Partly leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted the law should
be approved.
	   ``He (Yeltsin) is an absolutely irresponsible person and is
incapable of running the country,'' he said. ``We are governed by
an unsober person. In effect, the president has become a full-blown
alcoholic.''
	   Communists and other Yeltsin foes have long accused the
president of drinking heavily, a charge the president has denied.
Zyuganov has been increasingly blunt in recent days.
	   ``Alcoholism isn't an insult, it's a disease that is very
difficult to cure,'' Zyuganov said Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin, resting at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, is recovering
from what his aides call fatigue and high blood pressure. The
latest illness has again brought a new round of calls for the
president's resignation by his Communist foes.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious illness and says he will serve
out his term that runs until the middle of the year 2000.
	   Yeltsin met with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on Tuesday to
discuss military reform and building housing for retired officers.
Russian television showed brief footage of a smiling Yeltsin
welcoming Sergeyev to his residence and then sitting across from
him behind a small table.
	   Yeltsin, dressed in a dark cardigan and white shirt, looked
tired but displayed no visible signs of illness.
	   The president began a two-week stay in Sochi on Friday. He had
been working only sporadically in recent weeks because of his poor
health.

Philippines posts balance of payments surplus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines posted a balance of
payments surplus of dlrs 1.4 billion in the first 10 months of the
year, the central bank said Tuesday.
	   The surplus was a complete reversal from the year-earlier
deficit of dlrs 1.2 billion. Other details were not provided.
	   The balance of payments measures the flow of resources between
the domestic economy and the rest of the world. Its main components
are the current account, which covers the trade balance, and the
capital account, which includes stock investments.
	   The government is targeting a balance of payments surplus of
dlrs 1.1 billion in 1998.
	   Philippine Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the
balance of payments surplus is another indication that the peso
will appreciate further.
	   The peso closed higher against the U.S. dollar Tuesday, buoyed
by strong dollar inflows and expectations of a further
appreciation.
	   The peso hit a new four-month high of 39.680 pesos to the
dollar, its highest level since hitting 39.210 pesos to the dollar
on June 10.

Netanyahu links Cabinet approval of peace deal to security plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian security chief saying the
Palestinians have kept their promises, Arafat leaving for Spain &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the latest disruption of the new Mideast
peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday
postponed a Cabinet meeting during which the accord was to have
been ratified.
	   Netanyahu said he ordered the delay because the Palestinians
have not submitted a complete blueprint for fighting terrorism, but
would not say what was missing from the security plan.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai later explained that Israel
is holding out for a list of 30 wanted Palestinians the Palestinian
Authority has promised to arrest as part of the peace agreement.
Israel also wants a timetable for the arrests, Mordechai said.
	   Implementation of the 12-week land-for-security agreement cannot
begin until it has been approved by Israel's Cabinet and the
parliament. The original startup date for the agreement was Monday.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily to Netanyahu's decision to
postpone the Cabinet meeting, which was initially was scheduled for
1 p.m. (1100 gmt) Tuesday.
	   ``Instead of playing these sorry political games, he (Netanyahu)
should just stand up and say ... I won't implement what I have
signed,'' said Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in the Gaza
Strip, said the security plan was presented to the United States,
to the satisfaction of U.S. officials.
	   Dahlan, who played a key role in putting together the
anti-terror plan, said he also discussed the plan with Israeli
security officials. The Israeli officers deemed the Palestinian
plan sufficient, Dahlan said.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu would try to work out the problem in
a telephone call to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. However,
Arafat left for Spain, as scheduled, in mid-afternoon, and there
were no signs that the dispute had been resolved.
	   Netanyahu appeared to be contradicting the Clinton
administration when he said that the Palestinians had not delivered
everything they had promised.

Ukrainian government starts talks with IMF on economic situation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine's government began talks with an
IMF team on the country's growing economic problems, including a
backlog in wage and pension payments, poor tax collection and
printing more money, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The International Monetary Fund mission arrived in Kiev
following last week's release of dlrs 78 million in credits for
Ukraine, the second tranche of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan approved by
the IMF in September.
	   Presidential economic adviser Valery Lytvytsky said the
government has kept to promised budget deficit levels and foreign
currency reserves, which are among the major economic indicators
watched by the IMF, the independent Ukrainian News service
reported.
	   However, the government plans to ask the IMF to revise its
requirements regarding tax collection and the social welfare
payments, whose fulfillment remains in doubt, Lytvytsky said.
	   The Ukrainian government has chronically failed in its struggle
to collect planned taxes, while wage and pension debts in the
former Soviet republic have reached some 6.5 billion hryvna (dlrs
1.91 billion).
	   The talks' agenda also includes the controversial issue of
restrictions on foreign currency purchases, introduced by the
government in September to combat economic turmoil in neighboring
Russia and support the national hryvna currency.
	   The hryvna has slipped from its pre-crisis level of about 2.2 to
the U.S. dollar to nearly 3.43 last month, but has stabilized in
recent days at around 3.428. However, IMF experts are concerned
that the government's measures may contradict the IMF's charter,
Ukrainian News said.
	   ``The Fund understands the necessity of these restrictions, but
it is constantly stressing their temporary character. My own
forecast is that they would not last for more than another month,''
Lytvytsky said.
	   Ukraine also plans to ask the IMF to allow a limited money
emission under a scheme in which the National Bank would print
money to buy state treasury bills. The IMF has limited such
operations as part of its loan deal with Ukraine.
	   ``We are talking about the sum of 300 million to 500 million
hryvna (dlrs 88 million to dlrs 147 million),'' Lytvytsky said.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has spoken in recent days in
favor of some limited money emission, arguing that it might not
necessarily lead to higher inflation.
	   The economic development program agreed with the IMF ``was
normal before the financial crisis,'' but now it is necessary to
``respond in time to the changes on the financial market,'' Kuchma
said lately, according to the daily Dyen.
	   If the IMF allows Ukraine to print more money, it would be used
to pay wage and pension debts and social subsidies, said Lytvytsky.

Suspected WWII concentration camp guard proclaims innocence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A 72-year-old Croat woman suspected of
torturing inmates in the country's most notorious World War II camp
declared Tuesday the charges are groundless, her attorney said.
	   Nada Sakic, who was extradited from Argentina on Monday, met
with an investigative judge from the Zagreb district court, Mirjana
Rigljan, in the first step toward determining whether she will be
indicted for war crimes.
	   Her husband Dinko, 76, is already imprisoned here, facing war
crimes charges.
	   Mrs. Sakic was extradited on a warrant accusing her of
``carrying out torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as
terror, intimidation and collective punishment of civilians,''
which led to the deaths of an unknown number of inmates.
	   As a teen-ager, Mrs. Sakic allegedly was a guard from 1942-45 in
the women's block in the Stara Gradiska camp, part of the Jasenovac
concentration camp complex.
	   Dinko Sakic, extradited from Argentina in June, is suspected of
ordering, witnessing and participating in the war crimes committed
in the Jasenovac camp he commanded between 1942 and 1944.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist Croats
were killed at Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than 20
concentration camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet
state.
	   After hearing the charges, Mrs. Sakic said she ``doesn't even
want to respond to such false accusations,'' her attorney Branko
Seric told reporters.
	   ``She didn't want to present her defense because she thinks the
charges are groundless,'' Seric said. Asked whether she thereby
feels not guilty, he replied: ``Absolutely.''
	   The district court will now hear witnesses.
	   Mrs. Sakic, who suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, spent
the night in Zagreb's main prison, where her husband also is
imprisoned. But the two have not met, pending approval from prison
authorities, Seric said.
	   The Sakics married in late 1944, after apparently meeting each
other through Maks Luburic, Nada's half-brother and Dinko Sakic's
superior. Luburic was in charge of all World War II camps in
Croatia.
	   The two fled Croatia in 1945 when Nazi rule was crushed. Both
lived quietly in the Argentine capital until April, when Dinko
Sakic outraged Holocaust survivors by telling Argentine television
that Jasenovac victims died of disease and natural causes.
	   Nada Sakic was arrested in July at the request of Yugoslav
officials, who accuse her of genocide.
	   Croatia then also asked for her extradition, apparently to
prevent her from being tried in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, where
she would face a tougher trial. The majority of victims at the camp
were Serbs.

Hong Kong's First Pacific willing to join another group in takeover
</HEADLINE>
of PLDT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hong Kong-based holding group First
Pacific Co. said Tuesday it is willing to explore talks with
another investor group to facilitate a takeover of Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co., as long as First Pacific gets management
control of the Philippines' largest telecommunications company.
	   ``Management control is one of three basic requirements we look
for among potential acquisitions,'' said Robert Sherbin, First
Pacific's vice president for corporate communications.
	   Sherbin is in Manila as part of a team negotiating to acquire
PLDT shares held by government pension fund Social Security System,
U.S.-based fund manager Capital Research Group, and PLDT President
Antonio Cojuangco.
	   First Pacific has announced its purchase of a ``strategic
stake'' in PLDT, but has not disclosed the exact amount of the
shares and from whom they were purchased.
	   Sherbin refused to comment on speculation that the shares were
purchased from the Social Security System.
	   The SSS, Capital Research Group and Cojuangco hold a combined 35
percent stake in PLDT.
	   Sherbin said another requirement sought by First Pacific in its
investment in PLDT is a minimum 18 percent internal rate of return
of investment over the medium term.
	   Sherbin described the possible takeover of PLDT as a ``home
run'' for First Pacific as it falls under its four core business
concerns: telecommunications, property, banking and marketing and
distribution.
	   He added that First Pacific's interest in PLDT is in line with
its belief that it has a home court advantage with the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.
	   Sherbin stressed First Pacific intends to maintain a strategic
presence in PLDT, debunking some market watchers' comments that the
Hong Kong-based company may be interested in the local carrier only
for the short term.
	   ``We are not asset traders or slash-and-burn types of investors.
We will be at PLDT for the long term,'' Sherbin said.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government plans to set up a new berth
in the Red Sea port city of Aqaba to be used for phosphate exports,
an official said Tuesday.
	   The berth will be designed to serve only a joint venture between
the state-run Jordan Phosphate Mines Co. and a Norwegian firm
exporting phosphates. The joint firm is called Hydro Agri-Jordan.
	   Mohammed Baderkhan, JPMC's chief engineer, said the new berth
will be built away from current docks used for commercial exports
to curb pollution that may result from phosphate exports on the
shores of Aqaba, 350 kilometers (210 miles) south of the capital
Amman.
	   He said the berth is expected to be operational in 2001.
	   Hydro Agri-Jordan, which began production this year, produces
phosphoric acid and compound fertilizers in the southern mine city
of Sheidiyeh, 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of Aqaba.

	   AMMAN. Jordan (AP) _ More than 1 million tourists visited Jordan
between January and September this year, a 12.6 percent increase
over the same period in 1997.
	   A Tourism Ministry report obtained Tuesday said 63.7 percent of
the visitors to Jordan came from neighboring Gulf Arab states.
	   The report said tourists from the United States, Europe and
other Western countries formed 26.9 percent of the total, while
Israelis made up 9.4 percent.
	   It said revenues from tourism in the same period also increased
by 7.7 percent to 399.7 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 562.9
million).

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The government asked parliament Tuesday to rush
through a law that would allow it to sell state foreign investments
to close a 1.92 billion dinar (dlrs 6.35 billion) deficit in its
current fiscal year, which began July 1.
	   Finance Minister Sheik Ali al-Sabah told the National Assembly
there were only two options to bridge the shortfall: selling
foreign investments or borrowing, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   The latter was fraught with ``technical and economic
difficulties, while the former was quicker and would be carried out
according to specific controls,'' Sheik Ali said.
	   The step was not surprising since Kuwait has for years been
using its foreign investments to cover budget deficits. State
revenues of this small Gulf state have been seriously affected by
low oil prices.
	   The investments, known as the Fund for Future Generations, are
estimated at dlrs 40 billion, down from around dlrs 100 billion in
the 1980s. Formed by setting aside 10 percent of state revenues
every year since 1976, the fund is meant to provide for Kuwaitis
when oil runs out.

Yemeni president urges Arabs to renew economic boycott of Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab states should revive their economic and
political boycott of Israel, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
said in remarks published Tuesday.
	   The president disapproved of the U.S. call for Arab nations to
normalize relations with Israel, made after the Israeli-Palestinian
accord signed outside Washington last month.
	   ``Why don't we boycott Israel? It's the arch enemy which
deserves to be boycotted,'' Saleh told the Egyptian newspaper
Al-Shaab in an interview.
	   Arab governments suspended part of their economic embargo on
Israel after the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord of 1993. They
decided to allow trade with foreign companies that do business with
Israel, but maintained the embargo on direct trade with the Jewish
state.
	   Several Arab countries also opened diplomatic or trade missions
in Israel, but such moves ground to a halt after Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in 1996 and adopted a
hard-line approach toward the peace process.
	   ``When Arabs agree and restore their solidarity and revive the
boycott of Israel, America will be forced to make an understanding
with Arabs,'' Saleh said. Arab governments have long accused the
United States of a pro-Israeli tilt in its foreign policy.
	   Yemen has no ties with Israel.

Former coup leader's candidacy reopening wounds in Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY109 &QL; 
 &UR; By BART JONES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The growing possibility that failed
coup leader Hugo Chavez will become president of Venezuela is
reopening old wounds in the armed forces and stirring worries that
the military may try to block his rise to power.
	   A war of words and rumors has already begun. Army leaders have
signaled that they may not respect the results of Dec. 6
presidential balloting and Chavez has denounced a military
conspiracy against his candidacy.
	   In a speech last month, President Rafael Caldera tried to rein
in his generals by declaring that the will of the voters should be
honored. Yet some army leaders still see Chavez as a traitor who
should never have been released from prison after his 1992 coup
attempt.
	   ``In the armed forces, it is very difficult to accept that a
Venezuelan who disrespected his military obligations and betrayed
his superiors ... could be commander in chief,'' said Fernando
Ochoa Antich, defense minister during Chavez's uprising.
	   Chavez, 44, was jailed for two years after he tried to overthrow
then-President Carlos Andres Perez in 1992. Hoping to heal wounds,
Caldera ended a military trial in 1994 and released him.
	   Millions of poor Venezuelans see the former paratrooper as a
hero who will fight rampant political corruption, though many in
the wealthy elite fear that he will impose a dictatorship. Much of
the business community is backing former state Gov. Henrique Salas
Romer, who is second in the polls.
	   Chavez says that army chief Gen. Ruben Rojas Perez, the
son-in-law of the president, has been visiting barracks to persuade
soldiers and officials of the need to block Chavez.
	   ``The situation in the barracks is inflamed,'' Chavez told a
group of businessmen recently. ``(Rojas has) reopened fissures that
were closing.''
	   Chavez's backers say any attempt to derail the retired
lieutenant colonel could create chaos. It ``could bring us to a
real war, a war with bullets and rifles,'' Chavez said.
	   Still, the chances of a coup stopping Chavez are slight because
military attitudes toward the candidate are divided, with Chavez
enjoying strong support among the rank and file. A more likely
scenario would be elements in the military encouraging electoral
fraud to keep Chavez from winning. The army is in charge of
security on election day.
	   Some old-guard military officials who helped put down Chavez's
coup attempt worry that he will demote, expel or even jail them if
he wins.
	   Rojas recently declared ``the army does not support those who
rose up with arms against the republic'' _ a clear reference to
Chavez. Later, Rojas refused to attend a meeting between Chavez and
army leaders to discuss the candidate's platform.
	   As tensions grew, Caldera convened a meeting of the military
high command on Oct. 23. In a nationally televised speech to them,
Caldera insisted that the armed forces are united and declared that
they will respect the election results.
	   For his part, Rojas may lack the support to head a coup, partly
because many military officials view his promotion as blatant
nepotism.
	   Army opposition to Chavez also may be aimed at heading off
probes of alleged corruption by Caldera's relatives and other
members of his administration, retired Vice Admiral Mario Ivan
Carratu said.
	   ``They're not interested in having someone rise to power who
will open the books of the Caldera government, because without
doubt innumerable acts of corruption will appear,'' Carratu said.
	   Officials deny that corruption is widespread and note that
Caldera is widely viewed as personally honest.
	   Rojas did not respond to requests for an interview.
	   Though tensions eased after Caldera's speech, they could rise
again if Chavez wins and tries to purge the military or carry out a
pledge to shut down Congress.
	   Chavez has warned that his supporters could take to streets if
he loses the election because of fraud. Venezuela suffered two coup
attempts in 1992 and rioting in 1989 that left hundreds dead.

German tax plan reportedly to cost business 37 billion marks (dlrs
</HEADLINE>
22.4 billion) &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new center-left government plans
to finance its tax reform by shifting more of the burden to
businesses, a German business daily reported Tuesday.
	   The proposed reform, comprising 72 amendments, would bring in an
additional 44 billion marks (dlrs 26.6 billion) in taxes the daily
Handelsblatt said. Of that, 37 billion marks would come from
industry alone.
	   The new Social Democratic-led government has pledged to reform
the tax code largely by plugging loopholes.
	   Advisers to Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine have submitted a
tax reform proposal to the Finance Ministry's tax experts,
Handelsblatt said, and the plan will be submitted to the lower
house of parliament Nov. 10.
	   Finance Ministry officials said that there was no official list
of tax amendments. However, the junior government coalition
partner, the Greens, confirmed the accuracy of the proposed tax
amendments reported by Handelsblatt, but not the amount of
additional revenue they were expected to produce.
	   The coalition's tax plan already has come under fire from
industry representatives as being too hard on business, prompting
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to offer changes to help medium-sized
companies in particular.

Chechen leader claims Russian financier paid ransom for hostages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Berezovsky quote in new 6th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov claimed a
prominent Russian financier has been paying large ransoms to win
the release of hostages held in the breakaway territory, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   Boris Berezovsky, one of Russia's wealthiest and most
controversial businessmen, has claimed credit for freeing a number
of hostages held in Chechnya, including the recent release of an
British couple held for more than a year. But he has never
acknowledged paying ransoms.
	   ``In circumvention of the Chechen government, he comes with
suitcases full of money and heaps of computers and bails out the
captives,'' Maskhadov said in an interview with the Komsomolskaya
Pravda newspaper published Tuesday. ``This only stimulates the
appetites of gangsters and discredits my nation.''
	   Whenever hostages are released, there are rumors about possible
ransom payments, but the parties involved rarely provide details.
	   Berezovsky has said that he and others have been sending
humanitarian and medical aid, computers and school textbooks to
Chechnya, and in return, senior Chechen officials have put more
emphasis on identifying and locating kidnappers.
	   But he again denied Tuesday that he had paid any ransoms.``We
have never paid any money for the release of hostages,'' he said on
the Echo Moscow radio.

S.Africa says Lesotho deal shows intervention was right
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ After its troops began leaving
neighboring Lesotho, South Africa on Tuesday said a deal struck
between Lesotho's bickering political factions justified its
September military intervention.
	   South African and Botswanan troops crossed the border to quell
an army mutiny and unrest linked to a May election, which the
ruling party won by a landslide but which opposition parties
claimed was rigged.
	   Lesotho's opposition parties have agreed to a proposed interim
committee which will prepare for new elections.
	   Addressing Parliament, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said a
deal would never have happened without foreign troops.
	   The agreement has ``confirmed our view that unless the coup in
Lesotho was ended and the security situation normalized it would
have been impossible to deal with the political problems,'' he
said.
	   On Monday a convoy carrying 800 South African soldiers rumbled
out of Lesotho, reducing troop strength of the intervention force
by almost one-quarter.
	   The withdrawal came after South Africa's armed forces chief,
Gen. Siphiwe Nyanda, announced the situation in Lesotho had
stabilized.
	   Dozens of people died in what commanders had thought would be a
peaceful intervention on behalf of the Southern African Development
Community, but which turned into a bloody battle in and around the
capital Maseru.
	   Lesotho, which has a population of 2 million, is a poor,
mountainous country within South Africa's borders.

Nicaragua rejects offer of Cuban doctors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mitch &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua, (AP) _ Nicaragua's government says it has
rejected Cuba's offer of doctors to help those injured by Hurricane
Mitch, but said it would accept medicine for victims of the storm
that killed an estimated 2,000 Nicaraguans.
	   The foreign ministry confirmed the decision late Monday. Health
Minister Martha McCoy said Nicaragua already has enough doctors on
hand, but needs medicine.
	   Cuba, with one of the world's highest concentrations of doctors,
often sends physicians abroad in aid missions and had a sizable
medical team in Nicaragua during the 1980s when the Sandinistas
were in power.
	   With the government estimating 2,000 people may have died in the
storm, former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, head of the
leftist Sandinista party, called the rejection of Cuban aid
``unheard of.''
	   He said Nicaragua had not rejected such assistance ``even in the
times of the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle, when the earthquake
of 1972 destroyed this capital'' of Managua.
	   The government of President Arnoldo Aleman has long been a
political ally of Cuban exile groups hostile to Fidel Castro. The
Cuban president was close to Aleman's political rivals in
Nicaragua, the Sandinistas.

Official: Western aid coming too slowly to close Chernobyl on time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine won't be able to close down the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant by 2000 as promised because western
countries aren't providing financial help fast enough, a senior
government official said Tuesday.
	   ``If Chernobyl continues operating after 2000, it is not Ukraine
that will be to blame,'' First Deputy Energy Minister Mykhailo
Umanets said.
	   He said that while Ukraine ``is fully implementing all its
obligations'' to close down Chernobyl on time, too little money has
come from the West to stay on schedule.
	   Ukraine has pledged to close Chernobyl by 2000, but needs
outside money for the lengthy procedure of shutting down the
plant's reactors. It also wants to complete two new nuclear
reactors to compensate for the loss of power that Chernobyl's
closure would cause.
	   Umanets said Ukraine so far has received only about a fifth of
the dlrs 640 million needed to shut down the nuclear plant itself,
while negotiations with the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development over a loan to complete the two new nuclear reactors
have not yet provided results.
	   ``There are no loans for this project at all, and the EBRD's
requirements are simply mind-boggling,'' Umanets told a news
conference.
	   Ukrainian leaders have repeatedly said they would not close
Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986,
until new reactors at the Khmelnytsky and Rivne nuclear power
plants start operating.
	   In what might also slow down the completion of the reactors, the
Russian government is no longer ``making definite statements''
about financing the project next year, Umanets added.
	   Russia earlier promised to grant Ukraine a dlrs 180 million loan
in 1999 for completing the new reactors, but the recent economic
crisis made the deal a matter of lesser importance to the Russian
government, he said.

Immigrants from former Soviet Union now largest ethnic group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Immigrants from the former Soviet Union have
become Israel's largest ethnic group, overtaking Israelis of
Moroccan descent, a new Hebrew University study has found.
	   Some 900,000 immigrants from the former Soviet republics live in
Israel, compared to about 500,000 tracing their roots to Morocco,
according to the study, ``Profile of an Immigration Wave.''
	   The newcomers from the Soviet Union increased the Jewish
population of Israel by 15 percent and altered the face of Israeli
society. As a result of the immigration wave, there has been a jump
in the overall level of education. The percentage of divorced women
and single parent families has also increased, the study said.
	   Some 750,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union have
arrived in the Jewish state since 1989. They compromise about
one-seventh of the population.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Israeli army statement in 4th graf. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes raided suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon Tuesday for the second
straight day, security officials said.
	   Israeli jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on a valley near
the village of Shaqra, about eight kilometers (five miles) north of
the Israeli-occupied enclave in southern Lebanon, said the
officials, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The area is used by Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas to
launch attacks against Israeli troops inside the enclave.
	   An Israeli army spokesman said the planes struck their targets
and returned safely to base.
	   The air attack appeared to be in retaliation for an ambush by
Lebanese guerrillas on the Tallousa outpost, which is manned
jointly by Israeli soldiers and their South Lebanon Army militia
allies.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the mortar
attack on Tallousa, which is on the edge of the occupied zone.
	   On Monday, Israeli jets carried out three air raids against
suspected guerrilla hideouts around the wooded hills of Ein
al-Tineh in southern Lebanon. There were no casualties.
	   Hezbollah and other guerrilla groups are fighting to oust 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the occupied enclave.

Russia to prepare Gazprom auction by end of November
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has until the end of the month to
prepare an auction of up to 5 percent of the natural gas monopoly
Gazprom, the world's largest gas company, a news report said
Tuesday.
	   The Cabinet has ordered the State Property Ministry to design
the procedure for the sale of Gazprom, one of the government's most
valuable assets, by the end of November, the Interfax news agency
reported. No date for the auction has been set.
	   Russian news reports have said the government may decide not to
sell a stake in Gazprom this year because its stock price has
fallen sharply. If the auction goes ahead, no more than 3 percent
of the company will be sold, the reports added.
	   However, after President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree
announcing the sale Monday, Gazprom share prices rose 25 percent at
the Moscow Stock Exchange, from 1.52 rubles (9.6 cents) per share
to 1.9 rubles (12 cents).
	   Russia's financial troubles have scared away foreign investors
and driven down share prices, and the government has repeatedly
postponed the sale because it was hoping to get a better price.
	   With treasury bill debts coming due, wage arrears mounting and
no international aid in sight, the government has little choice but
to sell more shares in Gazprom to cover expenses.
	   Russia planned to present a draft 1999 budget to the
International Monetary Fund this month. But it will take at least
until February for the budget to be approved by Russia's
parliament, said the chief of the legislature's budget committee,
Alexander Zhukov.
	   The Cabinet will present a budget draft to the State Duma, the
lower house of parliament, on Dec. 1, Zhukov said Monday, according
to Interfax.
	   ``Debates on the budget normally last three months,'' he said,
adding that they may be shorter ``if the State Duma chooses to
support the government.''
	   Not all news was so grim for the government Tuesday. Russia's
tax chief Georgy Boos said tax collections in October rose from the
previous month, and were all in cash, without offsets between
companies and state agencies.
	   Cash receipts for October reached 12.2 billion rubles (dlrs
784,000), up from 9.3 billion rubles (dlrs 597,000) the month
before, according to Boos.
	   ``We are slightly below our original target, but we are at the
same level as in July,'' Boos told a news conference.
	   A quarter of tax payments for October _ more than 3 billion
rubles (dlrs 193,000) _ came from Gazprom. The money was all in
cash, Boos said.
	   Last month, the government signed an agreement with Gazprom for
payments of the company's tax debts and current taxes through the
end of this year. The scheme allows Gazprom to offset some of taxes
through gas deliveries to government agencies.
	   The government holds 40 percent of Gazprom shares and said it
may gradually reduce its holdings to 25 percent. Private investors
in Russia and abroad hold the remaining shares.
	   Boos also said his service has submitted proposals to the
government for shifting the tax burden from manufacturers to
customers by lowering profit taxes and value-added taxes and
expanding the use of sales taxes.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hill and Rugova touring war-devastated zone.
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Signaling an easing of Kosovo's
refugee crisis, a U.N. organization said Tuesday that thousands of
displaced _ some with no roof over their heads for weeks _ had
found shelter ahead of winter.
	   The latest try at shuttle diplomacy moved into its second round,
as U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with ethnic Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova in the provincial capital Pristina for discussions
on a draft agreement with the Serbs on Kosovo's future.
	   Afterward, Rugova joined Hill in touring a war-devastated area
southwest of Pristina _ a first-time move reflecting the relative
freedom of movement in areas that for months were unsafe because of
Serb-Albanian violence.
	   In the village of Banja, on the road running southwest of
Pristina to Malisevo, some Albanians kissed Rugova. Later, in
Orahovac, a mixed town, a Serb complained to Rugova that his father
was missing because of the turmoil. Replying in Serb, Rugova said:
``We're together in this.''

Lafontaine takes interest rate appeal to European Central Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine on
Tuesday directed his campaign for creating jobs by lowering
interest rates to the European Central Bank, which starting Jan. 1
will set a Europe-wide interest rate to accompany the European
common currency.
	   His comments to reporters came just as the European Central
Bank's 17-member policy-making body was meeting in Frankfurt.
	   Lafontaine repeatedly has called on Germany's central bank, the
Bundesbank, to lower interest rates as a way of stimulating
economic growth and easing record-high unemployment that tops 10
percent.
	   The Bundesbank has dismissed unemployment as a political
problem, saying its agenda is setting monetary policy with the
foremost goal of price stability. While the ECB has the same goal,
Lafontaine reminded the central bank that it must support the
economic policies of individual European Union members. He noted
that interest ``rate cuts elsewhere in Europe haven't gone
unnoticed.''
	   Earlier Tuesday, the Bank Of Spain said it would lower its
interest rate to 3.50 percent from 3.75 percent.
	   Lafontaine spoke with reporters after meeting with Austria's
Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger in Bonn. Austria holds the
rotating presidency of the European Union; Germany takes over the
job next year.
	   On Thursday, the finance minister will attend a meeting of the
Bundesbank's policy-making council meeting.

Reigning champion Cuba beats U.S. team in opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Regla Torres Herrera scored eight points Tuesday as
Cuba, the reigning world and Olympic champion, opened defense of
its women's world volleyball title with a 15-7, 15-8, 15-10 victory
over the United States.
	   While the Cubans' power was an old story, their uniforms were
new one-piece outfits resembling gymnastic tights. Peru sported
similar uniforms in its 15-8, 15-6, 15-3 loss to Japan.
	   Another new feature in the tournament is the use of ``libero''
players, who are barred from an attacking role but can be freely
substituted as receivers. They wear different color uniforms than
their teammates.
	   In their Group B game, the Americans sent in libero Laura Davis,
wearing white to contrast with her teammates' dark blue, to receive
55 times, including 27 serves. She missed only eight.
	   Cuba needed one hour and 16 minutes to beat the United States,
which placed sixth in the previous world championship in San Paulo,
Brazil, in 1994.
	   Playing before 4,000 spectators at Tokuyama, western Japan,
Allison Weston led the American team with 5 points, including 3
attack points.
	   ``Cuba is simply too strong for us at this moment,'' said U.S.
coach Michael Haley. ``We played very hard, and we are sure that we
can be successful in the remaining part of this round robin.''
	   In the other Group B game, Italy defeated Bulgaria 15-12, 15-10,
15-6.
	   In Group A, aside from Japan's victory, the Netherlands beat
Kenya 15-7, 15-1, 15-6.
	   Russia, the 1994 bronze medalist, beat silver medalist Brazil
15-7, 15-6, 15-11 in a Group C game. The Dominican Republic
defeated Germany 1-15, 15-11, 15-6, 7-15, 17-15.
	   Olympic silver medalist China beat Thailand 15-9, 15-2, 15-5 in
Group D. South Korea defeated Croatia 15-12, 9-15, 15-12, 7-15,
15-11.
	   The top three teams in each of the four-team groups, playing in
four different Japanese cities, will advance to the quarterfinal
round Nov. 7-9 in Nagoya and Fukuoka. The semifinals and finals
will be played Nov. 11-12 in Osaka.
	   The world championship for men will be played in Japan Nov.
13-29.

Slaying of Catholic man no `excuse to kill,' priest tells mourners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The random slaying of a
Catholic man should send a warning to Northern Ireland's
politicians that they must not fail in their peacemaking efforts,
the priest presiding over his funeral said Tuesday.
	   Several hundred mourners filled Holy Cross Catholic Church _ on
the dividing line between Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods in
polarized north Belfast _ to bid farewell to Brian Service, shot as
he walked home alone Saturday.
	   ``The Service family want no one to use Brian's death as an
excuse to kill,'' said the priest, the Rev. Ken Brady. ``Rather,
they want our politicians to work more determinedly together for
peace. ... The price of failure, as we experience this morning, is
too great.''
	   Service's slaying was claimed in the name of the Red Hand
Defenders, which authorities suspect is a cover name for dissenting
members of one of Northern Ireland's established pro-British
paramilitary groups.
	   All four groups are supposed to be observing cease-fires.
	   Service, 35, was killed on the same day that politicians missed
an important deadline in April's peace agreement, specifying that
the new Northern Ireland government should hold an inaugural summit
with the Irish government by the end of October.
	   But David Trimble, elected in July to lead Northern Ireland's
new cabinet-style administration, is refusing to form any
government that includes Sinn Fein politicians until the party's
Irish Republican Army allies start to disarm.
	   Trimble is leader of the major British Protestant party, the
Ulster Unionists.

Czech doctor charged with sexual abuse of minors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A doctor in the south Moravia
region has been charged with sexual abusing at least 100 children
and faces eight years in jail if convicted, police said Tuesday.
	   Zdenek Lubas, police spokesman in Brno, 200 kilometers (125
miles) southeast of Prague, said the 40-year-old doctor was a
researcher in a project dealing with the prevention of diseases in
adolescence.
	   About 300 children from 20 schools in Brno were chosen to take
part in the project, which ran for one month, Lubas said. The
project was halted in June after parents complained about the
doctor's behavior.
	   The doctor allegedly was examining the children in an
inappropriate way and took pictures of them naked.
	   ``So far, we know about 100 cases,'' Lubas said. ``But we are
sure that the number of children examined and photographed by the
doctor will be much higher, some 200.''
	   Pictures of some of the children were found in the doctor's
apartment during a police search.

Ukrainian police suspect central bank branch of embezzling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian police have prevented a regional
branch of the central bank from channeling a large sum of money
abroad on suspicion that the deal might be illegal, a newspaper
said Tuesday.
	   Investigators are trying to determine who was behind an attempt
to transfer nearly 80 million hryvna (dlrs 23.4 million) to a
Latvian bank from the Vinnytsia regional branch of the National
Bank of Ukraine, the daily Segodnya said.
	   The transaction apparently was disguised as payment for energy
imports.
	   The deal, which was to have taken place at the end of October,
was suspended after preliminary examination of the contract
indicated it might be fictitious, Segodnya said.
	   No other details were released.
	   Police said the scheme was similar many illegal deals used
before to channel large sums of money out of Ukraine, according to
Segodnya.

Taiwan's chief of staff met Cohen, discussed missile system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's chief of general staff discussed
missile defense and other security issues with U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen last month in Washington, the Defense
Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The chief, Tang Fei, and U.S. officials discussed factors
involved in including Taiwan in the Theater Missile Defense, a
system to intercept missiles over a large swath of the Asia Pacific
region, said ministry spokesman Gen. Kung Fan-ding.
	   Kung did not say whether the discussions, held between Oct. 17
and 31 in Washington, had resulted in any conclusions.
	   He said news of Tang's visit was suppressed to prevent protests
from China, which claims Taiwan as a breakaway province to be
reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.
	   China is fiercely opposed to Taiwan's inclusion in any regional
security agreement and lists funding of Theater Missile Defense
among examples of policies it says are aimed at containing China's
growing power and influence.
	   Kung said the sides also discussed ``issues of concern to U.S.
and Taiwanese defense,'' and U.S. officials reiterated Washington's
commitment to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. That law, enacted when
Washington broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979, requires
Washington to ensure Taiwan has an adequate defense capability and
to view seriously any act of aggression against the island.
	   Other officials at the meetings included Kurt Campbell, deputy
assistant defense secretary for the Asia-Pacific region, and Gen.
Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Kung said.

U.S. investors refurbish tank factory in inland China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUPERT HAYES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUMA, China (AP) _ The brown dusty valleys of northern China
once protected some of the military complexes that supplied the
army from inland China. When the country pared down production of
old-style armaments, empty factories were left behind.
	   In China's struggles with conversion to civilian production and
re-employment, American investment banker Jack Perkowski saw an
opportunity.
	   Perkowski's Asian Strategic Investments Corp., or ASIMCO,
Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar Inc. and a Chinese partner,
CITIC Machinery Manufacturing Inc., on Friday opened an engine
castings plant in a refurbished foundry that once made armored
tanks.
	   The three companies project a dlrs 98.5 million investment.
ASIMCO owns 57 percent of the shares with Caterpillar and CITIC
Machinery splitting the rest.
	   ``This investment comes at a time when world financial markets
are in turmoil and flows of capital into developing countries such
as China are shrinking,'' Perkowski said at the opening ceremony.
	   The investors chose this part of southern Shanxi province, where
villagers were just finishing the winter wheat planting, to save
money on labor, raw materials _ and capital expenses, because the
foundry was already built, Perkowski said in an interview.
	   Shanxi, in north-central China, is the nation's leading coal
producer. Many of the debt-ridden state factories in the heavily
industrialized province have laid off workers.
	   The Chinese government is encouraging foreign investors to look
past the developed east coast and invest in more backward areas in
the interior, like Houma, to help reduce the gap between rich and
poor.
	   Fearing coastal attacks, during the Cold War, revolutionary
leader Mao Tse-tung ordered the country to move military production
inland. The legacy of what was called the ``Third Front'' policy is
an industrial infrastructure and a large pool of skilled workers in
remote, mountainous regions like southern Shanxi.
	   Many of the skilled workers at the tank foundry and seven other
military factories in several complexes in rural Shanxi were
transferred there during the early 1970s from eastern industrial
cities.
	   Many retirees moved back east, and unmarried, young laid-off
workers have joined the tens of millions of migrant workers who
seek jobs in the cities.
	   But many others, especially married people with children, stayed
behind, jobless and restless beside the empty or underused
factories.
	   The new venture, Shanxi International Casting Corp., will train
and employ about 600 workers.
	   A worldwide shortage of high-quality engine castings means the
new foundry's order books are full, ASIMCO chairman Perkowski said.
	   In the United States and Europe, it is hard for companies to
find communities willing to accept heavily polluting foundries. The
industry is a natural market for a developing country such as
China, he said.
	   While China also is trying to combat pollution, with millions of
workers joining unemployment lines, it is in no position to turn
away such investments.
	   Liu Zhenhua, vice governor of Shanxi, said the province has more
than 100,000 unemployed laborers. The government and industry need
to work together to solve the problem of unemployment, he said.
	   ASIMCO is one of the biggest foreign investment corporations in
China, employing 24,000 people in 10 Chinese provinces. The company
supplies components and partially assembled vehicles to the
automotive, agricultural machinery and motorcycle industries.

EU approves dlrs 7.7 million in aid for victims of Hurricane Mitch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with Mitch &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved
6.4 million European currency units (dlrs 7.7 million) in aid for
thousands of victims of the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch
in Central America.
	   EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used to
provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and
blankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by
torrential rains and mudslides.
	   The aid will be distributed in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras
and Guatemala which have most suffered from Mitch's deadly passage,
the EU executive Commission said in a statement.
	   Officials in Central America estimated Tuesday that about 7,000
people have died in the region.
	   The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, where an
estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _ 10 percent of the
population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's
storm.
	   El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174 dead, 96
missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own regional affiliate in San
Miguel province reported 125 dead there alone. Guatemala reported
100 storm-related deaths.
	   The latest EU aid follows an initial 400,000 ecu (dlrs 480,000).
the EU approved for the region on Friday. The full 6.8 million ecu
(dlrs 8.18 million) will be channeled through humanitarian groups
working in the region.

Gov't authorizes future talks with groups close to ETA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prime minister confirming contacts, details,
background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said
Tuesday he had authorized talks with organizations linked to the
armed Basque separatist group ETA, marking the first time the
government has taken steps to negotiate an end to the 30-year
conflict.
	   ``There are news reports that I have authorized contacts. It's
true,'' Aznar said upon his return from a trip to London.
	   The contacts would be through the Basque National Liberation
Front, a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist
organizations, a spokesman for Aznar's office said on the condition
of anonymity.
	   ``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take
place with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' the spokesman said.
``We cannot say anything yet about the how, who and when.''
	   The official government spokesman, Josep Pique, told reporters
that the contacts were aimed at exploring possibilities opened up
by the cease-fire, ``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to
give up violence for good.''
	   The Basque peace process was ushered in nearly two months ago
when ETA initiated an indefinite cease-fire in its campaign for a
Basque homeland straddling northern Spain and southern France.
	   Groups close to ETA said the truce was modeled on the Northern
Irish process that led to last April's peace accord and called on
the government to promote a negotiated settlement as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had done in Northern Ireland.
	   Irish republican leader Gerry Adams visited the Basque region
last month and urged Aznar's government to respond positively to
the cease-fire by opening negotiations for peace.
	   A group of Basque political parties and organizations known as
the Irish Forum secured Adams' backing for its proposal, known as
the Lizarra Declaration, for all-party peace talks, including the
government and ETA.
	   The government rejected the proposal at the time.
	   The government's tough stand against ETA, resulting in many
arrests and earlier this year the dismantling of a major ETA
financial network and the closing of an allied daily newspaper, is
believed to have been a factor in bringing about the cease-fire.
	   The Irish Forum includes Herri Batasuna, the radical political
coalition linked to ETA, as well as moderate Basque nationalist
parties, labor unions and civic groups.
	   The government's hard-line position of rejecting peace
negotiations with ETA or legal organizations linked to it has
softened gradually since the cease-fire and since regional
elections on Oct. 25.
	   Recently, the government let it be known ETA would not be
required to hand over its weapons before peace talks could be held
covering such issues as the future of 535 ETA prisoners being held
in Spanish jails.
	   Aznar's Popular Party and Euskal Herritarok, a political
coalition linked to ETA, came in second and third respectively in
last month's Basque regional elections. The moderate Basque
Nationalist Party that supports ETA aims but opposes its violence
placed first.
	   Euskal Herritarok said the elections showed that Basques wanted
to see political negotiations to resolve the dispute over Basque
independence _ one of the last armed conflicts in Western Europe.
	   The government said it interpreted the election results to mean
that many Basques do not want independence.
	   ETA, which stands in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   Before the truce, the group had been targeting town councilors
from Aznar's Popular Party in retaliation for the government's
hard-line policies, killing six since July last year.

Date of next S.African election to be announced next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Lawmakers on Tuesday failed to
approve constitutional amendments that would have allowed President
Nelson Mandela to promptly announce a date for South Africa's
second all-race election.
	   Because discussion on the amendments hit a snag, naming a date
for the 1999 election will only occur next year at the earliest,
when parliament reconvenes.
	   As currently written, the 1996 constitution does not allow
Mandela to declare an election date before the five-year mandate of
his government runs out in April. The election must be held within
the following three months.
	   Lawmakers of all parties want to change the law to allow the
date to be announced sooner, giving election organizers more time
to organize the balloting and allowing politicians more time for
campaigning.
	   However, discussions snagged on a clause that would shift the
power to call local elections in South Africa's nine regions from
provincial heads to the president.
	   The ruling African National Congress supports the change, saying
it allows both national and local elections to be held on the same
day, while opposition parties see it as an erosion of provincial
rights.
	   A committee dealing with the amendments decided to postpone
further discussion on the issue until parliament reconvenes in
February.
	   Parliament adjourned in September but was in special session
this week to consider legislation it didn't manage to attend to
during the normal term.
	   Unless the constitution is amended, the earliest Mandela can
call elections is on April 30, according to his office.

Pope appeals for aid for hurricane survivors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II offered prayers for the
more than 7,000 killed by Hurricane Mitch and appealed for aid for
the survivors Tuesday.
	   The Vatican sent its condolences through the papal nuncio in
Nicaragua, the country hardest-hit by the storm.
	   John Paul ``prayed for the eternal rest of the deceased and
asked God to console those affected by the tragedy,'' the message
said.
	   ``At the same time, His Holiness urged institutions and all men
of good faith moved by feelings of fraternal solidarity and
Christian charity to lend their help to overcome these difficult
moments.''
	   The pontiff asked the nuncio, Monsignor Luigi Travaglino, to
relay ``his paternal solicitude and feelings of closeness to the
injured and homeless to whom he sends, from his heart, the
comforting apostolic benediction as a sign to all those affected
among the beloved Nicaraguan people.''

France it's study dates for Khatami visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French Foreign Ministry said Tuesday a date has
not yet been set for the visit of Iranian President Mohamed
Khatami.
	   ``The exact dates are currently under study,'' said ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret, responding to a Monday report in
the newspaper Le Monde that Khatami would visit France in February.
	   Le Monde cited Iranian Ambassador Ali-Reza Moayeri.
	   Gazeau-Secret expressed France's pleasure that Khatami has
accepted the invitation to visit France, but added that the date
has not yet been decided upon.
	   Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine extended an official invitation
to Khatami during his visit to Tehran in August. Vedrine's was the
highest level French visit to Iran in seven years.
	   It would be Khatami's first trip to a European nation since
taking office in August 1997.
	   The Iranian leader has expressed the wish to improve relations
with the West, particularly the European Union.

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ As floodwaters receded and
communications improved, Central America on Tuesday began grasping
the ``panorama of death'' in the wake of Hurricane Mitch, which
killed an estimated 7,000 people and wiped whole villages off the
map.
	   The greatest devastation was reported in Honduras, where an
estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 _ 10 percent of the
population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's
storm. Countless more were lacking fresh water, food and medicine.
	   Nicaragua's death toll was also high. Official preliminary
figures showed 1,330 dead and 1,903 missing nationwide.
	   Pope John Paul II expressed condolences Tuesday and urged
worldwide aid to help Central America ``overcome these difficult
moments.''
	   Appealing for international help, Honduran President Carlos
Flores Facusse said Monday ``the floods and landslides erased from
the map many villages and households as well as whole neighborhoods
of cities.''
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin in
all of the national territory,'' he said in a nationally broadcast
speech.
	   ``There are corpses everywhere,'' the president said. ``The most
conservative calculations of the dead are in the thousands, not in
the hundreds.''
	   Many parts of Honduras remained cut off almost a week after
Mitch barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290
kph) winds. The storm pounded across the isthmus, dropping up to 25
inches (63 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, before
dissipating Monday in southern Mexico.
	   Virtually all of Honduras was flooded, from the lowland marshes
on the Atlantic Coast to the mountains, hills and plateaus of the
interior.
	   Responding to widespread looting and vandalism, Flores Facusse
suspended constitutional liberties for two weeks, enabling
authorities to seize property, detain suspects and conduct
unlimited searches. People were ordered off the streets between 9
p.m. and 5 a.m.
	   In Nicaragua, as many as 1,500 people may have died in mudslides
when the crater lake of the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a
wall of mud and debris onto villages below.
	   By late Monday, soldiers had found 808 bodies in the mudslide
area. Local civil defense officials said they planned to go into
the disaster area on Tuesday and burn bodies to lower the risk of
disease.
	   Nicaraguan Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said in a
telephone interview Monday night that there had been another small
mudslide on the northern slope of the volcano, but there were no
apparent casualties. More than 30 houses were destroyed, he said.
	   Miguel Angel Ortiz told of waiting three days with his family on
a hilltop under pouring rain after a wave of mud, trees and rocks
crashed down on the village of El Ojochal.
	   Running to the top of a hill, they were among few in the village
lucky enough to get out in time.
	   Help never came and they finally walked out Monday because of
hunger and thirst.
	   ``There was no food, no water and a lot of disease, a lot of
death,'' said the 33-year-old. ``We needed to get out of there.''
	   Among the hurricane casualties in other Central American
countries, El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 174
dead, 96 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own regional
affiliate in San Miguel province reported 125 dead there alone.
	   Guatemala reported 100 storm-related deaths. A plane crash
Sunday in western Guatemala blamed on Mitch's remnants killed 10
U.S. missionaries of the Living Water Teaching Mission and their
Guatemalan pilot, doctors said.
	   Mexico reported one storm-related death.
	   The International Red Cross on Monday tripled its appeal for
assistance to dlrs 7.4 million.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the U.S. government
was providing dlrs 2 million in food, medicine, water and other
relief supplies.
	   U.S. military aid flights began arriving Monday in Honduras and
were distributing aid Tuesday in Nicaragua, where officials said
that as of Tuesday they would fine people who exploit the crisis to
raise prices on basic foods
	   Nicaragua's government, however, rejected Cuba's offer of
doctors but accepted medicine from the Communist island.

Council of Europe opens trim new human rights court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with inauguration opening, quotes; EDITS to conform

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The Council of Europe inaugurated a
streamlined European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France,
Tuesday which it hopes will deal faster with a rapidly increasing
number of citizens' complaints.
	   ``Nearly 800 million Europeans will have access to this court,''
Daniel Tarschys, the secretary-general of the Council of Europe,
told the inauguration ceremony.
	   ``With 40 judges and a jurisdiction spanning from Nuuk in
Greenland to Petropavlovsk, in Kamchatka (in the Russian far east)
... this will be the largest permanent court in the world,''
Tarschys said.
	   The new court will work full-time, unlike the old one which
operated just one week every month and handled about 100 cases a
year, said council spokeswoman Kathy Burton.
	   ``We're hoping the new system will speed up the procedure quite
dramatically,'' Burton said. Under the old court system set up in
1950, rulings often took years.
	   Already this year, 4,791 cases have been registered, the Council
of Europe said in a statement.
	   Under the new system, a human rights commission which examined
cases before they went to court will be scrapped so cases come
before judges sooner.
	   The court rules on infringements of the 1950 European Human
Rights Convention which is signed by all 40 nations in the Council
of Europe. Citizens from those nations can bring cases to the
European court after they have exhausted legal options in their
home countries.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge filed an extradition
request Tuesday that seeks to bring former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet from London to face charges of genocide, terrorism
and torture in Spain.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose earlier detention order resulted in
Pinochet's arrest in London on Oct. 16, sent his extradition
request to the Justice Ministry, which in turn could present it to
a Cabinet meeting Friday, sources close to the judge told
reporters.
	   Sources close to the Judge Baltasar Garzon said the petition
could be made ready later in the day and passed onto the Justice
Ministry which in turn would likely present it at Friday's cabinet
meeting.
	   Although eager not to upset political and economic ties with
Chile, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has promised his
government will not block a request for extradition.

Netanyahu links Cabinet approval of peace deal to security plan

saying the Palestinians have kept their promises, Arafat leaving

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In the latest disruption of the new Mideast
peace agreement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed a
Tuesday Cabinet meeting during which the accord was to have been
ratified.
	   Netanyahu said he ordered the delay because the Palestinians
have not submitted a complete blueprint for fighting terrorism, but
would not say what was missing from the security plan.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Israel is holding out
for a list of 30 wanted Palestinians the Palestinian Authority has
promised to arrest as part of the peace agreement. Israel is also
seeking a timetable for the arrests, Mordechai said.
	   Implementation of the 12-week land-for-security agreement cannot
begin until it has been approved by Israel's Cabinet and the
parliament. The original startup date for the agreement was Monday.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily to Netanyahu's decision to
postpone the Cabinet meeting, which had been scheduled for Tuesday
afternoon.
	   ``Instead of playing these sorry political games, he (Netanyahu)
should just stand up and say ... I won't implement what I have
signed,'' said Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   The Palestinians have said they have handed a security plan to
the United States, as required. The United States has promised to
brief Israel on the plan, but not present it as a document.
	   Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in the Gaza
Strip, said the security plan was presented to the United States,
to the satisfaction of U.S. officials.
	   Dahlan, who played a key role in putting together the
anti-terror plan, said he also discussed the plan with Israeli
security officials. The Israeli officers deemed the Palestinian
plan sufficient, he said.
	   Israel radio said Netanyahu would try to work out the problem in
a telephone call to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. However,
Arafat left for Spain, as scheduled, in mid-afternoon, and there
were no signs that the dispute had been resolved.
	   Netanyahu appeared to be contradicting the Clinton
administration when he said Tuesday that the Palestinians had not
delivered everything they promised.
	   James Rubin, the U.S. State Department spokesman, said Monday
that ``the necessary plans were provided on time, prior to entry
into force (of the agreement).''
	   The approval of the peace agreement in Israel's Cabinet does not
appear to be a certainty, with at least six of the 18 Cabinet
ministers reportedly undecided and three opposed.
	   In hopes of broadening support, Netanyahu on Monday released
four U.S. letters of guarantees to Israel.
	   In one letter, the United States addresses a key Israeli
concern, Arafat's plan to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state
in May, the end of the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy. In
the letter, U.S. Ambassador Edward Walker says the United States
opposes such a move.
	   However, the Palestinians were assured that in disputes with
Israel over implementation, U.S. officials would ``vouch for'' the
Palestinians publicly whenever appropriate, said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   The latest setback came a day after Netanyahu and Arafat
overcame another hurdle in a rare show of good will.
	   On Monday, the day the peace accord was to have taken effect,
Arafat agreed to a request by Netanyahu to a delay so the agreement
could be approved by Israel's Cabinet and the Knesset. The Knesset
vote is set for Nov. 12.
	   Netanyahu told Arafat that despite the delay he would do his
best to carry out the initial Israeli troop withdrawal in the West
Bank on or around Nov. 16, the original date stipulated in the
agreement.
	   Also Tuesday, a leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas said
more than 300 activists have been rounded up by Palestinian
security forces since last week's suicide attack on an Israeli
convoy in the Gaza Strip.
	   Palestinian security official said earlier this week that they
had arrested more than 100 suspected Islamic militants. They have
refused to update the figure.
	   A senior Arafat aide, meanwhile, said Palestinian security
agents foiled Iranian-backed attempts by Hamas to assassinate
Arafat and senior Palestinian Authority officials.
	   Iran is training and funding a secret Hamas group to carry out
the assassinations as well as suicide bombings in Israel, said
Tayyeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of the Palestinian
Authority.
	   Last week, Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, sharply
criticized Arafat, calling him a traitor for signing the latest
peace agreement with Israel.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indicating that members of the
military contributed to the downfall of former President Suharto, a
government fact-finding team said Tuesday that some security
officials incited deadly riots just before his ouster.
	   A report by the panel also disputes military claims that no mass
rapes were committed during the riots on May 13-15. It concluded
instead that 66 women, many of them ethnic Chinese, were raped.
	   The release of the harshly critical report is a further blow to
the credibility of the tarnished Indonesian military, which is
caught between widespread allegations of human rights abuses under
Suharto and a new role as a promoter of democratic reform.
	   It comes as the military is preparing a huge security operation
to protect a government assembly that will cast guidelines next
week for general elections in 1999. Student activists plan to
protest, saying the government is not moving fast enough on
political reform.
	   After three months of investigation, a team set up by Suharto's
successor, President B.J. Habibie, said that some military
officials urged crowds in parts of Jakarta, the capital, to loot
and burn in a wave of unrest that left 1,200 people dead.
	   ``The riots in Jakarta can be described as an effort to topple
the power unconstitutionally,'' said Marzuki Darusman, chairman of
the panel that includes human rights activists, senior police
officers, lawyers, bureaucrats and community leaders.
	   At a news conference, Darusman acknowledged that much of the
unrest was sparked by anger over price increases amid Indonesia's
worst economic crisis in decades.
	   He did not speculate on who was trying to topple the government
or whether military involvement in the riots was approved by the
institution, or was an act of individual officers. Without
elaborating, he said infighting between political elites also
helped provoke the riots.
	   He urged the military to court-martial former Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto who was fired from his post as
commander of Indonesia's special forces after admitting to
involvement in the kidnapping of nine political activists.
	   Darusman also said the government should investigate Maj. Gen.
Syafrie Sjamsuddin, an ally of Prabowo who was head of the Jakarta
military at the time of the riots. Sjamsuddin was later handed a
less prominent post.
	   Some government opponents have alleged military hard-liners
provoked the riots because they wanted an excuse to crack down on
dissidents, a charge that the military has vehemently denied.
	   The government-backed investigators said the military bungled
efforts to restore order in Jakarta, in many cases ignoring looters
or taking payoffs to guard terrified ethnic Chinese.
	   ``We found the involvement of security officials who also
benefited or commercialized their security service for protection
in several places,'' Darusman said.
	   ``The security officers in several places let the riots
happen,'' he said.
	   The Chinese minority, which dominates the economy, has been a
frequent target of attacks as Indonesia endures a period of
prolonged economic hardship. Many Chinese-owned shops and homes
were attacked and burned.
	   The riots in Jakarta erupted after police fired on a crowd of
student demonstrators on May 12, killing four. Suharto quit on May
21, bowing to overwhelming opposition to his 32-year authoritarian
rule.
	   The conclusions of the investigators were based on extensive
interviews with witnesses, said Bambang Widjojanto, a human rights
lawyer who is on the government panel.
	   Some witnesses have said they saw men with short, military-style
haircuts roaming Jakarta and other cities in trucks and urging
crowds to riot. Some of the men were armed.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge filed an extradition
request Tuesday to bring former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet from London to face charges of genocide, terrorism and
torture in Spain.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose earlier detention order resulted in
Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest in London, sent his extradition request
to Spain's Justice Ministry, which could present it Friday to a
Cabinet meeting, sources close to the judge told reporters.

France relays temporary arrest warrant for Pinochet to Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French court on Tuesday relayed a temporary
arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to
British authorities, judicial officials said.
	   The temporary arrest order is the final step necessary before
France can officially ask for Pinochet's extradition, the officials
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   On Monday, French Judge Roger Le Loire issued an international
arrest warrant for Pinochet on charges of ``sequestration followed
by torture.'' That step was also required for France to ask Britain
to hand over Pinochet.
	   Last week, a lawyer representing three French families whose
relatives disappeared in Chile after Pinochet took power in 1973
filed a complaint with a French court, asking for Pinochet's
extradition to face charges of crimes against humanity.
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested in a central London hospital Oct. 16
after undergoing back surgery.
	   England's High Court ruled last week that Pinochet was immune
from prosecution as a former head of state. He was granted bail,
but remains under police guard at another hospital in north London.
	   British prosecutors _ acting on behalf of a Spanish magistrate
seeking the former Chilean dictator's extradition on allegations of
murder, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year rule _ have until
the end of the business day Monday to appeal formally.
	   Switzerland has also requested Pinochet's arrest and extradition
on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says some
3,000 people disappeared during Pinochet's rule.

Chilean exiles file compaints against Pinochet in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two new complaints; ADDS details of European
countries with complaints or extradition requests &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Five Chilean exiles have filed
complaints against former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
accusing him of responsibility for their arrest, kidnap and torture
in Chile in 1973, prosecutors said Tuesday.
	   A Chilean man who has since gained German citizenship has
accused Pinochet of responsibility in his kidnap and torture, and
of the disappearance and probable murder of his brother in 1976 in
papers filed in a Hanover court.
	   A Chilean woman, who also since became a German citizen, accused
Pinochet of depriving her of personal liberty and causing bodily
harm during her arrest and torture, according to a complaint filed
in Cologne.
	   A third complaint, filed in Hamburg on behalf of two Chilean
exiles who have German citizenship and a Chilean expatriate, accuse
Pinochet of genocide, murder, crimes against humanity, deprivation
of personal liberty and causing serious bodily harm.
	   Prosecutors were determining whether Germany has jurisdiction in
the cases, since neither Chilean was a German citizen when the
events happened, and whether the charges were still valid 25 years
after the fact.
	   The legal actions were the latest by Chilean exiles who claim to
have suffered under Pinochet's 17-year rule since Britain's High
Court ruled illegal the dictator's arrest in London on a Spanish
warrant seeking his extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping
and torture.
	   Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, is expected to rule
this week on an appeal to the High Court ruling that Pinochet is
immune from prosecution as a former head of state. The judges were
expected to uphold the ruling, meaning that Britain would be
unlikely to honor other extradition requests, should the new cases
advance that far.
	   Chilean exiles in Belgium, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and
France have independently filed complaints similar to the ones in
Germany seeking either Pinochet's prosecution or extradition:
	   _France issued an international arrest warrant Monday.
	   _Switzerland has requested Pinochet's extradition.
	   _In Sweden, criminal complaints have been filed.
	   _In Belgium, six Chilean exiles launched legal proceedings to
have Pinochet extradited there if the Spanish bid fails.
	   _In Norway, a Chilean exile has filed a complaint alleging
Pinochet was responsible for the disappearance of two friends in
1974.
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says more
than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's
rule.

Lara, Hooper pull out of South Africa tour citing fees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Captain Brian Lara and vice captain
Carl Hooper have pulled out of the West Indies' tour of South
Africa in a dispute over fees, the West Indies Cricket Board said
Tuesday.
	   ``They have voiced concern over the fees for the tour of South
Africa,'' a statement from the board said.
	   WICB members are to hold an emergency meeting Wednesday to
discuss the natter at its headquarters in Antigua, and was inviting
the two players to to attend, the statement said.
	   It quoted board president Pat Rousseau as saying that fees for
the tour had been agreed with the West Indian Players Association.
Rousseau ``said that the players' action was therefore particularly
surprising and went against the instructions issued in writing by
the manager, Clive Lloyd,'' according to the statement.
	   Lara, the world record holder for runs in a test innings, is no
stranger to controversy. The Trinidadian had been fined or warned
by the West Indies Cricket Board for breaching its code of
discipline four times in the three years before he was named
captain in January.
	   In June, Warwickshire county cricket officials fined Lara 2,000
pounds (dlrs 3,260) for arriving too late to lead his English team
in a crucial league match. It was the second time in the season
that Lara had been delayed in the West Indies after missing his
flight back to England.
	   The Barbados Nation newspaper noted Tuesday that Lara had spoke
enthusiastically about the upcoming South Africa tour as recently
as Sunday, in Bangladesh, saying the team was beginning to gel.
	   Rousseau said it was his understanding that the rest of the team
was traveling to South Africa from Bangladesh, where it played for
the West Indies in the Wills International Cup.
	   It lost to South Africa in the Wills final on Sunday.
	   The South Africa tour only starts Nov. 10 with a one-day warmup
match, but players were expected to exercise until then to prepare
for the first full series between the two teams _ five tests and
seven one-day internationals.
	   Their only previous test was at London's Kensington Oval in
1992. The West Indies won the test, which was South Africa's first
since it was readmitted to the international cricket following its
ban due to apartheid.

Gov't authorizes future talks with groups close to ETA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of grouping in 3rd graf to Basque National
Liberation Movement sted Basque National Liberation Front &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said
Tuesday he had authorized talks with organizations linked to the
armed Basque separatist group ETA, marking the first time the
government has taken steps to negotiate an end to the 30-year
conflict.
	   ``There are news reports that I have authorized contacts. It's
true,'' Aznar said upon his return from a trip to London.
	   The contacts would be through the Basque National Liberation
Movement, a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist
organizations, a spokesman for Aznar's office said on the condition
of anonymity.
	   ``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take
place with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' the spokesman said.
``We cannot say anything yet about the how, who and when.''
	   The official government spokesman, Josep Pique, told reporters
that the contacts were aimed at exploring possibilities opened up
by the cease-fire, ``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to
give up violence for good.''
	   The Basque peace process was ushered in nearly two months ago
when ETA initiated an indefinite cease-fire in its campaign for a
Basque homeland straddling northern Spain and southern France.
	   Groups close to ETA said the truce was modeled on the Northern
Irish process that led to last April's peace accord and called on
the government to promote a negotiated settlement as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had done in Northern Ireland.
	   Irish republican leader Gerry Adams visited the Basque region
last month and urged Aznar's government to respond positively to
the cease-fire by opening negotiations for peace.
	   A group of Basque political parties and organizations known as
the Irish Forum secured Adams' backing for its proposal, known as
the Lizarra Declaration, for all-party peace talks, including the
government and ETA.
	   The government rejected the proposal at the time.
	   The government's tough stand against ETA, resulting in many
arrests and earlier this year the dismantling of a major ETA
financial network and the closing of an allied daily newspaper, is
believed to have been a factor in bringing about the cease-fire.
	   The Irish Forum includes Herri Batasuna, the radical political
coalition linked to ETA, as well as moderate Basque nationalist
parties, labor unions and civic groups.
	   The government's hard-line position of rejecting peace
negotiations with ETA or legal organizations linked to it has
softened gradually since the cease-fire and since regional
elections on Oct. 25.
	   Recently, the government let it be known ETA would not be
required to hand over its weapons before peace talks could be held
covering such issues as the future of 535 ETA prisoners being held
in Spanish jails.
	   Aznar's Popular Party and Euskal Herritarrok, a political
coalition linked to ETA, came in second and third respectively in
last month's Basque regional elections. The moderate Basque
Nationalist Party that supports ETA aims but opposes its violence
placed first.
	   Euskal Herritarrok said the elections showed that Basques wanted
to see political negotiations to resolve the dispute over Basque
independence _ one of the last armed conflicts in Western Europe.
	   The government said it interpreted the election results to mean
that many Basques do not want independence.
	   ETA, which stands in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   Before the truce, the group had been targeting town councilors
from Aznar's Popular Party in retaliation for the government's
hard-line policies, killing six since July last year.

Suspected WWII concentration camp guard proclaims innocence

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 13-15 with attorney outlining defense
strategy &QL; 
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A 72-year-old Croat woman suspected of
torturing inmates in the country's most notorious World War II camp
declared Tuesday the charges are groundless, her attorney said.
	   Nada Sakic, who was extradited from Argentina on Monday, met
with an investigative judge from the Zagreb district court, Mirjana
Rigljan, in the first step toward determining whether she will be
indicted for war crimes.
	   Her husband Dinko, 76, is already imprisoned here, facing war
crimes charges.
	   Mrs. Sakic was extradited on a warrant accusing her of
``carrying out torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as
terror, intimidation and collective punishment of civilians,''
which led to the deaths of an unknown number of inmates.
	   As a teen-ager, Mrs. Sakic allegedly was a guard from 1942-45 in
the women's block in the Stara Gradiska camp, part of the Jasenovac
concentration camp complex.
	   Dinko Sakic, extradited from Argentina in June, is suspected of
ordering, witnessing and participating in the war crimes committed
in the Jasenovac camp he commanded between 1942 and 1944.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist Croats
were killed at Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than 20
concentration camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet
state.
	   After hearing the charges, Mrs. Sakic said she ``doesn't even
want to respond to such false accusations,'' her attorney Branko
Seric told reporters.
	   ``She didn't want to present her defense because she thinks the
charges are groundless,'' Seric said. Asked whether she thereby
feels not guilty, he replied: ``Absolutely.''
	   The district court will now hear witnesses.
	   Mrs. Sakic, who suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, spent
the night in Zagreb's main prison, where her husband also is
imprisoned. But the two have not met, pending approval from prison
authorities, Seric said.
	   The Sakics married in late 1944, after apparently meeting each
other through Maks Luburic, Nada's half-brother and Dinko Sakic's
superior. Luburic was in charge of all World War II camps in
Croatia.
	   Some Croatian media claimed Nada was actually put into Stara
Gradiska by Luburic, who wanted the young sister, left without
parents, to be safe and taken care of by his subordinates.
According to these claims, she did wear a uniform, but was not a
camp guard and did not participate in any of the developments
there.
	   Seric indicated that will be her defense, saying ``That is
exactly what happened.''
	   ``She was in the camp by a combination of circumstances, not as
an official in charge of doing things that she is now accused of,''
he said.

Interior minister calls for higher government wages to stem
</HEADLINE>
corruption &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 5,500 Russian officials are under
investigation for taking bribes this year, and Russia's economic
troubles are creating a breeding ground for corruption, the
interior minister said Tuesday.
	   ``A poverty-stricken official is always prone to crime,'' Sergei
Stepashin told a news conference.
	   He called for increasing salaries of police and other officials,
sharply devalued by a steep dive of the Russian currency since the
government stopped propping up the ruble in August.
	   Russian police have undertaken a massive effort to combat graft,
including corruption in its own ranks, but the problem has
continued to plague the government, Stepashin said.
	   ``We are especially concerned about corruption on the grassroots
level, such as bribe-taking among traffic police and various small
offices,'' he said.
	   Stepashin urged the government to radically streamline the
bureaucracy to reduce the opportunities for bribery.
	   Last week, Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent liberal lawmaker and a
presidential hopeful, caused an uproar when he said Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's new government is as prone to corruption as its
predecessors.
	   On Monday, Yavlinsky specified his accusations in a letter sent
to Primakov, urging him to investigate past business connections of
several high-ranking Cabinet members and their lobbying efforts for
business interests.
	   Primakov criticized Yavlinsky for failing to provide evidence,
but instructed his aides to investigate into the accusations and
prepare a detailed response.
	   The Prosecutor General's office, meanwhile, has ordered a
preliminary investigation on possible libel charges against
Yavlinsky over the allegations.
	   Stepashin on Tuesday described Yavlinsky's accusations as a
publicity effort and called on him to provide hard facts.
	   Yavlinsky, in his turn, has said that he simply wanted to draw
public attention to the problem and it remained up to police and
prosecutors to collect specific evidence.

 &UR; Spanish judge petitions for Pinochet extradition &QL;  Eds: EDITS to
drop erroneous 3rd graf; ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spanish judge filed an extradition
request Tuesday that seeks to bring former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet from London to face charges of genocide, terrorism
and torture in Spain.
	   Judge Baltasar Garzon, whose earlier detention order resulted in
Pinochet's arrest in London on Oct. 16, sent his extradition
request to the Justice Ministry, which in turn could present it to
a Cabinet meeting Friday, sources close to the judge told
reporters.
	   Although eager not to upset political and economic ties with
Chile, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has promised his
Cabinet will not block a request for extradition.
	   The government has until Nov. 25 _ Pinochet's 83rd birthday _ to
pass the extradition on to London.
	   Garzon pushed ahead with his bid to bring Pinochet to trial
after Spain's National Court ruled Friday that its judges were
competent to investigate human rights crimes committed in Chile and
Argentina when military juntas ruled in the 1970s and 1980s.
	   Pinochet was recovering from back surgery in London when
arrested. England's High Court later ruled that the arrest was
illegal as the former Chilean dictator was entitled to diplomatic
immunity.
	   The retired general was subsequently released on bail but
remains under police guard pending an appeal before a panel of
judges from the House of Lords that is expected to begin
deliberating Wednesday.
	   If the panel upholds the immunity decision, Pinochet would be
freed and any extradition request from Spain would be futile.
	   Also Tuesday, representatives of some 40 political and social
organizations were to hand in a letter of protest to the British
Embassy in Madrid call on British authorities to facilitate
Pinochet's trial in Spain.
	   Pinochet cannot be prosecuted in Chile because he is a senator
for life, a job created for him in a constitution he steered to
enactment.
	   More than 3,000 people disappeared or were killed during
Pinochet's 1973-1990 dictatorship which began with a bloody coup
against the elected government of President Salvador Allende.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Piet Hein Geeris scored twice and the
Netherlands scored four times in the second half to rout South
Korea 5-0 on Tuesday for its third victory in as many games and
keep it on top of the Champions Trophy standings.
	   The result left the world and Olympic champs as the only
unbeaten and untied team after three rounds of the six-nation
event. It moved four points ahead of second-placed Australia
(1-2-0), which was held to a 4-4 draw earlier Tuesday.
	   South Korea fell to 1-1-1, four points and fourth place, just
behind Spain on goal difference.
	   Teun de Nooijer, Remco van Wijk and Marten Eikelboom also scored
for the Netherlands, which has outscored its opponents 12-4.
	   South Korea looked strong in the opening minutes but quickly
folded.
	   Forwards Kim Jeong Kui and captain Park Shin Heun were smartly
checked by a strong Dutch defense.
	   The Netherlands jumped ahead in the 30th minute when Jeroen
Delmee crossed from right to Hein Geeris, who pushed the ball in
the empty net.
	   Geeris scored again six minutes into the second half, blasting a
shot from the top of the striking circle past South Korean keeper
Ku Jin Soo.
	   Holland's Van Wijk scored off a 48th minute short corner, while
Eikelboom completed the tally with a brilliant goal in the 69th
minute.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein wants a
timetable on when U.N. sanctions will be lifted before he will
allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume, a visiting Russian
legislator said Tuesday.
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky told reporters after two
hours of talks with Saddam that the Iraqi president saw ``no
problem'' with monitoring.
	   ``But he would like to have information when the blockade (will
be) eliminated,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``When? This year, next year,
next century?'' said the legislator, a regular visitor to Iraq who
has had good relations with Saddam.
	   Saddam has not spoken publicly since the government announced
Saturday that it was halting dealings with the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees weapons inspections. Iraq's precondition
for resuming cooperation was U.N. pledges to begin easing or
lifting the trade sanctions.
	   The stance has put Iraq on a collision course with the U.N.
Security Council, which termed the action a ``flagrant violation''
of U.N. resolutions.
	   U.S. President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
suggested that military force was an option.
	   Zhirinovsky said of Saddam that ``he would like peace.'' But he
added: ``Iraq made everything to fulfill all resolutions of the
United Nations, but the United Nations doesn't make anything for
Iraq.''
	   The sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, limit the sale of oil and ban most other financial dealings
with Iraq.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until the
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its non-conventional
weapons.
	   Iraq has charged that the Special Commission, under Australian
Richard Butler, has been working on behalf of the United States to
prolong the sanctions.
	   Zhirinovsky quoted Saddam as saying the Special Commission
needed to be restructured to make it ``more objective.'' The Iraqi
leader suggested Butler should be replaced by someone from China,
Russia or France, the Russian legislator said.
	   Representatives of the three countries have been the most
willing members of the Security Council to consider easing the
sanctions.
	   On Tuesday, China urged Iraq to end the standoff and said
cooperation would be the quickest way to end the sanctions. At the
same time, the Security Council should fairly evaluate the
inspection work so far and ``gradually lift the sanctions,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
	   The United States and Britain, the other permanent members,
insist sanctions stay in place until the weapons inspections are
finished.
	   Earlier Tuesday, some 60 coffins were carried atop taxis in the
latest symbolic funeral procession for children the government says
died because of the sanctions.
	   About 100 women, most dressed in black, accompanied the orange
and white taxis, shouting ``Today we bury them, tomorrow we will
avenge them'' and ``America is the enemy of God.''
	   The protesters abandoned their usual route to the U.N.
headquarters and, instead, marched to the gate of the Al-Rasheed
Hotel. A number of diplomats _ including Zhirinovsky _ are staying
at the hotel, most to attend the Baghdad International Fair.
Western reporters also stay at the Al-Rasheed.
	   Also Tuesday, three monitoring teams from the
Vienna-headquartered International Atomic Energy Agency went into
the field to check three previously declared weapons sites, U.N.
spokeswoman Caroline Cross said.
	   She said a technical team from the U.N. Special Commission _
which looks into biological and chemical weapons as well as
long-range missiles _ went out to deal with a problem involving a
camera or a sensor. She gave no other details.
	   While Iraq has halted the work of UNSCOM inspectors and
monitors, it has continued to allow nuclear monitors to work.
	   In a front-page editorial Tuesday the state-run Al-Iraq daily
said the country should prepare to battle ``the U.S. monster''
regardless of the sacrifices.

Christian churches agree to add emergency exit to Holy Sepulchre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a rare example of cooperation, the leaders
of three Christian sects agreed to add an emergency exit to the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Jesus was said to be crucified,
buried and resurrected, Israeli officials said Tuesday.
	   The Israeli government had pushed for the second exit, concerned
that the church will not be able to handle all the estimated 4.5
million pilgrims expected to visit the Holy Land during millennium
celebrations.
	   The issue first arose several years ago and Monday
representatives from the Greek and Armenian Orthodox churches, the
Franciscan custos, and the Israeli ministries of tourism and
religious affairs reached the agreement.
	   A team will make a recommendation on the exit's location in
three weeks, according to Nitsan Ilan, a spokeswoman for the
Israeli tourism ministry.
	   Any decisions regarding the church, considered one of
Christianity's most sacred sites, are often slow in coming. Six
sects _ Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Armenian Orthodox,
Ethiopian, Egyptian Copt and Syrian Orthodox _ lay claim to the
church, with the largest three administering the common areas.
	   Each sect controls its own area of the church and reaching
agreement on simple renovations can take years. The church is
located within Jerusalem's walled Old City, which came under
Israeli control after the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The church was first built by Emperor Constantine in A.D. 335.
Natural disasters and deliberate destruction as well as wear and
tear have warranted repair work throughout the centuries. The
current entrance with its heavy wooden doors, dates from the 11th
century.

Top European clubs demanding 50 percent of revenue

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Europe's top clubs on Tuesday demanded 50 percent
of any revenue generated by UEFA's revamped Champions League as a
reward for shunning a rival Super League.
	   The celebratory mood in evidence after the big clubs agreed to
stay true to UEFA last month evaporated at a meeting to thrash out
the details of the new Champions League _ including the
all-important issue of money.
	   ``We're still trying to find some sort of middle ground as to
how the money will be divided up,'' said Liverpool club president
Rick Parry. ``There is no decision yet but that's what the clubs
are probably the most unhappy with right now.''
	   Clubs generating the most revenue are demanding that 50 percent
of the dlrs 400-600 million UEFA expects to bring in be distributed
according to market value and split up between them. Consequently
smaller clubs would have no guaranteed income.
	   The clubs also proposed that the remaining 50 percent be awarded
under the current system of match and performance fees.
	   ``We have no uniformity of views,'' said Gerhard Aigner, general
secretary of UEFA, soccer's ruling body. ``The big clubs want more
money and so do the smaller ones. However, we cannot satisfy
everyone.''
	   ``But if everyone is a just little unhappy and no one is saying
`hurrah' while others are extremely unhappy then I think we are
doing okay,'' Aigner told journalists.
	   At a meeting Oct. 23, representatives of AC Milan, Real Madrid
and 10 other major teams agreed not to join the independent Super
League _ launched by Italy-based Media Partners _ after UEFA
proposed to change its European Champions League, offering teams
more money.
	   UEFA promised to extend next season's European Champions' League
from 24 teams to 32 clubs, playing in eight groups of four teams in
the first stage. It also proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and Cup
Winners Cup into one competition, called the UEFA Cup.
	   At Tuesday's meeting, money was not the only sticking point.
	   The 17 dates needed to stage the competition in an already tight
season schedule has also proven problematic.
	   ``Some leagues have 20 teams so it will be difficult for them,''
said Aigner. ``Of course this was already a problem even without
the increased number of matches.
	   ``We'll have to study the individual situation in each
country.''
	   UEFA is also still struggling to come up with a ranking system
which will satisfy everyone.
	   Currently, UEFA is looking to figure in group match results,
results in the knock-out matches, the nation's coefficient and
individual club coefficients, Aigner said.
	   ``We might the help of a mathematician,'' said Aigner. ``We want
to be sure whatever concept we go with, will still be valid in the
long term and won't have to be replaced in a couple of years.''

Israeli court orders Lebanese captives held for six more months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli judge extended the detention
Tuesday of two Hezbollah leaders held for years without charges or
trial since they were kidnapped from their homes in Lebanon by
Israel.
	   Sheik Abd el-Karim Obeid, captured by Israel in 1989, and
Mustafa Dirani, captured in 1994, will be held in administrative
detention for another six months.
	   Judge Uri Goren, acting chief justice of the Tel Aviv District
Court, will review the detention order again Feb. 1, 1999.
	   Israel is holding the two as bargaining chips in exchange for
information about Israeli air force navigator Ron Arad, missing
since October 1986 after his jet was shot down during a bombing
mission over south Lebanon.
	   Israel believes Arad is being held by Iran or Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, whose guerrilla fighters are trying to force Israel out
of southern Lebanon.
	   Israel's Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that the two men
could be held without charge in exchange for information about
Arad. An appeal is pending.

Searchers find two life rafts from missing Windjammer schooner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Rewrites throughout to ADD comment from Coast Guard officials,
company executives and passengers; details on debris, ship
history. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Searchers on Monday found two life rafts and seven
life jackets from a Windjammer schooner missing since last week
while trying to outrun Hurricane Mitch, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
	   Searchers found two debris fields, which included portions of a
wooden staircase from the 282-foot (85-meter) schooner and pieces
of blue canvas, off the Honduran coast. The serial number on one of
the life rafts was confirmed as that of the Fantome, the flagship
of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises Ltd.
	   ``We have found all sorts of stuff,'' said Scott Carr, a Coast
Guard spokesman. ``It's starting to look as if the ship went
down.''
	   But searchers on four Coast Guard planes and a British warship,
as well as Windjammer executives, clung to hope that the crew is
alive.
	   ``This doesn't dismiss the possibility that survivors could be
out in the open sea on a life raft,'' said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Jeff Hall, stationed at Miami Beach.
	   And waves crashing across the bow of the ship could explain why
some items were in the ocean, said James Canty, vice president of
corporate development for Windjammer.
	   ``Of course we are concerned, but we feel the ship is out there
and are continuing to search for it,'' Canty said.
	   The Fantome had a total of 11 life rafts on board, each with a
capacity for 25 passengers, said Coast Guard spokeswoman Veronica
Bandrowsky.
	   The vessel, once owned by Aristotle Onassis, is registered in
Antigua and operates out of Miami. It was on a tourist cruise near
Belize and the Bay Islands early last week. It dropped off 100
passengers on shore before the 31 crew members sailed toward the
Roatan Islands, Honduras, to avoid the storm, which at the time had
winds of 150 mph (240 kph).
	   The ship inadvertently traveled into the path Hurricane Mitch,
The Miami Herald reported Tuesday.
	   In their last communication with Windjammer, the crew of the
Fantome said they were experiencing 100-knot (180-kph) winds and
40-degree rolls, according to a Windjammer spokesman.
	   The Coast Guard covered about 21,100 square miles (55,000 square
kilometers) in its search Monday. So far, the search has covered
about 120,000 square miles (192,000 kilometers) _ about the size of
Colorado _ since Thursday.
	   Searchers Tuesday planned to move 30 to 40 miles (50 to 65
kilometers) north of where the wreckage was found near Roatan
Island, Hall said. An instrument used to measure ocean currents
indicates that any survivors would have drifted north, he said.
	   So far, searchers have concentrated mostly in the southern area.
	   According to passengers, who have set up Internet sites to
exchanges messages, the ship's captain was Guyan March, an
experienced British sailor.
	   ``Captain Guyan has been sailing since he was a kid. He is a
fantastic sailor,'' said Laura Marshall, an Atlanta resident who
has traveled often on Windjammer Cruises. ``He knew what he was
doing. He did the right thing.''
	   Windjammer officials wouldn't confirm the identities of the
crew.
	   The Coast Guard said 11 crew members are from Guanaja Island,
four each from Grenada and St. Vincent, three from Jamaica, two
from Honduras and one each from Nicaragua, St. Lucia, Panama,
Trinidad, Antigua, Romania and England.
	   The Fantome, which is among the world's largest four-masted
schooners, can accommodate 128 passengers and was built in 1927 for
the Duke of Westminster. Aristotle Onassis bought the ship as a
wedding present for Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco,
but never delivered it because he wasn't invited to the wedding.

Portuguese Central Bank cuts benchmark interest rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's central bank clipped its
benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 3.75 percent Tuesday,
its second such cut in four weeks.
	   The central bank is independent, but the move came after
repeated calls by the government for lower interest rates to keep
the economy and financial markets buoyant amid recent global
financial turmoil.
	   The central bank of neighboring Spain, with which Portugal has
close trade ties, announced it was cropping its rate to 3.5 percent
earlier Tuesday.
	   The drop moves Portugal closer to the 3.3 percent level it must
meet for participation in the new European single currency being
launched next year.
	   The Bank of Portugal last altered its benchmark rate on Oct. 9
when it cut the so-called repo rate by half a point to 4 percent.

Mir's crew prepares for micro-meteorite `rain'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The crew of the Mir space station will not face
any danger when their space outpost enters a cloud of
micro-meteorites later this month, space officials said Tuesday.
	   Just in case, cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev will
board a Soyuz escape capsule permanently attached to the six-module
station when the barrage of meteorites peaks in mid-November, said
deputy Mission Control chief Viktor Blagov.
	   The ``meteorite rain'' doesn't pose a serious danger because it
consists of very small particles that are not full meteorites, but
remnants of a comet, Blagov said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Next Wednesday, Padalka and Avdeyev will take a spacewalk to
attach to the station's outer surface a French-made device designed
for studying the micro-meteorites, he said.

Sosa top vote-getter on AP All-Star team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On the 1998 Associated Press U.S. Major League
Baseball All-Star Team, Sammy Sosa was beaten by no one, not even
Mark McGwire.
	   The Chicago Cubs outfielder received 187 votes in totals
released Monday, five more than his St. Louis rival, who led at
first base.
	   McGwire, who set a record with 70 homers _ four more than Sosa _
had the most dominating win in the nationwide voting by sports
writers and broadcasters. His closest competitor at first was
Boston's Mo Vaughn, who got six votes. Atlanta's Andres Galarraga
was third, getting the only two other votes.
	   In the outfield, Sosa finished 25 ahead of Seattle's Ken Griffey
Jr. Juan Gonzalez of the Texas Rangers got the third spot with 78,
more than double the total of San Diego's Greg Vaughn, fourth with
35.
	   Only one player from the World Series champion New York Yankees
made the team. David Wells, who pitched a perfect game against
Minnesota in May and went 18-4 with a 3.49 ERA, led left-handed
starters with 92 votes, 27 ahead of Atlanta's Tom Glavine, who
finished second.
	   Houston's Craig Biggio dominated at second base, beating
Baltimore's Roberto Alomar 147-12.
	   Seattle's Alex Rodriguez was an easy winner at shortstop,
beating Boston's Nomar Garciaparra 102-55. Derek Jeter of the
Yankees was third with 17, one ahead of Cleveland's Omar Vizquel.
	   Atlanta's Chipper Jones won at third base in the closest contest
among position players. Jones had 81{ points, with Colorado's Vinny
Castilla second at 57.
	   Edgar Martinez of the Mariners won the closest race, finishing
with 60 votes at designated hitter, 15 more than Toronto's Jose
Canseco.
	   Ivan Rodriguez of the Rangers easily won at catcher with 139
votes. Mike Piazza of the New York Mets was second with 31.
	   Toronto's Roger Clemens was the top right-handed starter with
122{ votes after going 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA and 271 strikeouts. San
Diego's Kevin Brown was second with 42{ votes, followed by
Atlanta's Greg Maddux with 10.
	   San Diego's Trevor Hoffman, who had a major league-leading 53
saves, was the top reliever with 169 votes. Boston's Tom Gordon was
second with 12.

U.S. envoy holds Kosovo talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, facts from Taft presser, trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Signaling an easing of Kosovo's
refugee crisis, international relief organizations said Tuesday
that thousands of displaced had found shelter ahead of winter.
	   A U.S. senior official returned to the region for the second
time in two months, reinforced this idea, saying that a
humanitarian disaster in Kosovo has been averted, although the
situation remains fragile.
	   ``The crisis is still there and very fragile, but the
catastrophe that we all expected, hopefully will not happen,'' U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft told reporters at the end
of her four-day tour of the Kosovo region.
	   Taft visited the region in August, at the height of the conflict
in Kosovo when hundreds of thousands of people were displaced by
the fighting. At that time, she predicted Kosovo would be engulfed
in a humanitarian catastrophe, if universal attention was not
focused on an immediate cessation of the hostilities.
	   ``Two months later, I am able to look at the extent of
compliance by the authorities as it relates to the humanitarian
side of the issue,'' Taft told reporters in Belgrade. ``While the
progress is fragile, it is positive, it is going in the right
direction.''
	   International humanitarian agnecey estimated last weekend that
some 200,000 people were still displaced within Kosovo, but as few
as 5,000 of them remained camped in the open. Others were staying
with neighbors or relatives.
	   Jacques Franquin, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Geneva, also said the number of people camped out in
the open has dropped considerably, since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pulled his troops out of the province last week.
	   Also Tuesday U.S. envoy, Christopher Hill met with ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the provincial capital Pristina
for discussions on a draft agreement with the Serbs on Kosovo's
future.
	   Afterward, Rugova joined Hill in touring a war-devastated area
southwest of Pristina _ a first-time move reflecting the relative
freedom of movement in areas that for months were unsafe because of
Serb-Albanian violence.
	   In the village of Banja, on the road running southwest of
Pristina to Malisevo, some Albanians kissed Rugova. Later, in
Orahovac, a mixed town, a Serb complained to Rugova that his father
was missing because of the turmoil. Replying in Serb, Rugova said:
``We're together in this.''
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has led international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 others have been forced from
their homes since Serb authorities launched a crackdown on Albanian
militants in February.
	   As part of an Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to order
troops back to their barracks and dismantle police barricades,
allowing for people to return safely.
	   On Tuesday, however, a regional command of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army claimed that Serb forces have not been withdrawing
as planned from their checkpoints in the west of the province.
	   In a statement faxed to the ethnic Albanian media Tuesday, a KLA
regional command, claimed Serb forces have regrouped and relocated
to positions farther off the main roads. It also said the Serbs
were harassing and shooting at Albanians trying to return to their
villages.
	   ``If provocations, attacks and murder of civilians continue, the
(KLA) will be forced to take defensive measures,'' said the
statement.
	   The KLA statement also claimed Serb police buried nine ethnic
Albanians in the border town of Junik Monday. The Albanians were
reportedly killed recently in clashes at the border.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed and there
was no immediate response from the Serb side.
	   Serbian sources in the province reported Tuesday that the KLA
attacked overnight an ethnic Albanian family for ``its known
loyalty to Serbia.''
	   According to testimonies from the Sopa family members, four
uniformed KLA members riddled their home in the village Malo
Gracko, 20 kilometers (13 miles) south of Pristina with bullets.
The head of the family, Fehmi Sopa was seriously wounded and was in
a coma in a Pristina hospital, said the Serbian Media Center.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Albanians.

Steffi Graf, in latest comeback, wins in Leipzig
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Former world No. 1 Steffi Graf, making
her latest comeback from injury, beat Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir
in straight sets Tuesday at the Leipzig Open.
	   Graf, who was operated on her right hand, displayed flashes of
the powerful forehand that dominated women's tennis for a decade in
ousting Dragomir, 6-3, 6-3, at the dlrs 450,000 event.
	   Graf hadn't played a singles in 56 days, since losing to Patty
Schnyder of Switzerland at the U.S. Open. Afterwards she underwent
the operation.
	   Graf held the top ranking for a record 374 weeks before Swiss
teenager Martina Hingis displaced her on March 31 of 1997 as the
29-year-old German increasingly fell victim to injuries.
	   This is the latest comeback for Graf, struggling to fight her
way back to the top since a knee injury in June of 1997 threatened
to end her career.
	   ``I'm not expecting to march into the final here,'' said Graf.
``I just want some match practice.''
	   Graf, who tested her hand in a doubles match she lost Monday,
next faces Japan's Ai Sugiyama in the quarterfinals.
	   The German has won 103 titles, four at Leipzig, and over dlrs 20
million prize money.

Swedish central bank cuts repo rate 0.25 percentage points
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, on
Tuesday cut its main lending rate _ the one-week repurchase rate _
to 3.85 percent from 4.10 percent.
	   The reason for the cut, the Riksbank said, is that inflation is
now expected to undershoot the central bank's official target of 2
percent in the next two years,
	   ``Economic growth in Sweden is still expected to be relatively
good in the coming years, but the weaker international outlook is a
reason for a downward revision to expected capacity utilization,''
the Riksbank said in a prepared statement.
	   Net exports are also weakening while stock piles tend to
accumulate and growth of corporate borrowing is slowing down. At
the same time, households are less positive about the future, the
bank said.
	   ``The price statistics point in the same direction. Inflationary
pressure is low. Transitory effects are now judged to make a
smaller contribution to the change in the consumer prices index in
2000, and survey data show that inflation is expected to remain
subdued,'' the Riksbank said.
	   Only one factor, the weaker than anticipated exchange rate, is
speaking against a rate cut, and the bank contends that a downward
revision of the krona's expected exchange rate path compared with
the latest inflation report could be motivated by recent
developments.
	   However, the weakness in the krona isn't enough to offset the
fact that inflation will be below the target, the bank said.

Swiss hold off on formal extradition request for Pinochet

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Switzerland asking Spain for more information on
legal help application, minor edits. &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet, Germany-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland has prepared a formal
request for the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet, but is awaiting the outcome of Spain's attempt to have
him extradited, authorities said Tuesday.
	   The decision is in line with European rules giving priority to
requests according to the order in which they are made and the
seriousness of the charges involved, the Swiss Office of Police
Affairs said in a statement.
	   Pinochet was arrested at a London clinic last month. Spanish
magistrate Baltasar Garzon is seeking his extradition on charges of
genocide, torture and terrorism during his 17-year rule which ended
1990.
	   Switzerland subsequently requested Pinochet's arrest with a view
to extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   The move followed a criminal complaint filed in Geneva by the
widow of Alexis Jaccard, a student of Swiss-Chilean dual
nationality who disappeared in May 1977.
	   Switzerland said the Spanish effort to extradite Pinochet should
be given priority.
	   The country has also asked Spain for more information on its
request for legal assistance in its own case, said Folco Galli,
spokesman for the Office of Police Affairs.
	   No details have been given, but the request is believed to
relate to possible bank accounts held by Pinochet in Switzerland.
	   Last week, Britain's High Court ruled illegal the general's
arrest on a Spanish warrant.
	   Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, is expected to rule
this week on an appeal to the ruling that Pinochet, as a former
head of state, is immune from prosecution.
	   Meanwhile, Chilean exiles in Belgium, Norway and France have
independently filed complaints seeking Pinochet's prosecution or
extradition. The latest complaint was filed by a Chilean exile in
Germany Tuesday.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's prime minister said Tuesday he had
authorized talks with groups linked to militant Basque separatists,
marking the first time the Spanish government has taken steps to
negotiate an end to the 30-year conflict.
	   ``There are news reports that I have authorized contacts. It's
true,'' Aznar said upon his return from a trip to London.
	   The contacts would be through the Basque National Liberation
Movement, a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist
organizations, a spokesman for Aznar's office said.
	   ``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take
place with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' said the spokesman,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We cannot say anything yet
about the how, who and when.''
	   An official government spokesman, Josep Pique, told reporters
that the contacts were to exploring new possibilities since the
cease-fire, ``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to give
up violence for good.''
	   ETA, which is campaigning for a Basque homeland in northern
Spain and southern France, declared an indefinite cease-fire last
two months ago, ushering in the Basque peace process.
	   Groups close to ETA said the truce was modeled on the Northern
Irish process that led to the April peace accord and urged the
government to promote a negotiated settlement as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had done in Northern Ireland.
	   Irish republican leader Gerry Adams visited the Basque region
last month and urged Aznar's government to respond positively to
the cease-fire by opening peace talks.
	   A group of Basque political parties and organizations known as
the Irish Forum secured Adams' backing for its proposal, known as
the Lizarra Declaration, for all-party peace talks, including the
government and ETA.
	   The Irish Forum includes Herri Batasuna, the political coalition
linked to ETA, as well as moderate Basque nationalist parties,
labor unions and civic groups.
	   The government's hard-line position of rejecting peace
negotiations with ETA or legal organizations linked to it has
softened gradually since the cease-fire and since regional
elections on Oct. 25.
	   Until then, the government took tough stand against ETA,
arresting many militants, dismantling a major ETA financial network
and closing an allied daily newspaper _ all of which is believed to
have contributed to the cease-fire.
	   Recently, the government let it be known ETA would not be
required to hand over weapons before talks could be held on the
future of 535 ETA prisoners being held in Spanish jails and other
issues.
	   Aznar's Popular Party and Euskal Herritarok, a political
coalition linked to ETA, came in second and third respectively in
last month's Basque regional elections. The moderate Basque
Nationalist Party that supports ETA aims but opposes its violence
placed first.
	   Euskal Herritarok said the elections showed that Basques wanted
to see political negotiations to resolve the dispute over Basque
independence _ one of the last armed conflicts in Western Europe.
	   The government said it interpreted the election results to mean
that many Basques do not want independence.
	   ETA, which stands in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   Before the truce, the group had been targeting town councilors
from Aznar's Popular Party in retaliation for the government's
hard-line policies, killing six in the past 15 months.

Portuguese Central Bank cuts benchmark interest rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's central bank clipped its
benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 3.75 percent Tuesday,
its second such cut in four weeks.
	   The central bank is independent, but the move came after
repeated calls by the government for lower interest rates to keep
the economy and financial markets buoyant amid recent global
financial turmoil.
	   The central bank of neighboring Spain, with which Portugal has
close trade ties, announced it was cropping its rate to 3.5 percent
earlier Tuesday.
	   The drop moves Portugal closer to the 3.3 percent level it must
meet for participation in the new European single currency being
launched next year.
	   The Bank of Portugal last altered its benchmark rate on Oct. 9
when it cut the so-called repo rate by half a point to 4 percent.

Swedish central bank cuts repo rate 0.25 percentage points
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, on
Tuesday cut its main lending rate _ the one-week repurchase rate _
to 3.85 percent from 4.10 percent.
	   The reason for the cut, the Riksbank said, is that inflation is
now expected to undershoot the central bank's official target of 2
percent in the next two years,
	   ``Economic growth in Sweden is still expected to be relatively
good in the coming years, but the weaker international outlook is a
reason for a downward revision to expected capacity utilization,''
the Riksbank said in a prepared statement.
	   Net exports are also weakening while stock piles tend to
accumulate and growth of corporate borrowing is slowing down. At
the same time, households are less positive about the future, the
bank said.
	   ``The price statistics point in the same direction. Inflationary
pressure is low. Transitory effects are now judged to make a
smaller contribution to the change in the consumer prices index in
2000, and survey data show that inflation is expected to remain
subdued,'' the Riksbank said.
	   Only one factor, the weaker than anticipated exchange rate, is
speaking against a rate cut, and the bank contends that a downward
revision of the krona's expected exchange rate path compared with
the latest inflation report could be motivated by recent
developments.
	   However, the weakness in the krona isn't enough to offset the
fact that inflation will be below the target, the bank said.

Top European clubs demanding 50 percent of revenue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos GEV101-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Europe's top clubs on Tuesday demanded 50 percent
of any revenue generated by UEFA's revamped Champions League as a
reward for shunning a rival Super League.
	   The celebratory mood in evidence after the big clubs agreed to
stay within UEFA's confines last month evaporated at a meeting to
thrash out the details of the new Champions League _ including the
issue of money.
	   ``We're still trying to find some sort of middle ground as to
how the money will be divided up,'' Liverpool club president Rick
Parry said. ``There is no decision yet but that's what the clubs
are probably the most unhappy with right now.''
	   Clubs generating the most revenue are demanding that 50 percent
of the dlrs 400-600 million UEFA expects to bring in be distributed
according to market value and split up between them. Consequently
smaller clubs would have no guaranteed income.
	   The clubs also proposed that the remaining 50 percent be awarded
under the current system of match and performance fees.
	   ``We have no uniformity of views,'' said Gerhard Aigner, general
secretary of UEFA. ``The big clubs want more money and so do the
smaller ones. However, we cannot satisfy everyone.''
	   ``But if everyone is a just little unhappy and no one is saying
`hurrah' while others are extremely unhappy, then I think we are
doing OK,'' Aigner told journalists.
	   At a meeting Oct. 23, representatives of AC Milan, Real Madrid
and 10 other major teams agreed not to join the independent Super
League _ launched by Italy-based Media Partners _ after UEFA
proposed to change its European Champions League, offering teams
more money.
	   UEFA promised to extend next season's European Champions' League
from 24 teams to 32, playing in eight groups of four in the first
stage. It also proposed to merge the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners Cup
into one competition, called the UEFA Cup.
	   At Tuesday's meeting, money was not the only sticking point.
	   The 17 dates needed to stage the competition in an already tight
season schedule has also proven problematic.
	   ``Some leagues have 20 teams so it will be difficult for them,''
Aigner said. ``Of course this was already a problem even without
the increased number of matches.
	   ``We'll have to study the individual situation in each
country.''
	   UEFA is also still struggling to come up with a ranking system
which will satisfy everyone.
	   Currently, UEFA is looking to figure in group match results,
results in the single-elimination or knock-out matches, the
nation's co-efficient and individual club co-efficients, Aigner
said.
	   ``We might the help of a mathematician,'' Aigner said. ``We want
to be sure whatever concept we go with, will still be valid in the
long term and won't have to be replaced in a couple of years.''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Can vacations be good for you?
	   Greece is making such a pitch to health-conscious North
Americans, extolling the benefits of the low-fat Mediterranean
diet.
	   The advertisements, which will appear in U.S. and Canadian
publications later this month, are part of a 4 billion drachma
(dlrs 14.2 million) winter tourism campaign unveiled Tuesday.
	   The unusual gastronomical approach by Greece attempts to
capitalize on the growing appreciation for the health benefits of
the traditional Mediterranean diet _ dominated by vegetables,
seafood, olive oil and lean meat.
	   Ads planned for northern Europe take a more ordinary approach:
sun and sea.

Fire breaks out at old uranium mine, injuring three workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ A fire broke in a propane tank at an
old uranium mine in southern France, injuring three workers, the
state nuclear fuel reprocessing company said.
	   Fire fighters dispatched helicopters, fire trucks and ambulances
to Lodeve, a town about 50 kilometers west of the city of
Montpellier in the Languedoc region where the mine is located.
	   All of the injured suffered burns and were transported to the
burn unit of a hospital in Montpellier.
	   The COGEMA, the state nuclear fuel reprocessing company, said
the mine which once yieled uranium was no longer in use.
	   The fire began when workers were draining the tank as part of
efforts to the facilities at the former mine into a new industrial
park, COGEMA said in a communique.
	   Fire authorities decided to let the blaze burn out naturally and
said there was no risk of an explosion.

Saddam's envoy fails to convince half brother to return to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A cousin of Saddam Hussein has failed to
convince the Iraqi leader's half-brother in Switzerland to return
home instead of going into exile, Iraqi dissidents said Tuesday.
	   Barzan al-Tikriti, who headed Iraq's mission at the United
Nations in Geneva for 10 years, failed to be persuaded by
guarantees of his safety offered by Saddam, the dissidents said.
	   Al-Tikriti was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other diplomats
recalled to Baghdad over the summer in a major diplomatic
reshuffle. Al-Tikriti refused to return saying he wanted to stay
abroad for family reasons.
	   Last month, Saddam's cousin, Gen. Mizahem Saab al-Hassan, met
with al-Tikriti in Geneva and conveyed a message that his decision
to go into exile is harming the Iraqi regime's image, said the
dissidents.
	   They spoke on condition they were not identified further.
	   Al-Hassan, a former commander of the Iraqi air force, also
conveyed a message from Saddam's eldest son, Odai, warning
al-Tikriti to refrain from hostile acts while in exile or making
statements critical to the regime, said the dissidents.
	   The Swiss government said al-Tikriti has until the end of
November to leave Geneva under Swiss laws that allow U.N. diplomats
to stay on in Switzerland for three months after the end of their
tenure.
	   Al-Tikriti's four children are believed to have Swiss
citizenship but it is not clear if he will apply to stay in
Switzerland. His wife is believed to be undergoing cancer treatment
in New York.
	   On Friday, he told the London-based Al-Arab newspaper that he
had some personal problems with his brother's government although
he denied political dissension
	   ``For 15 years I have had enough sufferings which could have not
been tolerated by others. This was done unjustly,'' al-Tikriti said
without elaborating.
	   He said he has no plans to join the Iraqi opposition groups in
exile although he called for political reform in Iraq.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new dlrs 18 million U.S. Embassy opened Tuesday
in the Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan after two years of
construction, a news report said.
	   Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev and Stephen Sestanovich, special
adviser to U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, attended the
opening ceremony in Bishkek, capital of the former Soviet republic,
the Interfax news agency said.
	   The building also houses offices of the U.S. Agency for

	   Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous, agricultural nation that borders
China, has seen little foreign investment or economic development
since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Vincent Spadea of the United States stunned
spectators at the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open on Tuesday by
beating French No. 1 Cedric Pioline, 6-4, 6-4.
	   Pioline fired nine aces to Spadea's two, but never looked
completely comfortable on his serve.
	   Chicago-born Spadea, 24, broke serve in the seventh game and
held serve comfortably to take the first set.
	   In the second set, he broke early to put himself on course for
victory.
	   Leading 3-1, Spadea showed his growing confidence with a cheeky
backhand drop volley at 30-30.
	   Pioline, who had to withdraw from last week's Eurocard Open in
Stuttgart because of gastroenteritis, never showed the form that
has taken him to No. 17 in the world, eventually losing in one hour
14 minutes.
	   In a second round match, No. 13 seed Greg Rusedski of Britain
had little trouble beating Nicolas Kiefer, 6-3, 6-4, in one hour
seven minutes.
	   In other matches Tuesday, Sweden's Magnus Norman and Jerome
Golmard of France qualified for the second round with straight sets
wins.
	   Norman beat France's Arnaud Clement, while Golmard eliminated
Byron Black of Zimbabwe.

Colombian soldiers try to retake town overrun by rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with wounded soldier's account. TRIMS. No

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian rebels beat back government
soldiers flown into a remote jungle region to retake a state
capital. The town, which was taken by hundreds of leftist
guerrillas, remained under rebel control Tuesday.
	   About 400 army troops who landed Monday just across the border
in Brazil encountered fierce guerrilla resistance about one mile
(kilometer) outside Mitu, said a soldier wounded in the battle.
Mitu is about 370 miles (600 kilometers) southeast of Bogota.
	   More than 800 rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, overwhelmed Mitu's police station Sunday. The
Colombian Red Cross said about 60 police and 10 civilians died in
the 12-hour assault, and that the rebels took at least 40 police
officers prisoner.
	   In addition, radio reports said 20 soldiers and eight police
officers were killed in Monday's fighting.
	   High-ranking police and army generals said Tuesday they could
not confirm the total number killed.
	   Pvt. Cesar Tulio Espitia said in a radio interview that he and
about 200 soldiers were ambushed Monday by rebels with machine
guns, grenades and mortars. He said at least five of his fellow
soldiers died.
	   ``They are better armed than we are,'' said the soldier. He told
Radionet network from a hospital in San Jose del Guaviare, the
army's staging area 190 miles (305 kilometers) from the fighting,
that he had shrapnel and bullet wounds in his leg.
	   Espitia said he expected the army would have a lot of casualties
before it could enter the Amazon basin town of 15,000 people.
	   The bloodshed has underscored the power rebels enjoy as they
prepare for peace talks with the government to try to end
Colombia's 34-year civil war. The rebels haven't lost a battle in
nearly a decade.
	   The rebels now hold about 290 police and soldiers captive _ all
seized in battles during the past two years.
	   President Andres Pastrana has so far refused a guerrilla
proposal to exchange the prisoners for 452 jailed rebels before
peace talks begin.
	   But the president has agreed to meet a rebel demand that he pull
troops out of an area of southern Colombia in order to start the
talks.
	   The troop pullback is scheduled to occur by Saturday, despite
the latest violence. Pastrana says he will personally attend the
opening round of peace talks, scheduled to begin in the coming
weeks.
	   ``It's regrettable that at a time when we're promoting peace
these kinds of actions occur, because instead of acts of war, what
Colombia needs are acts of peace,'' said Pastrana's peace envoy,
Victor G. Ricardo.
	   The president, who cut short a state visit Monday to Venezuela,
issued an order that Mitu be retaken but hasn't commented publicly
on the rebel attack.
	   The jungle town _ normally accessible only by air and water _
was cut off from communications when the rebels seized control of
the airport and blew up the phone company's microwave tower.
	   The Red Cross said the police barracks and a nearby farmers'
bank burned to the ground as a result of rebel shelling.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 5,500 Russian officials are under
investigation for taking bribes this year, and Russia's economic
troubles are creating a breeding ground for corruption, the
interior minister said Tuesday.
	   ``A poverty-stricken official is always prone to crime,'' Sergei
Stepashin told a news conference.
	   He called for increasing salaries of police and other officials,
sharply devalued by a steep dive of the Russian currency since the
government stopped propping up the ruble in August.
	   Russian police have undertaken a massive effort to combat graft,
including corruption in its own ranks, but the problem has
continued to plague the government, Stepashin said.
	   ``We are especially concerned about corruption on the grassroots
level, such as bribe-taking among traffic police and various small
offices,'' he said.
	   Stepashin urged the government to radically streamline the
bureaucracy to reduce the opportunities for bribery.
	   Stepashin mentioned several high-profile corruption cases,
including the arrest last summer of top officials with the
government's statistics service, accused of falsifying data to help
big companies dodge taxes. Police found more than dlrs 1 million in
cash at suspects' homes.
	   The Prosecutor General's office said Tuesday that the
investigation is still under way, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Last week, Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent liberal lawmaker and a
presidential hopeful, caused an uproar when he said Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's new government is as prone to corruption as its
predecessors.
	   On Monday, Yavlinsky specified his accusations in a letter sent
to Primakov, urging him to investigate past business connections of
several high-ranking Cabinet members and their lobbying efforts for
business interests.
	   Primakov criticized Yavlinsky for failing to provide evidence,
but instructed his aides to investigate into the accusations and
prepare a detailed response.
	   The Prosecutor General's office, meanwhile, has ordered a
preliminary investigation on possible libel charges against
Yavlinsky over the allegations.
	   Stepashin on Tuesday described Yavlinsky's accusations as a
publicity effort and called on him to provide hard facts.
	   Yavlinsky, in his turn, has said that he simply wanted to draw
public attention to the problem and it remained up to police and
prosecutors to collect specific evidence.

Turkey to request extradition of Germany-based Islamic leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey is to ask Germany to extradite an
Islamic leader allegedly to be behind a foiled plan for a suicide
attack on the mausoleum of modern Turkey's founder, the justice
minister said Tuesday.
	   Turkish authorities say they foiled the attack by detaining 23
members of the group last week, just a day before the planned
attack during celebrations marking secular Turkey's 75th
anniversary.
	   Authorities claim Metin Kaplan, the head of the Germany-based
Association of Islamic Groups and Communities, ordered the attack.
	   His four-year-old group advocates replacing Turkey's secular
government with an Islamic state.
	   Germany has refused past requests for his extradition on grounds
that he is a political refugee.
	   ``It is no longer possible for Germany to consider Metin Kaplan
as a political suspect,'' Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu told
the Anatolia news agency during a visit to Strasbourg, France.

Turks march to protest state-mafia ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Demonstrators took to the streets Tuesday
to protest ties between the government and gangsters on the second
anniversary of a car crash that revealed the extent of the
underworld's infiltration.
	   The scandal has forced a cabinet minister to resign and led to
the cancellation of a major bank privatization. Spurred on by tapes
of a mob boss talking with one of the bidders for the bank, the
government is investigating all pending privatizations.
	   Marches took place in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa and several
other cities marking the 1996 Susurluk accident, in which a wanted
fugitive and a senior police official were killed and a deputy from
the ruling party was injured.
	   In Ankara hundreds of protesters marched through the streets
behind a banner saying: ``We're united for a democracy against the
gangs.''
	   The Susurluk accident also revealed a bloody side to the
state-mob ties. A parliamentary inquiry found that the state had
employed gangs to murder people seen as threats to national
security, including human rights activists and journalists.
	   Many believe the full extent of the state-mob ties are still
unknown and are likely to remain so for political reasons. Ismet
Bertan, a columnist for Radical newspaper, wrote Tuesday that
Susurluk showed ``the absence of a rule of law, the unlawful
practices of the state and the shelving of law.''

Gov't authorizes future talks with groups close to ETA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS lead graf to clarify, ADDS background on talks in 1989 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said
Tuesday he had authorized talks with organizations linked to the
armed Basque separatist group ETA, marking the first time his
government has taken steps to negotiate an end to the 30-year
conflict.
	   ``There are news reports that I have authorized contacts. It's
true,'' Aznar said upon his return from a trip to London.
	   The contacts would be through the Basque National Liberation
Movement, a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist
organizations, a spokesman for Aznar's office said on the condition
of anonymity.
	   ``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take
place with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' the spokesman said.
``We cannot say anything yet about the how, who and when.''
	   The official government spokesman, Josep Pique, told reporters
that the contacts were aimed at exploring possibilities opened up
by the cease-fire, ``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to
give up violence for good.''
	   The Basque peace process was ushered in nearly two months ago
when ETA initiated an indefinite cease-fire in its campaign for a
Basque homeland straddling northern Spain and southern France.
	   Groups close to ETA said the truce was modeled on the Northern
Irish process that led to last April's peace accord and called on
the government to promote a negotiated settlement as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had done in Northern Ireland.
	   Irish republican leader Gerry Adams visited the Basque region
last month and urged Aznar's government to respond positively to
the cease-fire by opening negotiations for peace.
	   A group of Basque political parties and organizations known as
the Irish Forum secured Adams' backing for its proposal, known as
the Lizarra Declaration, for all-party peace talks, including the
government and ETA.
	   The government rejected the proposal at the time.
	   Extensive peace talks between a Spanish government and ETA have
not taken place since 1989 when the Socialist party was in power.
	   The failure of these talks, held in Algeria, was subsequently
used to justify hard-line policies ruling out a negotiated solution
to the conflict.
	   Aznar's tough stand against ETA, resulting in many arrests and
earlier this year the dismantling of a major ETA financial network
and the closing of an allied daily newspaper, is believed to have
been a factor in bringing about the cease-fire.
	   The Irish Forum includes Herri Batasuna, the radical political
coalition linked to ETA, as well as moderate Basque nationalist
parties, labor unions and civic groups.
	   The government's hard-line position of rejecting peace
negotiations with ETA or legal organizations linked to it has
softened gradually since the cease-fire and since regional
elections on Oct. 25.
	   Recently, the government let it be known ETA would not be
required to hand over its weapons before peace talks could be held
covering such issues as the future of 535 ETA prisoners being held
in Spanish jails.
	   Aznar's Popular Party and Euskal Herritarrok, a political
coalition linked to ETA, came in second and third respectively in
last month's Basque regional elections. The moderate Basque
Nationalist Party that supports ETA aims but opposes its violence
placed first.
	   Euskal Herritarrok said the elections showed that Basques wanted
to see political negotiations to resolve the dispute over Basque
independence _ one of the last armed conflicts in Western Europe.
	   The government said it interpreted the election results to mean
that many Basques do not want independence.
	   ETA, which stands in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   Before the truce, the group had been targeting town councilors
from Aznar's Popular Party in retaliation for the government's
hard-line policies, killing six since July last year.

U.S., Britain say force not ruled out against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS throughout with joint British-U.S. statement warning

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain and the United States warned Tuesday that
they have not ruled out the use of force if Iraq fails to back down
in its latest confrontation over U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his British counterpart
George Roberston, meeting briefly in London, issued a statement
calling the two countries in ``complete agreement about the gravity
of the situation.''
	   On Saturday, Iraq banned U.N. weapons inspection teams from
working in the country after the U.N. Security Council again
refused to lift economic sanctions. The Security Council demanded
that Iraq reverse the ban.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has to realize that full compliance with the
U.N. is the only way open to Iraq to achieve the lifting of
sanctions,'' the statement from Cohen and Robertson said.
	   It added that all options remained on the table, including the
use of force, to persuade Saddam.
	   The situation is similar to the last crisis in February, when an
Iraqi refusal to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to do their job led
to a buildup of forces in the Gulf.
	   ``Diplomacy can achieve a lot,'' Robertson told British
Broadcasting Corp. radio on Tuesday. ``Diplomacy backed by the
threat of force can achieve much more.''
	   He added that ``Saddam has got to get a very clear and unanimous
message from the international community that this is not going to
be tolerated.''
	   Also Tuesday, The Guardian newspaper quoted an Iraqi defector as
saying Saddam has a chemical and biological weapons arsenal that he
keeps secret from even his most senior advisers.
	   Abbas Al-Janabi, the former private secretary to Saddam's son,
told the newspaper that Saddam has misled senior officials into
thinking the weapons have been destroyed.
	   ``Even (Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister) Tareq Aziz doesn't know
where the weapons are,'' Al-Janabi, who defected last spring and
lives in hiding, was quoted as saying.

Farmer seek crop reforms; warn of more roadblocks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LARISA, Greece (AP) _ Hundreds of farmers staged a rally Tuesday
demanding a change to some agriculture limits and warned they could
mobilize another spree of highway blockades if they are ignored.
	   Farmers, meeting in the central city of Larisa, seek higher
European Union limits on cotton production. They also want a change
in regulations regarding grains because of expections that prices
will decrease by 30 percent next year.
	   The farmers warned they could again use tractors to set up
barricades.
	   Earlier this year, farmers attempting to force higher subsidies
out of the Socialist government blocked the country's main
north-south highway and other roads. The government refused to meet
the farmers' demands, saying it would hurt efforts to meet EU
fiscal guidelines.
	   Similar actions by farmers last year cut the country in two for
more than a month, stranding thousands of trucks and causing a loss
of more than dlrs 150 million in international and domestic trade.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A U.S.-backed proposal for the
developing world to take a bigger role in combating global warming
received a cool reception at a U.N. climate summit.
	   Developing nations led by China have blocked efforts to add
discussion of ``voluntary'' quotas for poorer nations to the agenda
of the conference, the biggest since last year's landmark global
warming treaty.
	   Persuading China and India to commit to reducing greenhouse
gases under the 1997 treaty has proved one of the thorniest issues.
	   Spurred by China and other foes of voluntary commitments, 163
nations unanimously decided Monday to block the issue from even
reaching the agenda as they kicked off their two-week conference.
	   Debate on other issues continued Tuesday as the delegates sought
to flesh out the 1997 treaty reached in Kyoto, Japan.
	   ``To say the least, we are disappointed that it appears that
countries will not have an opportunity to explore this matter in
any detail,'' U.S. negotiator Melinda Kimble told the delegates.
	   In the December Kyoto accord, governments set 2012 as the
deadline for cutting back on greenhouse gases in the United States,
Japan, the 15-nation European Union and 21 other industrial
nations.
	   Although the cuts apply only to those 38 nations, greenhouse
emissions in India and China are expected by 2015 to exceed those
of the biggest polluter, the United States.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
five gases, chiefly carbon dioxide from power plant and automobile
consumption. Critics say dire warming scenarios remain unproven and
don't warrant potentially costly shifts away from fossil fuels.
	   The United States is not among the 38 signers of the accord, and
a Republican-led Senate remains skeptical without greater efforts
by the developing world.
	   Developing countries argue that their economies can't assume the
costs of switching to alternative energy sources to reduce their
greenhouse gas output. They point out industrialized nations
developed rapidly by using carbon fuels _ and that they loaded the
atmosphere with carbon dioxide to start.
	   The Kyoto accord would require the European Union to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases 8 percent
below 1990 levels, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 6
percent.
	   Later Tuesday, delegates were to discuss a plan, broadly
endorsed at Kyoto, to meet their greenhouse gas reductions by
trading or purchasing credits from other nations that have already
met goals.
	   Washington supports unrestricted swapping, to save industries
money. But opponents insist unrestricted trading would let the
United States reach targets without actually scaling back
emissions.
	   ``Kyoto was a significant, but small step forward.
Unfortunately, there has been no significant progress since,'' said
Jennifer Morgan of the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund.
	   ``Instead there is talk of loopholes ... in which the countries
that emit the most pollution can wriggle out of the commitments
they made in Kyoto.''
	   With 1.5 million metric tons (1.65 million U.S. tons) a year,
the United States leads in carbon dioxide emission _ nearly twice
as much as China. Washington says it is working to cut those
emissions while seeking to make the United States more energy
efficient.

British Petroleum profits hit by weak oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Petroleum PLC announced Tuesday that its
quarterly profits fell 35 percent to 445 million pounds (dlrs 736
million), attributing the lower earnings to weak oil prices and
depressed market conditions.
	   BP said its pretax profits for the three months ending Sept. 30
compared with earnings of 691 million pounds (dlrs 1.1 billion) in
the same period a year earlier.
	   Revenues plunged 18.5 percent to 9.2 billion pounds (dlrs 15.2
billion), from 11.3 billion pounds (dlrs 18.6 billion).
	   John Browne, BP's chief executive officer, said the results
reflected a ``difficult business environment.''
	   Oil prices have dropped by one third in the last year.
	   BP said it made an average of dlrs 12 per barrel for its crude
oil in the quarter just ended, down from dlrs 17.90 in the same
period during 1997.
	   Despite lower prices, however, the company is pumping more oil.
It reported its oil production rose 12 percent over last year,
partly offsetting losses due to weak prices.
	   BP announced that for the first nine months of the year, its
pretax profits came to 2.4 billion pounds (dlrs 4 billion), down
from 3.4 billion pounds (dlrs 5.6 billion) a year earlier.
	   Revenues for the first nine months of the year came to 26.5
billion pounds (dlrs 43.7 billion), compared with 35.5 billion
pounds (dlrs 58.6 billion).
	   BP, the world's third-largest oil company, in August agreed to
acquire Amoco in a deal worth dlrs 58 billion, the largest
industrial merger in U.S. history.
	   Browne said the deal, which is awaiting regulatory and
shareholder approval, is on track for completion by the end of the
year.
	   ``Our merger plans are well-advanced,'' he said. ``Discussions
with the regulatory bodies are going well.''
	   The new company would be the second-biggest gasoline retailer in
the United States, behind a joint venture that covers Shell and
Texaco gasoline stations. Existing BP stations would be converted
to Amoco.

World Bank: No loans to Belarus until reforms begin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A World Bank delegation left Belarus on
Tuesday saying no aid will be provided to this former Soviet
republic until it begins economic reforms.
	   The World Bank has repeatedly criticized Belarus for making
virtually no reforms in its Soviet-style economy, and even refusing
to abide by an agreement to introduce a single exchange rate.
	   Belarus uses five different exchange rates for conversions
between its ruble and the U.S. dollar. World Bank officials have
said the lack of a single, objective rate has prevented the
accumulation of hard-currency reserves and inaccurately reflected
the country's health in trade and production.
	   ``I told the government that ... new loans cannot be made in the
foreseeable future, and definitely not until crucial reforms have
been implemented _ mainly the reform of the exchange mechanism,''
World Bank vice president Johannes Linn told reporters at the close
of the visit.
	   Last summer, the Belarusian government and the World Bank signed
a memorandum on relaxing controls on the ruble rate, but the
government has refused to act so far.
	   Linn said Belarus also needs to limit money-printing, stop
providing money to support outdated, unprofitable factories, speed
up privatization, and generally liberalize the economy to attract
investors.
	   Belarus has one of the most unreformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, with most enterprises still under state control. It
was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, with a dramatic slump
in its currency prompting the government to order strict price
controls.
	   The current economic crisis in Russia _ which traditionally was
the main customer for Belarusian goods _ has made Belarus'
situation even worse.

Court refuses bail to embattled author Taslima Nasrin

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A Bangladeshi court refused bail to
Taslima Nasrin and on Tuesday ordered the embattled novelist to
surrender by Jan. 5 to answer charges of blaspheming Islam.
	   Nasrin, who faces death threats from Islamic extremists and a
warrant of arrest, has been in hiding since returning in September
from four years of self-imposed exile in Europe and America. She
accompanied her mother, who has colon cancer.
	   ``I'm greatly disappointed by the court's ruling. I want freedom
to take care of my ailing mother,'' the 36-year-old author told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview from her hideout.
	   Police said they were unable to locate her.
	   Nasrin became the target of Islamic extremists after a newspaper
quoted her as saying that the Koran, the Islamic holy book, should
be rewritten. She denied making the comment, but admitted that she
supports changes in Islamic laws to give more rights to women in
her male-dominated society.
	   Extremists have offered 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to anyone who
kills her.
	   Since she returned, thousands of Muslim conservatives have
demonstrated in the Bangladeshi capital, Dkaha, demanding Nasrin's
death.
	   Dhaka magistrate Ali Ahmed ordered Nasrin's arrest in September
in a civil suit that accused her of offending the religious
sentiments of Muslims in her book Nirbachito Column (Selected
Columns), a compilation of her newspaper writings.
	   This case was in addition to another blasphemy case filed in
1994 by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government.
	   Nasrin was freed on bail in the state-sponsored case after she
surrendered to a court after three months in hiding. She fled to
Stockholm, Sweden, in 1994.

Kosovo rebels demand further cutdown in Serb troop numbers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A rebel organization is demanding
further cutdowns in Serb police and Yugoslav army troop figures in
Kosovo, a political representative of the guerrillas said Tuesday.
	   Speaking for the Kosovo Liberation Army, Adem Demaci told
reporters that both the figure of 15,000 Yugoslav army soldiers and
10,000 Serb policemen to be allowed to stay on is unacceptable to
the rebels in the Albanian-majority province.
	   Bowing to international pressure to halt his crackdown on the
secessionist province, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic agreed
last month to reduce the presence of his forces to the level before
the fighting.
	   ``We disagree with this figure, it is causing distress among the
(ethnic Albanian) population,'' Demaci said, speaking for the KLA.
	   ``We shall try to bring it down to a necessary minimum ... of
6,000 soldiers and 2,500 police,'' he said.
	   ``Displaced people are afraid to return home and are losing
valuable time for repairing their damaged houses ahead of the
coming winter,'' he said.
	   Demaci also reiterated KLA accusations that Serb troops were
regrouping and relocating instead of withdrawing.

Suspected Croat concentration camp guard proclaims innocence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A 72-year-old Croat woman suspected of
torturing inmates in Croatia's most notorious World War II camp
declared Tuesday that the charges are groundless, her attorney
said.
	   Nada Sakic, who was extradited Monday from Argentina, met with
an investigative judge from the Zagreb district court, Mirjana
Rigljan, in the first step toward determining whether she will be
indicted for war crimes.
	   Her husband Dinko, 76, is already imprisoned here, facing war
crimes charges.
	   Mrs. Sakic was extradited on a warrant accusing her of
``carrying out torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as
terror, intimidation and collective punishment of civilians,''
which led to the deaths of an unknown number of inmates.
	   As a teen-ager, Mrs. Sakic allegedly was a guard from 1942-45 in
the women's section in the Stara Gradiska camp, part of the
Jasenovac concentration camp complex.
	   Dinko Sakic, extradited in June from Argentina, is suspected of
ordering, witnessing and participating in the war crimes committed
in the Jasenovac camp he commanded between 1942 and 1944.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist Croats
were killed at Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than 20
concentration camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet
state.
	   After hearing the charges, Mrs. Sakic said she ``doesn't even
want to respond to such false accusations,'' her attorney Branko
Seric told reporters.
	   ``She didn't want to present her defense because she thinks the
charges are groundless,'' Seric said. Asked whether she thereby
feels not guilty, he replied: ``Absolutely.''
	   The district court will now hear witnesses.
	   Mrs. Sakic, who suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, spent
the night in Zagreb's main prison, where her husband also is
imprisoned. But the two have not met, pending approval from prison
authorities, Seric said.
	   The Sakics married in late 1944, after apparently meeting each
other through Maks Luburic, Nada's half-brother and Dinko Sakic's
superior. Luburic was in charge of World War II camps in Croatia.
	   Some Croatian media claimed Nada was actually put into Stara
Gradiska by Luburic, who wanted the young sister, left without
parents, to be safe and taken care of by his subordinates.
According to these claims, she did wear a uniform, but was not a
camp guard and did not participate in any of the developments
there.
	   Seric indicated that will be her line of defense. ``That is
exactly what happened,'' she said.
	   ``She was in the camp by a combination of circumstances, not as
an official in charge of doing things that she is now accused of,''
he said.
	   The two fled Croatia in 1945 when Nazi rule was crushed. Both
lived quietly in the Argentine capital until April, when Dinko
Sakic outraged Holocaust survivors by telling Argentine television
that Jasenovac victims died of disease and natural causes.
	   Nada Sakic was arrested in July at the request of Yugoslav
officials, who accuse her of genocide.
	   Croatia then also asked for her extradition, apparently to
prevent her from being tried in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, where
she would face a tougher trial. The majority of victims at the camp
were Serbs.

Spanish central bank cuts interest rate to 3.5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Bank of Spain, the country's central
bank, announced Tuesday that it was cutting interest rates to 3.5
percent from 3.75 percent, effective from Wednesday.
	   The country's main banks immediately began announcing similar
quarter point cuts in their prime rates.
	   The benchmark cut will become effective from Wednesday's auction
of the Bank of Spain's repurchase agreements.
	   The Bank of Spain has cut its key benchmark rate three times
this year, down to 3.75 percent from 4.75 percent.
	   Spanish monetary and fiscal authorities have kept a tight grip
on the economy in recent years to make the country eligible to join
the single European currency at its planned launch on Jan. 1, 1999.

Sierra Leone's rebel leader takes death sentence to higher court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Condemned to death by hanging,
Sierra Leone's notorious rebel leader Foday Sankoh has appealed his
fate to a higher court, Justice Minister Solomon Berewa said
Tuesday.
	   Sankoh, leader of the rebel Revolutionary Front which is accused
of mass killings and maimings of unarmed civilians, has filed his
appeal, which was being processed by court employees, said Berewa,
who is also the country's attorney-general.
	   The case is expected to begin within the next month in a High
Court in the capital of Freetown, Berewa told journalists without
giving details.
	   Sankoh, an enigmatic former photographer and traditional healer
who later joined politics and launched Sierra Leone's civil war in
1991, was convicted late last month for treason and crimes against
humanity by a 12-member jury. He smiled and sang as the judge
passed the death sentence.
	   He did not have a lawyer during the trial because none were
found willing to represent him, despite urgings from human rights
groups and the United Nations. Berewa said Sankoh had still not
found a lawyer and it was unclear if he would represent himself in
the appeal.
	   Sankoh's rebels, who were ousted from the capital earlier this
year by a West African intervention force after taking power in a
bloody coup in May 1997, has escalated a retribution campaign of
civilian killings since their leader first appeared on trial in
August.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Candy? Computer games? Cinema
tickets? Shares?
	   The choice of how to spend pocket money got more difficult for
Dutch youngsters Tuesday with the launch of a new 400-share
investment fund aimed at the nation's youth.
	   Robeco Group, Europe's largest independent investment manager,
is aiming to attract investors aged 12-19 years with the open-ended
fund made up of stocks ``familiar'' to young people.
	   Dutch companies including entertainment group Endemol, food
retailer Ahold and telecom company KPN will sit side by side with
the likes of Coca Cola and McDonalds in the RG Youngdynamic Fund.
	   The company also has set up an Internet site where youngsters
can get information about investing and the fund, which Robeco
claims is the Netherlands' first aimed at such young investors.
	   Subscription for the fund starts Saturday and will last until
November 27. The fund, with an issue price of 25 guilders (dlrs
13.37), will get a listing on the Amsterdam stock exchange Dec. 1.
	   Robeco said the fund aims at a long-term return of 8 percent to
10 percent.

First state-protected witness testifies about journalist's murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The first state-protected witness in the
Irish Republic's history testified Tuesday about his drug-dealing
gang's assassination of investigative journalist Veronica Guerin.
	   Guerin was shot several times point-blank at a traffic
intersection in June 1996 in reprisal for her series of exposes on
Dublin's criminal underworld. She had been on the verge of naming
the city's senior drug-trafficking figures.
	   One of those subsequently arrested, Charles Bowden, was granted
immunity from prosecution and placed in a witness-protection
program founded specifically in response to Guerin's killing.
	   On Tuesday, Bowden told Dublin's Special Criminal Court that his
role was to retrieve a .357 Magnum from its hiding place, load it
and leave it at a prearranged spot, along with six extra rounds of
ammo.
	   He was testifying against Paul ``Hippo'' Ward, who has been
charged with Guerin's murder. Bowden said Ward was involved in
planning the killing and disposed of the gun and motorcycle used in
the attack, but did not pull the trigger.
	   Ward, held without bail since his October 1996 arrest, denies
any involvement in killing Guerin. His lawyers have spent most of
this year appealing for the right to see police documents
identifying other witnesses and Bowden's negotiations for immunity
in exchange for his evidence.
	   Bowden also testified Tuesday that their gang was dealing an
average 350,000 kilograms (800,000 pounds) of marijuana per week
before police cracked down following Guerin's death.
	   In the 1980s, British authorities in Northern Ireland granted
immunity and protection to turncoat members of the province's
several terrorist groups in exchange for their testimony. That
approach was never tried in the Irish Republic.

Russian legislator: Saddam wants timetable on sanctions

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein wants a
timetable for lifting U.N. sanctions before he will let U.N.
weapons inspections resume, a visiting Russian legislator said
Tuesday.
	   The hard-line Vladimir Zhirinovsky told reporters after two
hours of talks with Saddam that the Iraqi president saw ``no
problem'' with monitoring to determine whether Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction. Such inspections are a condition
for ending the sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990.
	   ``But he would like to have information when the blockade (will
be) eliminated,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``When? This year, next year,
next century?'' said the legislator, a regular visitor to Iraq who
has had good relations with Saddam.
	   Saddam has not spoken publicly since the government announced
Saturday that it was halting dealings with the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees weapons inspections. Iraq's precondition
for resuming cooperation was U.N. pledges to begin easing or
lifting the trade sanctions, which limit the sale of oil and ban
most other financial dealings with Iraq.
	   The stance has put Iraq on a collision course with the U.N.
Security Council, which termed the action a ``flagrant violation''
of U.N. resolutions.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair suggested that military force was an option.
	   Zhirinovsky said of Saddam that ``he would like peace.'' But he
added: ``Iraq made everything to fulfill all resolutions of the
United Nations, but the United Nations doesn't make anything for
Iraq.''
	   Iraq has charged that the Special Commission, directed by
Australian Richard Butler, has been working on behalf of the United
States to prolong the sanctions.
	   Zhirinovsky quoted Saddam as saying the Special Commission
needed to be restructured to make it ``more objective.'' The Iraqi
leader suggested Butler be replaced by someone from China, Russia
or France, the Russian legislator said.
	   Representatives of the three countries have been the Security
Council members most willing to ease sanctions.
	   On Tuesday, China urged Iraq to end the standoff and said
cooperation would be the quickest way to end the sanctions. At the
same time, the Security Council should fairly evaluate the
inspection work so far and ``gradually lift the sanctions,''
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.
	   The United States and Britain, the other permanent members,
insist sanctions stay in place until the weapons inspections are
finished.
	   Earlier Tuesday, some 60 coffins were carried atop taxis in the
latest symbolic funeral procession for children the government says
died because of the sanctions.
	   About 100 women, most dressed in black, accompanied the orange
and white taxis, shouting ``Today we bury them, tomorrow we will
avenge them'' and ``America is the enemy of God.''
	   The protesters abandoned their usual route to the U.N.
headquarters and, instead, marched to the gate of the Al-Rasheed
Hotel. A number of diplomats _ including Zhirinovsky _ are staying
at the hotel, most to attend the Baghdad International Fair.
Western reporters also stay at the Al-Rasheed.
	   Also Tuesday, three monitoring teams from the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency went into the field to check
three previously declared weapons sites, U.N. spokeswoman Caroline
Cross said.
	   She said a technical team from the U.N. Special Commission _
which looks into biological and chemical weapons as well as
long-range missiles _ went out to deal with a problem involving a
camera or a sensor. She gave no other details.
	   While Iraq has halted the work of UNSCOM inspectors and
monitors, it has continued to let nuclear monitors work.
	   In a front-page editorial Tuesday the state-run Al-Iraq daily
said the country should prepare to battle ``the U.S. monster''
regardless of the sacrifices.

Italian No.1 player Gaudenzi troubled by sore shoulder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's No.1 player Andrea Gaudenzi is a
questionable starter in the Davis Cup final against Sweden because
of a sore shoulder.
	   Paolo Bertolucci, captain of the Italian Davis Cup team, said
Tuesday that Gaudenzi gave up two tournaments in Argentina and
Chile later this month because of pains in his right shoulder,
already operated twice.
	   Gaudenzi, who led Italy to an upset victory against the United
States in the Davis Cup semifinals, is considered a key to a
possible Italian victory in the Dec. 4-6 final against Sweden,
scheduled on clay at Milan's Forum Dec. 4-6.
	   ``Doctors are confident that Gaudenzi can recover for the final,
but I must think of possible alternatives,'' Bertolucci said.
	   The Italian team which qualified for the final was made with
Gaudenzi, Davide Sanguinetti and doubles specialist Diego Nargiso.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Canadian model Linda Evangelista was
described in press reports Tuesday as overweight and unsteady on
her feet in an appearance at a Portuguese fashion show.
	   Evangelista, 33, was the headline attraction at the Portugal
Fashion event in the northern city Oporto on Sunday night.
	   Daily paper Publico described her as ``beautiful but clumsy.''
	   Another daily, Jornal de Noticias, said she was ``a great
disappointment'' and described her as ``visibly pregnant.''
	   In general the papers said she appeared lethargic, tripped on
the hem of a long white dress, and that one of the dresses she wore
had to be altered to make it bigger.
	   She reportedly left the show before the finale, in which she was
due to appear.
	   A spokeswoman for the Lisbon branch of her modeling agency said
Evangelista was unwell with food poisoning.
	   ``She was sick before she arrived. She was wrong to have come,''
said the spokeswoman for Look Elite who declined to identify
herself by name.
	   Manuel Serrao, spokesman for Portugal's National Association of
Young Businessmen which organized the show, said Evangelista ``did
not carry out precisely the work she was contracted to do.''
	   Her agent acknowledged the shortcomings and her appearance fee
was renegotiated, Serrao said by phone. He declined to give
details.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Signaling an easing of Kosovo's
refugee crisis, international relief organizations said Tuesday
that thousands of displaced had found shelter ahead of winter.
	   A U.S. senior official in the region for the second time in two
months reinforced this idea, saying that a humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo has been averted, although the situation remains delicate.
	   ``The crisis is still there and very fragile, but the
catastrophe that we all expected, hopefully will not happen,'' U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft told reporters at the end
of her four-day tour of the Kosovo region.
	   Taft visited the region in August, at the height of the conflict
in Kosovo when hundreds of thousands of people were displaced by
the fighting. At that time, she predicted Kosovo would be engulfed
in a humanitarian catastrophe if universal attention was not
focused on an immediate cessation of the hostilities.
	   International humanitarian agencies estimated last weekend that
some 200,000 people were still displaced within Kosovo, but as few
as 5,000 of them remained camped in the open. Others were staying
with neighbors or relatives.
	   Jacques Franquin, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Geneva, also said the number of people camped out in
the open has dropped considerably, since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic scaled down troops and police in the province
last week.
	   But the reduction was not enough for the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which has spearheaded the fight to wrest the Albanian-majority
province away from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   Speaking for the ethnic Albanian guerrillas, Adem Demaci told
reporters that both the figure of 15,000 Yugoslav army soldiers and
10,000 Serb policemen to be allowed to stay on is unacceptable.
	   Bowing to international pressure to halt his crackdown on the
secessionist province, Milosevic agreed last month to reduce the
presence of his forces to the level before the fighting.
	   But Demaci said no more than 6,000 soldiers and 2,500 police
should be allowed to stay.
	   ``Displaced people are afraid to return home and are losing
valuable time for repairing their damaged houses ahead of the
coming winter,'' he said.
	   Also Tuesday U.S. envoy, Christopher Hill met with ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the provincial capital Pristina
for discussions on a draft agreement with the Serbs on Kosovo's
future.
	   Afterward, Rugova joined Hill in touring a war-devastated area
southwest of Pristina _ a first-time move reflecting the relative
freedom of movement in areas that for months were unsafe because of
Serb-Albanian violence.
	   In the village of Banja, on the road running southwest of
Pristina to Malisevo, some Albanians kissed Rugova. Later, in
Orahovac, a mixed town, a Serb complained to Rugova that his father
was missing because of the turmoil. Replying in Serb, Rugova said:
``We're together in this.''
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has led international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 others have been forced from
their homes since Serb authorities launched a crackdown on Albanian
militants in February.
	   As part of an Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to order
troops back to their barracks and dismantle police barricades,
allowing for people to return safely.
	   On Tuesday, however, a regional command of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army claimed that Serb forces have not been withdrawing
as planned from their checkpoints in the west of the province.
	   In a statement faxed to the ethnic Albanian media Tuesday, a KLA
regional command, claimed Serb forces have regrouped and relocated
to positions farther off the main roads. It also said the Serbs
were shooting at Albanians trying to return to their villages. It
warned of retaliation ``if provocations, attacks and murder of
civilians continue.
	   The KLA statement also claimed Serb police buried nine ethnic
Albanians in the border town of Junik Monday. The Albanians were
reportedly killed recently in clashes at the border.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed and there
was no immediate response from the Serb side.
	   Serbian sources in the province reported Tuesday that the KLA
attacked overnight an ethnic Albanian family for ``its known
loyalty to Serbia,'' leaving one person in a coma.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Albanians.

Ethiopia orders Sudanese rebel group to close office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ Ethiopia has ordered the Sudanese
People's Liberation Army to close its office in western Ethiopia on
the border with Sudan, a source said Tuesday.
	   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi had
ordered rebel leader John Garang to close the SPLA office in the
Gambella region that borders Sudan.
	   The Sudanese government had also agreed to curb the activities
of Ethiopian opposition groups in its territory, the source added.
	   The move was seen as a sign of further improvement of ties
between Addis Ababa and Khartoum, strained since suspected
Sudan-based assailants tried to assassinate Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak at an Organization of African Unity summit in Addis
Ababa in 1995.
	   Quoting the Sudanese Al Alwan newspaper, three private Ethiopian
newspapers reported at the weekend that Garang had been had been
ordered to pull out his forces away from the border area in
addition to closing the SPLA office in Gambella.
	   But when questioned about the newspaper reports Tuesday,
government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse replied: ``Was there an SPLA
office in western Ethiopia in the first place?''
	   She said she would not at any rate comment on reports from
independent newspapers whose sources, she said, were unreliable.
	   The relationship between Ethiopia and Sudan began to improve
dramatically after the outbreak five months ago of a simmering
border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Eritrea has been at loggerheads with Sudan, which it accuses of
interference in its internal affairs. Eritrea is host to the
National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella group of Sudanese opposed
to the Islamic Front government of President Omar el-Bashir.
	   Ten days ago, Ethiopian Airlines resumed flights to the Khartou,
2 1/2 years after suspending them in the aftermath of the Mubarak
assassination attempt.
	   Ethiopia accused Sudan of complicity, and relations fell to an
all-time low.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of slain fashion heir Maurizio
Gucci was convicted of his murder Tuesday and sentenced to 29 years
in prison. Four codefendants were also convicted, with the
triggerman getting a life sentence.
	   The verdict came only a few hours after Patrizia Reggiani
Martinelli make a final plea for mercy before a crowded courtroom,
saying she was naive and involved in his murder against her will.
	   The prosecution had asked for the maximum _ a life sentence. But
the panel of two judges and five citizens instead gave her 29 years
in prison.
	   Reggiani Martinelli was accused of murdering her ex-husband to
gain control of his fortune.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said
Tuesday he had authorized talks with groups linked to the militant
Basque ETA separatists, marking the first time his government has
taken steps to negotiate an end to the 30-year conflict.
	   ``There are news reports that I have authorized contacts. It's
true,'' Aznar said upon his return from a trip to London.
	   The contacts would be through the Basque National Liberation
Movement, a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist
organizations, a spokesman for Aznar's office said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   ``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take
place with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' the spokesman said.
``We cannot say anything yet about the how, who and when.''
	   The official government spokesman, Josep Pique, told reporters
that the contacts were aimed at exploring possibilities opened up
by the cease-fire, ``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to
give up violence for good.''
	   ETA ushered in the Basque peace process two months ago when it
declared an indefinite cease-fire in its campaign for a Basque
homeland straddling northern Spain and southern France.
	   Groups close to ETA said the truce was modeled on the Northern
Irish process that led to last April's peace accord and urged the
government to promote a negotiated settlement as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had done in Northern Ireland.
	   Irish republican leader Gerry Adams visited the Basque region
last month and urged Aznar's government to respond positively to
the cease-fire by opening negotiations for peace.
	   A group of Basque political parties and organizations known as
the Irish Forum secured Adams' backing for its proposal, known as
the Lizarra Declaration, for all-party peace talks, including the
government and ETA.
	   The government rejected the proposal at the time.
	   Extensive peace talks between a Spanish government and ETA have
not taken place since 1989 when the Socialist party was in power.
	   The failure of these talks, held in Algeria, was subsequently
used to justify hard-line policies ruling out a negotiated solution
to the conflict.
	   Aznar's tough stand against ETA _ including the arrest of Basque
militants, the dismantling of a major ETA financial network and the
closing of an allied daily newspaper _ is believed to have been a
factor in bringing about the cease-fire.
	   The Irish Forum includes Herri Batasuna, the political coalition
linked to ETA, as well as moderate Basque nationalist parties,
labor unions and civic groups.
	   The government's hard-line position of rejecting peace
negotiations with ETA or legal organizations linked to it has
softened gradually since the cease-fire and since regional
elections on Oct. 25.
	   Recently, the government suggested that ETA would not be
required to hand over its weapons before peace talks could be held
covering such issues as the future of 535 ETA prisoners being held
in Spanish jails.
	   Aznar's Popular Party and Euskal Herritarrok, a political
coalition linked to ETA, came in second and third respectively in
last month's Basque regional elections. The moderate Basque
Nationalist Party that supports ETA aims but opposes its violence
won.
	   Euskal Herritarrok said the elections showed that Basques wanted
to see political negotiations to resolve the dispute over Basque
independence _ one of the last armed conflicts in Western Europe.
	   The government said it interpreted the election results to mean
that many Basques do not want independence.
	   ETA, which stands in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   Before the truce, the group had been targeting town councilors
from Aznar's Popular Party in retaliation for the government's
hard-line policies, killing six since July 1997.

EU Commission seen recommending big states represent euro-zone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission is expected to
recommend Wednesday that the 11 nations that adopt the euro as
their common currency be represented at G-7 meetings by France,
Germany and Italy, the euro-zone's existing G-7 members.
	   A draft of proposal from the 20-member European Union executive
was leaked to reporters Tuesday. Due to be adopted by the
Commission Wednesday, the recommendation seems likely to anger
smaller members of the euro-zone.
	   However, Commission officials said room for maneuver is limited
because the big EU nations are unwilling to cede their seats at G-7
ministerial meetings. Also, non-EU members of the group of leading
world economic powers do not want to create space for a separate
euro-zone delegation.
	   The proposal does recommend that strict consultation and
reporting measures are set up to keep smaller euro-zone nations
informed of G-7 developments.
	   The question of who will represent the euro-zone in
international fora is one of the last remaining issues to be
resolved before the launch of the euro on Jan. 1.
	   EU finance ministers are scheduled to debate the Commission's
proposals on Nov. 23, and a final decision is expected at a
December summit of EU leaders in Vienna, Austria.
	   The Commission appears to side-step the question of how the
powerful new European Central Bank, which will run monetary policy
in the euro-zone, should be represented at meetings of G-7 central
bankers.
	   Regarding the International Monetary Fund, the Commission
recommends that the country holding the EU's six-month rotating
presidency speak for the euro-zone.

Israel delays peace deal, links it to arrest of Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs, UPDATES with Ross arriving Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new crisis of confidence, Israel said
Tuesday it will not carry out the land-for-security agreement with
the Palestinians until it gets assurances that 30 Palestinian
fugitives will be arrested by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The Palestinians said the United States was satisfied with their
anti-terror plan and accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
seizing a pretext to avoid handing over West Bank land.
	   The latest dispute raised questions about whether the two sides
could stick to the 12-week program, which was to have taken effect
on Monday but was delayed at the request of Netanyahu.
	   Under the time table, the first installment of an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank is due on Nov. 16.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the Middle East
on Thursday to oversee implementation, and Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat it was up to the Americans to break the latest impasse.
	   ``Netanyahu wants to break the time line,'' Erekat told The
Associated Press. ``They (the Americans) must interfere.''
	   The new recriminations made it clear that any good will
generated by the new peace accord has already evaporated. With
suspicions running high, the United States will likely have to step
in as referee repeatedly in the coming weeks.
	   The latest crisis began Tuesday morning, three hours before the
Israeli Cabinet was to start a two-day debate on the peace
agreement, with ratification expected on Wednesday.
	   Netanyahu announced that he would not convene the ministers
because the Palestinians have not submitted a complete blueprint
for fighting terrorism to the Americans, as promised.
	   ``I won't show the ministers an incomplete agreement,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu would not say what information was missing, but
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai later said Israel was holding
out for a list of 30 wanted Palestinians the Palestinian Authority
has promised to arrest as part of the peace agreement. Israel also
wants a timetable for the arrests, Mordechai said.
	   Israel has said it cannot begin implementing the agreement until
it has been approved by the Cabinet and by parliament, which is to
vote on the accord Nov. 12.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily to the latest delay.
	   ``Instead of playing these sorry political games, he (Netanyahu)
should just stand up and say ... I won't implement what I have
signed,'' said Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   The United States appeared to be siding with the Palestinians in
the dispute. James Rubin, the U.S. State Department spokesman, said
Monday that ``the necessary plans were provided on time, prior to
entry into force (of the agreement).''
	   Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in the Gaza
Strip, said he discussed the anti-terror plan with Israeli security
officials who also considered it sufficient.
	   Israeli commentator Emanuel Rosen said the arrest of the 30
fugitives is a fringe issue and that Netanyahu apparently used it
to hold up the accord temporarily because he wanted to show Cabinet
hard liners that he is standing tough against the Palestinians.
	   Cabinet approval is not assured. At least six of 18 ministers
are undecided and three are opposed to the plan.
	   Erekat, meanwhile, said Israel was making new demands in
connection with the opening of a Palestinian airport in the Gaza
Strip, an issue that was already settled in the peace accord.
	   Erekat said Israel has told Palestinian negotiators that it
would only agree to the opening of the airport if the Palestinians
drop demands for a second land link between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   In the peace accord, the two sides had agreed to a second land
route in principle, but had left the issue to further negotiations.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, denied Erekat's claim,
saying Israel had not linked the airport opening to other issues.
	   In other developments Tuesday, a senior aide to Yasser Arafat
said Palestinian security agents have foiled Iranian-backed
attempts by the Islamic militant group Hamas to assassinate the
Palestinian leader.
	   Iran is training and funding a secret Hamas group to carry out
the assassination as well as suicide bombings, said Tayyeb Abdel
Rahim, the secretary general of the Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas denied in a leaflet that it was receiving money from Iran.
	   Palestinian security forces have rounded up more than 100
suspected Islamic militants since last week's suicide attack by the
group on an Israeli convoy. Hamas leaders on Tuesday put the number
of detainees at more than 300.

Another victim discovered in gutted Swedish dance hall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Investigators combing the charred ruins
of an upstairs dance hall hit by a raging fire discovered a body
Tuesday, raising the death toll in the catastrophe to 63.
	   The body was that of a 15-year-old girl who had been missing
since the fire broke out shortly before midnight Thursday at the
hall in Goteborg, 500 kilometers (300 miles) southwest of
Stockholm.
	   The body ''was very hard to detect _ nothing that you could see
with bare eyes when you come into the place,'' Ronald Bagge of the
Goteborg police said, according to the Swedish news agency TT.
	   ''It was something we discovered after going through the
premises square-centimeter by square-centimeter (square-inch by
square-inch),'' he said.
	   Despite the painstaking investigation, police on Tuesday offered
no information about the cause of the fire. The fire's rapid spread
has led to wide speculation that it was set.
	   The fire blocked one of the second-floor hall's two exit
stairways and some witnesses have reported the blaze apparently
started there. The stairway reportedly was crowded with chairs and
other pieces of wood furniture.
	   Most of those who died and the 160 others who were injured were
immigrants or the children of immigrants, largely Muslims. Despite
Islam's tradition of burying the dead quickly, investigators kept
the bodies for several days in order to examine them for clues to
the fire.
	   The first bodies were released on Tuesday.

Ukrainian government starts talks with IMF on economic situation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts, UPDATES throughout with IMF negotiator's warnings;
Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The top International Monetary Fund
negotiator in talks with Ukraine warned Tuesday that the country's
1999 budget draft was too optimistic and urged the parliament to
adopt reforms necessary for the continuation of aid.
	   In particular, lawmakers should approve changes to ease the tax
pressure on Ukrainian producers and pass new legislation on taxing
private individuals, John Odling-Smee told the chief of
parliament's financial committee, Valeriy Alioshyn.
	   Odling-Smee said the government's 1999 budget draft was overly
optimistic in projecting revenues of about dlrs 6.6 billion and
needed to be revised, including the expenditures part, the
independent UNIAN news agency reported.
	   The IMF mission is in Kiev to tackle Ukraine's growing economic
problems, including a backlog in wage and pension payments, poor
tax collection and printing more money. The delegation's arrival
followed last week's release of dlrs 78 million in credits for
Ukraine, the second tranche of a dlrs 2.2 billion loan approved
last September.
	   Since the IMF approved that loan, the former Soviet republic's
economic situation has become more complex, Odling-Smee noted.
	   The credibility of Ukraine's financial market has been
undermined by the economic crisis in Russia, and the country's
economic development is expected to slow down, with a possible
decline in gross domestic product, he said.
	   Presidential economic adviser Valery Lytvytsky said the
government has kept to promised budget deficit levels and foreign
currency reserves, which are among the major economic indicators
watched by the IMF, the independent Ukrainian News Service
reported.
	   However, the government plans to ask the IMF to revise its
requirements regarding tax collection and the social welfare
payments, whose fulfillment remains in doubt, Lytvytsky said.
	   The Ukrainian government has chronically failed to collect
taxes, while wage and pension debts have reached some 6.5 billion
hryvna (dlrs 1.91 billion).
	   The talks' agenda also includes the touchy question of
restrictions on foreign currency purchases, introduced by the
government in September to combat the effects of Russia's economic
turmoil and support the hryvna currency.
	   The hryvna has slipped from its pre-crisis level of about 2.2 to
the U.S. dollar to nearly 3.43 last month, but has stabilized in
recent days at around 3.42. However, IMF experts are concerned that
the government's measures may contradict the IMF's charter,
Ukrainian News said.
	   Ukraine also plans to ask the IMF to allow a limited money
emission under a plan in which the central bank would print money
to buy state treasury bills.
	   ``We are talking about the sum of 300 million to 500 million
hryvna (dlrs 88 million to dlrs 147 million),'' Lytvytsky said.
	   The IMF has limited such operations as part of its loan deal
with Ukraine.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma has spoken in recent days in
favor of some limited money emission, arguing that it might not
lead to higher inflation.
	   If the IMF allows Ukraine to print more money, it would be used
to pay wage and pension debts and social subsidies, said Lytvytsky.

More than 1,800 new HIV cases in Russia in six months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 1,800 new cases of HIV have been
reported in Russia in the past six months, and 90 percent of those
who contracted the virus were intravenous drug users, the Health
Minister said Tuesday.
	   The new cases bring the total number of people with HIV in
Russia to 8,867, including 385 children, Vladimir Starodubov told a
conference in St. Petersburg, the Interfax news agency reported. An
additional 320 Russians have full-blown AIDS, he said.
	   Russian officials warn that the actual number of HIV cases may
be up to 10 times higher. HIV and AIDS came to Russia late, and
Russia still lacks comprehensive diagnostic and treatment programs.
	   About 4,300 new HIV cases were registered in Russia last year _
a three-fold increase from the year before.
	   Officials say more than 90 percent of people testing positive
for HIV are intravenous drug users who have caught the virus
through infected syringes.

Ronaldo back in wintry Moscow for Inter-Spartak game
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rain, snow, freezing temperatures _ the perfection
conditions for Ronaldo.
	   Last April, on a snow-covered pitch in Moscow, the Brazilian
striker conjured up some of his magic to score two goals as Inter
Milan defeated Spartak Moscow in the UEFA Cup semifinals.
	   The two clubs meet again Wednesday in Moscow, this time in the
group stage of the Champions League.
	   The weather conditions will be similar, with wet snow and a low
temperature of 0 degrees celsius (32 f) forecast.
	   ``The weather and field conditions will be difficult for both
teams,'' Spartak coach Oleg Romantsev said. ``However, we are
training in these conditions all year and we are more used to
them.''
	   Inter is reeling after three straight defeats in Serie A,
including Sunday's humiliating 3-2 loss to Bari.
	   Owner Massimo Moratti says coach Gigi Simoni's future will
depend on the outcome of the game in Moscow and this weekend's
league match against AC Milan.
	   Inter should be boosted by the presence of Ronaldo, who has
played only two full matches this season because of tendinitis in
both knees.
	   Two weeks ago, a rusty Ronaldo scored the winning goal in
Inter's 2-1 home victory against Spartak. He's expected to team up
front Wednesday with Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano.
	   Inter will be without several injured stars _ forward Roberto
Baggio, French midfielder Youri Djorkaeff, Uruguaya's Alvaro Recoba
and Brazil's Ze Elias.
	   Wednesday's game will be crucial in the Group C standings. Inter
and Spartak are tied with defending champion Real Madrid with six
points, and the Spanish side is expected to pick up another easy
victory against Sturm Graz.
	   As in Moscow, winter-like conditions are forecast for the Group
E match in Ukraine between Dynamo Kiev and English champion
Arsenal.
	   Dynamo outplayed the Gunners two weeks ago at Wembley in a 1-1
draw, and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes the Ukrainian side
is the favorite to win the group.
	   Dynamo's star striker Andriy Shevchenko, who was injured in a
domestic league match last week, has recovered and will be in the
lineup against Arsenal.
	   Arsenal made the trip to Ukraine without three key players _
Dennis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars and Tony Adams.
	   Bergkamp, who scored Arsenal's goal against Dynamo last month,
has a flear of flying and had considered traveling to Kiev by
train. But those plans were dropped when he failed to recover from
a back injury.
	   With Bergkamp and Overmars out, Wenger is likely to field
untested Liberian Chris Wreh up front with French striker Nicolas
Anelka. Steve Bould, 36, steps in for Adams in defense.
	   Arsenal is bolstered by the return of French stars Patrick
Vieira and Emmanuel Petit, who missed the first game through
suspension and injury, respectively.
	   A look at other games in each group:
 &UR; GROUP A &QC; 
	   Ajax Amsterdam, the 1995 champion, is in danger of elimination
after its 1-0 defeat to Greek side Olympiakos two weeks ago. The
Dutch side must win at home to stay alive.
	   Ajax captain Danny Blind is injured and his replacement, Polish
international Andrzej Rudy, has a hamstring problem which could
keep him out.
	   Ajax's Nigerian international winger Tijjani Babangida will miss
the match through injury as will defender Mario Melchiot.
	   Olympiakos, which leads the group with seven points, has no
major injury problems.
	   FC Porto travels to Croatia Zagreb after winning 3-0 at home
last month.
 &UR; GROUP B &QC; 
	   Juventus, at home to Athletic Bilbao, moved to the top of Serie
A with a 2-0 victory against Sampdoria on Sunday.
	   But La Juve has been unimpressive so far in the Champions
League, with three consecutive draws against Rosenborg, Galatasaray
and Bilbao.
	   Striker Filippo Inzaghi will lead Juve's attack alongside
Alessandro del Piero, while the midfield will benefit from the
return following suspension of French World Cup star Zinedine
Zidane and Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids.
	   The only big name missing for Juve is French midfielder Didier
Deschamps, who strained his right ankle Sunday.
	   Spanish international defender Rafael Alkorta has a muscle
injury and is out of the Spanish club's lineup.
	   Rosenborg, which leads the group with five points, is at home
against Galatasaray, which has four. Juve has three and Bilbao two.
 &UR; GROUP C &QC; 
	   While Spartak plays Inter, Real Madrid can pile more misery on
Sturm Graz, the only club in the competition with zero points.
	   Real beat the Austrian side 6-1 two weeks ago and is back at the
top of the Spanish league. It has star forward Pedrag Mijatovic and
veteran defender Manuel Sanchis back in the lineup.
	   ``A draw would be like a defeat against Sturm Graz,'' Real's
Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos said.
 &UR; GROUP D &QC; 
	   Manchester United, which thrashed Broendby 6-2 in Copenhagen
last month, should have another easy time at Old Trafford.
	   United's Ryan Giggs is sidelined with a broken foot and is
replaced by Jesper Blomqvist
	   Bayern Munich, which recorded a 1-0 home win last month against
Barcelona, travels to Spain with a virtual full-strength squad.
	   Only Jens Jeremies, suspended for the match, is out.
	   Barcelona has appealed to fans to fill the Camp Nou, giving the
team that has been badly affected by injuries and absences maximum
support in a key game.
	   With Miguel Angel Nadal and Michael Reiziger both injured, the
Barcelona defense looks shaky. The midfield has been hit by the
injury of Luis Enrique Martinez.
 &UR; GROUP E &QC; 
	   While Kiev vs. Arsenal is the highlight, Panathinaikos is at
home against Lens. The French side won 1-0 at home and is tied with
Arsenal with five points, while the Greeks have three and Dynamo
has two.
 &UR; GROUP F &QC; 
	   Kaiserslautern, which leads with seven points, hosts PSV
Eindhoven, while Benfica is at home vs. Helsinki.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from Albanian guerrillas

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Signaling an easing of Kosovo's
refugee crisis, international relief organizations said Tuesday
that thousands of displaced had found shelter ahead of winter.
	   A U.S. senior official in the region for the second time in two
months reinforced this idea, saying that a humanitarian disaster in
Kosovo has been averted, although the situation remains delicate.
	   ``The crisis is still there and very fragile, but the
catastrophe that we all expected, hopefully will not happen,'' U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft told reporters at the end
of her four-day tour of the Kosovo region.
	   Taft visited the region in August, at the height of the conflict
in Kosovo when hundreds of thousands of people were displaced by
the fighting. At that time, she predicted Kosovo would be engulfed
in a humanitarian catastrophe if universal attention was not
focused on an immediate cessation of the hostilities.
	   International humanitarian agencies estimated last weekend that
some 200,000 people were still displaced within Kosovo, but as few
as 5,000 of them remained camped in the open. Others were staying
with neighbors or relatives.
	   Jacques Franquin, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Geneva, also said the number of people camped out in
the open has dropped considerably, since Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic scaled down troops and police in the province
last week.
	   But the reduction was not enough for the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which has spearheaded the fight to wrest the Albanian-majority
province away from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   Speaking for the ethnic Albanian guerrillas, Adem Demaci told
reporters that both the figure of 15,000 Yugoslav army soldiers and
10,000 Serb policemen to be allowed to stay on is unacceptable.
	   Bowing to international pressure to halt his crackdown on the
secessionist province, Milosevic agreed last month to reduce the
presence of his forces to the level before the fighting.
	   But Demaci said no more than 6,000 soldiers and 2,500 police
should be allowed to stay.
	   ``Displaced people are afraid to return home and are losing
valuable time for repairing their damaged houses ahead of the
coming winter,'' he said.
	   Also Tuesday U.S. envoy, Christopher Hill met with ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in the provincial capital Pristina
for discussions on a draft agreement with the Serbs on Kosovo's
future.
	   Afterward, Rugova joined Hill in touring a war-devastated area
southwest of Pristina _ a first-time move reflecting the relative
freedom of movement in areas that for months were unsafe because of
Serb-Albanian violence.
	   In the village of Banja, on the road running southwest of
Pristina to Malisevo, some Albanians kissed Rugova. Later, in
Orahovac, a mixed town, a Serb complained to Rugova that his father
was missing because of the turmoil. Replying in Serb, Rugova said:
``We're together in this.''
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has led international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 others have been forced from
their homes since Serb authorities launched a crackdown on Albanian
militants in February.
	   As part of an Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to order
troops back to their barracks and dismantle police barricades,
allowing for people to return safely.
	   On Tuesday, however, a regional command of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army claimed that Serb forces have not been withdrawing
as planned from their checkpoints in the west of the province.
	   In a statement faxed to the ethnic Albanian media Tuesday, a KLA
regional command, claimed Serb forces have regrouped and relocated
to positions farther off the main roads. It also said the Serbs
were shooting at Albanians trying to return to their villages. It
warned of retaliation ``if provocations, attacks and murder of
civilians continue.
	   The KLA statement also claimed Serb police buried nine ethnic
Albanians in the border town of Junik Monday. The Albanians were
reportedly killed recently in clashes at the border.
	   None of the reports could be independently confirmed and there
was no immediate response from the Serb side.
	   Serbian sources in the province reported Tuesday that the KLA
attacked overnight an ethnic Albanian family for ``its known
loyalty to Serbia,'' leaving one person in a coma.
	   There was no immediate comment from the Albanians.

 &UR; Gucci ex-wife gets 29 years in husband's murder &QL;

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of slain fashion heir Maurizio
Gucci was convicted of his murder Tuesday and sentenced to 29 years
in prison. Four codefendants were also convicted, with the
triggerman getting a life sentence.
	   The verdict came only a few hours after Patrizia Reggiani
Martinelli make a final plea for mercy before a crowded courtroom,
saying she was naive and involved in his murder against her will.
	   The prosecution had asked for the maximum _ a life sentence. But
the panel of two judges and five citizens instead gave the woman
dubbed the ``Black Widow'' by the Italian press 29 years in prison.
	   Reggiani Martinelli, accused of murdering her ex-husband to gain
control of his fortune, said after the verdict that her innocence
would eventually be believed. ``Truth is the child of time,'' she
said, according to her lawyer.
	   Also convicted were her longtime psychic adviser, Giuseppina
Auriemma, the doorman of a seedy hotel, a debt-ridden pizzeria
owner accused of pulling the trigger, and an unemployed auto worker
accused of driving the getaway car.
	   Auriemma was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the doorman got
26, the driver got 29 years and the triggerman was sentenced to
life. All but Gucci's ex-wife and the pizzeria owner confessed.
	   Gucci, 46, was shot to death March 27, 1995, outside his Milan
office. He was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of the fashion
company known for its leather goods and double ``G'' logo.
	   Maurizio Gucci was the last Gucci to hold a stake in the
company, but he sold out for dlrs 120 million in 1993 after a long
history of family discord.
	   With its sordid courtroom revelations about greed, betrayal and
shameless social climbing, the five-month trial has aired a seamy
side of Milan, the chic capital of Italy's fashion industry.
	   Prosecution witnesses testified that Reggiani Martinelli wasn't
satisfied with her dlrs 860,000 a year in alimony and wanted all of
her ex-husband's money.
	   Pale and drawn, Reggiani Martinelli pointed her finger Tuesday
at Auriemma, whom she says arranged the murder, then blackmailed
her for dlrs 375,000.
	   ``I have been naive to the point of stupidity,'' she told a
packed courtroom that included her son and mother. ``I found myself
involved against my will. I deny categorically that I was an
accomplice.''
	   The once-glamorous Reggiani Martinelli said Auriemma, a
Neapolitan of humble origins, used her to satisfy an obsessive
hunger for money and power.
	   ``Never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken coop. Sooner
or later it will get hungry,'' she said.
	   Reggiani Martinelli, 50, has admitted threatening Gucci and
repeatedly seeking someone to kill him, but says she never went
through with the plan.
	   Auriemma has admitted arranging Gucci's murder but testified
that she did it at Reggiani Martinelli's behest. She made no final
statement Tuesday.
	   The driver of the getaway car, Orazio Cicala, and hotel doorman
Ivano Savioni, who acted as a go-between, both made public pleas
for forgiveness. Alleged triggerman Benedetto Ceraulo again
maintained his innocence.
	   ``I've reflected a lot over these long months,'' Savioni told
the court. ``I know that I face many long years in prison for what
I've done. I ask the pardon of Gucci's children and am horrified
that things went so much farther than I intended.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The number of ethnic Albanian
refugees living in the open in Kosovo province has dropped
significantly, U.N. officials said Tuesday _ a good sign as the
shuttle diplomacy that aims to end the conflict moves into a second
round.
	   A week after NATO's decision not to strike Yugoslavia, U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill met with ethnic Albanian representatives
Tuesday to discuss a draft agreement on Kosovo's future.
	   After the meeting in the provincial capital of Pristina, Hill
and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova toured a war-devastated
area southwest of the city _ a first-time move reflecting the
relative freedom of movement in areas that for months were unsafe
because of Serb-ethnic Albanian violence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
others forced from their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants in
February. The rebels are fighting for Kosovo's independence from
Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   As part of an Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to order
troops back to their barracks and dismantle police barricades,
allowing people to return safely.
	   Signaling an easing of the refugee crisis, U.S. Assistant

 &UR; Palestinians say Israel trying to change accord on airport &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian official accused Israel of trying
to alter sections of the latest Mideast peace agreement it signed,
but Israeli denied the charges Tuesday.
	   The latest row over the opening of the Gaza International
Airport is one of several disputes which have erupted over the deal
signed Oct. 23rd in Washington.
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said that Israel,
contrary to the accord, has conditioned the opening of a Gaza
airport on a Palestinian concession over a second safe passage
route between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Erekat said Israel had linked the two issues and was
backpedaling on the second route. ``This is blackmail of the
agreement,'' Erekat told The Associated Press. ``Such a tie is
unacceptable to us.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said ``There is absolutely no connection between the
airport and any other issue.'' But he added that Israel had
security concerns regarding the route between Gaza and the northern
West Bank.
	   As part of the deal signed last month at the White House, Israel
agreed to allow the Palestinians to open their first airport in the
Gaza Strip and to provide a second safe passage route for
Palestinians traveling between their autonomous areas.
	   Israel has delayed implementation of the land-for-peace deal
saying the security document which the Palestinian submitted Monday
is incomplete. The Palestinians said their security plan is a
matter they share with the Americans and not Israel.

Whaler turned away when trying to see Keikio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Norwegian whale-hunter who says Keiko the
Hollywood whale should be ground into hamburger was turned away
Tuesday when he tried to meet his enemy at a holding pen in
Iceland.
	   Norway's most outspoken whaler, Steinar Bastesen, can't stand
Keiko or the 1993 ``Free Willy'' movie the whale starred in.
Bastesen, a member of parliament, says the hubbub about the movie
and about returning Keiko to the wild unfairly stacks public
opinion against whale hunting.
	   ``He would have been more suited as hamburger on a plate,'' the
Norwegian news agency NTB quoted Bastesen as saying on Tuesday.
	   In the box-office hit, Keiko portrayed Willy, an orca that
escaped death in amusement park owner by leaping over a breakwall
to freedom in the ocean with the help of a young boy. After the
movie, however, the real whale languished in a Mexican aquarium
until U.S. school kids collected pennies to help save him.
	   Then donors gave millions of dollars to help the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation return the 21-year-old whale to his native waters
off Iceland. Keiko is now in a holding pen off Iceland's Vestmann
Islands, preparing for a return to the wild after 19 years in
captivity.
	   Bastensen often provokes opponents of Norway's whale and seal
hunts by wearing sealskin clothing, drinking whale oil and hosting
whale meat barbecues.
	   He turned up at Keiko's pen while in Iceland for a conference,
but was turned away because the foundation did not want to be drawn
into the whaling debate, NTB said.
	   Norway has faced protests, sanction threats and sabotage against
whaling vessels since it resumed its commercial hunts for minke
whales in 1993, despite a global ban.

German flood waters recede; light rain forecast promises further

<TEXT>
	   ZELL, Germany (AP) _ Emergency workers helped residents in this
flooded town wash slime and mud from basements, streets and
sidewalks Tuesday as the swollen Mosel River began receding after
last month's record rainfall.
	   Rivers and tributaries were dropping across Germany, and
forecasts of only minor showers raised hopes for further relief
from flooding. Most of the country was hit by two or three times
the normal rainfall in October.
	   Low-lying streets were still inundated in Wertheim, a town on
the Main River, but the water level was dropping. A small flood
wave upstream was not expected to worsen conditions, a town
spokeswoman said.
	   Tributaries of the Main in the southern state of Bavaria also
were receding, as was the Mosel River in western Rhineland
Palatinate.
	   The Main River city of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital,
escaped any serious flooding, despite what the weather office
called the city's wettest October since 1857. Frankfurt saw 177.4
liters (46.9 U.S. gallons) of rain per square meter (10.8 square
feet) for the month.
	   Waters peaked early Tuesday in the Rhine River city of Cologne
at 9.41 meters (30.9 feet) and were expected to recede slightly by
nightfall. The development spared the old town center and
14th-century cathedral, which were flooded in 1995 when the river
exceeded 10 meters (32.8 feet) and overflowed barrier walls.
	   Still, travel was suspended on the Rhine at 5 a.m., as the flood
wave headed downstream toward the Dutch border; about 150 barges
were tied up at docks in Duisburg.
	   While waters were receding in Lower Saxony state, emergency
conditions remained in effect because of water-logged dikes that
threatened to burst.
	   Searches continued for several small children, though officials
had little hope of finding them alive.
	   Two 5-year-old boys missing in Lower Saxony were last seen
Saturday playing near the flooded Ilse river in the town of
Borssum. A 2-year-old boy was last seen by the Main river in
Veitschoechheim, near Frankfurt on Saturday. Another 2-year-old
slipped into the Holzbach River in North-Rhine Westphalia state on
Sunday.
	   The body of a 4-year-old boy who fell into the Sachsback River
at Kaiserslautern, in southern Bavaria, was recovered Sunday.

Truthfulness of Holocaust memoir in doubt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The author of an award-winning memoir of
surviving Nazi concentration camps claims he was a Latvian Jew born
in 1939, but his story is coming under increasing doubt, The New
York Times reported Tuesday.
	   The book by Binjamin Wilkomirski, ``Fragments: Memories of a
Wartime Childhood,'' first published in 1995, was lauded by Jewish
groups and won the National Jewish Book Award in the United States
and the Jewish Quarterly Literary Prize in Britain. It was
translated into more than a dozen languages.
	   While the publishers maintain they believe the author is a
Latvian Jew who survived the Holocaust, his identity is being
questioned, according to the Times.
	   In the book, Wilkomirski recalls seeing his father beaten to
death and being imprisoned at age 3 or 4 in a concentration camp in
Poland, eventually spending time in two camps. He says the details
of his early years were revealed through therapy.
	   But Swiss legal records identify Wilkomirski as the son of an
unwed Swiss Protestant woman and say he was adopted by a
middle-class Zurich couple. They indicate he was born in 1941, two
years later than is stated in the original German edition of the
book, ``Fragments: A Childhood 1939 to 1948.''
	   The book itself noted some of the contradictions in the record,
with Wilkomirski telling readers in an ``afterword'' that the birth
date of 1941 in the Swiss records ``has nothing to do with either
the history of this century or my personal history.''
	   Wilkomirski claimed that a third person, who is now dead, had
altered and switched legal records.
	   More questions were raised by Swiss author Daniel Ganzfried, who
was commissioned to write a profile of Wilkomirski. He found that
records show Wilkomirski attending first grade in Zurich in 1947
even though Wilkomirski says he didn't arrive in Switzerland until
the following year. He also says he found a 1946 photo of
Wilkomirski in the garden of his adoptive parents.
	   Publishers of the book still support the account given by the
author, who has become a recluse, the newspaper said. Asked for
comment, the author wrote in an e-mail, ``My health is in rather
poor condition. I am very weak and it takes me a lot of strength to
answer questions, which cannot be answered in only a few
sentences.''
	   Some historians have said the book should have been published as
fiction because of doubts about the author's background.
	   Deborah Dwork, director of the Center for Holocaust Studies at
Clark University, said she has doubts about the book because
children age 3 or 4 only rarely survived the camps.
	   She said she had met Wilkomirski and thinks he truly believes
the story he tells. But she said that until he can show that the
Swiss documents are inaccurate, ``I do not accept `Fragments' as
historically accurate.''

 &UR; Whaler turned away when trying to see Keiko &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Norwegian whale-hunter who says Keiko the
Hollywood whale should be ground into hamburger was turned away
Tuesday when he tried to meet his enemy at a holding pen in
Iceland.
	   Norway's most outspoken whaler, Steinar Bastesen, can't stand
Keiko or the 1993 ``Free Willy'' movie the whale starred in.
Bastesen, a member of parliament, says the hubbub about the movie
and about returning Keiko to the wild unfairly stacks public
opinion against whale hunting.
	   ``He would have been more suited as hamburger on a plate,'' the
Norwegian news agency NTB quoted Bastesen as saying on Tuesday.
	   In the box-office hit, Keiko portrayed Willy, an orca that
escaped death in amusement park owner by leaping over a breakwall
to freedom in the ocean with the help of a young boy. After the
movie, however, the real whale languished in a Mexican aquarium
until U.S. school kids collected pennies to help save him.
	   Then donors gave millions of dollars to help the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation return the 21-year-old whale to his native waters
off Iceland. Keiko is now in a holding pen off Iceland's Vestmann
Islands, preparing for a return to the wild after 19 years in
captivity.
	   Bastensen often provokes opponents of Norway's whale and seal
hunts by wearing sealskin clothing, drinking whale oil and hosting
whale meat barbecues.
	   He turned up at Keiko's pen while in Iceland for a conference,
but was turned away because the foundation did not want to be drawn
into the whaling debate, NTB said.
	   Norway has faced protests, sanction threats and sabotage against
whaling vessels since it resumed its commercial hunts for minke
whales in 1993, despite a global ban.

U.S. Congo peace envoys wind up meeting with Zimbabwe President
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with end of Mugabe meeting, Rice quotes,
departure for Rwanda; trims; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Senior U.S. diplomats received a frosty
welcome here in efforts to end a war that has embroiled troops from
as many as eight countries and threatens to escalate.
	   After a two-hour meeting with President Robert Mugabe, the top
U.S. Africa official, Susan Rice, said it was too early to tell
whether her visit had advanced the prospects of peace.
	   ``I think that will have to be determined in the future,'' Rice
told reporters before leaving for the Rwandan capital, Kigali.
	   Mugabe kept Rice, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, waiting for several hours before receiving her.
Mugabe has deployed 6,000 troops to Congo to support its president,
Laurent Kabila, against rebels. Angola and Namibia have also sent
troops to aid Kabila.
	   Rice's seven-nation African trip has taken her to Angola, Congo,
South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. She said she wanted to ``listen
to the perspectives of all sides.''
	   The United States voiced its concern over the escalation of the
conflict and ``steps must be taken to prevent another genocide in
the region,'' Rice said, referring to the slaughter by Hutus of
500,000 people in Rwanda, neighboring Congo, in 1994. The victims
were mainly Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   Those killings ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in Rwanda
in July 1994. Hutu rebels used eastern Congo to regroup and launch
cross-border attacks into Rwanda.
	   Rwanda, which backs the rebels with troops and arms, accuses
Kabila of hating Tutsis and failing to rid the border of the former
Hutu soldiers and militias responsible for the 1994 genocide.
	   ``We have not come with any grand American prescription,'' Rice
said. ``There is still a great deal of work to be done.''
	   Kabila and Mugabe have sharply criticized U.S. efforts to broker
a Congo peace agreement, arguing that Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
deployed troops to repel an invasion by rebels backed by Rwandan
and Ugandan troops.
	   Mugabe has described U.S. calls for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from Congo as ``absolutely abominable'' and demanded Rwanda
and Uganda withdraw first, saying that would lead to the collapse
of the rebel campaign and bring peace.
	   Rice said she was informed of reports Angola planned to withdraw
some troops from the allied force backing Kabila, ``but I have no
information on that.''
	   During her three-day visit to Angola last week, Rice failed to
see Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. He was due to meet
her just before she left, but then he called a Cabinet meeting for
the same time.
	   Uganda acknowledges it has troops in Congo, but says they are
there to strike at Congo-based Ugandan rebels.
	   Rice, accompanied by President Clinton's special assistant,
Gayle Smith, and his special envoy to the Great Lakes region,
Howard Wolpe, was scheduled to hold talks in Rwanda with President
Pasteur Bizimungu and Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, who is the vice
president, minister of defense and the chief architect of Rwanda's
policy in Congo.
	   The delegation then travels to Uganda.

Lithuanian president to visit Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus will
visit Kiev this week for two days of talks with senior Ukrainian
officials, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.
	   During his meetings Thursday and Friday with President Leonid
Kuchma, premier Valery Pustovoitenko and parliament speaker
Oleksandr Tkachenko, Adamkus is to discuss strengthening economic
ties, which might help increase mutual investments and establish
new joint ventures.
	   The sides also plan to talk about Ukraine's closer cooperation
with other Baltic states, including construction of new transport
routes from the Baltic region to the Black Sea, the ministry said.
	   Adamkus and Ukrainian leaders also are to look at Lithuania's
relations with the European Union to discuss what impact its
expansion could have on adjacent non-EU states.
	   On Friday, Adamkus will visit the western Ukrainian city of
Lviv.

Another victim, the 63rd, discovered in gutted Swedish dance hall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Investigators minutely examining the
charred ruins of a Swedish dance hall gutted by fire discovered
another body Tuesday, raising the death toll to 63.
	   The body was of a 15-year-old girl who had been missing since
the fire broke out shortly before midnight Thursday at the upstairs
hall in Goteborg, 300 miles (500 kilometers) southwest of
Stockholm.
	   The body ``was very hard to detect _ nothing that you could see
with bare eyes when you come into the place,'' Ronald Bagge of the
Goteborg police said, according to the Swedish news agency TT.
	   ``It was something we discovered after going through the
premises square-centimeter by square-centimeter (square-inch by
square-inch),'' he said.
	   Despite the painstaking investigation, police have yet to offer
any information about the cause of the fire. The fire's rapid
spread has led to speculation that it was set.
	   The fire blocked one of the second-floor hall's two exit
stairways. The stairway reportedly was crowded with chairs and
other pieces of wood furniture.
	   Most of those who died and the 160 who were injured were
immigrants or the children of immigrants, largely Muslims. Despite
Islam's tradition of burying the dead quickly, Swedish
investigators kept the bodies for several days in order to examine
them for clues to the fire.
	   The first bodies were released to their families on Tuesday.

Prince of Wales gets early birthday gift on East Europe tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Prince Charles got a honey of an
early birthday gift Tuesday _ a hive full of bees _ as he ended a
two-day visit to Slovenia and proceeded on his tour through Eastern
Europe.
	   The bad news: The bees themselves will have to be left behind, a
victim of British custom laws which prohibit their import.
	   The prince flew on to Romania after his stop in this former
Yugoslav republic, and later this week will visit Bulgaria and
Macedonia.
	   Recognizing his interest in beekeeping, Slovene President Milan
Kucan presented Charles with the hive as a gift marking his
upcoming 50th birthday on Nov. 14. But only the hive will be
allowed back into Britain.
	   The son of Queen Elizabeth II was welcomed at the city council
of Ljubljana, where he met with Mayor Viktorija Potocnik.
	   Hundreds of onlookers waved and applauded the heir to the
British throne as he dropped in on shoppers at a mall and a street
market and chatted to a vendor behind a spice stall.
	   He also visited an elementary school to talk to some pupils.
	   In the excitement, a photographer stumbled to the ground as he
maneuvered for a picture. He was helped up by the prince to the
cheers of the crowd.
	   The prince, who is an ardent admirer of architecture, also took
a look at the city's cathedral and joined Kucan in opening
``British week in Ljubljana'' in a local shopping village.
	   He flew on Tuesday evening to Bucharest, where he was greeted by
Culture Minister Ion Caramitru and headed for dinner with President
Emil Constantinescu at the Cotroceni presidential palace _ home to
his ancestor Queen Marie who was Queen Victoria's granddaughter.
	   During the three-day stop in Romania, he also will visit the
Transylvanian city of Sibiu.
	   It is the first visit by a senior member of the British royal
family to Romania and the highest-level visit by a British official
to this former communist country.

Thousands of illegal immigrants detained on Russian-Ukrainian

border &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Border guards along Ukraine's southeastern
border with Russia detained 5,034 violators in the first nine
months of 1998, including 2,472 illegal immigrants, a senior
officer said Tuesday.
	   The immigrants, mostly from the Middle East, Asia and Africa,
were trying to cross into Ukraine on their way to central and
western Europe, Arkadiy Yavorsky, the border guards' regional chief
of staff, was quoted by the independent UNIAN news agency as
saying.
	   Ukrainian authorities say as many as 11,000 border violators _
including 5,000 illegal immigrants _ were detained in Ukraine in
the first half of 1998, twice as many as in the same period last
year.
	   The number of illegal immigrants from poor Middle East, Asian
and African nations trying to cross into Europe through the former
Soviet Union, especially Ukraine and Russia, has drastically
increased in recent years.
	   Ukraine recently adopted measures aimed at strengthening the
border regime and introducing frontier zones along the country's
international borders, where foreigners are restricted in their
stay.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Canadian model Linda Evangelista was
described in press reports Tuesday as overweight and unsteady on
her feet in an appearance at a Portuguese fashion show.
	   Evangelista, 33, was the headline attraction at the Portugal
Fashion event in the northern city Oporto on Sunday night.
	   Daily paper Publico described her as ``beautiful but clumsy.''
	   Another daily, Jornal de Noticias, said she was ``a great
disappointment'' and described her as ``visibly pregnant'' _ a
comment based on photographs apparently revealing a plump
waistline. There was no confirmation that Evangelista might be
pregnant.
	   In general the papers said she appeared lethargic, tripped on
the hem of a long white dress, and that one of the dresses she wore
had to be altered to make it bigger.
	   She reportedly left the show before the finale, in which she was
due to appear.
	   A spokeswoman for the Lisbon branch of her modeling agency said
Evangelista was unwell with food poisoning.
	   ``She was sick before she arrived. She was wrong to have come,''
said the spokeswoman for Look Elite who declined to identify
herself by name.
	   Manuel Serrao, spokesman for Portugal's National Association of
Young Businessmen which organized the show, said Evangelista ``did
not carry out precisely the work she was contracted to do.''
	   Her agent acknowledged the shortcomings and her appearance fee
was renegotiated, Serrao said by phone. He declined to give
details.

Steffi Graf wins with strong performance in latest comeback

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf, making her latest comeback
from injury, turned in a strong performance Tuesday in beating
Romania's Ruxandra Dragomir in straight sets at the Leipzig Open.
	   Graf, who was sidelined nearly two months after being operated
for a bone spur on her right hand, ousted Dragomir, 6-3, 6-3, at
the dlrs 450,000 event in just 70 minutes.
	   Afterwards, the former world No. 1 pronounced herself healthy
and pleased with her performance, despite numerous unforced errors.
	   ``All I have is a blister,'' said Graf. ``I played pretty good,
even if I can play some points better with a little more match
practice and concentration.''
	   The German, who held the top ranking a record 374 weeks and
dominated the women's game for a decade, hadn't played singles in
57 days, since losing to Patty Schnyder of Switzerland at the U.S.
Open.
	   The comeback is the latest for Graf after an operation on her
left knee in June, 1997 threatened a career end and sidelined her
for eight months.
	   Stepping onto the court as an unseeded player for the first time
in nearly 13 years, Graf blasted the world No. 34 behind a powerful
serve and by slamming the flat forehand that was tennis' best
weapon for years.
	   Graf, 29, rolled to breaks to start both sets in the easy
victory played out in front of over 1,000 cheering spectators at a
tournament she helped found in 1990.
	   She next faces sixth-seeded Ai Sugiyama of Japan, who ousted
Germany's Sandra Kloesel, 6-4, 6-3. Belarus' Natasha Zvereva, the
seventh-seed, also advanced with a 7-5, 6-3 win against Henrieta
Nagyova of Slovakia, 7-5, 6-3.
	   ``I'm not expecting to march into the final here,'' said Graf.
``I have a tough draw and I just want some match practice.''
	   Graf also played and lost a doubles match Monday.
	   The struggle of Graf, now ranked 22nd, to regain her spot among
the world's top players has been set back by injuries several
times.
	   After coming back from the knee operation on February 17,
playing in Hanover, the German then was knocked out of action by a
hamstring injury.
	   Just before the U.S. Open and her latest injury, Graf appeared
poised to prove she could reclaim her old role in tennis by winning
her first title since her return.
	   En route to her 103rd career title, she beat then-world. No. 2
Jana Novotna and No. 3 Lindsay Davenport.

British army lets soldiers convicted of murder keep their jobs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The British army announced
Tuesday that two soldiers convicted of murdering a Catholic
teen-ager can keep their jobs.
	   The decision outraged Catholic leaders and contradicted earlier
recommendations by Mo Mowlam, Britain's governor for Northern
Ireland, who declined comment Tuesday.
	   James Fisher and Mark Wright, members of the Scots Guards
regiment, fatally shot Peter McBride, an unarmed 18-year-old who
ran away from their Belfast patrol, in 1992.
	   Citing ``exceptional reasons,'' a Ministry of Defense statement
said a five-member panel had concluded the soldiers could remain in
the army. The soldiers had shown ``contrition for their action,
which they admitted was an error of judgment which they very much
regret,'' the statement said.
	   The panel was made up of three generals, a senior civil servant
and the government's armed forces minister, Doug Henderson.
	   At their trial, the soldiers testified that McBride looked like
he was going to throw an object at them that they feared was an
Irish Republican Army grenade. They were convicted of shooting
McBride in the back without justification and given life sentences.
	   The pair won early parole in September days before the
government began freeing convicted members of the IRA and outlawed
pro-British groups under terms of April's peace accord for Northern
Ireland.
	   McBride was the last person killed by British soldiers in
Northern Ireland.
	   Two other soldiers convicted of murdering Catholic civilians in
1984 and 1990 also were allowed to stay in the army after serving
shortened sentences.

Israel delays peace deal, links it to arrest of Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new crisis of confidence, Israel said
Tuesday it will not carry out the land-for-security agreement with
the Palestinians until it gets assurances that 30 Palestinian
fugitives will be arrested by the Palestinian Authority.
	   The Palestinians said the United States was satisfied with their
antiterror plan and accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
seizing a pretext to avoid handing over West Bank land.
	   The latest dispute raised questions about whether the two sides
could stick to the 12-week program, which was to have taken effect
Monday but was delayed at the request of Netanyahu.
	   Under the timetable agreed to at the Wye summit, the first
installment of an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank is due on Nov. 16.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive Thursday in the
Middle East to oversee implementation, and Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat it was up to the Americans to break the latest impasse.
	   ``Netanyahu wants to break the time line,'' Erekat told The
Associated Press. ``They (the Americans) must interfere.''
	   The new recriminations made it clear that any good will
generated by the new peace accord has already evaporated. With
suspicions running high, the United States will likely have to step
in as referee repeatedly in the coming weeks.
	   In other developments Tuesday, a senior aide to Yasser Arafat
said Palestinian security agents have foiled Iranian-backed
attempts by the Islamic militant group Hamas to assassinate the
Palestinian leader.
	   Iran is training and funding a secret Hamas group to carry out
the assassination as well as suicide bombings, said Tayyeb Abdel
Rahim, the secretary general of the Palestinian Authority.
	   Hamas denied in a leaflet that it was receiving money from Iran.
	   Palestinian security forces have rounded up more than 100
suspected Islamic militants since last week's suicide attack by the
group on an Israeli convoy. Hamas leaders on Tuesday put the number
of detainees at more than 300.
	   The latest crisis in the peace process began Tuesday morning,
three hours before the Israeli Cabinet was to start a two-day
debate on the peace agreement, with ratification expected
Wednesday.
	   Netanyahu announced that he would not convene the ministers
because the Palestinians have not submitted a complete blueprint
for fighting terrorism to the Americans, as promised.
	   ``I won't show the ministers an incomplete agreement,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu would not say which information was missing, but
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai later said Israel was holding
out for a list of 30 wanted Palestinians the Palestinian Authority
has promised to arrest as part of the peace agreement. Israel also
wants a timetable for the arrests, Mordechai said.
	   Israel has said it cannot begin implementing the agreement until
it has been approved by the Cabinet and by parliament, which is to
vote on the accord Nov. 12.
	   The Palestinians reacted angrily to the latest delay.
	   ``Instead of playing these sorry political games, he (Netanyahu)
should just stand up and say ... I won't implement what I have
signed,'' said Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour.
	   The United States appeared to be siding with the Palestinians in
the dispute. James Rubin, the U.S. State Department spokesman, said
Monday that ``the necessary plans were provided on time, prior to
entry into force (of the agreement).''
	   Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian security chief in the Gaza
Strip, said he discussed the antiterror plan with Israeli security
officials who also considered it sufficient.
	   Cabinet approval is not assured. At least six of 18 ministers
are undecided and three are opposed to the plan.
	   Erekat, meanwhile, said Israel was making new demands in
connection with the opening of a Palestinian airport in the Gaza
Strip, an issue that was already settled in the peace accord.
	   Netanyahu's adviser, David Bar-Illan, denied Erekat's claim,
saying Israel had not linked the airport opening to other issues.

Norwegian whaler turned away when trying to see Keiko
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Norwegian whale-hunter who says Keiko the
Hollywood whale should be ground into hamburger was turned away
Tuesday when he tried to meet his enemy at a holding pen in
Iceland.
	   Norway's most outspoken whaler, Steinar Bastesen, can't stand
Keiko or the 1993 ``Free Willy'' movie the whale starred in.
Bastesen, a member of parliament, says the hubbub about the movie
and about returning Keiko to the wild unfairly stacks public
opinion against whale hunting.
	   ``He would have been more suited as hamburger on a plate,'' the
Norwegian news agency NTB quoted Bastesen as saying on Tuesday.
	   In the box-office hit, Keiko portrayed Willy, an orca that
escaped death in amusement park owner by leaping over a breakwall
to freedom in the ocean with the help of a young boy. After the
movie, however, the real whale languished in a Mexican aquarium
until U.S. school kids collected pennies to help save him.
	   Then donors gave millions of dollars to help the Free Willy
Keiko Foundation return the 21-year-old whale to his native waters
off Iceland. Keiko is now in a holding pen off Iceland's Vestmann
Islands, preparing for a return to the wild after 19 years in
captivity.
	   Bastensen often provokes opponents of Norway's whale and seal
hunts by wearing sealskin clothing, drinking whale oil and hosting
whale meat barbecues.
	   He turned up at Keiko's pen while in Iceland for a conference,
but was turned away because the foundation did not want to be drawn
into the whaling debate, NTB said.
	   Norway has faced protests, sanction threats and sabotage against
whaling vessels since it resumed its commercial hunts for minke
whales in 1993, despite a global ban.

Judges claim politicians meddle in judicial system
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with president's office and general prosecutor denying
charges

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A top magistrate has openly accused
the president's office of meddling in politically sensitive cases.
	   The general secretary of the Magistrates Association, Viorica
Costiniu, said Monday the presidential office had obtained access
to confidential files through the justice ministry. She did not
specify which cases.
	   President Emil Constantinescu's press office in a statement
Tuesday denied any interference by the president or the institution
in judicial matters
	   Since communism was overthrown in 1989, there have been repeated
allegations that political leaders intervene in certain sensitive
cases. Officials elected two years ago vowed to allow the judicial
system to function independently, but corruption continues.
	   Last week, during a visit to Norway, Constantinescu said that
Romania's magistrates were ``communists,'' prompting the
magistrates to respond.
	   Speaking on private Antena 1 TV late Monday, Costiniu also said
chiefs of police or prosecutors often telephone judges before some
trials open, suggesting solutions to the case.
	   Romania's General Prosecutor Mircea Cristea rejected the charges
in a news conference saying ``Since I became general prosecutor no
file has been requested or has gone to the president's office.''
	   The Bucharest daily Ziua Tuesday said it was impossible for
honest magistrates to survive in the system, forcing many to
abandon the profession ``at an alarming rate'' to become lawyers
and public notaries.
	   A judge in Romania's Supreme Court of Justice, Maria Coca-Cozma,
who heads the magistrate's association told reporters at a news
conference Monday that judges ``who oppose interference are
intimidated and threatened'' by top prosecutors.
	   She cited two cases. One involved a huge cigarette smuggling
scandal in April in which security officers close to President Emil
Constantinescu were charged and the other was the case of Syrian
businessman who was charged with massive fraud and had close links
to former President Ion Iliescu.
	   The Magistrates Association represents some 2,450 civil and
military judges. Almost three-quarters were appointed after 1989.

Swiss group sues newspaper for printing diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Germ in 7th graf is cq. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Swiss foundation holding the
copyright to Anne Frank's famous diary went to court Tuesday
against an Amsterdam newspaper that printed parts of five newly
discovered pages.
	   The Basel-based Anne Frank Fund scolded the daily Het Parool for
what it contends was the ``unauthorized publication'' of excerpts.
Its suit in the Amsterdam District Court claims copyright
infringement.
	   The squabble began in August, when longtime Frank family friend
Cor Suijk revealed he held five previously unpublished handwritten
pages penned by the Jewish teen in hiding from the Nazis.
	   On Aug. 26, Het Parool published about 400 words of excerpts on
its front page next to a large photograph of Anne. The new diary
entries contained Anne's criticisms of her parents' strained
relationship.
	   Germ Kemper, the lawyer for the Anne Frank Fund, said the group
wants the newspaper to run a correction acknowledging copyright
infringement, and stop quoting from the new pages and sending
copies to other media.
	   The newspaper has refused, contending it had the right under
Dutch and European freedom of speech laws to print the excerpts.
	   ``All requirements for lawful quotation have been satisfied,''
said Willem van Manen, a lawyer for the newspaper, which has not
said how it obtained the passages still in Suijk's possession.
	   A verdict has been scheduled for Nov. 12.
	   The Anne Frank Fund holds all rights to ``The Diary of Anne
Frank,'' an international bestseller in dozens of languages. It has
no connection to the Amsterdam-based Anne Frank Foundation, which
runs a popular museum in the canal house where the girl and her
family hid for two years until their betrayal.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp just
weeks before it was liberated in the spring of 1945.

France issues stern warning to Baghdad, recalls representative
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Tuesday recalled its representative in
Baghdad for consultations and issued a stern warning, saying Iraq's
decision to end cooperation with weapons inspectors would lead to
its ``total isolation'' if not reversed.
	   A letter from Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine to Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz called Iraq's decision Saturday
``serious,'' and said it aggravates an already tense situation.
	   ``France does not understand this attitude which assuredly will
not aid Iraq in getting sanctions lifted,'' the letter said,
according to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
	   It asked Baghdad to reverse its position ``without delay.''
	   ``There should be no mistake about the state of mind of the
(U.N.) Security Council,'' the spokeswoman quoted the letter as
saying.
	   The United States and Britain warned Iraq Tuesday that they have
not ruled out the use of force if Baghdad does not back off its
position.
	   France, once a major trading partner of Iraq, has worked to get
punishing U.N. sanctions lifted. An embargo was clamped on Baghdad
after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
	   The French letter appeared a last attempt to coax Iraq to change
its mind, combining a warning with an appeal.
	   Iraq said Saturday it was halting all dealings with the U.N.
Special Commission charged with investigating the country's weapons
of mass destruction.
	   It said the decision was due to the failure of a U.N. review of
Iraqi compliance with U.N. resolutions to mention the lifting of
sanctions. It blamed the United States.
	   But Gazeau-Secret said the review was made at the behest of
Iraq, with France working hard so that Iraq ``could see the light
at the end of the tunnel.''
	   Its current action ``will lead to the total isolation of Iraq,''
she told reporters at a regular briefing.
	   She said France had recalled for consultations its
representative in Baghdad, Yves Aubin de la Messuzie.

Central banks in Spain, Portugal and Sweden cut key lending rates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Combines Spain-Interest Rates, Sweden-Rate Cut,
Portugal-Interest Rate. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The central banks in Spain, Portugal and Sweden cut key lending
rates Tuesday in an effort to keep their economies growing.
	   The cuts could put added pressure on Germany, France and other
European countries to trim their rates as well.
	   The Bank of Spain lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25
percentage point to 3.50 percent. Hours later, the central bank in
neighboring Portugal trimmed a quarter percentage point from its
benchmark lending rate to 3.75 percent.
	   Earlier, Sweden's central bank cut its one-week fixed securities
repurchase rate _ a key indicator of lending trends _ to 3.85
percent from 4.10 percent.
	   Many European central banks need to lower their key interest
rates before the European single currency is launched next year.
	   The Bank of Spain has cut its key benchmark rate three times
this year, reducing it from 4.75 percent.
	   Henrik Lumholdt, an analyst at Bank of America in Madrid, said
the cut came ``sooner than we expected. That suggests that you have
to look at this in a pan-European context.''
	   It was the second cut in Portugal's benchmark rate in four
weeks. The Bank of Portugal last altered its benchmark rate on Oct.
9 when it cut it by half a point to 4 percent.
	   The central bank is independent, but the Portuguese government
has made repeated calls for lower rates to keep the economy and
financial markets buoyant.
	   The drop moves Portugal closer to the 3.3 percent level it must
meet for participation in the new European single currency.
	   Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, said it lowered rates
because inflation is expected to be lower than its official target
of 2 percent in the next two years.
	   ``Economic growth in Sweden is still expected to be relatively
good in the coming years,'' a statement from the Riksbank said.
	   But it said the weakening international situation indicates that
Swedish factories may have to reduce operating rates as exports
weaken and stockpiles accumulate. Corporate borrowing is slowing
and households are less positive about the future, the bank said.

Mitch

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government said Tuesday
it will donate 1.4 million guilders (dlrs 747,600) to help fund
relief operations in Central American nations lashed by hurricane
Mitch.
	   Overseas Development Minister Eveline Herfkens said the
government will give one million guilders (dlrs 534,000) to the
International Red Cross which is working to bring relief to the
devastated region.
	   The government also will donate 100,000 guilders each (dlrs
53,400) to governments in Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and
Nicaragua, the nations worst-hit by Mitch.
	   About 7,000 people are believed to have been killed by the storm
in Central America.
	   In Honduras, an estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 people _
10 percent of the population _ were forced to flee their homes
after last week's storm.
	   The European Union on Tuesday agreed to donate dlrs 7.7 million
to relief efforts in the region.

Official: Iran funds and trains militants trying to kill Arafat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Hamas response, EDITS to TRIM &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security forces have in
recent months foiled Iranian-backed attempts by Islamic militants
to assassinate Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and senior members
of his government, a senior Arafat aide said Tuesday.
	   Iran is training and funding a secret cell within the Islamic
militant group Hamas to carry out the assassinations and suicide
bombings in Israel, Tayyeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of
the Palestinian Authority, told The Associated Press.
	   ``We arrested several of these people who had plans detailing
the assassinations,'' Abdel Rahim said.
	   The most recent arrest came in October when Palestinian
intelligence agents arrested a Hamas activist, Jamal Natche, in the
West Bank town of Hebron. Natche was given orders by Iran to kill
Arafat, Abdel Rahim said, but did not provide details.
	   In a sharply worded leaflet, Hamas denied that it was receiving
money from Iran. ``Those who are cooperating with the enemy should
remain silent,'' the leaflet said in a reference to the Palestinian
Authority's pledge as part of the new peace agreement to crack down
on Hamas and to try and prevent terror attacks against Israelis.
	   Hamas, which has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings
in Israel since 1994, said the attacks would continue. ``Hamas
renews its commitment to the Palestinian people to continue the
holy war and resistance against our occupiers,'' the leaflet said.
	   A Hamas leader, Ismail Hanieh, said that more than 300
supporters of the group have been rounded up since last Thursday's
suicide attack on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian
official have put the number of detainees at more than 100.
	   Hanieh said the dialogue between Hamas and the Palestinian
Authority has resumed. Hanieh said he met Monday with Palestinian
intelligence officials and demanded that all detainees be freed. He
said the security officials did not give an immediate response.
	   As a result of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, there have
been mounting threats against Arafat.
	   Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, has called Arafat a
traitor. The leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group in Lebanon,
Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, said Arafat's hands should be chopped off
for signing the agreement.
	   The Hamas military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, warned Arafat of
``the wrath of vengeance'' for his crackdown on Hamas, imposed
after last week's suicide attack by the group on an Israeli convoy.
	   On Monday, the 69-year-old Arafat dismissed the threats with a
wave of his hand. ``It is not the first time and it won't be the
last. I don't care,'' said Arafat, who has survived several
attempts on his life during his decades as Palestinian leader.
	   Israeli media reports said the CIA has given Arafat's security
chiefs, Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan. instructions on how to
deal with the new situation. However, Abdel Rahim said security for
Arafat has not been beefed up in response to the threats.
	   With no designated successor, Arafat's sudden death would create
chaos within Palestinian society. Such a situation would seriously
threaten an already shaky peace process.

Afghanistan cease-fire could lead to prisoner exchange
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMMED RIAZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ The two sides in Afghanistan's
protracted civil war agreed to stop fighting for another two weeks
while they prepare the list of an estimated 3,000 prisoners for
exchange, said the man who negotiated the agreement.
	   Said Jalal, a close confidant of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince
Abdullah, told reporters Tuesday in northwest Pakistan that his
shuttle diplomacy brought about the breakthrough.
	   Also on Tuesday, the Taliban-run Radio Shariat said 105
opposition prisoners will be released from prison in southern
Kandahar. It wasn't immediately clear whether they would be brought
to the Afghan capital of Kabul.
	   Jalal negotiated the one-week cease-fire that expired Monday.
Both sides in the conflict appear to have agreed to let Jalal
negotiate.
	   Jalal said that both the Taliban religious army and its
opposition agreed to lay down their weapons for another two weeks.
	   During that time two separate commissions will be established to
prepare the list of prisoners being held by either side.
	   Jalal said one commission comprising two representatives of the
Taliban army and one representative of opposition leader Ahmed Shah
Massood will visit opposition jails. The commission, led by Jalal,
will make a list of all Taliban prisoners.
	   A second commission, comprising two representatives of Massood's
opposition and one Taliban representative will tour jails in
Taliban areas _ and make a list of Massood's prisoners.
	   The lists will be completed in 10 days followed by a prisoner
exchange, said Jalal.
	   The Taliban and opposition forces have been waging a bloody
battle for power on several fronts, all of them north of
Afghanistan's beleaguered capital.
	   The Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, while the
opposition controls the remaining 10 percent.
	   Saudi Arabia is one of only three governments to recognize the
Taliban, however a dispute last month caused Riyadh to withdraw its
envoy.
	   It's not clear what caused the falling out, but news reports in
Pakistan claim Saudi Arabia demanded the Taliban hand over Muslim
militant Osama bin Laden, believed by the United States to have
masterminded the devastating bombings in August of its embassies in
East Africa.
	   Jalal, however, said Saudi Arabia did not ask for bin Laden and
it seems unlikely that Riyadh would want the dissident in jail in
Riyadh where he could become a hero to disaffected Saudis.

3,000 Muslims attend communal harmony fest; Christians stay away
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOHAG, Egypt (AP) _ About 3,000 Muslims attended Tuesday a
song-and-poetry festival in southern Egypt but only a handful of
Coptic Christians showed up for the event that was called to
bolster Muslim-Christian unity.
	   The government-organized festival comes nearly two weeks after
reports that security forces jailed and tortured hundreds of Copts
while investigating an Aug. 14 murder case in al-Kushh town, 55
kilometers (35 miles) south of Sohag.
	   Egyptian human rights groups accused policemen of rounding up
1,200 Copts in al-Kushh, a predominantly Christian town. No Muslims
were arrested at the time.
	   The area is 400 kilometers (245 miles) south of Egypt's capital,
Cairo.
	   The al-Kushh murder victims were Copts and human right workers
have said that police wanted to find Christian suspects quickly in
order to prevent Muslim-Copt clashes. The government denied the
charges.
	   It was not clear whether the low turnout at the song fest was
because of the deep-seated mistrust among Copts for
government-organized functions or because they were simply unaware
of the event.
	   Christian community leaders were not immediately available for
comment.
	   The reports of alleged police brutality in al-Kushh have
embarrassed Egyptian officials, already smarting from foreign
criticism about alleged persecution of the country's Christian
minority, who are about 10 million of the country's 60 million
people.
	   News of the al-Kushh incident was spread by the town's Bishop
Wisa and Archbishop Antonious, who were not invited for the song
fest.
	   Both men were arrested on Oct. 15, but were released the same
day after signing pledges to stop what police called
``incitement.''
	   On Tuesday, singers sang of love for Egypt and poets stressed
tolerance among religions. In a speech, Sohag province Gov. Ahmed
Bakr described Wisa as ``a fanatic.''
	   He also blamed Wisa for contacting churches abroad ``to pressure
Egypt by showing that there is religious persecution of Copts.''
	   Bakr also complained that he received four letters from
institutions in the Netherlands, Canada and Australia blaming him
for the violence in al-Kushh. He did not name any of these
organizations.
	   Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif told Saudi Asharq
al-Awsat daily newspaper on Tuesday that reports of human rights
abuses were a conspiracy aimed at marring Egypt's reputation.
	   Two Egyptian lawyers have sued London's Sunday Telegraph, which
called al-Kushh's security sweep a government crackdown on
Christians.

British laureate Ted Hughes laid to rest in Devon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NORTH TAWTON, England (AP) _ British poet laureate Ted Hughes
was laid to rest in this tiny Devon village Tuesday, eulogized by
Nobel Literature prize-winner Seamus Heaney as leaving ``a rent in
the veil of poetry.''
	   About 200 mourners crowded into St. Peter's Church to remember
Hughes, 68, who died in a London hospital last week after an
18-month battle with cancer.
	   At the request of Hughes' widow, Carol, Heaney read Welsh poet
Dylan Thomas's ``Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.'' He also
read two of the late laureate's poems, ``Go Fishing'' and ``The Day
He Died'' _ the latter written in honor of Mrs. Hughes' father.
	   Heaney described Hughes was ``simply beloved'' and ``a tower of
tenderness and strength.''
	   The Rev. Terence McCaughey, who had known the poet since they
were students at Cambridge University, noted that the friends,
associates, fellow artists and neighbors gathered in the
13th-century church had ``along the way been touched somehow,
sometime, by this remarkable man.''
	   ``He had so much to say, and the world will be fertilized and
enriched by what he wrote,'' McCaughey said. ``We have come to say
thanks to him one last time.''
	   Hughes published more than 35 poems and collections of verse,
three works of prose, two opera libretti and four stage plays. He
was a successful children's writer as well, publishing five poetic
works for young people and seven stories.
	   His first wife was the American poet Sylvia Plath, who committed
suicide in 1963, months after he'd left her for another woman.
	   Earlier this year, he published ``Birthday Letters,'' a
searingly personal collection of poems chronicling his meeting,
marriage and breakup with Plath.

Hakkinen pays tribute to near-fatal crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOKING, England (AP) _ Formula One champion Mika Hakkinen says
his near-fatal crash three years ago only reinforced his love for
the dangerous sport.
	   Hakkinen, who won Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix to claim his
first series championship, met Tuesday with McLaren staff members
in the team factory south of London.
	   ``After the crash I did not think about driving for a while,''
said the 30-year-old Finn, who suffered severe head injuries in the
crash while practicing for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.
	   ``I realized there were other things in my life.''
	   ``It helped give me the opportunity to spend time with family
and friends. Up until then I had been so busy in my racing
career.''
	   Hakkinen, who lapsed into a coma after the crash but returned to
the track in four months, said the time in the hospital made him
appreciate the sport.
	   ``It was a hard way to learn things like that. I don't recommend
it,'' he said. ``But when I first went to test in the south of
France after the crash I realized I still loved it. This was the
sport I wanted to do.''

Council of Europe opens new, streamlined human rights court
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with inauguration opening, quotes; TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The Council of Europe inaugurated a
streamlined European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France,
that it hopes will deal faster with citizens' complaints.
	   ``Nearly 800 million Europeans will have access to this court,''
Daniel Tarschys, the secretary-general of the Council of Europe,
said at the inauguration ceremony Tuesday.
	   ``With 40 judges and a jurisdiction spanning from Nuuk in
Greenland to Petropavlovsk, in Kamchatka (in the Russian far east)
... this will be the largest permanent court in the world,''
Tarschys said.
	   The new court will work full-time, unlike the old one that
operated just one week every month and handled about 100 cases a
year, said council spokeswoman Kathy Burton.
	   ``We're hoping the new system will speed up the procedure quite
dramatically,'' Burton said. Under the old court system, rulings
often took years.
	   The court rules on infringements of the 1950 European Human
Rights Convention that was signed by all 40 nations in the Council
of Europe. Citizens from those nations can bring cases to the
European court after they have exhausted legal options in their
home countries.

Jewish leader questions honoring of Swiss bank critics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A prominent Swiss Jewish leader
Tuesday called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
explain why he is honoring two leading critics of Switzerland's
World War II role shortly before he visits the country.
	   At a ceremony planned in Jerusalem on Nov. 17, Netanyahu is to
honor Edgar Bronfman, head of the World Jewish Congress, and U.S.
Senator Alfonse D'Amato for their ``convictions and courage'' in
pushing through a settlement by Swiss banks of Holocaust victims'
claims.
	   Sigi Feigel, honorary president of the Hebrew Congregation of
Zurich, issued an open letter to Netanyahu after the Israeli
ambassador in Bern called on the Swiss to welcome him when he
arrives Nov. 25 for a Swiss-Israeli economic seminar.
	   ``Non-Jewish friends asked me whether you (Netanyahu) put any
value on the feelings of the Swiss population,'' Feigel said in his
letter.
	   ``Why this honor so close to your visit to Switzerland?'' Feigel
asked, calling on Netanyahu to give an answer ``personally and
directly to the Swiss people.''
	   Feigel has long been a critic of Jewish organizations who
accused Switzerland of acting as banker to Nazi Germany. He accused
Bronfman and D'Amato of making untrue allegations which ``deeply
hurt the feelings of a large part of the Swiss population.''
	   Following international pressure, Swiss banks agreed in August
to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors to compensate for
World War II losses.
	   New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who threatened Swiss
banks with sanctions, and U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart
Eizenstat, who oversaw the talks that led to the settlement, are
also to be honored at the ceremony in Jerusalem.
	   Feigel's letter follows another flap in September over a leaked
letter Netanyahu wrote praising Bronfman for his ``great pride,
dignity, skill and aplomb'' in the negotiations.
	   Netanyahu moved to end the row with a conciliatory statement
after a visit to Israel by Switzerland's armaments chief and the
economic seminar were briefly put in doubt.
	   The Swiss government remains angry with Bronfman for what it
considers were unfair attacks and in particular for remarks earlier
this year about ``total war'' on the Swiss.
	   Switzerland has not protested the planned honors, Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Yasmine Chatila said.

Russia, De Beers extend trade agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's chief diamond producer and the South
African cartel De Beers on Tuesday extended an agreement for the
sale of Russian rough diamonds for three more years.
	   The agreement, effective through the end of 2001, allows
Russia's Almazy Rossii-Sakha (ARS) to sell De Beers at least dlrs
550 million worth of rough diamonds each year.
	   ARS supplies to the South African cartel are expected to reach
about dlrs 900 million this year, said ARS president Vyacheslav
Shtyrov.
	   Under the agreement, Russia also may sell 5 percent of its
diamonds from current production and 20 percent of diamonds from
state reserves on the open market.
	   De Beers' chief executive, Nicholas Oppenheimer, denied reports
that the company planned to provide a diamond-backed loan to the
cash-strapped Russian government.
	   ``There have been no discussions on that matter,'' Oppenheimer
said in Moscow after signing the trade agreement.
	   Russian news agencies have quoted unidentified government
officials as saying Oppenheimer would discuss the loan during the
visit. They did not indicate the size of the possible loan, but
said it would have been secured by diamonds held by the state
treasury.
	   De Beers earlier granted Russia a trade advance of dlrs 1
billion to develop Russian diamond fields.
	   Russia supplies about 20 percent of the world's uncut gems, and
5 percent of all cut diamonds.
	   The terms of the new trade agreement are unchanged from the
current one, which expires at the end of the year.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov praised the extension of
the deal, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``We are working in what is a very important field for us,'' he
was quoted as telling Oppenheimer.

Ireland says match is on for Belgrade on Nov. 18
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Yugoslavia's European Championship
qualifying game against Ireland, called off last month due to the
crisis in Kosovo, will be played in Belgrade on Nov. 18, the Irish
soccer association said Tuesday.
	   The Group 8 match was orginally scheduled to take place in
Belgrade on Oct. 10 but was postponed by UEFA because of the threat
of NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
	   ``It is a great relief that we now know where we are going,''
said Football Association of Ireland chief executive Bernard
O'Byrne. ``I am happy that the final decision has been made by UEFA
because we can now go ahead with our travel plans.''
	   Ireland team manager Mick McCarthy said he always believed the
match would be staged in Belgrade.
	   In Nyon, Switzerland, a UEFA spokesman said he could not confirm
that a final decision had been taken about the venue.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of murdered fashion scion
Maurizio Gucci was convicted of his contract killing Tuesday and
sentenced to 29 years in prison. Her four co-defendants were also
convicted, with the triggerman getting a life sentence.
	   The verdict came only a few hours after Patrizia Reggiani
Martinelli made a final plea for mercy before a crowded courtroom,
saying she was naive and involved in his murder only against her
will.
	   Her lawyer said she turned to him in bewilderment after the
verdict, while fights broke out between police and journalists
pushing to get closer to the woman Italy's press has dubbed ``The
Black Widow.''
	   ```Truth is the child of time,''' the lawyer quoted her as
saying. ```Evidentally, they didn't believe me.'''
	   Ex-husband Maurizio Gucci, 46, was shot dead March 27, 1995, on
the steps of his Milan office. He was the grandson of Guccio Gucci,
founder of the fashion company known for its leather goods and
double ``G'' logo.
	   He was the last Gucci to hold a stake in the company, but he
sold out for dlrs 120 million in 1993 after a long history of
family discord.
	   Prosecutors alleged his ex-wife had him killed to gain control
of his fortune. The prosecution had asked for the maximum _ a life
sentence. But the panel of two judges and five citizens chose a
shorter prison term.
	   Also convicted were her longtime psychic adviser, Giuseppina
Auriemma, the doorman of a seedy hotel, a debt-ridden pizzeria
owner accused of pulling the trigger, and an unemployed auto worker
accused of driving the getaway car.
	   Auriemma was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the doorman got
26, the driver got 29 years and the triggerman was sentenced to
life. All but Gucci's ex-wife and the pizzeria owner confessed.
	   With its sordid courtroom revelations about greed, betrayal and
shameless social climbing, the five-month trial has aired a seamy
side of Milan, the chic capital of Italy's fashion industry.
	   Prosecution witnesses testified that Reggiani Martinelli wasn't
satisfied with her dlrs 860,000 a year in alimony and wanted all of
her ex-husband's money.
	   Pale and drawn, Reggiani Martinelli pointed her finger Tuesday
at Auriemma, whom she says arranged the murder, then blackmailed
her for dlrs 375,000.
	   ``I have been naive to the point of stupidity,'' she told a
packed courtroom that included her son and mother. ``I found myself
involved against my will. I deny categorically that I was an
accomplice.''
	   The once-glamorous Reggiani Martinelli said Auriemma, a
Neapolitan of humble origins, used her to satisfy an obsessive
hunger for money and power.
	   ``Never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken coop. Sooner
or later it will get hungry,'' she said.
	   Reggiani Martinelli, 50, has admitted threatening Gucci and
repeatedly seeking someone to kill him, but says she never went
through with the plan.
	   Auriemma has admitted arranging Gucci's murder but testified
that she did it at Reggiani Martinelli's behest. She made no final
statement Tuesday.
	   The driver of the getaway car, Orazio Cicala, and hotel doorman
Ivano Savioni, who acted as a go-between, both made public pleas
for forgiveness. Alleged triggerman Benedetto Ceraulo again
maintained his innocence.
	   ``I've reflected a lot over these long months,'' Savioni told
the court. ``I know that I face many long years in prison for what
I've done. I ask the pardon of Gucci's children and am horrified
that things went so much farther than I intended.''
	   Lawyer Giovanni Maria Dedola said the younger of the couple's
two daughters took the verdict in tears.
	   He promised an appeal.
	   ``The fact that they gave less than life imprisonment means
there was some doubt and that gives us some hope,'' he said.

	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security forces have in
recent months foiled Iranian-backed attempts by Islamic militants
to assassinate Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and senior members
of his government, a senior Arafat aide said Tuesday.
	   Iran is training and funding a secret cell within the Islamic
militant group Hamas to carry out the assassinations and suicide
bombings in Israel, Tayyeb Abdel Rahim, the secretary general of
the Palestinian Authority, told The Associated Press.
	   ``We arrested several of these people who had plans detailing
the assassinations,'' Abdel Rahim said.
	   In October, Palestinian intelligence agents arrested a Hamas
activist, Jamal Natche, in the West Bank town of Hebron. Natche was
given orders by Iran to kill Arafat, Abdel Rahim said, but did not
provide details.
	   In a sharply worded leaflet, Hamas denied that it was receiving
money from Iran. ``Those who are cooperating with the enemy should
remain silent,'' the leaflet said in a reference to the Palestinian
Authority's pledge as part of the new peace agreement to crack down
on Hamas and to try and prevent terror attacks against Israelis.
	   Hamas, which has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings
in Israel since 1994, said the attacks would continue. ``Hamas
renews its commitment to the Palestinian people to continue the
holy war and resistance against our occupiers,'' the leaflet said.
	   A Hamas leader, Ismail Hanieh, said that more than 300
supporters of the group have been rounded up since last Thursday's
suicide attack on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian
official have put the number of detainees at more than 100.
	   Hanieh said the dialogue between Hamas and the Palestinian
Authority has resumed. Hanieh said he met Monday with Palestinian
intelligence officials and demanded that all detainees be freed. He
said the security officials did not give an immediate response.
	   As a result of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, there have
been mounting threats against Arafat.
	   Iran's spiritual leader, Ali Khamenei, has called Arafat a
traitor. The leader of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah group in Lebanon,
Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, said Arafat's hands should be chopped off
for signing the agreement.
	   The Hamas military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, warned Arafat of
``the wrath of vengeance'' for his crackdown on Hamas, imposed
after last week's suicide attack by the group on an Israeli convoy.
	   On Monday, the 69-year-old Arafat dismissed the threats with a
wave of his hand. ``It is not the first time and it won't be the
last. I don't care,'' said Arafat, who has survived several
attempts on his life during his decades as Palestinian leader.
	   Israeli media reports said the CIA has given Arafat's security
chiefs, Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan. instructions on how to
deal with the new situation. However, Abdel Rahim said security for
Arafat has not been beefed up in response to the threats.
	   With no designated successor, Arafat's sudden death would create
chaos within Palestinian society. Such a situation would seriously
threaten an already shaky peace process.

Chilean exiles file complaints against Pinochet in Germany
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from plaintiffs' group; RECASTS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Hoping to pressure Germany into
demanding the extradition of Chilean Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chilean
exiles filed complaints Tuesday with German prosecutors accusing
the former dictator of responsibility for human rights abuses 25
years ago.
	   Pinochet ``must be brought to justice,'' said Rainer Patz,
spokesman for a group coordinating the action. ``We're doing this
for those who can no longer speak.''
	   While France issued an international arrest warrant Monday for
the former dictator, and Switzerland has demanded Pinochet's
extradition, prosecutors were examining whether Germany has
jurisdiction in all its cases. None of the plaintiffs were German
citizens when the alleged abuses happened. There also were
questions about whether the statute of limitations has expired on
the charges, which date back to 1973.
	   Suits on behalf of four plaintiffs were filed Tuesday in Hanover
and Hamburg. One man accuses Pinochet of responsibility in his
kidnap and torture, and of the disappearance and probable murder of
his brother in 1976. Three other plaintiffs accuse Pinochet of
genocide, murder, crimes against humanity, deprivation of personal
liberty and causing serious bodily harm.
	   A fifth plaintiff, who filed her suit on Monday in Cologne,
accuses Pinochet of depriving her of personal liberty and causing
bodily harm during her arrest and torture in 1973.
	   More legal actions were expected, Patz said.
	   Germany's Justice Ministry did not return calls seeking comment.
	   The legal actions were the latest by Chilean exiles who say they
suffered under Pinochet's 17-year rule since Britain's High Court
ruled illegal the former dictator's arrest in London on a Spanish
warrant seeking his extradition on charges of murder, kidnapping
and torture.
	   Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, is expected to rule
this week on an appeal claiming that Pinochet is immune from
prosecution as a former head of state. The judges were expected
uphold the appeal, meaning that Britain would be unlikely to honor
other extradition requests.
	   Chilean exiles across Europe _ in Belgium, Norway and Sweden _
have filed complaints similar to the ones in Germany seeking either
Pinochet's prosecution or extradition
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says more
than 3,000 people were killed or disappeared during Pinochet's
rule.

 &UR; Ethiopia orders Sudanese rebel group to close office

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia _ Ethiopia has ordered the Sudanese
People's Liberation Army to close its office in western Ethiopia on
the border with Sudan, a source said Tuesday.
	   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press the government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi had
ordered rebel leader John Garang to close the SPLA office in the
Gambella region that borders Sudan.
	   The Sudanese government had also agreed to curb the activities
of Ethiopian opposition groups in its territory, the source added.
	   The move was seen as a sign of further improvement of ties
between Addis Ababa and Khartoum, strained since suspected
Sudan-based assailants tried to assassinate Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak at an Organization of African Unity summit in Addis
Ababa in 1995.
	   Quoting the Sudanese Al Alwan newspaper, three private Ethiopian
newspapers reported at the weekend that Garang had been had been
ordered to pull out his forces away from the border area in
addition to closing the SPLA office in Gambella.
	   But when questioned about the newspaper reports Tuesday,
government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse replied: ``Was there an SPLA
office in western Ethiopia in the first place?''
	   She said she would not at any rate comment on reports from
independent newspapers whose sources, she said, were unreliable.
	   The relationship between Ethiopia and Sudan began to improve
dramatically after the outbreak five months ago of a simmering
border conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Eritrea has been at loggerheads with Sudan, which it accuses of
interference in its internal affairs. Eritrea is host to the
National Democratic Alliance, an umbrella group of Sudanese opposed
to the Islamic Front government of President Omar el-Bashir.
	   Ten days ago, Ethiopian Airlines resumed flights to the Khartou,
2 1/2 years after suspending them in the aftermath of the Mubarak
assassination attempt.
	   Ethiopia accused Sudan of complicity, and relations fell to an
all-time low.

Chile gets first female general
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ On Nov. 17, Mireya Perez will make a bit
of history in Chile: she will become the first woman ever to reach
the rank of general.
	   The promotion will culminate a 32-year-old career of Col. Perez
in the Carabineros, Chile's militarized national police.
	   The pioneer thinks that others soon will follow.
	   ``From now on, I expect to see every year more women becoming
generals,'' she said.
	   She does not expect problems with male subordinates, since she
already has quite a few.
	   As general, she will keep her job as head of a special police
division in charge of family affairs.
	   The armed forces have admitted women since the early 1970s, but
none of them has yet reached the top.
	   Army commander in chief Ricardo Izurieta announced recently that
some branch colonels may soon become generals.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ With floodwaters receding and
communications improving, rescuers struggled Tuesday to reach
thousands cut off by Hurricane Mitch, fearing that hunger could add
to an estimated 7,000 people already dead in Central America.
	   The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, where an
estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 _ 10 percent of the
population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's
storm. Countless more were lacking fresh water, food and medicine
from Mexico and Guatemala to El Salvador and Nicaragua, where a
mudslide may have swallowed hundreds of villagers.
	   ``The floods and landslides erased from the map many villages
and households as well as whole neighborhoods of cities,''
President Carlos Flores Facusse said, appealing for international
help in a speech broadcast throughout Honduras on Monday. ``There
are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the waters.''
	   Responding to widespread looting and vandalism, Flores Facusse
suspended constitutional liberties for two weeks and imposed a
curfew.
	   With roads and bridges destroyed throughout the nation, the head
of Honduras' air force, Col. Alfredo San Martin, said Tuesday that
the country has gasoline for only about a week.
	   If fuel cannot be distributed, aid shipments to regions already
short of food could be stalled, he said.
	   The International Red Cross tripled its appeal for assistance to
dlrs 7.4 million Monday.
	   The U.S. government was considering ways to expand the dlrs 3.5
million in emergency aid it was providing to the region, U.S.
President Bill Clinton said Tuesday.
	   U.S. military aid flights began arriving Monday in Honduras and
U.S. Blackhawk helicopters started distributing aid Tuesday in
Nicaragua, where officials said that they would fine people raised
prices on basic foods.
	   Pope John Paul II expressed his condolences Tuesday and urged
worldwide aid to help Central America ``overcome these difficult
moments.''
	   Many areas were still cut off almost a week after Mitch barreled
in with 180 mph (290 kph) winds. The storm pounded the Central
American isthmus, dropping up to 25 inches (63 centimeters) of rain
in a six-hour period, before dissipating Monday in southern Mexico.
	   El Salvador's National Emergency Committee listed 222 dead, 135
missing and 50,000 homeless. Guatemala reported 100 storm-related
deaths. Mexico reported one. Nicaragua's official preliminary
figures showed 1,330 dead and 1,903 missing nationwide.
	   As many as 1,500 Nicaraguans may have died in mudslides when the
crater lake of the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud
and debris sliding down onto villages below.
	   By late Monday, soldiers had found 808 bodies. Local civil
defense officials said they planned to burn bodies on Tuesday to
cut the risk of disease.
	   Nicaraguan Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said in a
telephone interview Monday night that there had been another small
mudslide on the northern slope of the volcano, but there were no
apparent casualties. About 34 houses were destroyed, he said.

	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Cold air aloft brought on by a strong low-pressure center over
the maritime provinces of Canada reached the northern Caribbean
late on Monday. This cold air aloft has caused the atmosphere to
destabilize.
	   Afternoon heating from the sun will cause showers and
thunderstorms again, mostly in interior Puerto Rico. Some of these
storms will be intense and accompanied by heavy rain. Today the
storms should move south, pushed along by the upper-level steering
winds.
	   The air mass will start to dry out today, but very slowly. This
means that the trend through Friday will be for fewer showers and
thunderstorms.
	   The northerly swells will become northeasterly in the Atlantic
waters and will decrease to 4 feet by Friday.

Swiss group sues newspaper for printing diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Germ in 7th graf is cq. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Swiss foundation holding the
copyright to Anne Frank's famous diary went to court Tuesday
against an Amsterdam newspaper that printed parts of five newly
discovered pages.
	   The Basel-based Anne Frank Fund scolded the daily Het Parool for
what it contends was the ``unauthorized publication'' of excerpts.
Its suit in the Amsterdam District Court claims copyright
infringement.
	   The squabble began in August, when longtime Frank family friend
Cor Suijk revealed he held five previously unpublished handwritten
pages penned by the Jewish teen hiding from the Nazis.
	   On Aug. 26, Het Parool published about 400 words of excerpts on
its front page next to a large photograph of Anne. The new diary
entries contained Anne's criticisms of her parents' strained
relationship.
	   Germ Kemper, the lawyer for the Anne Frank Fund, said the group
wants the newspaper to run a correction acknowledging copyright
infringement, and stop quoting from the new pages and sending
copies to other media.
	   The newspaper has refused, contending it had the right under
Dutch and European freedom of speech laws to print the excerpts.
	   ``All requirements for lawful quotation have been satisfied,''
said Willem van Manen, a lawyer for the newspaper, which has not
said how it obtained the passages still in Suijk's possession.
	   A verdict has been scheduled for Nov. 12.
	   The Anne Frank Fund holds all rights to ``The Diary of Anne
Frank,'' an international bestseller in dozens of languages. It has
no connection to the Amsterdam-based Anne Frank Foundation, which
runs a popular museum in the canal house where the girl and her
family hid for two years until their betrayal.
	   Anne died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp
weeks before it was liberated in the spring of 1945.

UAE beat Oman 3-2 in Gulf soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Adil Mattar scored in the 83rd minute to
give the United Arab Emirates a 3-2 victory Tuesday over Oman in a
preliminary match of the the six-nation Gulf Cup.
	   It was UAE's second win following its 1-0 victory over host
Bahrain in the opening match of the tournament. The other teams
participating are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar.
	   UAE took the lead in the 37th minute when forward Adil Mohammed
deceived the Omani defense. Ali Thani followed in 57th minute to
give the Emirates its second goal.
	   Oman's Majdi Shaban brought the scores level 2-2, scoring the
first goal in the 75th minute with a powerful shot taken almost
19yards from the goal post. His second goal came from a penalty
shot awarded to him after he was yanked to the ground by a UAE
defender.
	   Though the Omani team had a better attack they could not execute
well near the post.
	   Mattar brilliantly controlled the ball with a header and then
kicked the ball in the center from the right side of the goal to
give UAE the winning goal in the 83rd minute.
	   Tuesday's victory also made UAE the only side to record two wins
so far in the tournament.

New Slovak government reverses Meciar moves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's new government on Tuesday
overturned two last-minute decisions by the outgoing leadership,
firing the new secret service chief and canceling a minimum wage
hike.
	   The reversals came just four days after the former opposition
coalition took power, replacing the authoritarian government of
former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar that it defeated in September
elections.
	   The government of new Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda dismissed
Rudolf Ziak, who was appointed only a week earlier to head the
Slovak secret service SIS, and replaced him with Vladimir Mitro.
Mitro headed the service before Meciar's party won elections in
1994.
	   The post was held until last week by Ivan Lexa, who was named to
fill Meciar's parliamentary seat. Critics of Meciar's government
suspect that move was aimed at giving him immunity from any
prosecution in the 1995 kidnapping of Michal Kovac Jr., son of
Slovakia's former president, a bitter Meciar rival.
	   The government, faced by a huge budget deficit, also canceled
Meciar's recent minimum wage increase to 4,000 crowns (dlrs 114) a
month, reducing the amount to 3,000 crowns (dlrs 85) again.
	   Dzurinda's cabinet also appointed state secretaries for the 15
ministries.
	   The Slovak prime minister plans his first official trip this
week, visiting Brussels on Thursday and Vienna on Friday. He will
meet with top representatives of the European Union and NATO and
with Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel.
	   Dzurinda said his government will announce its overall program
in two weeks.
	   His Cabinet indicated in a statement that one priority will be
trying to create favorable conditions in Slovakia so that many
Romanies or Gypsies won't seek political asylum abroad. Dzurinda
did not elaborate.

British laureate Ted Hughes laid to rest in Devon

<TEXT>
	   NORTH TAWTON, England (AP) _ British poet laureate Ted Hughes
was laid to rest in this tiny Devon village Tuesday, eulogized by
Nobel Literature prize-winner Seamus Heaney as leaving ``a rent in
the veil of poetry.''
	   About 200 mourners crowded into St. Peter's Church to remember
Hughes, 68, who died in a London hospital last week after an
18-month battle with cancer.
	   At the request of Hughes' widow, Carol, Heaney read Welsh poet
Dylan Thomas's ``Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night.'' He also
read two of the late laureate's poems, ``Go Fishing'' and ``The Day
He Died'' _ the latter written in honor of Mrs. Hughes' father.
	   Heaney described Hughes was ``simply beloved'' and ``a tower of
tenderness and strength.''
	   The Rev. Terence McCaughey, who had known the poet since they
were students at Cambridge University, noted that the friends,
associates, fellow artists and neighbors gathered in the
13th-century church had ``along the way been touched somehow,
sometime, by this remarkable man.''
	   ``He had so much to say, and the world will be fertilized and
enriched by what he wrote,'' McCaughey said. ``We have come to say
thanks to him one last time.''
	   Hughes published more than 35 collections of verse, three works
of prose, two opera libretti and four stage plays. He was a
successful children's writer as well, publishing five poetic works
for young people and seven stories.
	   His first wife was the American poet Sylvia Plath, who committed
suicide in 1963, months after he'd left her for another woman.
	   Earlier this year, he published ``Birthday Letters,'' a
searingly personal collection of poems chronicling his meeting,
marriage and breakup with Plath.

Centrist nominated as Latvia's PM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis on Tuesday
nominated centrist politician Vilis Kristopans to be prime minister
and asked him to begin efforts to form a government.
	   That could be a difficult task. Kristopans' Latvia's Way party
has signed a coalition agreement with the centrist New Party and
the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom, but together the three
parties hold only 46 seats in the 100-seat Saeima parliament that
was elected last month.
	   The largest party in the parliament _ the People's Party with 24
seats _ differs little in policy with Latvia's Way, but is led by
former prime minister Andris Skele, who is deeply disliked by many
politicians.
	   Ulmanis has pushed for including the People's Party, saying the
country needs a government with a large and stable majority in
parliament.
	   Kristopans as transport minister also has offended many with his
sharp tongue. He once called current Prime Minister Guntars Krasts
a ''lice-eating hawk,'' according to the Baltic News Service.
	   Kristopans has called for efforts to improve Latvia's troubled
relations with Russia. The Kremlin has often denounced the former
Soiet republic for its treatment of its large ethnic Russian
population.
	   Most of the ethnic Russians are non-citizens and had faced high
obstacles to obtaining citizenship. Voters approved easing the
naturalization laws last month, but the liberalization was opposed
by Fatherland and Freedom.
	   On other issues, the three parties in the proposed coalition are
in broad agreement about continuing Latvia's market-oriented
economic reforms and pursuing membership in NATO and the European
Union.
	   Ulmanis told the opening session of the new Saeima on Tuesday
that EU membership should be a top priority.
	   ``This parliament will take Latvia into the finishing phase of
the EU integration,'' he said. ``Bringing Latvian legislation into
conformity with EU norms is one of the priorities in the work of
the parliament and the government.''
	   Ulmanis wants to have a new government in place by Nov. 18,
Latvian Independence Day.

Lake created by El Nino disappearing in Peruvian desert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ When torrential El Nino-driven rains drenched
northern Peru this year, a massive lake dubbed ``La Nina'' formed
in its desert sands, where thousands of acres (hectares) of desert
bloomed with grass and trees.
	   But these benefits, which President Alberto Fujimori boasted
would bring tourism and agriculture benefits to Peru for years, are
quickly fading, experts said Tuesday.
	   In just seven months since the rains began, Lake La Nina's depth
has fallen by almost half _ from an average of 10 feet (3 meters)
to 5.3 feet (1.6 meters) _ and its surface area has shrunk by
one-third, Ronald Woodman, director of Peru's Geophysical
Institute, said Tuesday.
	   Forest fires started by people burning shrubs to make charcoal
have destroyed 74,000 acres (30,000 hectares) of the 1.2 million
(500,000 hectares) pasture created by El Nino. The fires continue
to burn.
	   The government had said the land could have serve as pasture for
cattle.
	   The Sechura desert, 500 miles (800 kilometers) north of Lima,
will return to its normal dry conditions in 2000, Woodman said.
	   El Nino-powered floods and mudslides early this year killed
hundreds and destroyed much of Peru's road and bridge
infrastructure. Fujimori had used Lake La Nina to show that El Nino
was not a complete disaster for Peru.
	   Lake La Nina, which was formed when two small lakes swelled in
size and merged, reached its peak in March when was 120 miles (200
kilometers) long and 18 miles (30 kilometers) wide, making it the
second largest lake in surface area in South America, Woodman said.
	   Pink flamingos came and impoverished desert residents fished in
its waters. Peru's tourism board showed people jet-skiing on its
surface to attract tourists to the temporary desert phenomenon.
	   But the dry desert air is quickly evaporating the lake and few
tourists have come.
	   El Nino is a giant pool of warm water that settles off Peru's
coast every two to seven years, altering weather patterns
worldwide. Peru and Ecuador are usually the countries hardest hit.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Vincent Spadea of the United States stunned the
hometown hero Tuesday with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over French No. 1
Cedric Pioline at the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   Pioline fired nine aces to Spadea's two, but never looked
completely comfortable on his serve.
	   The Chicago-born Spadea, 24, broke serve in the seventh game and
held serve comfortably to take the first set.
	   In the second set, he broke early to put himself on course for
victory.
	   Leading 3-1, Spadea showed his growing confidence with a deft
backhand drop volley at 30-30.
	   Pioline, who had to withdraw from last week's Eurocard Open in
Stuttgart because of gastroenteritis, never showed the form that
has taken him to No. 17 in the world, eventually losing in one hour
14 minutes.
	   Todd Martin was another American in fine form, beating No. 14
seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4).
	   Ivanisevic is the first seed to lose at this year's Paris Open.
	   In another second-round match, No. 13 seed Greg Rusedski of
Britain had little trouble beating Nicolas Kiefer of Germany, 6-3,
6-4, in one hour and seven minutes.
	   Rusedski said he was happy with his form _ Kiefer failed to
break serve during the match _ but played down his chances of
qualifying for the ATP Tour World Championship in Hanover.
	   ``I played well today and handled the big points,'' Rusedski
said. ``I was at 15-40 a couple of times, but came up with good
serves and good volleys.''
	   But with only next week's Stockholm Open to play before Hanover,
Rusedski said he had little hope of leaping above the players just
ahead of him in the world rankings: Tim Henman, Petr Korda and
Richard Krajicek.
	   ``I don't think I have a realistic chance for Hanover. It's
nearly impossible,'' he said.
	   Britain's Henman ended the challenge of Arnaud Di Pasquale,
beating the world junior champion 6-3, 6-3.
	   ``I started off well and served well at the start of the second
set, which was when he really had a chance,'' Henman said.
	   Henman, the world's No. 9, was more upbeat than his countryman
about qualifying for Hanover, describing his chances as ``pretty
good.''

Agent denies report Michael Schumacher is Algerian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The agent for Michael Schumacher Tuesday denied a
report by an Algerian newspaper that the Formula One driver is
actually named ``Farouk'' and moved to Germany.
	   ``El Modjhahid'' claimed it had documented proof that Michael
and his brother Ralf Schumacher, also a Formula One driver, had an
Algerian father and German mother and were born in the town of
Blida.
	   After the father died, the Schumachers allegedly moved to
Germany and changed their names. Ralf's real name, according to the
story in the paper, is Hassan.
	   ``Sensational idea. It should be printed exactly like that.
Actually I haven't heard anything that stupid in a long time,''
Michael Schumacher's press agent Heiner Buchinger told the Berlin
daily B.Z.
	   The B.Z. printed pictures of the two clean-shaven brothers
wearing Fez's and sporting mustaches, calling the story the
craziest of the year.
	   The B.Z., as well as several other German papers, also said ``El
Modjhahid'' seems to have overlooked the fact the square-jawed
brothers bear a strong resemblance to their father Rolf Schumacher.
	   Rolf Schumacher was raised in Cologne, Germany.

Russian legislator: Saddam wants timetable on sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cohen headed for the Gulf; France recalls
representative from Baghdad &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein wants a
timetable on when U.N. sanctions will be lifted before he will
allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume, a visiting Russian
legislator said Tuesday.
	   Ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky told reporters after two
hours of talks with Saddam that the Iraqi president saw ``no
problem'' with monitoring.
	   ``But he would like to have information when the blockade (will
be) eliminated,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``When? This year, next year,
next century?'' said the legislator, a regular visitor to Iraq who
has good relations with Saddam.
	   Saddam has not spoken publicly since the government announced
Saturday it was halting dealings with the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees weapons inspections. Iraq's precondition for
resuming cooperation was U.N. pledges to begin easing or lifting
the trade sanctions.
	   The stance has put Iraq on a collision course with the U.N.
Security Council, which termed the action a ``flagrant violation''
of U.N. resolutions.
	   U.S. President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
suggested that military force was an option. U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen was headed to the Gulf to consult with U.S. allies in
the region.
	   Zhirinovsky said of Saddam that ``he would like peace.'' But he
added: ``Iraq made everything to fulfill all resolutions of the
United Nations, but the United Nations doesn't make anything for
Iraq.''
	   The sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, limit the sale of oil and ban most other financial dealings
with Iraq.
	   The Security Council has said they will not be lifted until the
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its non-conventional
weapons.
	   Iraq accuses the Special Commission, under Australian Richard
Butler, of working on behalf of the United States to prolong the
sanctions.
	   Zhirinovsky quoted Saddam as saying the Special Commission
needed to be restructured to make it ``more objective.'' The Iraqi
leader suggested Butler should be replaced by someone from China,
Russia or France, Zhirinovsky said.
	   Representatives of the three countries have been the most
willing members of the Security Council to consider easing the
sanctions, but it appeared Tuesday that their patience was wearing
thin.
	   France recalled its representative in Baghdad, Yves Aubin de la
Messuzie, for consultations, and warned Iraq that its decision will
lead to its ``total isolation.''
	   ``France does not understand this attitude,'' Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said in a letter to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz. ``There should be no mistake about the state of mind of
the Security Council,'' he said.
	   China also urged Iraq to end the standoff and said cooperation
would be the quickest way to end the sanctions. At the same time,
the Security Council should fairly evaluate the inspection work so
far and ``gradually lift the sanctions,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to RAISE reference to appearance fee being
renegotiated, DELETES speculation about pregnancy

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Canadian super model Linda Evangelista
agreed to renegotiate her appearance fee at a Portuguese fashion
show after her performance was criticized as clumsy.
	   Evangelista, 33, was the headline attraction at the Portugal
Fashion event in the northern city Oporto on Sunday night.
	   But press reports Tuesday described her as overweight and
unsteady on her feet.
	   Manuel Serrao, spokesman for Portugal's National Association of
Young Businessmen, which organized the show, said Evangelista ``did
not carry out precisely the work she was contracted to do.''
	   Serrao said Evangelista's agent acknowledged shortcomings and
renegotiated her appearance fee. He declined to give details.
	   A spokeswoman for the Lisbon branch of her modeling agency said
Evangelista was unwell with food poisoning.
	   ``She was sick before she arrived. She was wrong to have come,''
said the spokeswoman for Look Elite who declined to give her name.
	   Daily paper Publico described Evangelista as ``beautiful but
clumsy.''
	   Another daily, Jornal de Noticias, said she was ``a great
disappointment.''
	   In general the papers said she appeared lethargic, tripped on
the hem of a long white dress, and that one of the dresses she wore
had to be altered to make it bigger.
	   She reportedly left the show before the finale, in which she was
due to appear.

Canadian general put on indefinite leave due to Rwanda stress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Canadian general who led a United Nations
mission in Rwanda and witnessed the horrors of the 1994 genocide
there has been put on indefinite mental health leave.
	   Lt. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, who has acknowledged experiencing
nightmares and post-traumatic stress, was ordered to take a 30-day
medical leave in late September.
	   On Monday, military authorities said Dallaire's leave had been
extended indefinitely.
	   ``It's a medical question between him and his doctor,'' said Lt.
Yves Vanier, a military spokesman. ``His return to work is based on
the progress of his recovery.''
	   Dallaire had been serving as an associate defense minister in
charge of military personnel. In the months before taking leave, he
had championed the cause of soldiers suffering psychological
effects from service abroad.
	   He had urged commanders and soldiers to take post-traumatic
stress syndrome seriously and treat its victims with the same care
as the casualties of battlefield wounds.
	   Dallaire was commander of an ill-fated U.N. contingent posted in
Rwanda at the beginning of the genocide there. In testimony this
year before the International Criminal Tribunal, Dallaire said the
world community should have done more to prevent the slaughter of
hundreds of thousands of minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu
extremists.
	   The Belgian Senate accused Dallaire of negligence in the death
of 10 Belgian soldiers under his command who were massacred after
he assigned them to guard the Rwandan prime minister.
	   Canada's Defense Department stood by Dallaire, discounting the
Belgian allegations.

Gucci ex-wife gets 29 years in husband's murder

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of murdered fashion scion
Maurizio Gucci was convicted of his contract killing Tuesday and
sentenced to 29 years in prison. Her four co-defendants were also
convicted, with the triggerman getting a life sentence.
	   The verdict came only a few hours after Patrizia Reggiani
Martinelli made a final plea for mercy before a crowded courtroom,
saying she was naive and involved in his murder only against her
will.
	   Her lawyer said she turned to him in bewilderment after the
verdict, while fights broke out between police and journalists
pushing to get closer to the woman Italy's press has dubbed ``The
Black Widow.''
	   ```Truth is the child of time,''' the lawyer quoted her as
saying. ```Evidentally, they didn't believe me.'''
	   Ex-husband Maurizio Gucci, 46, was shot dead March 27, 1995, on
the steps of his Milan office. He was the grandson of Guccio Gucci,
founder of the fashion company known for its leather goods and
double ``G'' logo.
	   He was the last Gucci to hold a stake in the company, but he
sold out for dlrs 120 million in 1993 after a long history of
family discord.
	   Prosecutors alleged his ex-wife had him killed to gain control
of his fortune. The prosecution had asked for the maximum _ a life
sentence. But the panel of two judges and five citizens chose a
shorter prison term.
	   Also convicted were her longtime psychic adviser, Giuseppina
Auriemma, the doorman of a seedy hotel, a debt-ridden pizzeria
owner accused of pulling the trigger, and an unemployed auto worker
accused of driving the getaway car.
	   Auriemma was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the doorman got
26, the driver got 29 years and the triggerman was sentenced to
life. All but Gucci's ex-wife and the pizzeria owner confessed.
	   With its sordid courtroom revelations about greed, betrayal and
shameless social climbing, the five-month trial has aired a seamy
side of Milan, the chic capital of Italy's fashion industry.
	   Prosecution witnesses testified that Reggiani Martinelli wasn't
satisfied with her dlrs 860,000 a year in alimony and wanted all of
her ex-husband's money.
	   Pale and drawn, Reggiani Martinelli pointed her finger Tuesday
at Auriemma, whom she says arranged the murder, then blackmailed
her for dlrs 375,000.
	   ``I have been naive to the point of stupidity,'' she declared.
``I deny categorically that I was an accomplice.''
	   The once-glamorous Reggiani Martinelli said Auriemma, a
Neapolitan of humble origins, used her to satisfy an obsessive
hunger for money and power.
	   ``Never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken coop. Sooner
or later it will get hungry,'' she said.
	   Reggiani Martinelli, 50, has admitted threatening Gucci and
repeatedly seeking someone to kill him, but says she never went
through with the plan.
	   Auriemma has admitted arranging Gucci's murder but testified
that she did it at Reggiani Martinelli's behest. She made no final
statement Tuesday.
	   The driver of the getaway car, Orazio Cicala, and hotel doorman
Ivano Savioni, who acted as a go-between, both made public pleas
for forgiveness. Alleged triggerman Benedetto Ceraulo again
maintained his innocence.
	   ``I've reflected a lot over these long months,'' Savioni told
the court. ``I know that I face many long years in prison for what
I've done. I ask the pardon of Gucci's children and am horrified
that things went so much farther than I intended.''
	   Lawyer Giovanni Maria Dedola said the younger of the couple's
two daughters took the verdict in tears.
	   He promised an appeal.
	   ``The fact that they gave less than life imprisonment means
there was some doubt and that gives us some hope,'' he said.

Jewish settlers stake West Bank land ahead of Israeli withdrawal

	   ALON SHVUT, West Bank (AP) - Two young religious Jews wearing
knitted scullcaps poured over Jewish texts in a new West Bank
trailer park Tuesday, while a third man, armed with a submachine
gun, stood guard outside.
	   The seven mobile homes were brought illegally on Saturday night
to the rocky hilltop outside the existing settlement of Alon Shvut
and several similar trailer parks have sprouted on other West Bank
hilltops in what appears to be a last-minute land grab.
	   Settlers say they want to claim the plots before Israel hands a
chunk of the West Bank to the Palestinians as part of a new Mideast
land-for-peace accord.
	   Under the Wye summit agreement, Israel is to withdraw its troops
from 13 percent of the West Bank and the hand the area over to
Palestinian control.
	   Sitting in his office stacked with maps and plans, Yerach Rotem,
a community official for Alon Shvut, said he was sorry the mobile
homes had to be erected illegally instead of with government
approval. Rotem hasn't seen the withdrawal maps and doesn't know
which areas will be affected in the pullback, ``but with this
agreement ... we were afraid that all our work would just go down
the drain,'' he said.
	   ``We are worried,'' Rotem said, and he is not alone.
	   Literally overnight, mobile homes popped-up, forming small beige
clusters on the very top of dusty dry hills.
	   Three homes appeared on an isolated hilltop outside the
settlement of Maale Michmash, in the heartland of the West Bank.
The very steep hill, about 700 yards (meters) from the settlement,
commands a magnificent view of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea
to the east, and the eastern suburbs of Jerusalem to the West.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and today some 150,000 Israeli Jews live in settlements
throughout the area. The Palestinians want the land as part of a
future independent state for the 1.6 million Palestinians who also
live in the West Bank in eight cities and hundreds of villages.
	   Yitzhak Sapir, 53, a lecturer at a community college in one of
the West Bank settlements, was looking after the three trailers
while the other settlers - three families and some young single
people - were absent at work.
	   Despite repeated calls by the Palestinians and the United States
to halt settlement construction, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has said he would allow settlements to expand, in order to
accommodate natural growth.
	   Sapir, however was not in need of a home. He already has one on
another West Bank settlement. He has moved into the trailer
``partly as a protest,'' he said, against the new peace agreement.
``Our physical presence here gives a feeling of greater security
and permanence,'' he said.
	   Sapir had already decorated the walls of his trailer with framed
photographs of orchids and West Bank landscapes. Lace curtains had
been hung on the window-frames. ``It's my wife,'' he said. ``She
tries to create the atmosphere of a home no matter how rough it
is.''
	   At Alon Shvut and Maale Michmash, Israeli police ordered the
settlers to remove mechanical diggers which were leveling the
ground, but made no attempt to evict the settlers.
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the presence of
the new mobile homes were ``a flagrant violation'' of the Wye
Plantation accord.
	   ``He can't have both settlements and peace,'' Erekat said.

3,000 Muslims attend communal harmony fest; Christians stay away
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES spelling of el-Kusheh to conform to style &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOHAG, Egypt (AP) _ About 3,000 Muslims attended Tuesday a
song-and-poetry festival in southern Egypt but only a handful of
Coptic Christians showed up for the event that was called to
bolster Muslim-Christian unity.
	   The government-organized festival comes nearly two weeks after
reports that security forces jailed and tortured hundreds of Copts
while investigating an Aug. 14 murder case in al-Kusheh town, 55
kilometers (35 miles) south of Sohag.
	   Egyptian human rights groups accused policemen of rounding up
1,200 Copts in al-Kusheh, a predominantly Christian town. No
Muslims were arrested at the time.
	   The area is 400 kilometers (245 miles) south of Egypt's capital,
Cairo.
	   The al-Kusheh murder victims were Copts and human right workers
have said that police wanted to find Christian suspects quickly in
order to prevent Muslim-Copt clashes. The government denied the
charges.
	   It was not clear whether the low turnout at the song fest was
because of the deep-seated mistrust among Copts for
government-organized functions or because they were simply unaware
of the event.
	   Christian community leaders were not immediately available for
comment.
	   The reports of alleged police brutality in al-Kusheh have
embarrassed Egyptian officials, already smarting from foreign
criticism about alleged persecution of the country's Christian
minority, who are about 10 million of the country's 60 million
people.
	   News of the al-Kusheh incident was spread by the town's Bishop
Wisa and Archbishop Antonious, who were not invited for the song
fest.
	   Both men were arrested on Oct. 15, but were released the same
day after signing pledges to stop what police called
``incitement.''
	   On Tuesday, singers sang of love for Egypt and poets stressed
tolerance among religions. In a speech, Sohag province Gov. Ahmed
Bakr described Wisa as ``a fanatic.''
	   He also blamed Wisa for contacting churches abroad ``to pressure
Egypt by showing that there is religious persecution of Copts.''
	   Bakr also complained that he received four letters from
institutions in the Netherlands, Canada and Australia blaming him
for the violence in al-Kusheh. He did not name any of these
organizations.
	   Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif told Saudi Asharq
al-Awsat daily newspaper on Tuesday that reports of human rights
abuses were a conspiracy aimed at marring Egypt's reputation.
	   Two Egyptian lawyers have sued London's Sunday Telegraph, which
called al-Kusheh's security sweep a government crackdown on
Christians.

Former Nigerian military leader to seek presidential nomination
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A former military ruler announced Tuesday
that he will seek the presidential nomination of one of Nigeria's
major political parties.
	   ``I have decided to offer full-term service, to serve our
country again,'' said Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, speaking to about 300
supporters at his farm in the southwestern town of Otta.
	   Obasanjo will seek the nomination of the Peoples Democratic
Party which, like most Nigerian parties, remains largely undefined
politically and has only a vague platform.
	   Many human rights activists have criticized Obasanjo's
presidential ambitions, saying that a campaign by a former soldier
would dilute the complete transfer of power from Nigeria's
long-ruling military to civilians.
	   For others, his campaign reflects the continued rule of
old-style Nigerian politicians, many of whom worked with various
military rulers.
	   ``Obasanjo stands for the older generation,'' said Olisa
Agbakoba, a leading human rights lawyer. ``We do not just want
power to shift from the north of Nigeria to the south, we are also
canvassing a generational shift.''
	   Northerners, who make up the majority of Nigeria's military,
have long ruled this West African country.
	   Obasanjo, who came to power in 1976 after a failed coup attempt
took the life of military leader Gen. Murtala Muhammed,
relinquished power and retired in 1979.
	   He was arrested in 1995 in connection with an alleged coup plot,
but was freed by Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   Abubakar, who came to power in June after the death of dictator
Gen. Sani Abacha, has promised free elections and a transition to
democratic rule next May.
	   Nigeria's military has ruled the country for all but 10 years
since independence in 1960.

Ukrainian debtors immune to unusual government pressure tactics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrainian prime minister's desperate
pressure tactics on reluctant debtors _ including locking
executives in a Cabinet room _ have persuaded just seven companies
to pay off their debts, officials said Tuesday.
	   The companies were among more than 50 that promised to pay back
foreign credits they obtained with state guarantees when Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko locked their top executives in a room
in September, deputy premier Serhiy Tyhypko told a closed-door
government meeting Tuesday.
	   According to official figures, Ukrainian companies have received
about dlrs 2.5 billion in government-backed foreign credits, of
which dlrs 1.1 billion remained to be paid back as of Oct. 1.
	   The companies owe the government nearly dlrs 672 million for
money spent by the authorities to cover their debt obligations,
Tyhypko was quoted independent UNIAN news agency as saying.
	   In an unorthodox but now familiar threat, Pustovoitenko said
Tuesday he would again hold debtor company executives in a Cabinet
room until they sign new repayment agreements. He also threatened
to have many of them fired.
	   In August, the premier launched a crackdown on companies and
regional institutions owing large sums to the budget and the
state-run Pension Fund. He kept their chief executives in a Kiev
building for a while, then brought some to a tent camp for
purported civil defense training.
	   As part of his desperate crusade to collect tax payments,
Pustovoitenko also has set up special tax posts at the offices of
debtor companies, seized thousands of cars from them and launched
dozens of criminal and bankruptcy cases.
	   Pustovoitenko's crackdown has yielded only a small fraction of
the debts so far, and about 105,000 debtor companies still owe more
than 8 billion hryvna (dlrs 2.35 billion at the current exchange
rate) to the federal and regional governments.
	   Ukraine's government is chronically short of cash and faces a
mounting foreign and domestic debt itself. The problems have been
aggravated by the economic turmoil in neighboring Russia, which has
pushed down Ukraine's hryvna currency and scared investors away.
	   Speaking at the session Tuesday, Finance Minister Ihor Mytyukov
said the government should be more orderly in seizing deposits from
debtor companies and expand the mechanism of arresting their hard
currency accounts, UNIAN reported.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Bologna beat Slavia Prague 2-0
with late-game goals in their second-round second-leg UEFA Cup
match in Prague Tuesday, advancing to the third round on a 4-1
aggregate.
	   Braving cold weather at Strahov stadium, Bologna seemed to be
under Slavia's spell for the first 10 minutes of play. But for the
rest of the first half, the Italians were more active, narrowly
missing on several chances to score.
	   In the 33rd minute, Lubos Kozel deflected a ball heading into
Slavia's empty goal.
	   Slavia's biggest chance came in the penultimate minute of the
first half when Pavel Horvath hit the post.
	   For most of the second half, Slavia again was playing well, but
missed several clear chances to score.
	   The first goal came in the 80th minute, when Bologna's Giuseppe
Signori scored from a precise pass from Amedeo Mangone.
	   Massimo Cappioli then scored only six minutes later.
	   Mangone received yellow card in the match and will not be
playing in the first leg of the next round.
	   The match was played at Prague's Strahov stadium before a crowd
of some 10,000.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli man suspected of bludgeoning to
death an elderly Palestinian farmer in the West Bank was ordered
held for six days after surrendering to authorities, police said
Tuesday.
	   The suspect, 35 year old Gur Hamel, had been on the run since
the killing of Mohammed Zalout, whose body was found Oct. 26 near
the Jewish settlement of Itamar where Gur lived from time to time.
	   Police initially said Zalout, 65, had been killed to avenge the
slaying of an Israeli security guard hours earlier in the West Bank
city of Hebron. Police received an anonymous phone call at the time
from a man speaking in Hebrew who said the two slayings were
linked.
	   Police now believe, after an investigation, that Zalout was
killed before the Israeli, Daniel Vargas. There was no indication
that Zalout's death was a revenge killing, police spokeswoman Linda
Menuhin said today.
	   Israeli radio reports have quoted Itamar settlers as saying that
Hamel was an extremist whose request to become a permanent resident
of Itamar was turned down.
	   Police said that Hamel was familiar to them in the past for
having drawn defamatory slogans against former left-wing prime
ministers Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin. He spent last July
hospitalized in a mental institution, police said.
	   On Monday, Hamel surrendered to Israeli police, with legislator
Benny Elon of the far-right Moledet Party serving as mediator.
	   A magistrate ordered Hamel held for six days for questioning and
to reconstruct the killing, Menuhin said. He brought to a Jerusalem
prison later Tuesday.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ At least one person was killed and
several injured when soldiers opened fire Tuesday on a section of
the crowd at a local soccer game, witnesses said.
	   The game between Kinshasa clubs Sportive Vita and Daring Club
Motema Pembe was delayed for eight minutes while soldiers cleared
out the wounded and other fans fled.
	   ``In the confusion there, we don't know exactly what happened,''
said a local journalist Pok a Mes Kileba.
	   Kileba, who witnessed the shooting, said it was not clear what
sparked the incident or who the victims were.
	   The game was a playoff match for the national league
championships.
	   Congo's military has instituted a crackdown since civil war
broke out in early August and the city is often tense.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Victims of Gen. Augusto Pinochet's rule told
Tuesday of murder, mysterious disappearances and brutal blackmail
in emotional testimony they hope will help persuade Britain's
highest court to uphold the former Chilean dictator's arrest on a
Spanish warrant.
	   In Madrid, a formal extradition warrant was filed Tuesday with
the Justice Ministry by the Spanish judge whose detention order
instigated Pinochet's arrest Oct. 16 in a London hospital.
	   France and Switzerland also want the 82-year-old general, and
Chilean exiles in Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Germany have filed
criminal complaints they hope will lead to extradition.
	   But legal experts say that if Pinochet wins in the House of
Lords, he likely would be free to fly home in a special jet waiting
at an air base north of London.
	   The two-day appeal against a High Court ruling last week that
quashed the arrest starts Wednesday before five judges, who were
expected to reserve judgment.
	   The High Court ruled that Pinochet's status as a foreign former
head of state gave him immunity from prosecution for acts performed
in the 17 years after he seized power from the leftist government
of President Salvador Allende.
	   In Chile, Senate President Andres Zaldivar ordered police to
clear the public galleries as Pinochet supporters and opponents
yelled at each other and appeared close to clashing during a
special Senate session. Afterward, the two groups scuffled outside
the Congress building in the port city of Valparaiso.
	   Also, a coalition of center-left parties that support Chilean
President Eduardo Frei appointed a legal panel to examine the
possibility of Pinochet standing trial in Chile. As a
senator-for-life and under laws he initiated, Pinochet has so far
had immunity from prosecution there.

Russia urges peaceful solution in Iraq, cooperation from Saddam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia again called Tuesday for a peaceful
solution to the Iraqi crisis, and urged Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to continue their work.
	   ``We think that the international community has an adequate
range of political and diplomatic means to succeed in a peaceful
outcome,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin was quoted
as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Foreign Ministry also warned Saddam that economic sanctions
against Iraq would only be lifted if he allows U.N. weapons
inspectors to complete their work.
	   Rakhmanin's comments came on the same day that Russia's
ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky proclaimed that Saddam
wanted a timetable for lifting U.N. sanctions before he will let
inspections resume.
	   ``He would like to have information when the blockade (will be)
eliminated,'' said Zhirinovsky said after meeting with Saddam in
Iraq on Tuesday. ``When? This year, next year, next century?''
	   The inspectors are to certify that Iraq has complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq, is
generally sympathetic to the Arab nation and has called for an
early lifting of the sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990.

Eleven convicted of genocide sentenced to life in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ A court in southeastern Rwanda has
convicted 11 people of crimes of genocide and sentenced them to
life in prison, the private Swiss news agency Hirondelle reported
Tuesday.
	   The agency said the court in Nyamata delivered its verdict
Monday in the cases of 48 people. In addition to the 11 sentenced
to life in prison, 11 were declared innocent of all charges and the
remaining 26 were convicted on lesser charges and sentenced to 12
years in prison.
	   Rwandan courts have imposed the death sentence on several dozen
people in connection with the 1994 genocide in which at least half
a million people _ minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus _
were killed in the slaughter organized by the extremist Hutu
government.
	   The government has executed 22 people.
	   There are 136,000 people in prison awaiting trial in connection
with the genocide. Observers estimate it would take more than 50
years to try them all.
	   Last month Justice Minister Faustin Nteziryayo said some 10,000
detainees whose dossiers contained nothing more than their names
and other personal information would be released.
	   Hirondelle said the government was going to hold meetings at the
local level to prepare people for the releases for which no date
has been made public.

Brian Lara, Carl Hooper pull out of South Africa tour citing fees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with statement from players union,
meeting in London with union members, tour ending February. No
pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ West Indies captain Brian Lara and
vice captain Carl Hooper are unhappy with fees for a tour of South
Africa and headed for London instead of Africa, officials said
Tuesday.
	   The West Indies Cricket Board said it has called an emergency
meeting Wednesday at its headquarters on the Caribbean island of
Antigua, and invited Lara and Hooper.
	   The West Indies Players' Association said the board had turned
down its request for a meeting in London. Instead Lara, vice
president of the association, and Hooper, the players'
representative, would meet with association president Courtney
Walsh and other team members currently in the British capital, the
players' union said in Barbados.
	   The WICB statement said board president Pat Rousseau understood
the rest of the team was on its way to South Africa from Bangladesh
_ where it lost to South Africa in Sunday's finals of the Wills
International Cup.
	   A board statement said that Lara and Hooper ``have not gone on
to South Africa from Bangladesh as planned. They have voiced
concern over the fees for the tour of South Africa and have instead
gone to England.''
	   It quoted Rousseau as saying the fees had been agreed with the
players' association and ``that the players' action was therefore
particularly surprising and went against the instructions issued in
writing by the manager, Clive Lloyd.''
	   The players association said it had made the board an offer on
fees that was accepted, ``but there are issues surrounding the
acceptance with which the WIPA is not in agreement.''
	   It gave no details.
	   It said the association hoped to resolve the issue with the
board and that the players wanted to reaffirm ``their keenness to
take part in the upcoming series.''
	   Lara, the world record holder for runs in a test innings, is no
stranger to controversy. The Trinidadian had been fined or warned
by the WICB for breaching its code of discipline four times in the
three years before he was named captain in January.
	   In June, Warwickshire county cricket officials fined Lara 2,000
pounds (dlrs 3,260) for arriving too late to lead his English team
in a crucial league match. It was the second time in the season
that Lara had been delayed in the West Indies after missing his
flight back to England.
	   The South Africa tour only starts Nov. 10 with a one-day warmup
match, but players were expected to exercise until then to prepare
for the first full series between the two teams _ five tests and
seven one-day internationals ending in February.
	   Their only previous test was at London's Kensington Oval in
1992. The West Indies won the test, which was South Africa's first
since it was readmitted to international cricket following its ban
due to apartheid.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Adil Mattar scored in the 83rd minute to
give the United Arab Emirates a 3-2 victory Tuesday over Oman in
the six-nation Gulf Cup.
	   It was UAE's second victory in as many matches and moved it to
the top of the standings with six points.
	   UAE took the lead in the 37th minute on a goal by Adil Mohammed
and Ali Thani doubled in the 57th.
	   Oman's Majdi Shaban pulled Oman even, scoring a goal from the
edge of the penalty area in the 75th and a later penalty after
being fouled.
	   Though the Omani team had a better attack they could not finish.
	   Mattar settled the ball with a header and then scored from the
right.

Voyage to Caspian Sea inspires Cousteau's successor

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ After a voyage to the depths of the polluted
Caspian Sea, the heir to Jacques Cousteau's legacy said Tuesday he
wants to build on that legacy by cleaning up the landlocked body of
water, home to most of the world's sturgeon.
	   ``The work of Capt. Cousteau must not stop,'' said New Zealand
yachtsman Sir Peter Blake.
	   ``We must build on it rather than diminish it because it will be
for the benefit of the world,'' he told a news conference at UNESCO
headquarters in Paris.
	   Sitting beside Blake, Cousteau's widow, Francine, said the
recent Caspian expedition was unprecedented, and could help
civilization ``millions of years into the future.''
	   The Caspian laps the shores of Iran and the former Soviet
republics of Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
	   Once the exclusive preserve of the Soviets and Iran, it is now
threatened by overfishing _ especially by gangs trafficking in
caviar. It is also being suffocated by nitrates, sulphur, fossil
fuels and hydrocarbons due to its booming oil industry.
	   Blake said man-made barriers are preventing sturgeon from
getting upstream to spawn, and that harmful fertilizers are flowing
down Russia's Volga River into the sea.
	   ``There's an urgent need for a cleanup,'' Blake said. ``Other
seas are bigger and accept rubbish put into them. But the Caspian
cannot swallow as much, and that's where things start to go
wrong.''
	   The voyage in the Cousteau Society's 35-meter-long (115.5-foot)
Alcyone ship is the first in 50 years by a foreign exploration ship
in the Caspian, said officials of UNESCO, or the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which is
supporting the Caspian mission.
	   Cousteau died in June 1996 in Paris at the age of 87. Blake, 50,
was chosen by the Cousteau Society last year to head the
organization.
	   The New Zealander has won the world's most prestigious yachting
races, including The America's Cup, the Whitbread, and the Jules
Verne trophy.
	   Knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in 1995, he's said to
have hit it off with Cousteau when the two met in 1996 for the
first time. He will devote himself fully to the group as of next
year.
	   ``I didn't know much before about the Caspian _ but what a
fascinating journey and place!'' he enthused Tuesday.
	   He said that in Russia, Cousteau's TV series ``The Undersea
World of Jacques Cousteau'' is currently showing, meaning the crew
was treated ``like celebrities.''
	   Mrs. Cousteau said the group hoped to build consensus between
various governments around the Caspian on measures to counteract
the environmental threats it faces.
	   On a wider scale, she has launched a ``Water for Peace''
project, aimed at preventing wars between countries over access to
water, by teaching countries about preservation.
	   The Caspian expedition has cost 4.5 million francs (dlrs
750,000).

 &UR; Turkish comedian goes on hunger strike to protest censorship

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's leading comedian went on a hunger
strike Tuesday, taking a stand against a censorship law that let
the government order a one-day blackout for a TV station that aired
his show.
	   Turkey's broadcasting board ordered Kanal D off the air because
of a skit in which Levent Kirca mocked Women and Family Affairs
Minister Isilay Saygin for publicly declaring last month that she
remained a virgin at 52.
	   ``The board cannot be expected to tolerate programs involving
personal insults and so much violence or sexuality that could hurt
children,'' board chief Kutlu Savas said Tuesday.
	   Kirca, who has been praised for tackling such touchy matters as
corruption, military coups and torture for over a decade, insisted
the ban was unjust.
	   ``This censorship law must change; we expect this from
Parliament,'' Kirca said outside his theater in downtown Istanbul
as he began the hunger strike. ``I will keep this up until I
collapse.''
	   ``I have the backing of the people,'' Kirca declared, surrounded
by scores of supporters.
	   An elderly lady pleaded with him to call off the hunger strike.
``We love you so much,'' she said.
	   In one popular skit, Kirca, wearing a general's uniform
decorated with soda bottle tops for medals, storms a TV station to
announce he was staging a military coup _ only to have the
declaration continuously interrupted by commercial breaks. The
military has staged three coups in Turkey over the past four
decades.
	   The board, which is empowered to black out stations it deems
politically biased, slanderous or offensive, has not yet said when
the 24-hour shutdown will take place.
	   In the skit that got him punished, Kirca asks an actress playing
Saygin why she is in support of virginity tests.
	   She replied she wasn't just in favor of the tests _ she thought
women should wear some kind of device that would let state
controllers ``check what they have done or not done.''
	   The skit put the issue of forced virginity tests under the
spotlight again.
	   Saygin raised something of a storm this year when she defended
virginity tests for girls in state homes and orphanages. The tests
have pushed some state wards to suicide.
	   Meanwhile, Saygin's lawyer Hulya Peksirin said Tuesday that the
minister was seeking dlrs 10,500 compensation from a married man
for making fun of her by publicly offering her marriage.
	   Virginity is highly valued in conservative Turkish society. The
board and some viewers found that the sketch by Kirca offended
Turkish family values under which an unmarried woman is expected to
be a virgin, no matter her age.

Publisher defends Holocaust memoirs, but doubter sees vindication
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Holocaust Book &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The publisher of a book of Holocaust memoirs said
Tuesday it was looking for written proof from challengers that the
award-winning autobiography is phony, but a key doubter said he
felt vindicated.
	   The book, ``Fragments'' by Binjamin Wilkomirski, relates how a
Swiss man claiming he is a Latvian Jew survived Nazi concentration
camps as a small boy.
	   Since it first appeared under the German title ``Bruchstuecke''
in 1994, the book has been a best-seller and has won awards from
Jewish organizations in a number of countries. It has been
translated into 12 languages.
	   But questions have increasingly been raised about whether
Wilkomirski's book was a true personal account. The latest
challenge was in The New York Times on Tuesday, which cited ``an
international debate about the authenticity of the memoir.''
	   Daniel Ganzfried, a Swiss author who has taking a leading role
in questioning the authenticity, said Tuesday he felt ``the book is
getting thinner and thinner.''
	   He said Wilkomirski, who also has been challenged by the French
daily Le Monde, had withdrawn his assertion that Swiss authorities
had falsified his birth and other records.
	   ``He's taking back all factual details that one can research,''
Ganzfried said. ``I feel I've been proved right.''
	   The Associated Press left a message on the author's answering
machine, but the call was not immediately returned. His agent in
Zurich also refused to comment.
	   Thomas Sparr, chief of the Jewish division of the Suhrkamp
Verlag publishing house based in Frankfurt, Germany, said the firm
had carefully checked doubts that had been raised about the book.
	   ``Of course, in this situation we need documents, witness
statements, proof, that Binjamin Wilkomirski was in Switzerland
between 1941 and 1946,'' Sparr told the AP.
	   Suhrkamp said such accounts by children survivors of the
Holocaust have been challenged before.
	   The book says it is an account of the first years of
Wilkomirski's life, from 1939 to 1948. He says he saw his father
beaten to death and being imprisoned at age 3 or 4 in a
concentration camp in Poland, eventually spending time in two
camps. He says the details of his early years were revealed through
therapy.
	   But Ganzfried says Binjamin Wilkomirski never was in the
concentration camps as a boy.
	   He said the account was the invention of Swiss clarinetist Bruno
Doessekker, who was born Bruno Grosjean in 1941 to an unmarried
Swiss Protestant woman.
	   He was adopted by a couple named Doessekker, in a Zurich suburb,
before he entered school in 1947, added Ganzfried.
	   Ganzfried, whose own father survived Ausschwitz, has written a
novel about the Holocaust. He said what he would like to see is for
``Fragments'' to be withdrawn and reissued as a novel.
	   He said he initially interviewed Doessekker for seven hours and
that one of the questions he asked was whether he was circumcise.
	   ``He told me yes, but then I asked his girlfriend and his
ex-wife and they independently told me no.''

Russian legislator: Saddam wants timetable on sanctions

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein wants a
timetable for the lifting of U.N. sanctions before he will let U.N.
weapons inspections resume, a visiting Russian legislator said
Tuesday.
	   Ultranationist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky told reporters after
two hours of talks with Saddam that the Iraqi president saw ``no
problem'' with monitoring to confirm Iraq has dismantled its
weapons of mass destruction. That is a condition for the lifting of
sanctions, imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``But he would like to have information when the blockade (will
be) eliminated,'' Zhirinovsky said. ``When? This year, next year,
next century?'' said the legislator, a regular visitor to Iraq who
has good relations with Saddam.
	   Saddam has not spoken publicly since the government announced
Saturday it was halting dealings with the U.N. Special Commission,
which oversees weapons inspections, until the United Nations
pledged to begin easing or lifting the trade sanctions.
	   The stance has put Iraq on a collision course with the U.N.
Security Council, which termed the action a ``flagrant violation''
of U.N. resolutions.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair suggested that military force was an option. U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen was headed to the Gulf to consult with U.S.
allies in the region.
	   Zhirinovsky said of Saddam that ``he would like peace.'' But he
added: ``Iraq made everything to fulfill all resolutions of the
United Nations, but the United Nations doesn't make anything for
Iraq.''
	   The Security Council says it will not lift the sanctions, which
limit the sale of oil and ban most other financial dealings with
Iraq, until inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
nonconventional weapons.
	   Iraq accuses the Special Commission, under Australian Richard
Butler, of working on behalf of the United States to prolong the
sanctions.
	   Zhirinovsky quoted Saddam as saying the Special Commission
needed to be restructured to make it ``more objective.'' The Iraqi
leader suggested Butler should be replaced by someone from China,
Russia or France, Zhirinovsky said.
	   The three countries are the most willing members of the Security
Council to consider easing the sanctions, but it appeared Tuesday
that their patience was wearing thin.
	   France recalled its representative in Baghdad, Yves Aubin de la
Messuzie, for consultations, and warned Iraq that its decision will
lead to its ``total isolation.''
	   ``France does not understand this attitude,'' Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said in a letter to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz. ``There should be no mistake about the state of mind of
the Security Council,'' he said.
	   China also urged Iraq to end the standoff and said cooperation
would be the quickest way to end the sanctions. At the same time,
the Security Council should fairly evaluate the inspection work so
far and ``gradually lift the sanctions,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao said.

Israel urges 50-year wait in Pope Pius XII beatification
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Israel's ambassador to the Vatican stepped into a
longtime dispute between Jews and the church Tuesday, urging the
Vatican to wait 50 years before moving ahead with any plan to
beatify Pius XII, the World War II pope.
	   Ambassador Aharon Lopez said the moratorium would give time for
all relevant documents in the Vatican archives to be made public
and allow the healing of ``wounds still open'' from the Holocaust.
	   Pius, pope from 1939 until his death in 1958, has been accused
by Jews and others of remaining silent about the Nazi holocaust.
	   In March, Pope John Paul II defended Pius against such
accusations, calling him a ``great pope.''
	   The case for possible beatification is now under study, but the
Vatican recently denied reports that it had already decided to
beatify him, together with Popes John XXIII and Paul VI, in 2000,
when the Vatican marks the start of Christianity's third
millennium. Beatification is the last step before possible
sainthood.
	   Lopez acknowledged that beatifications were the church's
business and said he was not passing judgment on Pius, but was
speaking out because of the ``controversy'' surrounding Pius.
	   ``A moratorium should be welcome,'' the ambassador said.
	   A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, said in response
that the beatification process ``would take its due course.''
	   Lopez made his foray on Pius during a news conference after
parrying questions about Israel's reaction to statements by the
Vatican's foreign minister during a visit to Jerusalem last week.
	   Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran said East Jerusalem was ``illegally
occupied'' by the Israelis and asked for international guarantees
for sites considered holy by Christian, Jews and Muslims.
	   Israel considers all of Jerusalem, including the Arab east which
it took over in the 1967 war, its eternal capital and has shown no
inclination to agree to any special statute.

Government approves cutting military service to 12 months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The government approved on Tuesday a draft
law reducing compulsory military service from 15 to 12 months, as
part of the army's adjustment to the requirements of NATO, which
Poland is to join in April.
	   Military service will be put off for undergraduates and
part-time students alike. But part-timers will have to prove
regularly that they are continuing studies. The requirement is to
eliminate a frequent practice of registering with a university only
to avoid the service.
	   The parliament and President Aleksander Kwasniewski still need
to approve the bill.
	   In 1995, a decision by the defense minister reduced the
communist-era 18 months' obligatory service, down to 15 months.
	   Under a reform urged by NATO, Poland is cutting troop strength
from 241,000 to 160,000-180,000, while career soldiers are to make
up about half of the force.
	   A survey commissioned by the Rzeczpospolita newspaper April 2-7
showed that 67 percent of adult Poles favor a fully professional
army and 27 percent favor the current obligatory conscription
system. The survey of 1,000 adults had a margin of error of three
percentage points.

British papers say Tyson to fight Botha on Jan. 16 in Vegas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Finkel comment, background on assault case.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mike Tyson will make his comeback against South
Africa's Francois Botha in Las Vegas on Jan. 16, two British
newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   The Sun and The Independent said Tyson has signed a contract for
the fight with the promoters America Presents, who are expected to
announce details later Tuesday in New York.
	   The Independent said the fight would be held at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas.
	   The fight would mark Tyson's first appearance in the ring since
his suspension 15 months ago for biting Evander Holyfield's ears
during their world title fight.
	   Tyson's adviser, Shelly Finkel, said the deal had not been
finalized.
	   ``Our plan is for him to fight in January, (but) Mike has not
concluded a deal to fight anybody in January,'' Finkel said Tuesday
in New York
	   Tyson's boxing license was restored last month by the Nevada
State Athletic Commission.
	   Botha is the No. 1 contender for Holyfield's IBF title.
Holyfield also holds the WBA crown.
	   Botha has lost only once in 37 fights, stopped in the 12th round
by Michael Moorder in an IBF title challenge two years ago.
	   The Sun said Germany's Axel Schultz had signed a contract to
fight Tyson first, but he was deemed unacceptable by Showtime, the
cable company which features Tyson's fights.
	   The Sun and Independent said Botha is being handled by British
fight promoter Frank Warren.
	   A spokesman for Warren would not confirm the Tyson-Botha fight
Tuesday, saying only that Warren's company is ``advising'' Botha
until January.
	   Tyson faces a Dec. 1 trial on misdemeanor assault charges
stemming from a traffic accident Aug. 31 in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
in suburban Washington.

U.S., Britain say force not ruled out against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Foreign Secretary Robin Cook &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain and the United States warned Tuesday that
they have not ruled out the use of force if Iraq fails to back down
in its latest confrontation over U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and his British counterpart
George Roberston, meeting briefly in London, issued a statement
calling the two countries in ``complete agreement about the gravity
of the situation.''
	   On Saturday, Iraq banned U.N. weapons inspection teams from
working in the country after the U.N. Security Council again
refused to lift economic sanctions. The Security Council demanded
that Iraq reverse the ban.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has to realize that full compliance with the
U.N. is the only way open to Iraq to achieve the lifting of
sanctions,'' the statement from Cohen and Robertson said.
	   It added that all options remained on the table, including the
use of force, to persuade Saddam.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, in a statement to
Parliament on Tuesday, said Saddam ``appears to be gambling that
the world will grow weary of his constant evasion and his repeated
confrontation. ... We must remain ready and resolute to prove him
wrong.''
	   ``We want to find a diplomatic solution, but we have always made
clear that all options remain open,'' he said.

Russia discusses U.S. food aid and imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While negotiating for U.S. food aid, Russia also
wants to keep buying U.S. food imports and use some of the revenues
to support domestic farmers, a top official said Tuesday.
	   A U.S. delegation is in Moscow this week to discuss possible
food aid for Russia. But no decision was expected for at least
another day, as the Americans asked for a ``timeout'' Tuesday to
consider the situation, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik
said.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Michael Hurley said no information was
available yet on the type or size of the possible aid package.
	   Meanwhile, Russia also wants to keep food imports at the level
of the past two years _ when imports made up about half of food in
Russia's stores _ and use some of the revenues to ``help stabilize
the Russian agrarian sector,'' Kulik was quoted as saying by the
Interfax news agency.
	   Russia's economic crisis and an ensuing drop in imports, which
came on top of the worst grain harvest in 40 years, have led to
serious concerns about possible winter food shortages.
	   Russian Agriculture and Food Minister Viktor Semyonov said last
week that 22 of Russia's 89 regions suffer ``acute shortages of
grain.''
	   Plenty of food has remained in most stores so far.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 9 grasf with with statement from Albanian
guerrillas. Pick up 6th graf pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The number of ethnic Albanian
refugees living in the open in Kosovo province has dropped
significantly, U.N. officials said Tuesday _ a good sign as the
shuttle diplomacy that aims to end the conflict moves into a second
round.
	   A week after NATO's decision not to strike Yugoslavia, U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill met with ethnic Albanian representatives
Tuesday to discuss a draft agreement on Kosovo's future.
	   After the meeting in the provincial capital of Pristina, Hill
and ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova toured a war-devastated
area southwest of the city _ a first-time move reflecting the
relative freedom of movement in areas that for months were unsafe
because of Serb-ethnic Albanian violence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 300,000
others forced from their homes since Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants in
February. The rebels are fighting for Kosovo's independence from
Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   Bowing to international pressure to halt his crackdown on the
secessionist province, Milosevic agreed last month to reduce the
presence of his forces to the level before the fighting. As part of
an Oct. 12 agreement, Milosevic pledged to order troops back to
their barracks and dismantle police barricades, allowing people to
return safely.
	   But the reduction was not enough for the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which has spearheaded the fight to wrest the mostly ethnic Albanian
province away from Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
	   Speaking for the ethnic Albanian guerrillas, Adem Demaci told
reporters that both the figure of 15,000 Yugoslav army soldiers and
10,000 Serb policemen to be allowed to stay on is unacceptable.
	   But Demaci said no more than 6,000 soldiers and 2,500 police
should be allowed to stay.
	   ``Displaced people are afraid to return home and are losing
valuable time for repairing their damaged houses ahead of the
coming winter,'' he said.

Georgia offers pardon to revolt leader if he surrenders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia's chief military prosecutor
Tuesday offered a possible pardon to the fugitive leader of a
one-day revolt against President Eduard Shevardnadze if he turns
himself in.
	   Thirty-four people have been arrested for allegedly instigating
the mutiny last month. But the leader, Akaky Eliava, and a few of
his men remain at large.
	   ``If Eliava and his people who are now in hiding will
voluntarily give themselves in, honestly repent, give honest
evidence _ this will naturally serve as extenuating circumstances
and will be taken into account by the court,'' chief military
prosecutor Badri Bitsadze said during a national television
appearance.
	   ``I don't rule out that the president will consider the question
of pardon for them,'' Bitsadze said.
	   Prosecutor General Dhzamlet Babilashvili also went on national
television Tuesday to say that the government was ready for talks
with Eliava and his men.
	   Eliava is a military commander who supported the late Georgian
president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it gained independence in
1991 with the Soviet collapse, was ousted in early 1992 and fought
a short war in a bid to return to power. He died under mysterious
circumstances in 1994. His followers remain bitterly opposed to
Shevardnadze.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Senior U.S. diplomats faced another
difficult meeting Tuesday when they arrived in the Rwandan capital
on a mission to convice Rwanda to disengage from the conflict in
neighboring Congo.
	   Fresh from a frosty welcome in Zimbabwe and a two-hour meeting
with President Robert Mugabe, Susan Rice, the top State Department
official dealing with Africa, said tersely that the main thing was
to preserve the territorial integrity of Congo.
	   The three-month rebellion against Congolese President Laurent
Kabila has already embroiled troops from as many as eight
countries, including Rwanda, and threatens to escalate.
	   Rice told reporters after meeting with Mugabe that it was too
early to tell whether her shuttle through seven African capitals
had advanced the prospects for peace.
	   ``I think that will have to be determined in the future,'' Rice
told reporters before leaving for Kigali.
	   Mugabe kept Rice, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for
African affairs, waiting for several hours before receiving her.
Mugabe has deployed 6,000 troops to Congo to support its president,
Laurent Kabila, against rebels. Angola and Namibia have also sent
troops to aid Kabila.
	   Rice's seven-nation African trip has taken her to Angola, Congo,
South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. She said she wanted to ``listen
to the perspectives of all sides.''
	   The United States voiced its concern over the escalation of the
conflict and ``steps must be taken to prevent another genocide in
the region,'' Rice said, referring to the slaughter by Hutus of
500,000 people in Rwanda, neighboring Congo, in 1994. The victims
were mainly Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   Those killings ended when Tutsi-led rebels won power in Rwanda
in July 1994. Hutu rebels used eastern Congo to regroup and launch
cross-border attacks into Rwanda.
	   Rwanda, which backs the rebels with troops and arms, accuses
Kabila of hating Tutsis and failing to rid the border of the former
Hutu soldiers and militias responsible for the 1994 genocide.
	   ``We have not come with any grand American prescription,'' Rice
said. ``There is still a great deal of work to be done.''
	   Kabila and Mugabe have sharply criticized U.S. efforts to broker
a Congo peace agreement, arguing that Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
deployed troops to repel an invasion by rebels backed by Rwandan
and Ugandan troops.
	   Mugabe has described U.S. calls for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from Congo as ``absolutely abominable'' and demanded Rwanda
and Uganda withdraw first, saying that would lead to the collapse
of the rebel campaign and bring peace.
	   Rice said she was informed of reports Angola planned to withdraw
some troops from the allied force backing Kabila, ``but I have no
information on that.''
	   During her three-day visit to Angola last week, Rice failed to
see Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. He was due to meet
her just before she left, but then he called a Cabinet meeting for
the same time.
	   Uganda acknowledges it has troops in Congo, but says they are
there to strike at Congo-based Ugandan rebels.
	   Rice, accompanied by President Clinton's special assistant,
Gayle Smith, and his special envoy to the Great Lakes region,
Howard Wolpe, was scheduled to hold talks in Rwanda with President
Pasteur Bizimungu and Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, who is the vice
president, minister of defense and the chief architect of Rwanda's
policy in Congo.
	   The delegation then travels to Uganda.

Congo soldiers open fire on soccer crowd, killing one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ At least one person was killed and
several injured when soldiers opened fire Tuesday on a section of
the crowd at a local soccer game, witnesses said.
	   The game between Kinshasa clubs Sportive Vita and Daring Club
Motema Pembe was delayed for eight minutes while soldiers cleared
out the wounded and other fans fled.
	   ``In the confusion there, we don't know exactly what happened,''
said a local journalist Pok a Mes Kileba.
	   Kileba, who witnessed the shooting, said it was not clear what
sparked the incident or who the victims were.
	   The game was a playoff match for the national league
championships.
	   Congo's military has instituted a crackdown since civil war
broke out in early August and the city is often tense.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers attacked Israeli police
Tuesday, throwing eggs and scratching them as policemen arrested a
rabbi in the West Bank city of Hebron for allegedly inciting
against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The founder of Hebron's Jewish settlement, American-born Moshe
Levinger, had refused a police order to show up for questioning
over remarks he made at a funeral last week for a Jewish man shot
to death, apparently by Palestinian assailants.
	   At the funeral, Levinger made a speech lambasting Netanyahu for
signing a peace accord last month in which Israel would transfer
more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Police were forced to break down Levinger's door Tuesday when
they came to arrest him.
	   As the police left the home with Levinger, several settlers who
live within the same compound, threw eggs and rocks and scratched
the policemen. Three officers were lightly injured in the attack,
police said. The settlers also tried to physically block police
vehicles.
	   In 1990, Levinger served three and a half months for killing a
Palestinian shopkeeper in Hebron. He has also served time for
assaulting Arabs and insulting an Israeli soldier. Levinger was one
of two Hebron settlers under investigation for alleged incitement
at the funeral.
	   Security around Netanyahu has been increased for fear of attacks
by Jewish extremists opposed to the latest Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement.
	   The late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a
Jewish militant in 1995 for handing over land to the Palestinians
as part of the Oslo peace accords.

Publisher defends Holocaust memoirs, but doubter sees vindication
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The publisher of a book of Holocaust memoirs said
Tuesday it was looking for written proof from challengers that the
award-winning autobiography is phony, but a key doubter said he
felt vindicated.
	   The book, ``Fragments'' by Binjamin Wilkomirski, relates how a
Swiss man claiming he is a Latvian Jew survived Nazi concentration
camps as a small boy.
	   Since it first appeared under the German title ``Bruchstuecke''
in 1994, the book has been a best-seller and has won awards from
Jewish organizations in a number of countries. It has been
translated into 12 languages.
	   But questions have increasingly been raised about whether
Wilkomirski's book was a true personal account. The latest
challenge was in The New York Times on Tuesday, which cited ``an
international debate about the authenticity of the memoir.''
	   Other challenges to the book include articles in The Boston
Globe and the Swiss weekly Die Weltwoche.
	   Daniel Ganzfried, a Swiss author who has taking a leading role
in questioning the authenticity, said Tuesday he felt ``the book is
getting thinner and thinner.''
	   He said Wilkomirski, who also has been challenged by the French
daily Le Monde, had withdrawn his assertion that Swiss authorities
had falsified his birth and other records.
	   ``He's taking back all factual details that one can research,''
Ganzfried said. ``I feel I've been proved right.''
	   The Associated Press left a message on the author's answering
machine, but the call was not immediately returned. His agent in
Zurich also refused to comment.
	   Thomas Sparr, chief of the Jewish division of the Suhrkamp
Verlag publishing house based in Frankfurt, Germany, said the firm
had carefully checked doubts that had been raised about the book.
	   ``Of course, in this situation we need documents, witness
statements, proof, that Binjamin Wilkomirski was in Switzerland
between 1941 and 1946,'' Sparr told the AP.
	   Suhrkamp said such accounts by children survivors of the
Holocaust have been challenged before.
	   The book says it is an account of the first years of
Wilkomirski's life, from 1939 to 1948. He says he saw his father
beaten to death and being imprisoned at age 3 or 4 in a
concentration camp in Poland, eventually spending time in two
camps. He says the details of his early years were revealed through
therapy.
	   But Ganzfried says Binjamin Wilkomirski never was in the
concentration camps as a boy.
	   He said the account was the invention of Swiss clarinetist Bruno
Doessekker, who was born Bruno Grosjean in 1941 to an unmarried
Swiss Protestant woman.
	   He was adopted by a couple named Doessekker, in a Zurich suburb,
before he entered school in 1947, added Ganzfried.
	   Ganzfried, whose own father survived Ausschwitz, has written a
novel about the Holocaust. He said what he would like to see is for
``Fragments'' to be withdrawn and reissued as a novel.
	   He said he initially interviewed Doessekker for seven hours and
that one of the questions he asked was whether he was circumcise.
	   ``He told me yes, but then I asked his girlfriend and his
ex-wife and they independently told me no.''

Norway's spy catcher writes of life as a double-agent against
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ All he wanted in his get-togethers with
''Charlie'' was to have a few beers and some conversation; what he
got was four harrowing years as a double-agent.
	   In a book being published Wednesday, Svein-Erik Lamark tells of
how he became a key figure in Norway's biggest spy case since the
Cold War.
	   In ''Codename Seagull'', excerpts of which were printed Tuesday
in Norwegian papers, Lamark says his cloak-and-dagger life began in
early 1994 when a Russian diplomat named Igor Chalyi visited his
office.
	   Lamark worked with the Ministry of Municipalities as an expert
on the Barents Sea region, the northern edge of Europe where Norway
and Russia come together _ the only Russia-NATO border. Contact
with Oslo-based Russian officials was part of his job.
	   As Lamark and Chalyi _ later codenamed ``Charlie'' _ shared a
few beers during subsequent meetings, the Norwegian felt a growing
sense of unease.
	   ``If he is a spy, this is a dangerous matter,'' wrote Lamark.
	   In June of that year, a Police Intelligence Service agent _
code-named ``Odd'' _ told Lamark that the agency knew of his
contact with Chalyi and wanted him to be a double agent. Lamark
agreed, and was told to keep any money the Russians gave him.
	   Lamark says Chalyi wanted information about Norway's NATO
policies and about the country's petroleum strategy; Norway is the
world's second-largest oil exporter. Chalyi also wanted him to
recruit spies, Lamark says.
	   According to Lamark, the Russians offered him dlrs 100,000 a
year. He accepted, but feared for his own fate if he were caught
and only ``Odd'' knew of his real role.
	   Lamark wrote that ``Charlie'' was pleased with the information
he had provided, but insisted that the Norwegian meet his
spymasters in Moscow. Lamark briefed an editor at the Verdens Gang
newspaper about his actions in order ''to have my back covered.''
	   At Christmas 1994, Lamark chuckled over two bottles of whiskey
he'd gotten as gifts: one was from Russia's ambassador and the from
Norway's counterintelligence chief.
	   In October 1996, Labor Party leader Thorbjoern Jagland became
prime minister. ``Charlie'' wanted to know who Jagland planned to
appoint as his top political advisors. Lamark read the list, and
was surprised by the Russian's reaction to one name.
	   ``He was wild, like fans after a goal at a soccer match,'' wrote
Lamark. He quoted the Russian as saying ``This is a person we know
well and can work with.''
	   Lamark said he told ``Odd,'' who confirmed that the advisor was
already being watched, but that police could only warn the
government of a suspected Russian spy in their midst. The advisor
is not named in the book.
	   Lamark's secret life ended when Norway expelled five Russian
diplomats for spying on March 12. A day later, Lamark, who had been
ordered to remain silent, went to the news media with his story,
mainly to protect himself.
	   ``It was an exciting and demanding game, which combined acting
with a need for analytical talents, and at the same time there was
always the danger of being found out,'' said Lamark at the time.
	   When reached by The Associated Press at his office on Tuesday,
Lamark refused to discuss the book.

Angola says it will keep troops in Congo until fighting ends
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola plans to keep troops in Congo until
the three-month rebellion in the neighboring country ends, an
official said Tuesday.
	   ``We will leave Congo only when the conflict is over,'' the
official said on condition that he not be identified.
	   The official, close to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, denied
news reports that Angola is preparing for a phased withdrawal from
Congo where it has deployed several thousand troops to support its
president, Laurent Kabila, against rebels.
	   ``Those reports are not true,'' he said.
	   The rebellion by ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of the
Congolese army and opposition politicians has sucked in many of
Congo's neighbors.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad and, reportedly, Sudan have sent
troops to support Kabila against insurgents backed by Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Angolan forces played a key role in blocking a rebel offensive
in southwest Congo, near the border, soon after the conflict
erupted in early August.
	   Angola also helped Kabila oust long-time ruler Mobutu Sese Seko
last year.
	   However, the government is increasingly concerned about the
mounting threat at home from the former Angolan rebel group UNITA,
which recently has attacked remote villages in contravention of the
country's 1994 peace pact.
	   Dos Santos did not meet last week with senior U.S. diplomats who
visited Luanda as part of an African tour to examine ways of ending
the fighting in Congo.
	   Susan Rice, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, warned the Congo war could destabilize the entire southern
half of the African continent.
	   Dos Santos was due to meet Rice just before she left, but then
he called a Cabinet meeting for the same time.

Opposition confirms election winners
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ A center-right conservative coalition
has won weekend parliamentary elections over the former communists
now in government, final vote tallies released Tuesday show.
	   The State Electoral Committee aid the coalition of VMRO-DPMNE
and Democratic Alternative garnered 58 seats in the 120-seat
legislature.
	   Both the incumbents and the election winners place importance in
having good relations with NATO and with Yugoslavia, dominated by
Serbia _ a delicate balancing act considering Western condemnation
of Serbia's harsh crackdown on its ethnic Albanian separatists.
Macedonia has its own large and restive ethnic Albanian community,
nearly a quarter of the country's 2.2 million people.
	   NATO presence has been welcomed by the winners, but there are
doubts about the alliance's possible cross-border action in Kosovo.
	   ``We are against Macedonian territory being used for any kind of
hostile activity against any of the neighboring countries,'' a top
party official of the Democratic Alternative, Aleksandar Dimitrov,
told Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   ``We do not know exactly what obligations to NATO the existing
government has assumed,'' Dimitrov said, adding the winning
coalition has asked the government to put on hold ``such
activities'' until the entire election process is finished and new
parliament and resulting government formed.
	   The coalition has said it would not seek any ``radical changes''
in the existing foreign policy.
	   The Kosovo issue played big in Macedonian elections because of
occasional tensions between the government and the country's ethnic
Albanian community. Unlike in Serbia, however, Macedonia's ethnic
Albanians do not boycott elections and have been included in the
government.
	   Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia six years ago,
the only former republic to have done so peacefully.
	   The defeated Social Democrats _ the renamed Communists _ will be
the second largest in future parliament with 29 seats. An alliance
of the country's ethnic Albanian parties secured 24 seats, and
another seven seats went to three smaller parties.
	   Due to unspecified irregularities, voting will be repeated in
two electoral units _ for two seats in the single-chamber
parliament _ and at least one of these is expected to go to the
winning coalition.
	   The coalition, which has promised an economic upswing and
further development of democracy while continuing close ties to the
West, is expected to woo the support of several deputies of other
parties to secure a majority.
	   The outcome of the elections is important for NATO's plans to
use Macedonia for verifying the pullback of government troops in
Serbia's Kosovo province. Aerial surveillance operations and a
security force to protect the 2,000-strong ground verification
force in adjacent Kosovo are to be based in Macedonia.

Reports: Tyson to fight Botha Jan. 16 in Las Vegas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Updates with source confirming Jan 16 as MGM as likely date
and site; SUBS 13th graf to UPDATE with Schultz still be
considered &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mike Tyson will make his comeback against South
Africa's Francois Botha in Las Vegas on Jan. 16, according to
published reports Tuesday.
	   The Sun and The Independent said the former heavyweight champion
has signed for the fight with the promoters America Presents, who
were expected to announce details Tuesday in New York.
	   The Independent said the fight would be held at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas.
	   In New York, the Daily News said the fight was ``a done deal.''
The newspaper said Tyson had received a large cash advance to help
with his cash-flow problems.
	   Tyson's adviser, Shelly Finkel, said the deal had not been
finalized.
	   ``Our plan is for him to fight in January, (but) Mike has not
concluded a deal to fight anybody in January,'' Finkel said Tuesday
in New York.
	   In Las Vegas, a source close to the negotiations also said
nothing has been signed, but the Jan. 16 looks like the date at
this point, and the MGM Grand was the likely site.
	   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Vaughn
Bean was also being considered as an opponent for Tyson.
	   The fight would be Tyson's first since his suspension 15 months
ago for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during their world title
fight.
	   Tyson's license was restored last month by the Nevada State
Athletic Commission.
	   Botha is the No. 1 contender for Holyfield's IBF title.
Holyfield also holds the WBA crown.
	   Botha has lost only once in 37 fights, stopped in the 12th round
by Michael Moorer in an IBF title challenge two years ago.
	   A spokeswoman for Showtime, the American cable television
company that will broadcast the fight, said Germany's Axel Schultz
also was being considered, and she said the deal could be closed by
the end of the week.
	   The Sun and Independent said Botha is being handled by British
promoter Frank Warren.
	   A spokesman for Warren would not confirm the Tyson-Botha fight
had been made, saying only that Warren's company is ``advising''
Botha until January.
	   Tyson faces a Dec. 1 trial on misdemeanor assault charges
stemming from a traffic accident Aug. 31 in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
outside Washington.

Cohen told that Saudi area off limits for attacks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi King Fahd on Tuesday told
visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen that he will not
allow his country to be used as a ``springboard'' for attacks on
Iraq.
	   Fahd met with Cohen in Riyadh, the first stop in Cohen's
official's tour of the Gulf to consult with U.S. allies on the
standoff between Iraq and the United Nations over weapons
inspections.
	   ``King Fahd told Cohen that Saudi Arabia doesn't approve using
its territories as a springboard for attacks on Iraq if Washington
decided to attack Iraq,'' a Saudi official said. He spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   Cohen is expected to meet later with Crown Prince Abdullah.
Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal and Saudi Chief of Staff Gen. Saleh
al-Mahaiya were present during the Cohen-Fahd meeting.
	   Saudi Arabia was the center of U.S. war operations during the
1991 Gulf War that evicted Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait. The
Iraqi occupation in 1990 led to U.N. economic sanctions, which
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq is
rid of weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq on Saturday suspended cooperation with the inspectors,
citing inordinate delay in the lifting of sanctions among a list of
complaints. Another standoff over inspections almost led to
military strikes by the United States and Britain early this year.
	   The United States' Gulf allies, including Saudi Arabia, had been
reluctant to support U.S. military action against Iraq during that
standoff too.
	   Cohen is expected to visit Kuwait on Wednesday, according to the
official Kuwaiti News Agency. He will meet with the emir of Kuwait
and other officials, KUNA said.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Cohen met with British Defense Secretary George
Robertson in London and the two officials agreed ``it is crucial
that Saddam Hussein reverse'' his stand.
	   The United States has indicated that military strikes against
Iraq remain an option although Pentagon officials said no movement
of extra troops, shops or weapons was under way.

Mir's crew prepares for micro-meteorite `rain'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS 3 grafs at end with NASA giving Russia money for
international space station. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The crew of the Mir space station will not face
any danger when their space outpost enters a cloud of
micro-meteorites later this month, space officials said Tuesday.
	   Just in case, cosmonauts Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev will
board a Soyuz escape capsule permanently attached to the six-module
station when the barrage of meteorites peaks in mid-November, said
deputy Mission Control chief Viktor Blagov.
	   The ``meteorite rain'' doesn't pose a serious danger because it
consists of very small particles that are not full meteorites, but
remnants of a comet, Blagov said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Next Wednesday, Padalka and Avdeyev will take a spacewalk to
attach to the station's outer surface a French-made device designed
for studying the micro-meteorites, he said.
	   Also Tuesday, the Russian space agency said it had received dlrs
34 million from NASA for the construction of the Russian segments
of the international space station, including the module that will
bring its first crew.
	   The money is the first installment of dlrs 60 million that the
U.S. Congress agreed last month to give Russia for the
international station, the Interfax news agency quoted Russian
space officials as saying.
	   The United States already had paid Russia about dlrs 1.2 billion
in space station-related funds, but Russia has repeatedly failed to
meet deadlines or complete key space equipment.

Amnesty: Tunisian human rights activists silenced, harassed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 0001 GMT Wednesday Nov. 4, time set by source. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Despite efforts by Tunisia's leaders to improve
their image, they are silencing and harassing human rights
activists through ever more sophisticated methods, Amnesty
International says.
	   In addition to imprisonment, short-term detention, harassment
and torture, authorities in the North African nation have
introduced wiretapping, fax and mail interception and ``sleaze
campaigns'' to intimidate human rights activists, Amnesty said in a
new report.
	   Authorities have, for example, publicized photo and video
montages showing human rights defenders in compromising situations,
according to the report.
	   Meanwhile, efforts by Tunisian authorities to improve their
image have included creating their own ``official'' human rights
organizations and web sites, while at the same time blocking access
to web sites belonging to watchdog organizations _ including
Amnesty _ it said.
	   The report called for the release of Khemais Ksila,
vice-president of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH), who has
been imprisoned since September 1997.
	   Ksila was arrested after publicly announcing he was going on a
hunger strike to protest increasing harassment of him and his
family, the report said.
	   And other human rights activists who have been released from
prison are still being prevented from working or traveling, it
added.
	   Organizations such as the LTDH have found it increasingly
difficult to operate, according to the report, due to constant
police surveillance and disruption of meetings.
	   ``The extent and scale of the harassment and intimidation which
human rights defenders have suffered in Tunisia for a number of
years indicate that these are not only tolerated, but are
encouraged at the highest level by the Tunisian authorities,'' it
said.
	   Tunisia has long been accused of systematic human rights
violations. Critics denounce Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben
Ali's tough approach to Muslim fundamentalists, hundreds of whom
are jailed.

South African crime grows more violent, police say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Crime in South Africa is growing
increasingly brutal, with criminals using greater violence to break
through tougher security, a police official said Tuesday.
	   Alcohol and drug abuse also were to blame, Chris de Kock of the
police's Crime Information Management Center told a Parliamentary
committee.
	   Also to blame was the fact that targets have ``hardened'' and
were becoming less accessible to criminals, he said. With increased
use of security devices, cars were harder to steal, so thieves
resorted to hijacking, he said.
	   And with home security growing tighter, criminals more and more
lay in wait for residents and force them to open their houses with
weapons.
	   South Africa has some of the highest crime rates in the world.
Many people in the wealthier suburbs of its cities live behind
electric gates, high walls and sophisticated alarm systems.
	   De Kock acknowledged that South Africa's image abroad had been
hurt by the high levels of violence.
	   He said premeditated killings accounted for a small percentage
of homicides.
	   Incidence in some categories, such as common assault,
shoplifting, commercial crime and drug-related crime, had leveled
off or were decreasing, he said.
	   But street crimes, such as muggings and purse-snatchings, had
increased in January-June.
	   No new figures were immediately available.

Reports: Tyson to fight Botha Jan. 16 in Las Vegas

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson will make his comeback against South
Africa's Francois Botha in Las Vegas on Jan. 16, according to
published reports Tuesday.
	   London newspapers The Sun and The Independent said the former
heavyweight champion has signed for the fight with the promoters
America Presents.
	   The Independent said the fight would be held at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas.
	   In New York, the Daily News said the fight was ``a done deal.''
The newspaper said Tyson had received a large cash advance to help
with his cash-flow problems.
	   But Tyson's adviser, Shelly Finkel, said the deal had not been
finalized.
	   ``Our plan is for him to fight in January, (but) Mike has not
concluded a deal to fight anybody in January,'' Finkel said Tuesday
in New York.
	   In Las Vegas, a source close to the negotiations also said
nothing has been signed, but Jan. 16 looks like the date at this
point, and the MGM Grand was the probable site.
	   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Vaughn
Bean was also being considered as an opponent for Tyson.
	   The fight would be Tyson's first since his suspension 15 months
ago for biting Evander Holyfield's ears during their title fight.
	   Tyson's license was restored last month by the Nevada State
Athletic Commission.
	   Botha is the No. 1 contender for Holyfield's IBF title.
Holyfield also holds the WBA crown.
	   Botha has lost only once in 37 fights, stopped in the 12th round
by Michael Moorer in an IBF title challenge two years ago.
	   A spokeswoman for Showtime, the American cable television
company that will broadcast the fight, said Germany's Axel Schultz
also was being considered, and she said the deal could be closed by
the end of the week.
	   The Sun and Independent said Botha is being handled by British
promoter Frank Warren.
	   A spokesman for Warren would not confirm the Tyson-Botha fight
had been made, saying only that Warren's company is ``advising''
Botha until January.
	   Tyson faces a Dec. 1 trial on misdemeanor assault charges
stemming from a traffic accident Aug. 31 in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
outside Washington.

Jewish settlers stake West Bank land ahead of Israeli withdrawal

<TEXT>
	   ALON SHVUT, West Bank (AP) - Two young religious Jews wearing
knitted scullcaps poured over Jewish texts in a new West Bank
trailer park Tuesday, while a third man, armed with a submachine
gun, stood guard outside.
	   The mobile homes were brought illegally on Saturday night to the
rocky hilltop outside the existing settlement of Alon Shvut and
several similar trailer parks have sprouted on other West Bank
hilltops in what appears to be a last-minute land grab.
	   Settlers say they want to claim the plots before Israel hands a
chunk of the West Bank to the Palestinians as part of a new Mideast
land-for-peace accord.
	   Under the Wye summit agreement, Israel is to withdraw its troops
from 13 percent of the West Bank and hand the area over to
Palestinian control.
	   Settlers and religious Jews, like the young men who turned their
trailer into a study hall, believe the West Bank is part of the
biblical land of Israel promised to the Jews by God.
	   Hoping to set their presence in stone, settlers have turned to
tactics which have worked in the past: they placed mobile homes on
hills they plan to turn into larger permanent settlements which
would be difficult for Israel to remove in the face of a larger
West Bank withdrawal.
	   Sitting in his office stacked with maps and plans, Yerach Rotem,
a community official for Alon Shvut, said he was sorry the mobile
homes had to be erected illegally instead of with government
approval. Rotem hasn't seen the withdrawal maps and doesn't know
which areas will be affected in the pullback, ``but with this
agreement ... we were afraid that all our work would just go down
the drain,'' he said.
	   ``We are worried,'' Rotem said, and he is not alone.
	   Literally overnight, over 10 mobile homes popped-up, forming
small beige clusters on the very top of dusty dry hills.
	   Three homes appeared on an isolated hilltop outside the
settlement of Maale Michmash, in the heartland of the West Bank.
The very steep hill, about 700 yards (meters) from the settlement,
commands a magnificent view of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea
to the east, and the eastern suburbs of Jerusalem to the West.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and today some 150,000 Israeli Jews live in settlements
throughout the area. The Palestinians want the land as part of a
future independent state for the 1.6 million Palestinians who also
live in the West Bank in eight cities and hundreds of villages.
	   Yitzhak Sapir, 53, a lecturer at a community college in one of
the West Bank settlements, was looking after the three trailers
while the other settlers - three families and some young single
people - were absent at work.
	   Despite repeated calls by the Palestinians and the United States
to halt settlement construction, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has said he would allow settlements to expand, in order to
accommodate natural growth.
	   Sapir, however was not in need of a home. He already has one on
another West Bank settlement. He has moved into the trailer
``partly as a protest,'' he said, against the new peace agreement.
``Our physical presence here gives a feeling of greater security
and permanence,'' he said.
	   Sapir had already decorated the walls of his trailer with framed
photographs of orchids and West Bank landscapes. Lace curtains had
been hung on the window-frames. ``It's my wife,'' he said. ``She
tries to create the atmosphere of a home no matter how rough it
is.''
	   At Alon Shvut and Maale Michmash, Israeli police ordered the
settlers to remove mechanical diggers which were leveling the
ground, but made no attempt to evict the settlers.
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the presence of
the new mobile homes were ``a flagrant violation'' of the Wye
Plantation accord.
	   ``He can't have both settlements and peace,'' Erekat said.

Russian tax officials confiscate 640,000 bottles of bootleg
</HEADLINE>
alcohol &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tax officials confiscated 640,000 bottles of
bootleg alcohol during raids on Moscow stores and wholesalers in
the first nine months of this year, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The spirits were worth 11.5 million rubles (dlrs 739,000), the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing the State Tax Service.
	   Some bootleg booze comes from licensed distilleries that
secretly produce extra alcohol to avoid taxes. The rest comes from
individual moonshiners.
	   With the economy rattled by the crisis, Russia's cash-starved
government is trying to get a tighter grip on the alcohol business,
which in Soviet times provided about a quarter of the state's
budget revenues.
	   The government has suspended the licenses of 28 Moscow
wholesalers and annulled eight licenses for selling illegal
alcohol, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   In the first 20 days of October alone, some 440,000 bottles were
confiscated in Moscow, it said.
	   Officials have said that moonshine manufacturing and evasion of
alcohol taxes cost the government an estimated 18 billion rubles
(dlrs 2.9 billion) in the first five months of this year.

Estonia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - Six decades after leaving her native
Estonia, Melissa Wells has returned as U.S. Ambassador, presenting
her credentials to President Lennart Meri on Tuesday.
	   Wells was only 1 year old when her mother, opera singer Miliza
Korjus, decided to leave Estonia in 1933 to pursue a career in
Western Europe. Korjus later became a Hollywood actress, noted for
her role in 1938's ''The Great Waltz.''
	   Wells, previously ambassador to Zaire, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau
and Cape Verde, said her family had left Estonia by ship and so she
insisted on returning by ship.
	   She arrived in Estonia on Friday, the first time she had been
back.
	   ``I thought of (my parents) as the city of Tallinn rose up on
the skyline,'' said Wells. ``I thought, 'Mummy and daddy, if you
could see me now!'''
	   As ambassador, Wells says she hopes to raise the profile of the
small country.
	   ``I want Estonia to be better known in the United States,'' she
said. ``I'd also like to focus on increasing investment between the
two countries.''

Official death toll from Nicaraguan mudslides nears 2,000
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICHIGALPA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers have pulled nearly
2,000 bodies from villages buried in mud when a volcanic lake
overflowed from rain brought by Hurricane Mitch, a Nicaraguan mayor
said Tuesday, although other sources put the number closer to
1,300.
	   Felicita Zeledon, mayor of Posoltega, the largest city near the
disaster area, said in a live radio interview that 1,930 bodies had
been recovered. The latest figure from the Red Cross was 1,250 and
the president's office said there were 1,338 dead, 166 wounded and
1,817 missing.
	   The death toll reported by the mayor was higher than the highest
official estimates made earlier.
	   As of early Tuesday, the Red Cross said that 808 bodies had been
found. Vice President Enrique Bolanos said earlier this week that
the slide apparently killed 1,000 to 1,500 people in several
communities near of Posoltega, at the foot of the Casitas volcano.
	   Central American officials estimated Monday that more than 7,000
people died in floods and mudslides triggered by Mitch, one of the
strongest hurricanes ever to hit the Caribbean.
	   After days of pounding rain, the crater lake high above the
villages overflowed. The two rivers that drain the lake had joined
to form one massive deluge.
	   The first relief helicopters reached the volcano's foot Sunday.
They found decomposing bodies everywhere, with victims' limbs
protruding from the mud.
	   Another small mudslide on the northern slope of the volcano
wiped out 34 houses Monday night, but there were no apparent
casualties, Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said.

Spain authorizes talks with groups close to Basque militants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS reax from Herri Batasuna,TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said
Tuesday he had authorized talks with groups linked to the armed
Basque separatist group ETA, taking his first step toward
negotiating an end to the 30-year conflict.
	   ``There are news reports that I have authorized contacts. It's
true,'' Aznar told reporters.
	   These contacts will be through the Basque National Liberation
Movement, a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist
organizations, an official in Aznar's office said on condition of
anonymity.
	   ``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take
place with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' the official said.
``We cannot say anything yet about the how, who and when.''
	   The official government spokesman, Josep Pique, told reporters
that the contacts were aimed at exploring possibilities opened up
by ETA's cease-fire, ``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing
to give up violence for good.''
	   ETA ushered in the Basque peace process on Sept. 16 when it
declared an indefinite cease-fire in its campaign for a Basque
homeland straddling northern Spain and southern France.
	   Groups close to ETA said the truce was modeled on the Northern
Ireland process that led to last April's peace accord. They urged
the government to promote a negotiated settlement as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had done in Northern Ireland.
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams visited the Basque region last
month and urged Aznar's government to respond positively to the
cease-fire by opening peace negotiations.
	   A group of Basque political parties and organizations known as
the Irish Forum secured Adams' backing for its proposal, known as
the Lizarra Declaration, for all-party peace talks, including the
government and ETA.
	   The government rejected the proposal at the time.
	   Extensive peace talks between a Spanish government and ETA have
not taken place since 1989 when the Socialist party was in power.
	   The failure of these talks, held in Algeria, was subsequently
used to justify hard-line policies ruling out a negotiated solution
to the conflict.
	   Aznar's tough stand against ETA _ including the arrest of Basque
militants, the dismantling of a major ETA financial network and the
closing of an allied daily newspaper _ is believed to have been a
factor in bringing about the cease-fire.
	   The Irish Forum includes Herri Batasuna, the political coalition
linked to ETA, as well as moderate Basque nationalist parties,
labor unions and civic groups.
	   Responding to Aznar's announcement Tuesday, Herri Batasuna
issued a statement stressing ``the need for dialogue and
negotiation as the only valid way to address the conflict''.
	   ``We are faced with an historic opportunity that requires vision
and courage,'' the group said.
	   Spain's main opposition party, the Socialists, complained that
Aznar had not consulted with it before making Tuesday's
announcement. He did hold a round of talks with all Spain's major
parties after the ceasefire began.
	   Socialist spokesman Juan Alberto Belloch said Aznar cannot
expect to form a political consensus on how to end the conflict
unless he keeps up consultations. ``He cannot continue like this,''
Belloch said.
	   The government's hard-line position of rejecting peace
negotiations with ETA or legal organizations linked to it has
softened gradually since the cease-fire and since regional
elections on Oct. 25.
	   Recently, the government suggested that ETA would not be
required to hand over its weapons before peace talks could be held
covering such issues as the future of 535 ETA prisoners being held
in Spanish jails.
	   Aznar's Popular Party and Euskal Herritarrok, a political
coalition linked to ETA, came in second and third respectively in
last month's Basque regional elections. The winner was the moderate
Basque Nationalist Party that supports ETA aims but opposes
violence.
	   ETA, which stands in the Basque language for Basque Homeland and
Liberty, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   Before the truce, the group had been targeting town councilors
from Aznar's Popular Party in retaliation for the government's
hard-line policies, killing six since July 1997.

Russia urges peaceful solution in Iraq, cooperation from Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in top 5 grafs with foreign minister's comments. Minor
edits to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia again called for a peaceful solution to the
Iraqi crisis Tuesday, and urged Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
allow U.N. weapons inspectors to continue their work.
	   ``I continue to believe a political solution has not been
exhausted, and moreover, I'm sure that no military solution is
possible,'' Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said.
	   But Saddam's decision Saturday to cut off all work with U.N.
inspectors was ``incomprehensible for us, and unfortunately, not
leading to a resolution of the situation,'' Ivanov said.
	   The Foreign Ministry also warned Saddam that economic sanctions
against Iraq would only be lifted if he allows U.N. weapons
inspectors to complete their work.
	   The warning by ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin came on the
same day that Russia's ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky
proclaimed that Saddam wanted a timetable for lifting U.N.
sanctions before he will let inspections resume.
	   ``He would like to have information when the blockade (will be)
eliminated,'' said Zhirinovsky said after meeting with Saddam in
Iraq on Tuesday. ``When? This year, next year, next century?''
	   The inspectors are to certify that Iraq has complied with U.N.
resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq, is
generally sympathetic to the Arab nation and has called for an
early lifting of the sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990.

Angola says it will keep troops in Congo until fighting ends

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angola plans to keep troops in Congo until
the three-month rebellion in the neighboring country ends, an
official said Tuesday.
	   ``We will leave Congo only when the conflict is over,'' the
official said on condition that he not be identified.
	   The official, close to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, denied
news reports that Angola is preparing for a phased withdrawal from
Congo where it has deployed several thousand troops to support its
president, Laurent Kabila, against rebels.
	   ``Those reports are not true,'' he said.
	   The rebellion by ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of the
Congolese army and opposition politicians has sucked in many of
Congo's neighbors.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Chad and, reportedly, Sudan have sent
troops to support Kabila against insurgents backed by Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Angolan forces played a key role in blocking a rebel offensive
in southwest Congo, near the border, soon after the conflict
erupted in early August.
	   Angola also helped Kabila oust long-time ruler Mobutu Sese Seko
last year.
	   However, the government is increasingly concerned about the
mounting threat at home from the former Angolan rebel group UNITA,
which recently has attacked remote villages in contravention of the
country's 1994 peace pact.
	   Dos Santos did not meet last week with senior U.S. diplomats who
visited Luanda as part of an African tour to examine ways of ending
the fighting in Congo.
	   Susan Rice, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, warned the Congo war could destabilize the entire southern
half of the African continent.
	   Dos Santos was due to meet Rice just before she left, but then
he called a Cabinet meeting for the same time.

New Slovak government reverses Meciar moves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Slovakia's new government on Tuesday
overturned two last-minute decisions by the outgoing leadership,
firing the new secret service chief and canceling a minimum wage
hike.
	   The reversals came four days after the coalition replaced the
authoritarian government of former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar
that it defeated in September elections.
	   The new government, led by Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda,
dimissed Rudolf Ziak, who had been appointed just a week earlier to
head the Slovak secret service, SIS. The government replaced Ziak
with Vladimir Mitro, who headed the service before Meciar's party
won elections in 1994.
	   Ziak's immediate predecessor, Ivan Lexa, left the secret service
post last week to fill Meciar's seat in parliament. Critics of
Meciar's government suspect it transferred Lexa to parliament to
try to give him immunity from prosecution in the 1995 kidnapping of
the son of Slovakia's former president, Michal Kovac _ a bitter
Meciar rival.
	   The new government, facing a large budget deficit, also
cancelled Meciar's recent increase in the minimum wage to dlrs 114
a month, reducing the amount to its previous level of dlrs 85.
	   Dzurinda said his government will announce its overall program
in two weeks.
	   His Cabinet indicated in a statement that one priority will be
to create favorable conditions so that Gypsies, known also as Roma,
won't seek political asylum abroad.

Russia to prepare Gazprom auction by end of November
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 7-8 with government saying it will stick
to plan despite IMF criticism. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has until the end of the month to
prepare an auction of up to 5 percent of the natural gas monopoly
Gazprom, the world's largest gas company, a news report said
Tuesday.
	   The Cabinet has ordered the State Property Ministry to design
the procedure for the sale of Gazprom, one of the government's most
valuable assets, by the end of November, the Interfax news agency
reported. No date for the auction has been set.
	   Russian news reports have said the government may decide not to
sell a stake in Gazprom this year because its stock price has
fallen sharply. If the auction goes ahead, no more than 3 percent
of the company will be sold, the reports added.
	   However, after President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree
announcing the sale Monday, Gazprom share prices rose 25 percent at
the Moscow Stock Exchange, from 1.52 rubles (9.6 cents) per share
to 1.9 rubles (12 cents).
	   Russia's financial troubles have scared away foreign investors
and driven down share prices, and the government has repeatedly
postponed the sale because it was hoping to get a better price.
	   With treasury bill debts coming due, wage arrears mounting and
no international aid in sight, the government has little choice but
to sell more shares in Gazprom to cover expenses.
	   The government presented its first blueprint for tackling the
crisis to the International Monetary Fund last week, and the IMF
responded with five pages of criticism, Deputy Prime Minister
Gennady Kulik said Tuesday.
	   Russia's government appeared unmoved by the IMF's comments,
which included a suggestion that Russia abandon plans to rescue
flailing banks, Kulik said. Kulik said the government would abide
by its original program.

Treasury chief predicts slower growth _ just for next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Treasury chief Gordon Brown on Tuesday predicted
slower economic growth next year, but said that Britain was
well-placed to weather global recession _ in what critics described
as an overoptimistic assessment economic prospects.
	   Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown said overall growth is now
forecast to rise by between one and 1.5 percent, compared with by
between 1.75 percent and 2.25 percent that he predicted in June.
	   In a statement to the House of Commons, Brown said, however,
growth would recover to between 2.25 percent and 2.75 percent in
2000 and between 2.75 percent and 3.25 percent in 2001.
	   The Labor Party government, which pledged to stick for two years
to the spending plans of the Conservative Party administration it
replaced 18 months ago, actually underspent by two billion pounds
(dlrs 3.4 billion), Brown announced.
	   He said surpluses would continue over the next five years
totaling 33 billion pounds (dlrs 56 billion), describing this as a
``a margin that shows we are equipped to cope with further
uncertainties.''
	   Business leaders said the growth forecasts appeared on the high
side, but some analysts agreed with Brown's assessment.
	   ``The forecast was optimistic, optimistic on growth and
particularly optimistic on borrowing.'' said Ruth Lea, head of the
policy unit at the Institute of Directors.
	   Share prices did not respond. The Financial Times Stock Exchange
100-share index finished down 21.6 points, or 3.9 percent, at
5,503.9 points.

Festina joins campaign to crack down on banned drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Festina, whose team was kicked out of
the Tour de France after admitting to drug use, said Tuesday it has
joined three other cycling sponsors in signing a charter aimed at
clamping down on use of banned substances.
	   The watch company also said it was earmarking 100 million
pesetas (dlrs 715,000) to fight drug use in cycling and train young
riders.
	   The charter was signed last week by French sponsors Bigmat,
Cofidis and Francaise des Jeux in what was seen as a bid to clean
up cycling's tarnished image.
	   The document includes a range of measures designed to make it
tougher for cyclists to take illicit drugs.
	   Among the most far-reaching is one giving sponsors the right to
demand further medical examinations in the event of a positive drug
test, and prevent cyclists who test positive from competing until
undergoing a disciplinary hearing.
	   The move comes nearly three months after the Tour de France was
rocked by a doping scandal that saw Festina team expelled following
revelations that its riders systematically used the
performance-enhancing drug EPO.
	   The measures include allowing sponsors the right to hire doctors
of their own choice to test cyclists and making cyclists on the
three teams guarantee in writing that they will abstain from taking
banned substances during their contracts.

Official death toll from mudslides nears 2,000

	   CHICHIGALPA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers have pulled nearly
2,000 bodies out of villages devasted by mudslides in northern
Nicaragua, a local mayor said, although other sources put the
number closer to 1,300.
	   Felicita Zeledon, mayor of Posoltega, the largest city near the
disaster area, said in a live radio interview that 1,930 cadavers
had been recovered. The latest figure from the Red Cross was 1,250
and the president's office said there were 1,338 dead, 166 wounded
and 1,817 missing.
	   The death toll reported by the mayor was higher than the highest
earlier official estimates.
	   Vice President Enrique Bolanos earlier this week said the slide
apparently killed 1,000 to 1,500 people in several communities near
the city of Posoltega, at the foot of the Casitas volcano. Earlier
Tuesday, the Red Cross had said that 808 bodies had been found.
	   The first relief helicopters reached the region Sunday. They
found decomposing bodies everywhere, some with just limbs sticking
out of the mud.
	   At first, soldiers struggled to bury bodies where they lay. But
with the fear of epidemics growing, volunteer brigades set out
Monday from Chichigalpa to burn bodies.
	   ``We need the government to send us gasoline if they want to
avoid an epidemic,'' said Robert Lopez Marcia, a member of
Chichigalpa's emergency commission.
	   Central American officials estimated Monday more than 7,000
people died in floods and mudslides triggered by Mitch, one of the
strongest hurricanes ever to hit the Caribbean.
	   After days of pounding rains, the crater lake high above them on
the Casitas volcano overflowed. The two rivers that drain the lake
had joined to form one massive deluge.
	   Another small mudslide on the northern slope of the volcano
wiped out 34 houses Monday night, but there were no apparent
casualties, Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said.
	   At an improvised shelter in a Chichigalpa elementary school,
doctors stitched wounds and performed other minor surgery on people
evacuated from the mountains.
	   The doctors were in desperate need of medicine, antibiotics and
bandages, and there was little clean water or food. Children lay on
desks with bloody bandages on their heads.
	   Along the Pan American highway, thousands of people walked in
the pouring rain, some leaving the disaster area, others going in
to search for family members.
	   ``The only thing the federal government does is ask us for a
number every half hour _ how many dead, how many injured,''
complained Chichigalpa Mayor Elijio Palacio. ``But they don't send
us anything.''

Danish foreign minister offers advice to Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel could learn from Denmark's historical
experience in solving political difficulties, Danish foreign
minister Niels Helveg Petersen said in a speech Tuesday.
	   Helveg Petersen, addressing a mixed audience of Danes and
Israelis, said that while the two nations' political situations
seem completely different, some lessons could be learned.
	   For example, as a small country, Denmark has learned that
participating in multilateral organizations such as the European
Union provides more security than through bilateral relationships
alone, Helveg Petersen said.
	   Economic differences in the Middle East shouldn't prevent
multilateralism from developing in this region, he said.
	   ``Differences in standards of living is not a barrier to
regional cooperation,'' he said.
	   Helveg Petersen also mentioned that Europe is no stranger to
terrorism, noting Spain, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland and Great
Britain as victims. He said the most efficient way to fight
terrorists is to understand their motives and fight back fairly.
	   ``We have learned to focus on the problems for the cause of the
terrorists'' and to choose methods in fighting terrorism that
avoids creating martyrdom, he said.
	   ``To exceed the limits of normal legal investigation _ by for
instance allowing torture or other kinds of inhuman punishment _
will definitely not be beneficial in the long run,'' he said.
	   In response to an audience member's question, Helveg Petersen
said his government is ``actively looking'' at organizing a visit
by the Danish queen to Israel. Two years ago Queen Margrethe
canceled a planned visit to Israel during a 17-day Israeli blitz of
suspected guerrilla targets in Lebanon.

Publisher defends Holocaust memoirs, but doubter sees vindication
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Ganzfried says Wilkomirski was Swiss and spent
war years in Switzerland. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The publisher of a book of Holocaust memoirs said
Tuesday it was looking for written proof from challengers that the
award-winning autobiography is phony, but a key doubter said he
felt vindicated.
	   The book, ``Fragments'' by Binjamin Wilkomirski, relates how a
Swiss man claiming he is a Latvian Jew survived Nazi concentration
camps as a small boy.
	   Since it first appeared under the German title ``Bruchstuecke''
in 1994, the book has been a best-seller and has won awards from
Jewish organizations in a number of countries. It has been
translated into 12 languages.
	   But questions have increasingly been raised about whether
Wilkomirski's book was a true personal account. The latest
challenge was in The New York Times on Tuesday, which cited ``an
international debate about the authenticity of the memoir.''
	   Other challenges to the book include articles in The Boston
Globe and the Swiss weekly Die Weltwoche.
	   Daniel Ganzfried, a Swiss author who has taking a leading role
in questioning the authenticity, said Tuesday he felt ``the book is
getting thinner and thinner.''
	   He said Wilkomirski, who also has been challenged by the French
daily Le Monde, had withdrawn his assertion that Swiss authorities
had falsified his birth and other records.
	   ``He's taking back all factual details that one can research,''
Ganzfried said. ``I feel I've been proved right.''
	   The Associated Press left a message on the author's answering
machine, but the call was not immediately returned. His agent in
Zurich also refused to comment.
	   Thomas Sparr, chief of the Jewish division of the Suhrkamp
Verlag publishing house based in Frankfurt, Germany, said the firm
had carefully checked doubts that had been raised about the book.
	   ``Of course, in this situation we need documents, witness
statements, proof, that Binjamin Wilkomirski was in Switzerland
between 1941 and 1946,'' Sparr told the AP.
	   Suhrkamp said such accounts by children survivors of the
Holocaust have been challenged before.
	   The book says it is an account of the first years of
Wilkomirski's life, from 1939 to 1948. He says he saw his father
beaten to death and being imprisoned at age 3 or 4 in a
concentration camp in Poland, eventually spending time in two
camps. He says the details of his early years were revealed through
therapy.
	   But Ganzfried says Binjamin Wilkomirski has always been Swiss,
living in Switzerland from his birth in 1941 until the end of the
war and since then, and that he never was a concentration camp
inmate.
	   He said the account was the invention of Swiss clarinetist Bruno
Doessekker, who was born Bruno Grosjean to an unmarried Swiss
Protestant woman.
	   He was adopted by a couple named Doessekker, in a Zurich suburb,
before he entered school in 1947, added Ganzfried.
	   Ganzfried, whose own father survived Ausschwitz, has written a
novel about the Holocaust. He said what he would like to see is for
``Fragments'' to be withdrawn and reissued as a novel.
	   He said he initially interviewed Doessekker for seven hours and
that one of the questions he asked was whether he was circumcised.
	   ``He told me yes, but then I asked his girlfriend and his
ex-wife and they independently told me no.''

Bochum's Thomas Ernst tests positive again for banned substance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German soccer authorities said Tuesday
that VfL Bochum goalkeeper Thomas Ernst's second sample had tested
positive for a banned substance.
	   The German Soccer Federation will meet with the Bundesliga club
and Ernst Monday before taking action on the case.
	   Bochum said Ernst was treated during halftime of a Oct. 26 match
against FC Kaiserslautern after colliding with Danish player
Michael Schoenjborg, who broke his leg.
	   The team doctor gave Ernst a medicament for blood circulation
that wasn't banned, but apparently contained an ingredient that
stood on the list.
	   In 1995, Bochum's Roland Wohlfarth was the first of four doping
case reported in the Bundesliga. The striker was suspended for two
months.

political settlement for the Serbian province is possible without
their consent.
	   ``Sidelining the KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) from political
issues ... will provoke negative consequences in the search for a
solution for Kosovo,'' said a statement from the armed
secessionists obtained by The Associated Press.
	   International officials regard Ibrahim Rugova, who was
re-elected political leader of Kosovo Albanians this year, as chief
representative of the community. U.S. diplomats are shuttling
between Rugova and Belgrade to try to arrange an agreement on a
form of self-rule for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians form 90
percent of the province's 2 million people.
	   ``We appeal to all relevant international factors not to
cooperate with the worthless, anti-national political groups and
individuals in Kosovo,'' the statement said, in an apparent
reference to Rugova and his aides.
	   ``The KLA will not recognize nor accept any solution less than
an independent Kosovo,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spaniards have donated an estimated three
million dollars for victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America,
news reports said Tuesday.
	   By mid-day the Spanish Red Cross had collected over 200 million
pesetas (dlrs 1.4 million) and other private aid agencies took the
total to over twice that amount, the national news agency EFE
reported.
	   Spanish television and other news organizations have been
publicizing telephone numbers for people to make donations after
showing damage done by Mitch, which killed an estimated 7,000
people and left hundreds of bodies reeking in rivers of mud.
	   Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Rodrigo Rato promised unspecified
government support for Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala
and Belize _ all badly affected.
	   Town councils and regional governments also pledged large sums,
with the regional government of Andalusia promising to send 150
million pesetas (dlrs 1 million).

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ With flood waters receding and
communications improving, Central Americans struggled Tuesday to
reach thousands cut off by Hurricane Mitch. As the official death
count surged, authorities feared a lack of aid could push the
number of dead well past the estimated 7,000.
	   The greatest losses were reported in Honduras, where an
estimated 5,000 people died and 600,000 _ 10 percent of the
population _ were forced to flee their homes after last week's
storm. Countless more lacked clean water, food and medicine.
	   Most of the deaths in Nicaragua occurred when the crater lake of
the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud and debris
onto several villages below.
	   Preliminary figures from the Nicaraguan president's office said
1,338 people died in the crater lake mudslide. However, Felicita
Zeledon, mayor of Posoltega, the largest city near the volcano,
said Tuesday that workers have recovered 1,950 bodies. The
differing figures could not immediately be reconciled.
	   Nicaragua reported 500 people killed elsewhere in the country.
In El Salvador, 222 people were reported killed and 50,000 were
homeless. Guatemala reported 157 storm-related deaths.
	   Honduran Communications Minister Tomas Lozano said Tuesday that
at least 5,000 people had died, 11,000 were missing and 1 million
had to flee their homes in this nation of 6 million.
	   ``But we are dealing with preliminary official figures,'' he
said. ``And the number of victims will be greater when the waters
fall and the country returns to normal'' to permit a full
accounting.
	   U.S. and local helicopters flew emergency missions throughout
the day in Nicaragua and Honduras to reach people trapped by the
floods.
	   In the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, hundreds of people crowded
morgues and hospitals seeking missing relatives.
	   Oscar Triminio, spokesman for the Tegucigalpa fire department,
said more than 30 bodies had been pulled from the Choluteca River
since Monday.
	   Lozano said that many people remain trapped on rooftops by
floodwaters eight days after Mitch hit the Atlantic coast.
	   ``Mitch destroyed almost all the highways, 70 bridges and
destroyed 70 percent of national agriculture,'' Lozano said.
	   That made it difficult to transport food and impossible to move
gasoline that fuels the relief efforts, noted the Air Force chief
of staff, Col. Alfredo San Martin.
	   ``We now have fuel to operate, but in five or seven days, the
supplies will run out,'' he said.
	   U.S. military helicopters on Tuesday ferried Honduran officials
on inspection tours of the refineries and transportation routes.
	   ``If we don't get fuel into the city, it will be utter chaos,''
said Lt. Col. Ricardo Aguilar of the U.S. Air Force.
	   For days, residents of Tegucigalpa have trudged through the mud
left throughout the city by Mitch to form long lines have formed in
front of bakeries, grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations. The
water supply had been cut since Monday due to contamination in the
system.
	   In Guatemala, struck by Mitch over the weekend, President Alvaro
Arzu reported Tuesday that 157 people had died, 100,000 homes were
damaged and 30 highways were blocked.
	   El Salvador's National Emergency Committee reported 222 deaths,
135 missing and 50,000 driven from their homes by the flooding.
	   The last vestiges of Mitch finally dissipated off Mexico's
Pacific coast early Tuesday, but not before floods just north of
the Guatemalan border killed at least five people Monday and forced
the evacuation of hundreds more.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Edouard Manet's striking portrait of Impressionist
painter Berthe Morisot on Tuesday became the latest treasure to
enrich the Orsay Museum's collection of 19th-century paintings.
	   ``Berthe Morisot au Bouquet de Violettes'' (Berthe Morisot With
A Bouquet of Violets) had not been seen in public since 1983. It
had been owned by Morisot's heirs since she bought it back from a
French dealer a year before her death in 1894.
	   Executed in 1872 but not exhibited until the Salon of 1905, the
portrait is widely regarded as one of Manet's most important
pieces.
	   For French poet and critic Paul Valery, it was simply ``Manet's
triumph.''
	   The work, a study of shadow and light, highlights Morisot's dark
beauty and the brooding intensity of her gaze. Manet transformed
her naturally green eyes into black, and showed her in black
mourning clothes.
	   A successful Impressionist painter in her own right, Morisot was
one of Manet's favorite models. She married Manet's brother,
Eugene, in 1874.
	   Museum officials declined to say how much was paid for the
painting, but Radio France Info said it was 80 million francs
(about dlrs 14.5 million.)

Publisher defends Holocaust memoirs, but doubter sees vindication
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The publisher of a book of Holocaust memoirs said
Tuesday it was looking for written proof from challengers that the
award-winning autobiography is phony, but a key doubter said he
felt vindicated.
	   The book, ``Fragments'' by Binjamin Wilkomirski, relates how a
Swiss man claiming he is a Latvian Jew survived Nazi concentration
camps as a small boy.
	   Since it first appeared under the German title ``Bruchstuecke''
in 1994, the book has been a best-seller and has won awards from
Jewish organizations in a number of countries. It has been
translated into 12 languages.
	   But questions have increasingly been raised about whether
Wilkomirski's book was a true personal account. The latest
challenge was in The New York Times on Tuesday, which cited ``an
international debate about the authenticity of the memoir.''
	   Other challenges to the book include articles in The Boston
Globe and the Swiss weekly Die Weltwoche.
	   Daniel Ganzfried, a Swiss author who has taking a leading role
in questioning the authenticity, said Tuesday he felt ``the book is
getting thinner and thinner.''
	   He said Wilkomirski, who also has been challenged by the French
daily Le Monde, had withdrawn his assertion that Swiss authorities
had falsified his birth and other records.
	   ``He's taking back all factual details that one can research,''
Ganzfried said. ``I feel I've been proved right.''
	   The Associated Press left a message on the author's answering
machine, but the call was not immediately returned. His agent in
Zurich also refused to comment.
	   Thomas Sparr, chief of the Jewish division of the Suhrkamp
Verlag publishing house based in Frankfurt, Germany, said the firm
had carefully checked doubts that had been raised about the book.
	   ``Of course, in this situation we need documents, witness
statements, proof, that Binjamin Wilkomirski was in Switzerland
between 1941 and 1946,'' Sparr told the AP.
	   Suhrkamp said such accounts by children survivors of the
Holocaust have been challenged before.
	   The book says it is an account of the first years of
Wilkomirski's life, from 1939 to 1948. He says he saw his father
beaten to death and being imprisoned at age 3 or 4 in a
concentration camp in Poland, eventually spending time in two
camps. He says the details of his early years were revealed through
therapy.
	   But Ganzfried says Binjamin Wilkomirski has always been Swiss,
living in Switzerland from his birth in 1941 until the end of the
war and since then, and that he never was a concentration camp
inmate.
	   He said the account was the invention of Swiss clarinetist Bruno
Doessekker, who was born Bruno Grosjean to an unmarried Swiss
Protestant woman.
	   He was adopted by a couple named Doessekker, in a Zurich suburb,
before he entered school in 1947, added Ganzfried.
	   Ganzfried, whose own father survived Ausschwitz, has written a
novel about the Holocaust. He said what he would like to see is for
``Fragments'' to be withdrawn and reissued as a novel.
	   He said he initially interviewed Doessekker for seven hours and
that one of the questions he asked was whether he was circumcised.
	   ``He told me yes, but then I asked his girlfriend and his
ex-wife and they independently told me no.''

Parma wins 2-1, advances to third round of UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARMA, Italy (AP) _ Parma, a top title contender, moved into the
third round of the UEFA Cup on a 3-2 aggregate following Tuesday's
2-1 home win against Wisla Krakow.
	   The victory at Tardini stadium added to a 1-1 draw in the
second-round first leg of the European soccer competition.
	   Italian midfielder Stefano Fiore scored the opening goal in the
21st minute with a powerful drive from the penalty area edge.
	   An own goal by Bogdan Zajac made it two in the 46th minute.
	   The Polish defender diverted into his net a volley by Parma's
French midfielder Alain Boghossian.
	   Zajac avenged in part the mistake by scoring his team's only
goal in injury time (93rd).
	   The Italian team, showing winning form and determination
following last Saturday's 2-0 upset of league leader Fiorentina,
pressed on the attack for most of the game and left a few chances
to the opponents only in the last 20 minutes of play.
	   Argentine veteran striker Abel Balbo and Italian international
Enrico Chiesa wasted opportunities to make the score rounder as
Argentine Juan Sebastian Veron masterminded midfield play.
	   Wisla concentrated on defense during the first half and barely
changed attitude after Parma's second goal which meant certain
elimination for the Polish team.
	   Wednesday's 2-1 marked the ninth consecutive home win in UEFA
Cup action for Parma, which won the competition in 1995.
	   Parma kept at rest such stars as Hernan Crespo, who scored both
goals against Fiorentina Saturday, and flashy Colombian forward
Faustino Asprilla.

Bordeaux beats Vitesse Arnhem 2-1 to qualify for third round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - Bordeaux bounced back from the loss of
an early goal to beat Vitesse Arnhem 2-1 on Wednesday, and qualify
for the third round of the UEFA Cup with a 3-1 aggregate victory.
	   Though the French team won the first match 1-0 in the
Netherlands, its win was in doubt until the 64th minute when
Silvain Wiltord - who scored in the first leg - made it 2-1 on the
night.
	   Michel Pavon, who recovered from a knee injury to captain the
French team, hit a 20-yard (meter) right foot shot that goalkeeper
Kostas Chaniotakis couldn't hold, and Wiltord was perfectly placed
to fire in from close range.
	   Anrhem had tied the aggregate score in the eighth minute.
	   Lively wideman Louis Laros crossed from the left and right back
Arco Jochemsen, left unmarked by the home defense, planted a firm
header past Ulrich Rame.
	   But within two minutes, Bordeaux made it 1-1 when midfielder
Johan Micoud beat a defender and curled in a fine left-footed shot
from the edge of the penalty area.
	   In driving rain, both teams had opportunities to score again.
	   Seconds before halftime, Bordeaux frontman Lilian Laslandes
fired a left-footed drive that was brilliantly tipped over by
Chaniotakis, Arnhem's Greek goalkeeper.
	   Ten minutes into the second half, Arnhem's Greek striker Nikos
Machlas volleyed past Rame from just inside the penalty area.
	   The linesman called offside, but TV replays later showed that
Machlas was at least a yard onside.
	   Benarbia was sent off in injury time after receiving two yellow
cards.

Italian surgeon asks permission for transplant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's Health Ministry withheld judgment Tuesday on
a plastic surgeon's request to perform a penis transplant, saying
such a procedure was only a hypothesis at this point.
	   Dr. Nicolo Scuderi of Rome's leading Sapienza University made
the request. He told Italian newspapers he already had three
patients hoping for the surgery, including a man who had a
sex-change operation and had since changed his mind.
	   ``We are ready. We could do it tomorrow,'' Scuderi said. ``We're
only waiting for the authorization.''
	   Scuderi already performs penis reconstructions, which he called
likely the more difficult procedure.
	   The penises for transplant could come from corpses. He said it
was uncertain how much function could be restored.
	   Italy's Health Ministry said Scuderi so far had broached the
idea only in a fax. The ministry said it would need more detailed
information before deciding.

Arms suppliers defend themselves in probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The two men at the center of arms sales to Sierra
Leone defended themselves Tuesday, insisting they had not known a
U.N. embargo on weapons applied to ousted President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah.
	   Testifying before a government committee investigating the
affair, Col. Tim Spicer, director of mercenaries Sandline
International, and Peter Penfold, Britain's high commissioner, or
ambassador, in Sierra Leone, said they had understood the weapons
ban applied only to the junta that had seized power from Kabbah in
a May 1997 coup.
	   Spicer also said that British government officials knew of his
intention to supply arms to Kabbah, who was restored to power in
March by a Nigerian-led African force. He said he was convinced the
plan was ``absolutely right and absolutely legal.''
	   An official inquiry into the arms sale, conducted by Sir Thomas
Legg, found in July that Britain's violation of the embargo
resulted from staff blunders rather than a secret policy decision.
It noted that officials didn't know the embargo applied to Kabbah.
	   Penfold said Tuesday he had never given Sandline authority to
supply arms, but insisted that government policy had not ruled out
the use of force _ under a U.N. umbrella _ if peaceful methods
failed.
	   ``We never ever ruled out the possible use of force,'' he said.
	   Of Sandline's plans to help restore Kabbah to power through
military means, Penfold said, ``I neither encouraged them nor
discouraged them.''
	   ``As far as I was aware what they were contemplating wasn't
illegal and wasn't out of place with what we were seeking to
achieve _ the restoration of President Kabbah's government,'' he
said.

Strikes linger at Eiffel Tower, national library
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Striking workers kept tourists away from the Eiffel
Tower and scholars out of the new National Library Tuesday as
nagging labor protests persisted in the capital.
	   The Eiffel Tower _ the most visited monument in Paris _ stood
empty for a fifth day, with striking workers refusing to back down
on their demand for more personnel. Management proposed to meet
with unions Wednesday, but had not yet received a response from
labor leaders, according to the Eiffel Tower's press office.
	   Striking workers continued their protest at the National
Library, barring access for the third straight week to the
high-tech facility that opened for researchers less than a month
ago.
	   The strike was launched by library workers fed up with computer
glitches that delay the automatic delivery of books and research
materials. They are demanding better working conditions and for the
library to close on Mondays.
	   Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann said Tuesday she planned to
meet with the library's director and with workers, but she remained
firm that the library should stay open on Mondays.
	   The strikes are the latest in a series of social protests that
have swept France this fall. Last month thousands of high school
students took to the streets demanding smaller classes and better
facilities. Transit strikes have also hit a number of cities.

Norway's spy catcher writes of life as a double-agent against
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ All he wanted in his get-togethers with
``Charlie'' was to have a few beers and some conversation; what he
got was four harrowing years as a double-agent.
	   In a book being published Wednesday, Svein-Erik Lamark tells of
how he became a key figure in Norway's biggest spy case since the
Cold War.
	   In ``Codename Seagull'', excerpts of which were printed Tuesday
in Norwegian papers, Lamark says his cloak-and-dagger life began in
early 1994 when a Russian diplomat named Igor Chalyi visited his
office.
	   Lamark worked with the Ministry of Municipalities as an expert
on the Barents Sea region, the northern edge of Europe where Norway
and Russia come together _ the only Russia-NATO border. Contact
with Oslo-based Russian officials was part of his job.
	   As Lamark and Chalyi _ later code-named ``Charlie'' _ shared a
few beers during subsequent meetings, the Norwegian felt a growing
sense of unease.
	   ``If he is a spy, this is a dangerous matter,'' wrote Lamark.
	   In June of that year, a Police Intelligence Service agent _
code-named ``Odd'' _ told Lamark that the agency knew of his
contact with Chalyi and wanted him to be a double agent. Lamark
agreed, and was told to keep any money the Russians gave him.
	   Lamark says Chalyi wanted information about Norway's NATO
policies and about the country's petroleum strategy; Norway is the
world's second-largest oil exporter. Chalyi also wanted him to
recruit spies, Lamark says.
	   According to Lamark, the Russians offered him dlrs 100,000 a
year. He accepted, but feared for his own fate if he were caught
and only ``Odd'' knew of his real role.
	   Lamark wrote that ``Charlie'' was pleased with the information
he had provided, but insisted that the Norwegian meet his
spymasters in Moscow. Lamark briefed an editor at the Verdens Gang
newspaper about his actions in order ``to have my back covered.''
	   At Christmas 1994, Lamark chuckled over two bottles of whiskey
he'd gotten as gifts: one was from Russia's ambassador and the
other from Norway's counterintelligence chief.
	   In October 1996, Labor Party leader Thorbjoern Jagland became
prime minister. ``Charlie'' wanted to know who Jagland planned to
appoint as his top political advisors. Lamark read the list, and
was surprised by the Russian's reaction to one name.
	   ``He was wild, like fans after a goal at a soccer match,'' wrote
Lamark. He quoted the Russian as saying ``This is a person we know
well and can work with.''
	   Lamark said he told ``Odd,'' who confirmed that the advisor was
already being watched, but that police could only warn the
government of a suspected Russian spy in their midst. The advisor
is not named in the book.
	   Lamark's secret life ended when Norway expelled five Russian
diplomats for spying on March 12. A day later, Lamark, who had been
ordered to remain silent, went to the news media with his story,
mainly to protect himself.
	   ``It was an exciting and demanding game, which combined acting
with a need for analytical talents, and at the same time there was
always the danger of being found out,'' said Lamark at the time.
	   When reached by The Associated Press at his office on Tuesday,
Lamark refused to discuss the book.

Opposition confirms election winners

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ A center-right conservative coalition
has won weekend parliamentary elections over the former communists
now in government, final vote tallies released Tuesday show.
	   The State Electoral Committee said the coalition of VMRO-DPMNE
and Democratic Alternative garnered 58 seats in the 120-seat
legislature.
	   Both the incumbents and the election winners place importance in
having good relations with NATO and with Yugoslavia, dominated by
Serbia _ a delicate balancing act considering Western condemnation
of Serbia's harsh crackdown on its ethnic Albanian separatists.
Macedonia has its own large and restive ethnic Albanian community,
nearly a quarter of the country's 2.2 million people.
	   NATO presence has been welcomed by the winners, but there are
doubts about the alliance's possible cross-border action in Kosovo.
	   ``We are against Macedonian territory being used for any kind of
hostile activity against any of the neighboring countries,'' a top
party official of the Democratic Alternative, Aleksandar Dimitrov,
told Associated Press on Tuesday.
	   ``We do not know exactly what obligations to NATO the existing
government has assumed,'' Dimitrov said, adding the winning
coalition has asked the government to put on hold ``such
activities'' until the entire election process is finished and new
parliament and resulting government formed.
	   The coalition has said it would not seek any ``radical changes''
in the existing foreign policy.
	   The Kosovo issue played big in Macedonian elections because of
occasional tensions between the government and the country's ethnic
Albanian community. Unlike in Serbia, however, Macedonia's ethnic
Albanians do not boycott elections and have been included in the
government.
	   Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia six years ago,
the only former republic to have done so peacefully.
	   The defeated Social Democrats _ the renamed Communists _ will be
the second largest in future parliament with 29 seats. An alliance
of the country's ethnic Albanian parties secured 24 seats, and
another seven seats went to three smaller parties.
	   Due to unspecified irregularities, voting will be repeated in
two electoral units _ for two seats in the single-chamber
parliament _ and at least one of these is expected to go to the
winning coalition.
	   The coalition, which has promised an economic upswing and
further development of democracy while continuing close ties to the
West, is expected to woo the support of several deputies of other
parties to secure a majority.
	   The outcome of the elections is important for NATO's plans to
use Macedonia for verifying the pullback of government troops in
Serbia's Kosovo province. Aerial surveillance operations and a
security force to protect the 2,000-strong ground verification
force in adjacent Kosovo are to be based in Macedonia.

Iran's top leader says U.S. intent on `total domination'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said
on Tuesday that the United States is intent on ``total domination''
of Iran and that severing relations with it was ``100 percent'' in
Iran's interest.
	   ``Today, on the surface it appears that the tone of American
officials has changed. However, the reality is the same,'' Khamenei
said in comments broadcast by Iranian radio.
	   America ``will not be happy with anything less than the total
domination of this country's political and economic resources,''
said Khamenei, who represents the dominant hard-line group in the
ruling clergy.
	   His comments challenge the softer approach of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has suggested cultural exchanges between
Iranians and Americans.
	   Khamenei was speaking to mark the Iranian national day, which,
he pointed out, coincided with the anniversary of the days when
students, fired by the spirit of 1979 Islamic Revolution, took over
the U.S. embassy in Tehran.
	   The revolution toppled the U.S.-backed shah's regime and
installed the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
Khamenei's predecessor.
	   Radical Muslim students stormed the U.S. Embassy on Nov. 4, 1979
and took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The event led to the
severing of U.S.-Iran relations.
	   Khamenei said the breaking of ties was in Iran's interest,
contrary to the claims of the ``enemy.''
	   ``They spread rumors in their propaganda that the severing of
ties ... is to the detriment of the Iranian nation. No sir. It is
100 percent in the interest of the Iranian nation,'' he said.
	   Khamenei noted that Iran is free of the foreign domination which
characterized its history.
	   ``In the years before the revolution, the further back you go,
you see misery, humiliation, poverty, various pressures exerted by
the ruling classes and the domination, bullying and humiliation of
our nation by foreign powers.
	   ``Today, when you look at the world's political horizons, you
will see that if there is only one nation that is not under any
kind of foreign domination, that nation is the Iranian nation,''
Khamenei said.

European central banker says monetary policy no cure for economic
</HEADLINE>
problems &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The head of the European Central Bank
said Tuesday monetary policy was not a tool to deal with problems
like high unemployment, swatting away calls by some European
finance ministers for central banks to adjust policy to boost the
job market.
	   ``Monetary policy cannot solve structural problems,'' said Wim
Duisenberg, speaking at a regular news conference after a meeting
of the governing council of the European Central Bank.
	   Duisenberg heads the powerful body setting financial policy for
the single European currency, the euro, to be launched Jan. 1.
	   The ``decisive contribution of monetary policy to the fostering
of growth and employment'' was a medium-term policy to keep
inflation low, Duisenberg said.
	   Recent calls by Germany's new Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine
for central bankers to consider their role in cutting unemployment,
as well as ensuring price stability, have been coolly received by
most central bankers.
	   In an apparent reference to those calls, Duisenberg said using
monetary policy to adjust structural problems could undermine
confidence, compounding those problems.
	   A more relaxed fiscal policy, coupled with higher wage increases
key German unions have demanded could add a ``high degree of
uncertainty'' to the world economy, Duisenberg said.
	   Furthermore, Europe's economies could weaken next year and the
world economy would remain troubled, in spite of a modest firming
in recent weeks, he said.
	   Duisenberg heads the ECB's governing council, which discussed at
its regular meeting merging financial polices of the 11 European
nations participating in the Jan. 1 launch of the euro.
	   Among the tasks ahead for the ECB's council, comprised of
central bankers from the 11 nations, is setting a single European
interest rate, which would result in lower interest rates in most
EU countries.
	   The bankers are expected to set Europe's unified interest rate
to match Germany's core rate of 3.3 percent. About half the
countries launching the euro currency have rates higher than that.
	   Duisenberg didn't exclude a rate alteration, saying ``It's
nonsense to say that rates couldn't be lowered or raised,'' before
the end of the year, without elaborating.
	   Two countries joining the euro _ Spain and Portugal _ on Tuesday
cut rates to help the process of convergence, as the merging of
interest rates into a single euro rate is called.
	   Spain cut rates from 3.75 to 3.5 percent. Portugal cut rates
from 4 to 3.75 percent.
	   Sweden also cut a key rate from 4.1 to 3.85 percent, although
the country won't join the euro on Jan. 1.
	   The ECB gave rate convergence ``the highest priority,'' and they
were expected to converge by Jan. 1, Duisenberg said. ``There is
continued coordination across Europe going on between national
central banks,'' he said.

Mitch leaves more dead in Mexico before dissipating off coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ The remnants of deadly
Hurricane Mitch dissipated off the Mexican coast on Tuesday, but
not before claiming final victims in the southern state of Chiapas.
	   Five people died Monday when their car was carried away by the
flooded Cacaluta River about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of
the Guatemalan border, according to Deputy State Attorney General
Jorge Espinosa.
	   He said the driver tried to cross the usually small river across
a temporary road base placed after massive flooding in the area
earlier this year had knocked out a bridge.
	   But rains from Mitch had flooded the river again, washing away
the road base, and the car was carried away.
	   Several hundred people were evacuated in the southernmost tip of
Mexico on Monday due to rivers swollen by the storm.

	   BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) _ FC Brugge denied VfB Stuttgart a second
miracle in as many UEFA Cup rounds Tuesday, ending a nine-man
comeback attempt with a goal from Alexandar Ilic for a 3-2 win that
qualifies the Belgian champion for the third round.
	   Both sides had played to a 1-1 draw in Germany two weeks ago.
	   After Stuttgart came close to the impossible again by coming
back from behind twice when two men had already been sent off with
reds cards, Brugge pounded the German defense till it finally broke
in the 115th minute.
	   Serb playmaker Ilic headed home a cross from Sven Vermant in the
near corner for the late decider, finally knocking the last wind
out of the incredible Germans.
	   Fredi Bobic had put Stuttgart in a winning position three
minutes earlier with a fierce left-foot shot for 2-2.

Albanian leader makes first visit to countryside

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova made a rare trip into Kosovo's countryside Tuesday with a
U.S. envoy and said he was struck by both the widespread
destruction and signs of hope.
	   Rugova accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who is anxious
to show peace is returning to the disputed province, on a tour of
villages that were on the front line of fighting between Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas last month.
	   He called his outing ``the beginning of the liberation,'' noting
it was his first time visiting Kosovo villages since he became
involved in politics in 1989, when Serbian authorities stripped the
region of its autonomy.
	   There has been no fighting since an Oct. 12 peace agreement
aimed at halting seven months of clashes that killed hundreds of
people and drove an estimated 300,000 from their homes. But
sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with intimidation
by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic Albanians from returning
home in some areas.
	   Rugova said after his tour that although some refugees were
going home, others were staying away because of the continued Serb
police presence throughout Kosovo.
	   ``I did see lots of destruction of property and houses, but
still I did see a beginning of people returning to their homes,''
he said.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home.''
	   In the village of Banja, 35 kilometers (21 miles) southwest of
Pristina, he spoke with ethnic Albanians in the shadow of a mosque
with a destroyed minaret.
	   ``I'm happy that you came here and that you are working day and
night for us,'' said Fahredin Shurdhaj, who greeted Rugova with a
kiss on the cheek.
	   Further down the road in Orahovac, a town populated by both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, a Serb teen-ager complained to Rugova
that his father was missing because of the turmoil. Replying in
Serbian, Rugova said: ``We are together in this.''
	   Hill, who is trying to set up negotiations between Albanians and
Serbs on a political agreement to set up a three-year interim
period of self-rule for Albanians in Kosovo, said progress had been
made despite the ``shocking'' amount of damage to burned-out
houses.
	   ``We can see clearly that there are changes out there and that
people have indeed begun to return to their homes,'' he said. ``Now
we must make sure that they are able to stay in their homes, that
they are never driven from their homes again. And to do that we
need a lasting settlement.''
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, while Serbs insist that Kosovo
remain part of Serbian territory.
	   While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands
to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown began
last February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that more
special police and soldiers must go.
	   The guerrillas also warned that no political settlement for the
province is possible without their consent.
	   ``Sidelining the KLA from political issues ... will provoke
negative consequences in the search for a solution for Kosovo,''
said a statement by the rebels obtained by The Associated Press.
	   The guerrillas say they won't compromise in their push for
independence.
	   ``My job is to help ... make my country and people free,'' said
Ramush Haradinaj, a 30-year-old KLA commander, at Jablanica in
central Kosovo.
	   ``We see some good things,'' he said. ``But it is not enough.''

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A sordid tale of greed, jealousy and hate
came to a close Tuesday when a Milan court convicted the ex-wife of
fashion heir Maurizio Gucci of his contract murder and sentenced
her to 29 years in prison.
	   All five defendants in the trial were convicted of premeditated
murder, with the accused hitman getting the stiffest sentence, life
imprisonment. Italy does not have the death penalty.
	   Onetime-socialite Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, dubbed the
``black widow'' by Italy's press, blinked a few times when the
judge read out her sentence for the murder of her ex-husband and
then, her eyes red-rimmed, lowered her head.
	   Gucci, the last of his family to hold a stake in the maker of
luxury loafers, handbags and other accessories with the famed
double-G logo, was shot four times as he walked into his office
building on March 27, 1995.
	   Prosecutors alleged that Reggiani Martinelli, 49, paid the four
co-defendants to eliminate Gucci, whom she had publicly made clear
she despised. They painted her as a greedy woman who wasn't content
with her dlrs 860,000 a year alimony and feared that Gucci's new
companion would devour his wealth.
	   Earlier in the day, when Judge Renato Semek Ludovico allowed the
defendants one last plea to the jury, Reggiani Martinelli declared:
``I was naive to the point of stupidity,'' renewing her denial that
she had ordered the slaying.
	   After the verdict, she told her lawyer, ``Truth is the child of
time,'' recounted the attorney, Giovanni Maria Dedola.
	   Reggiani and the triggerman, former auto mechanic Benedetto
Ceraulo, maintained their innocence; the other three defendants
confessed.
	   The three included Reggiani Martinelli's former best friend,
Giuseppina Auriemma, who played psychic to Milan society, and whom,
prosecutors contended, Gucci's ex-wife asked to organize the
killing. Auriemma was sentenced to 25 years.
	   Also convicted were Ivano Savioni, a doorman in a rundown hotel
in Milan's prostitution district who allegedly acted as the
go-between, and the alleged driver of the getaway car, Orazio
Cicala, whose failed pizzeria and gambling habits left him in debt.
Savioni was sentenced to 26 years and Cicala got 29.
	   Throughout the trial, Reggiani Martinelli showed no remorse for
Gucci's end. Once glamorous, with coiffed hair and heavy jewelry
and makeup, she grew wan and often had a vacant look since the
trial began in May. Most of her emotion came out in the form of
bitterness for what she saw as Auriemma's betrayal.
	   Reggiani Martinelli admitted freely that she wanted Gucci dead
but argued that Auriemma coldly converted her well-known hatred
toward him into an excuse to blackmail her after the slaying.
	   ``Never let the friendly fox into your chicken coop. Sooner or
later, it could get hungry,'' Gucci's ex-wife said as she began her
final plea to the court.
	   Payments totaling dlrs 375,000 made to co-defendants, she
argued, were really blackmail money for a murder that she desired
but didn't order.
	   With its courtroom revelations about greed, betrayal and
shameless social climbing, the trial exposed a seamy side of the
chic capital of Italy's fashion industry.
	   The Guccis had long left the fashion business, however.
	   Gucci sold the last family stake in the company in 1993 for dlrs
120 million after a long history of family infighting and went on
to live the good life, including a villa in St. Moritz and a
70-meter (215-foot) yacht.
	   Defense lawyers promised an appeal.
	   ``The fact that she was sentenced to less than life imprisonment
means there was some doubt,'' Reggiani Martinelli's lawyer said.
	   Convicts in Italy often are released after serving two-thirds of
their sentence, meaning, along with time in custody since her
January 1997 arrest, Gucci's ex-wife might end up doing less than
18 years.
	   ``It confused suspicion with proof,'' Raffaele Della Valle said.
	   Reggiani Martinelli's mother and one of her two daughters,
Allegra, 17, were in court before the jury recessed for its
seven-hour deliberations.
	   No family members were present for the verdict. Allegra broke
into tears at the news, her mother's lawyer said.
	   The jury also awarded dlrs 125,000 in damages to the Gucci
office doorman, Giuseppe Onorato, who was shot in the arm while
sweeping leaves near the entrance when his boss was killed.

Monaco pounds Graz AK 4-0 to reach last 16

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) - Boosted by a pair of early goals, Monaco beat
Austria's Graz AK 4-0 on Wednesday and easily qualify for the last
16 of the UEFA Cup with a 7-3 aggregate win.
	   Monaco, last year's Champions League semifinalists, never looked
in trouble against the Austrians after opening the scoring as early
as the eighth minute.
	   The away defense cleared a corner, but the ball fell to Frank
Gava, who fired in a stunning left-footed volley from 25 meters
(yards).
	   Within ten minutes Robert Spehar, one of the scorers in the
first leg, made it 2-0.
	   Nigerian striker Victor Ikpeba dashed down the left wing, and
crossed to the unmarked Croatian, who calmly headed in from 10
yards (meters).
	   Monaco, who conceded a late equalizer in the first leg 3-3 draw
two weeks ago, moved up another gear, and penned in the Graz AK
defense for most of the first half.
	   Djibril Diawara put the game beyond doubt with a fine individual
effort early in the second half.
	   The 23-year-old Senegalese utility player danced through the
Graz AK defense before rounding the goalkeeper and tapping the ball
into the net.
	   Then Gava latched on to a long through ball to score his second
of the match and make it 4-0.

Albanian leader makes first visit to countryside
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with new comments from Rugova, KLA,
guerrilla commander; TRIMS. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova returned to Kosovo's countryside Tuesday with a U.S. envoy
anxious to show peace is returning to the disputed province.
	   The trip marked the first time in nine years that Rugova toured
sections of a province he was elected to lead. Accompanied by U.S.
envoy Christopher Hill, Rugova visited the front line where Serb
forces and ethnic Albanian guerrillas battled last month.
	   Rugova called his outing Tuesday ``the beginning of the
liberation,'' noting it was his first time visiting Kosovo villages
since he became involved in politics in 1989, when Serbian
authorities stripped the region of its autonomy.
	   The fighting ended with the Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that
averted NATO airstrikes on Milosevic's forces in Kosovo.
	   Under the agreement, the forces have withdrawn from Kosovo and
some of the tens of thousands of refugees in the region have
started returning home.
	   ``I did see lots of destruction of property and houses, but
still I did see a beginning of people returning to their homes,''
Rugova said.
	   Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with
intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent people from going
home in some areas.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
people, complain of routine harassment and detention by Serb
police. The lack of free movement intensified in a Serb crackdown
on Albanian separatists that began in February.
	   Subsequent fighting left hundreds dead, sent an estimated
300,000 fleeing and caused NATO to threaten airstrikes that forced
Milosevic into the agreement with Holbrooke.
	   In the village of Banja, 20 miles southwest of Pristina, Rugova
spoke with ethnic Albanians in the shadow of a mosque with a
destroyed minaret.
	   ``I'm happy that you came here and that you are working day and
night for us,'' said Fahredin Shurdhaj, who greeted Rugova with a
kiss on the cheek.
	   Further down the road in Orahovac, a town populated by both
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, a Serb teen-ager complained to Rugova
that his father was missing because of the turmoil.
	   ``We are together in this,'' Rugova replied.
	   Afterward, Rugova said that although some refugees were going
home, others were staying away because of the continued Serb police
presence throughout Kosovo.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home,'' he said.
	   Hill, who is trying to set up negotiations between Albanians and
Serbs on a political agreement to set up a three-year interim
period of self-rule for Albanians in Kosovo, said progress had been
made.
	   ``We can see clearly that there are changes out there and that
people have indeed begun to return to their homes,'' he said. ``Now
we must make sure that they are able to stay in their homes, that
they are never driven from their homes again. And to do that we
need a lasting settlement.''
	   Albanians want the region to be a republic in Yugoslavia, like
Serbia and Montenegro, while Serbs insist it remain a Serbian
province.
	   While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands
to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the February
crackdown, the guerrilla Kosovo Liberation Army says more special
police and soldiers must go.
	   The guerrillas also warned that no political settlement for the
province is possible without their consent.
	   ``Sidelining the KLA from political issues ... will provoke
negative consequences in the search for a solution for Kosovo,''
said a statement by the rebels obtained by The Associated Press.
	   The guerrillas say they won't compromise in their push for
independence.
	   ``My job is to help ... make my country and people free,'' said
Ramush Haradinaj, a 30-year-old KLA commander, at Jablanica in
central Kosovo.
	   ``We see some good things,'' he said. ``But it is not enough.''

Malaria kills more than 270 in Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ An outbreak of malaria has left more than
270 people dead, mostly children, in several parts of southern
Yemen, health officials said Tuesday.
	   The hardest hit is the province of al-Dali, 200 kilometers (130
miles) southeast of San'a, where 156 people have died since early
last month, said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In the area of Mawiya, 200 kilometers (130 miles) south of
San'a, 73 people died and 44 others died in the province of Lahij,
280 kilometers (180 miles) south of San'a, they said.
	   The officials said hospitals in the infected areas are unable to
cope with the high number of patients.
	   The health ministry has dispatched several medical teams and
medicine to the affected areas. No other details were available.
	   Heavy rains more than two months ago left pools of stagnant
water, allowing malarial mosquitoes to breed, said the officials.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country of 17 million in the southern
part of the Arabian Peninsula, spends only 400 riyals (dlrs 3)
annually per person for health care.

	   BRUGGE: for 2-2.
	   Stuttgart had made its own comeback near impossible when,
already trailing 1-0, Pablo Thiam and Kristian Djordevic were sent
off with their second yellow cards in the second half.
	   But as it proved with a 3-0 win at Feyenoord following a 3-1
home loss in the first UEFA Cup round, never count Stuttgart out.
	   When Djordevic was sent off in the 73rd minute it seemed the
game was over, Brugge leading on an Olivier De Cock goal and facing
just nine men.
	   But Dutch captain Frank Verlaat gave the Germans hope again,
equalizing with a glancing header in the 76th minute.
	   Buoyed on by the 13,000 fans at the Jan Breydel Stadium, Brugge
went looking for the decider but long failed to find a hole in the
depleted German ranks.
	   Chance seemed to be on Stuttgart's side too. Brugge's Nzelo
Lembi and Khalilou Fadiga hit the bar and the post in a furious
95th minute.
	   Brugge went ahead 2-1 in the 105th minute when Gert Claessens
knocked in a rebound from Stuttgart goalie Marc Ziegler, who was
unable to stop a shot from Fadiga.
	   In a seesaw show of shifting fortunes, Bobic's goal proved to be
insufficient and Ilic prevailed.
	   ``This is truly amazing,'' said Brugge captain Franky Vander
Elst after the match. And, at 37, he has already seen it all.
	   Brugge, which had enough with a goalless draw to advance to the
next round, never held back and boldly went for victory from the
start.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said
Tuesday he had authorized talks with groups linked to the militant
Basque ETA separatists, marking the first time his government has
taken steps to negotiate an end to the 30-year conflict.
	   ``There are news reports that I have authorized contacts. It's
true,'' Aznar said upon his return from a trip to London.
	   The contacts would be through the Basque National Liberation
Movement, a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist
organizations, a spokesman for Aznar's office said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   ``The contacts, that have not happened up until now, will take
place with the go-betweens of ETA's world,'' the spokesman said.
``We cannot say anything yet about the how, who and when.''
	   The official government spokesman, Josep Pique, told reporters
that the contacts were aimed at exploring possibilities opened up
by the cease-fire, ``to find out whether (ETA) is really willing to
give up violence for good.''
	   ETA ushered in the Basque peace process two months ago when it
declared an indefinite cease-fire in its campaign for a Basque
homeland straddling northern Spain and southern France.
	   Groups close to ETA said the truce was modeled on the Northern
Irish process that led to last April's peace accord and urged the
government to promote a negotiated settlement as British Prime
Minister Tony Blair had done in Northern Ireland.
	   Irish republican leader Gerry Adams visited the Basque region
last month and urged Aznar's government to respond positively to
the cease-fire by opening negotiations for peace.
	   A group of Basque political parties and organizations known as
the Irish Forum secured Adams' backing for its proposal, known as
the Lizarra Declaration, for all-party peace talks, including the
government and ETA.
	   The government rejected the proposal at the time.
	   Extensive peace talks between a Spanish government and ETA have
not taken place since 1989 when the Socialist party was in power.
	   The failure of these talks, held in Algeria, was subsequently
used to justify hard-line policies ruling out a negotiated solution
to the conflict.
	   Aznar's tough stand against ETA _ including the arrest of Basque
militants, the dismantling of a major ETA financial network and the
closing of an allied daily newspaper _ is believed to have been a
factor in bringing about the cease-fire.
	   The Irish Forum includes Herri Batasuna, the political coalition
linked to ETA, as well as moderate Basque nationalist parties,
labor unions and civic groups.
	   Responding to Aznar's announcement Tuesday, Herri Batasuna
issued a statement stressing ``the need for dialogue and
negotiation as the only valid way to address the conflict''.
	   ``We are faced with an historic opportunity that requires vision
and courage,'' the group said.

	   PARIS (AP) _ After a voyage to the depths of the polluted
Caspian Sea, the heir to Jacques Cousteau's legacy said Tuesday he
wants to clean up the landlocked body, source of much of the
world's finest caviar.
	   ``The work of Capt. Cousteau must not stop,'' said New Zealand
yachtsman Sir Peter Blake.
	   ``We must build on it rather than diminish it because it will be
for the benefit of the world,'' he told a news conference at UNESCO
headquarters in Paris.
	   Sitting beside Blake, Cousteau's widow, Francine, said the
recent Caspian expedition was unprecedented, and could help
civilization ``millions of years into the future.''

republics of Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan.

UN agency urges nations to fish less and save sharks and seabirds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Faced with depleting fish stocks and alarmed by the
potential damage to their economies, more than 80 nations on
Tuesday approved a voluntary agreement to limit fishing worldwide.
	   Under the accord, nations also pledged to protect sharks and
seabirds. Each year, thousands of sharks are accidentally caught in
nets used by tuna fishermen while thousands of seabirds die when
they try to feed off bait on fishing lines and become ensnared by
the hooks.
	   The document was adopted at a weeklong conference at the
Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
and has been submitted to the agency's fishing committee for final
approval, expected in February.
	   ``In most cases, the greatest risk is not the extinction of fish
species but the extinction of economies,'' said Serge Garcia,
director of FAO's Fisheries Resources Division.
	   The world ocean catch is valued at about dlrs 80 billion a year,
and fish farming adds another dlrs 42 billion. Fisheries employ
about 200 million people worldwide.
	   Garcia said that too many fish are being caught every year,
preventing many species from reaching reproduction age and causing
the number of fish in the ocean to drop. He estimated that an
additional 10 million tons of fish could be caught each year if
stocks were allowed to regenerate.
	   ``If we reduce our fishing capacity, the fish will be bigger and
there will be more of them,'' said Garcia. He said governments
needed to restrict fishing licenses and encourage the retirement of
vessels, two key recommendations in the accord.
	   China, Russia, Japan, the United States and India lead the world
in fishing tonnage, according to 1995 figures. Backers of the
accord said it won the approval of all the key fishing nations,
including the United States.
	   What has happened with cod in Canada is a prime example of
overfishing, said Garcia. There, the average life of cod, which is
20 years when they are undisturbed, has dropped to just 3, far
below the age when they can start spawning.
	   Species most at risk of further depletion include Atlantic cod
and redfish, haddock, anchovy, swordfish and tunas such as bluefin,
bigeye and albacore.
	   FAO said that an increased trade in shark fins and other exotic
shark products in recent years has critically endangered several
species.
	   The accord asks nations to adopt protective measures including
special nets with holes for sharks to escape. It also calls on
fishermen who accidentally catch sharks to put them back in the
ocean alive and withdraw any hooks from their jaws.

Caspian fishing, another lawmaker urging corruption investigation

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ About 5,500 Russian officials are under
investigation for taking bribes this year, and Russia's economic
troubles are creating a breeding ground for corruption, the
interior minister said Tuesday.
	   ``A poverty-stricken official is always prone to crime,'' Sergei
Stepashin told a news conference.
	   He called for increasing salaries of police and other officials,
sharply devalued by a steep dive of the Russian currency since the
government stopped propping up the ruble in August.
	   Russian police have undertaken a massive effort to combat graft,
including corruption in its own ranks, but the problem has
continued to plague the government, Stepashin said.
	   ``We are especially concerned about corruption on the grassroots
level, such as bribe-taking among traffic police and various small
offices,'' he said.
	   Stepashin urged the government to radically streamline the
bureaucracy to reduce the opportunities for bribery.
	   Stepashin mentioned several high-profile corruption cases,
including the arrest last summer of top officials with the
government's statistics service, accused of falsifying data to help
big companies dodge taxes. Police found more than dlrs 1 million in
cash at suspects' homes.
	   Meanwhile, a lawmaker in the southern republic of Dagestan was
arrested Tuesday and charged with embezzling 800 million rubles
(dlrs 50 million) in government funds intended for fish
conservation efforts in the Caspian Sea.
	   The arrest, cited by the ITAR-Tass news agency, came the day
after Dagestan's Justice Minister was charged with embezzling other
funds.
	   Also Tuesday, the head of the Russian parliament's security
committee, Viktor Ilyukhin, urged the Prosecutor General's office
to investigate 15 top officials in the State Customs Committee on
possible corruption charges, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Last week, Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent liberal lawmaker and a
presidential hopeful, caused an uproar when he said Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's new government is as prone to corruption as its
predecessors.
	   On Monday, Yavlinsky specified his accusations in a letter sent
to Primakov, urging him to investigate past business connections of
several high-ranking Cabinet members and their lobbying efforts for
business interests.
	   Primakov criticized Yavlinsky for failing to provide evidence,
but instructed his aides to investigate into the accusations and
prepare a detailed response.
	   The Prosecutor General's office, meanwhile, has ordered a
preliminary investigation on possible libel charges against
Yavlinsky over the allegations.
	   Stepashin on Tuesday described Yavlinsky's accusations as a
publicity effort and called on him to provide hard facts.
	   Yavlinsky, in his turn, has said that he simply wanted to draw
public attention to the problem and it remained up to police and
prosecutors to collect specific evidence.

Communists push for medical inspection of Yeltsin

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 13-14 with aide saying Yeltsin to fulfill
Kremlin duties, resume meetings with governors. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hard-liners in Russia's parliament were demanding
details of Boris Yeltsin's health, while the recuperating president
held private talks Tuesday with his defense minister in southern
Russia.
	   The lower house of Russia's parliament, the State Duma, will
consider a bill Thursday that would require Yeltsin to undergo a
medical checkup. If the bill is approved, presidential doctors
would have to release their conclusions following an exam.
	   The bill requires the checkup be carried out by the medical
department of Yeltsin's office, not an independent team. To become
law, the bill would have to be approved by the upper house and
Yeltsin himself, who is almost certain to veto it.
	   The president's envoy to parliament, Alexander Kotenkov, said
the bill had little chance of success.
	   ``Apart from being tactless, the document is illegal,'' he said
on Tuesday.
	   Kotenkov and other critics of the bill said a specific reference
to Yeltsin effectively turns it into an administrative directive to
the presidential doctors _ something that the Duma has no right to
pass.
	   Communist Partly leader Gennady Zyuganov insisted the law should
be approved.
	   ``He (Yeltsin) is an absolutely irresponsible person and is
incapable of running the country,'' he said. ``We are governed by
an unsober person. In effect, the president has become a full-blown
alcoholic.''
	   Communists and other Yeltsin foes have long accused the
president of drinking heavily, a charge the president has denied.
Zyuganov has been increasingly blunt in recent days.
	   ``Alcoholism isn't an insult, it's a disease that is very
difficult to cure,'' Zyuganov said Tuesday.
	   Yeltsin, resting at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, is recovering
from what his aides call fatigue and high blood pressure. The
latest illness has again brought a new round of calls for the
president's resignation by his Communist foes.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no serious illness and says he will serve
out his term that runs until the middle of the year 2000.
	   Presidential aide Oleg Sysuyev said Tuesday that Yeltsin would
``fully perform'' his Kremlin and constitutional duties.
	   Yeltsin also planned to resume long-delayed meetings with
governors and presidential envoys to Russian regions, Sysuyev said
during a visit to Strasbourg, France, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Yeltsin met with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on Tuesday to
discuss military reform and building housing for retired officers.
Russian television showed brief footage of a smiling Yeltsin
welcoming Sergeyev to his residence and then sitting across from
him behind a small table.
	   Yeltsin, dressed in a dark cardigan and white shirt, looked
tired but displayed no visible signs of illness.
	   The president began a two-week stay in Sochi on Friday. He had
been working only sporadically in recent weeks because of his poor
health.

	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescuers have found more than 1,900
bodies in the mud that runs down the volcano and sweeps down these
broad, flat plains, the mayor of this municipality said Tuesday.
	   A two-hour walk out of the town's center and into the sugar cane
fields turned up 22 bodies still in plain view _ bloated, scratched
and tangled in trees, cane stalks and mud.
	   ``It is full, full of bodies,'' Ariel Mendoza, a 26-year-old
construction worker said, pointing at the Casitas volcano. ``From
where the mud starts, down to the sea.''
	   Mayor Felicita Zeledon of Posoltega, the largest city near the
disaster area, said in a live radio interview Tuesday that 1,930
cadavers had been recovered in villages below Casitas volcano.
	   Other officials gave lower, but still ghastly calculations of
the death toll here: The Red Cross said 1,250. The president's
office said 1,338.
	   Bodies found Tuesday were being burned to prevent the spread of
disease, Zeledon said.
	   Nicaragua's Health Ministry said it was dispatching medical
brigades to help recover and bury bodies and to fumigate the
region.
	   Villagers said they found about 200 bodies here at the San Pablo
sugar cane plantation, just outside of town.
	   Amid the crushed cane stalks lie muddy shoes, purses, tires, a
colander.
	   The stench of death crops up every few hundred yards where a
body lies: A little girl with her hair braided into the cane stalks
by the slide. A man still wearing boots, but nothing else. A boy,
perhaps 8, snuggled under a tree trunk. Or just an arm sticking out
of the mud.
	   The government urged people living near Casitas and eight other
nearby volcanos to evacuate their homes Tuesday for fear of new
mudslides. More heavy rains have been falling in recent days.
	   Another small mudslide on the northern slope of the Casitas
volcano wiped out 34 houses Monday night, but there were no
apparent casualties, Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said.
	   Residents ``must be mindful of the situation and look for
refuge,'' President Arnoldo Aleman said.
	   Central American officials say more than 7,000 people died in
floods and mudslides triggered by Mitch, one of the strongest
hurricanes ever to hit the Caribbean.
	   The tragedy here occurred Friday morning following pounding
rains. Part of the crater in the Casitas volcano collapsed and the
lake inside formed a deluge down the slope.
	   Ricardo Donaires, 34, his wife, and their baby boy spent three
days in the open on a hilltop in the village of Rolando Rodriguez
before hiking to safety on Monday.
	   ``We suffered without eating and without drinking water for
three days,'' Donaires said, now at a schoolhouse converted into an
emergency shelter in Posoltega.
	   At first, soldiers struggled to bury bodies where they lay. But
with the fear of epidemics growing, civilian volunteers set out
from the nearby community of Chichigalpa to burn bodies.
	   ``We need the government to send us gasoline if they want to
avoid an epidemic,'' said Robert Lopez Marcia, a member of
Chichigalpa's emergency commission.
	   At an improvised shelter at a Chichigalpa elementary school,
doctors were in desperate need of medicine, antibiotics and
bandages, and there was little clean water or food. Children lay on
desks with bloody bandages on their heads.
	   Along the Pan American highway, thousands of people walked in
the pouring rain, some leaving the disaster area, others going in
to search for family members.
	   ``The only thing the federal government does is ask us for a
number every half hour _ how many dead, how many injured,''
complained Chichigalpa Mayor Elijio Palacio. ``But they don't send
us anything.''

	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ Darko Kovacevic scored twice to lead
Real Sociedad to a 3-0 drubbing of Dynamo Moscow on Tuesday and
advance his team to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   The aggregate score was 6-2 since Real beat Dynamo 3-2 in Moscow
two weeks ago in the first leg of the second round.
	   On Tuesday the two sides played a scoreless first half under
driving rain in Anoeta stadium in this seaside city in the Spanish
Basque country.
	   Kovacevic broke the ice in the 56th minute with a crisp header
after a corner kick from Francisco Jose de Pedro.
	   Five minutes later Ricardo Sa Pinto missed with a blazing
left-footed shot from just outside the area.
	   But in the 70th minute Oscar de Paula stole the ball on an error
by the Russian defense and dribbled past goalie Dmitry Tyapushkin,
who slid in a puddle of water in a vain attempt to stop the shot,
making the score 2-0.
	   Kovacevic, who came up with two goals in Moscow as well, scored
again in the 75th minute as Sa Pinto passed him the ball at
midfield and the Croat ran in solo, then arced the ball above
Tyapushkin's head when the Russian came out to meet him.
	   It was Kovacevic's fifth goal in UEFA Cup play this year.

Malaria kills more than 270 in Yemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ An outbreak of malaria has left more than
270 people dead, mostly children, in several parts of southern
Yemen, health officials said Tuesday.
	   The hardest hit is the province of al-Dali, 200 kilometers (130
miles) southeast of San'a, where 156 people have died since early
last month, said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In the area of Mawiya, 200 kilometers (130 miles) south of
San'a, 73 people died and 44 others died in the province of Lahij,
280 kilometers (180 miles) south of San'a, they said.
	   The officials said hospitals in the infected areas are unable to
cope with the high number of patients.
	   The health ministry has dispatched several medical teams and
medicine to the affected areas. No other details were available.
	   Heavy rains more than two months ago left pools of stagnant
water, allowing malarial mosquitoes to breed, said the officials.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country of 17 million in the southern
part of the Arabian Peninsula, spends only 400 riyals (dlrs 3)
annually per person for health care.

FC Brugge edges past 9-man Stuttgart in thriller

<TEXT>
	   BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) _ FC Brugge denied VfB Stuttgart a second
miracle in as many UEFA Cup rounds Tuesday, ending a nine-man
comeback attempt with a goal from Alexandar Ilic for a 3-2 win that
qualifies the Belgian champion for the third round.
	   Brugge advanced on a 4-3 aggregate score following a 1-1 draw in
Germany two weeks ago.
	   Both sides were 1-1 after regulation time on Tuesday, setting up
a spectacular finish in extra time.
	   After Stuttgart came close to the impossible by surging from
behind twice when two men had already been sent off with reds
cards, Brugge pounded the German defense till it finally broke in
the 115th minute.
	   Serb playmaker Ilic headed home a cross from Sven Vermant in the
near corner for the late decider, finally knocking the last wind
out of the incredible Germans.
	   ``We should have finished this off a lot earlier but we didn't.
So it turned into a real thriller,'' said FC Brugge coach Eric
Gerets.
	   Five minutes ahead of Ilic's goal, striker Fredi Bobic had put
Stuttgart with one foot in the third round with a fierce left-foot
shot for 2-2.
	   Stuttgart had made its own comeback near impossible in the
second half when, already trailing 1-0, Pablo Thiam t seemed the
game was over, Brugge leading on an Olivier De Cock goal and facing
just nine men.
	   But Dutch captain Frank Verlaat gave the Germans hope again,
equalizing with a glancing header in the 76th minute.
	   Buoyed on by the 13,000 fans at the Jan Breydel Stadium, Brugge
went looking for the decider but long failed to find a hole in the
depleted German ranks.
	   Chance seemed to be on Stuttgart's side too. Brugge's Nzelo
Lembi and Khalilou Fadiga hit the bar and the post in a furious
95th minute.
	   Brugge went ahead 2-1 in the 105th minute when Gert Claessens
knocked in a rebound from Stuttgart goalie Marc Ziegler, who was
unable to stop a shot from Fadiga.
	   In a seesaw show of shifting fortunes, Bobic's goal proved to be
insufficient and Ilic prevailed.
	   ``This is truly amazing,'' said Brugge captain Franky Vander
Elst after the match. And, at 37, he has already seen it all.
	   Brugge, which had enough with a goalless draw to advance to the
next round, never held back and boldly went for victory from the
start.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A sordid tale of greed, jealousy and hate
came to a close Tuesday when a Milan court convicted the ex-wife of
fashion heir Maurizio Gucci of his contract murder and sentenced
her to 29 years in prison.
	   All five defendants in the trial were convicted of premeditated
murder, with the accused hitman getting the stiffest sentence, life
imprisonment. Italy does not have the death penalty.
	   Onetime-socialite Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli, dubbed the
``black widow'' by Italy's press, blinked a few times when the
judge read out her sentence for the murder of her ex-husband and
then, her eyes red-rimmed, lowered her head.
	   Gucci, the last of his family to hold a stake in the maker of
luxury loafers, handbags and other accessories with the famed
double-G logo, was shot four times as he walked into his office
building on March 27, 1995.
	   Prosecutors alleged that Reggiani Martinelli, 49, paid the four
co-defendants to eliminate Gucci, whom she had publicly made clear
she despised. They painted her as a greedy woman who wasn't content
with her dlrs 860,000 a year alimony and feared that Gucci's new
companion would devour his wealth.
	   Earlier in the day, when Judge Renato Semek Ludovici allowed the
defendants one last plea to the jury, Reggiani Martinelli declared:
``I was naive to the point of stupidity,'' renewing her denial that
she had ordered the slaying.

Central American envoys appeal for help for hurricane victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mitch &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Calling Hurricane Mitch the worst natural
disaster to hit Central America this century, U.N. ambassadors from
five nations appealed Tuesday for international help to feed and
clothe the survivors and bury the dead.
	   Rebuilding the hardest-hit countries _ Honduras and Nicaragua _
will take many years and billions of dollars. But with victims
still clinging to trees and rooftops, the ambassadors said the
region's top priority is emergency assistance.
	   Central Americans struggled Tuesday to reach thousands of people
who remained stranded almost a week after Mitch barreled into the
Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290 kph) winds. The storm
pounded the isthmus, dropping up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of
rain in a six-hour period, before dissipating Monday in southern
Mexico.
	   The storm and its aftermath has killed more than 7,000 people,
most in Honduras and Nicaragua, and thousands remained stranded or
in shelters.
	   Honduran Ambassador Hugo Noe-Pino _ flanked by envoys from
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica _ said Tuesday
that the killer storm had put the country's development efforts
back by at least 30 years.
	   In Honduras, 75 bridges have collapsed, 70 percent of the
country's infrastructure has been damaged and 70 percent of its
gross domestic product has been lost, Noe-Pino said.
	   ``The need of food, medicine, clothes and other basic things is
very, very important,'' he said. ``The government is at this moment
unable by itself to assist all the people.''
	   The Red Cross has estimated that Honduras needs about dlrs 10
million in immediate assistance, he said, and overall damages could
reach at least dlrs 2 billion.
	   Noe-Pino said the two major banana companies in Honduras have
talked about a loss of dlrs 850 million. Coffee and melon export
crops also have been lost _ and the loss of domestic food crops is
so large that he predicted very serious food shortages.
	   Nicaraguan Ambassador Alfonso Ortega Urbina said 70 percent of
his country's infrastructure has been destroyed, including more
than 40 bridges.
	   ``The situation of the people is tragic. They don't have food.
They don't have shelters. They don't have clothes. So they're
desperately in need of help,'' he said. ``We will not have crops
for the next six months so there will be hunger.''
	   The Red Cross and countries including the United States,
Britain, Spain and Norway have provided some aid to the region, but
Nicaragua desperately needs more assistance, he said.
	   Ortega Urbina said the country needs dlrs 15 million to dlrs 20
million immediately for emergency aid to victims and to bury the
dead and get rid of thousands of animals killed in the hurricane.
	   Nicaragua also will not be able to pay the service on its
current debt of dlrs 1 billion, the ambassador said, blaming the
storm and urging international institutions and governments to help
the country's economy in this time of crisis.
	   The ambassadors of El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica also
appealed for assistance.
	   The five ambassadors later met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan. The U.N. General Assembly appealed Monday for speedy relief
to help victims on Hurricane Mitch.
	   The U.N. World Food announced Tuesday that it had distributed
over 100,000 tons of food previously earmarked for development
projects in Nicaragua and was distributing food in Honduras.
	   UNICEF said it had provided dlrs 20,000 worth of medicine to
Nicaragua and was shipping 500,000 sachets of oral rehydration
salts, used in cases of diarrhea and cholera. In Honduras, UNICEF
said it was providing food, drugs and blankets for several thousand
people and clean water for 62,500 people for a week.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ As government troops battled Tuesday to
retake a remote state capital from leftist rebels, the government
declared that it had no choice but to press on with efforts to seek
peace.
	   A presidential envoy said President Andres Pastrana would
inaugurate planned peace talks in the coming weeks with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, of FARC, the country's
oldest and most powerful insurgency.
	   The rebel group flattened a frontier police post Sunday with
homemade missiles in Mitu, a town of 15,000 inhabitants in
southeastern Vaupes state, near the border with Brazil. The
Colombian Red Cross, the only observers allowed access by the
rebels, said an estimated 60 officers and 10 civilians were killed
and as many as 45 police taken prisoner.
	   ``We are moved, we are hurt and we are saddened,'' government
peace commissioner Victor G. Ricardo told a news conference. ``But
the objective of the peace process is precisely to stop this river
of blood.''
	   The massive rebel attack on the eve of planned peace talks has
increased distrust of the guerrillas and forced the government to
justify concessions made to bring them to the table.
	   Pastrana, who took office in August vowing to end a 34-year
civil war, has agreed to begin peace talks without a cease-fire and
to withdraw the army from a Switzerland-size region. Critics say
the rebels will take advantage of the gesture _ set to be completed
by Saturday _ to tighten their grip on southern Colombia.
	   As a prelude to the talks, the rebels also want to exchange
captured soldiers and police _ up to about 290 after Sunday's siege
_ for 452 jailed guerrillas. Pastrana has so far not agreed to the
demand.
	   The armed forces commander, Gen. Fernando Tapias, said he could
not confirm the weekend death toll provided by the Red Cross, but
said eight security force members were killed and 20 wounded when
reinforcements airlifted into Brazilian jungles near Mitu were
repelled by waiting rebel fighters.
	   Tapias said army efforts to regain control of Mitu were
proceeding slowly to avoid killing civilians, which he said the
guerrillas were using as ``shields.''
	   The bloodshed has underscored the power of the rebels, who have
racked up victory after victory against poorly trained, dispirited
security forces _ and haven't lost a battle in nearly a decade.
	   A soldier who suffered bullet and shrapnel wounds in the
fighting outside Mitu said in an interview that his column was
ambushed by rebels with machine guns, grenades and mortars, and at
least five of his comrades were killed.
	   ``They are better armed than we are,'' Pvt. Cesar Tulio Espitia
told Radionet network from a hospital in San Jose del Guaviare, the
army's staging area 300 kilometers (190 miles) from the fighting.

Arafat arrives in Spain to explain new peace accord with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser arrived in Madrid
Tuesday night to hold talks with Spanish leaders on the new
land-for-security agreement he signed with Israel, the state news
agency Efe reported.
	   Arafat is to meet Wednesday with King Juan Carlos and Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar and have dinner with Foreign Minister
Abel Matutes.
	   The Palestinian leader is in Spain at the invitation of Matutes,
who was present when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu signed the peace agreement October 23 in Maryland.
	   The accord calls on Israel to withdraw from an additional 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Moslem extremists who oppose peace with Israel.
	   But problems have already emerged. Israel said Tuesday it will
not carry out the agreement until it gets assurances that the
Palestinian Authority headed by Arafat will arrest 30 Palestinian
fugitives.

First half explosion injuries fourth man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ A Belgian off-field official was injured
by the explosion of a device hurled from the stands at the end of
the first half of Fiorentina-Grasshoppers UEFA Cup match Tuesday
night.
	   The ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield helping the referee
and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a left knee injury.
	   Second half play was not resumed after the regular 15-minute
rest time as UEFA representatives were discussing whether re-start
or suspend the game.
	   The injured official was identified as Philippe Flament.
	   The second-round second-leg game between Fiorentina and the
Swiss team was being played in Salerno, southern Italy, to raise
funds for victims of recent floodings.
	   Fiorentina led 2-1 at halftime on two goals by its
Brazilian-born Belgian forward Luis Oliveira.
	   The explosion occurred as players and officials were walking to
the dressing rooms.
	   The noisy, powerful explosion caused a hole on the field.
	   The Belgian official was taken away on a stretcher and rushed to
hospital.
	   According to news and television reports his condition was not
serious.
	   It was not immediately clear who hurled the device.
	   Florentine and Salerno fans have a history of bitter rivalry and
were following the match in separated sectors.

Iran's top leader says U.S. intent on `total domination'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said
on Tuesday that the United States is intent on ``total domination''
of Iran and that severing relations with it was in Iran's interest.
	   ``Today, on the surface it appears that the tone of American
officials has changed. However, the reality is the same,'' Khamenei
said in comments broadcast by Iranian radio.
	   America ``will not be happy with anything less than the total
domination of this country's political and economic resources,''
said Khamenei, who represents the dominant hard-line group in the
ruling clergy.
	   His comments challenge the softer approach of moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has suggested cultural exchanges between
Iranians and Americans.
	   Khamenei spoke on Iranian national day, which coincides with the
anniversary of the days when students, fired by the spirit of 1979
Islamic Revolution, took over the U.S. embassy in Tehran.
	   The revolution toppled the U.S.-backed shah's regime and
installed the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
Khamenei's predecessor.
	   Radical Muslim students stormed the U.S. Embassy on Nov. 4, 1979
and took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The event led to the
severing of U.S.-Iran relations.

Torre chosen manager of the year by AP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSH DUBOW &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe Torre, whose patient style and calming
influence helped guide the New York Yankees to a record 125 wins
and their 24th World Series championship, won The Associated Press
manager of the year award Tuesday.
	   Torre, who won his second Series in three years with New York,
received 85 votes from a national panel of writers and
broadcasters. San Diego's Bruce Bochy finished second with 48 1/2
votes, followed by the Cubs' Jim Riggleman (20 1/2), Houston's
Larry Dierker (10) and Boston's Jimy Williams (8).
	   ``It's nice to get recognition,'' said Torre, who won the AP NL
manager of the year award in 1982 while with Atlanta. Since 1984,
only one award has been given for both leagues.
	   ``During the season we went through, you have one purpose in
mind _ to win the World Series,'' Torre said. ``All of a sudden,
the awards come along and it's like a cherry on top of a great
season. I was just along for the ride.''
	   But Torre did more than just ride his players to an AL-record
114 wins during the regular season and an 11-2 postseason mark,
capped by a sweep of the San Diego Padres in the World Series.
	   In the media maelstrom of New York and with a meddlesome owner
like George Steinbrenner, Torre didn't flinch when the team started
1-4. He exhibited remarkable patience and kept his team focused on
each game even though the Yankees ran away from the rest of the
American League by the end of May.
	   Because of Torre's leadership and an extremely talented team,
the Yankees won more games _ regular and postseason _ than any
other team in history. Torre said winning more games than any other
Yankees team was the ultimate achievement.
	   All of the top five vote-getters led their teams into the
playoffs. Bochy won his second division title in four years as a
manager, winning a team-record 98 games and leading the Padres to
their first World Series in 14 years.
	   Riggleman's Cubs earned the NL wild-card berth and made the
playoffs for the first time since 1989. Dierker, in his second
year, won his second NL Central title for the Astros. Williams, in
his second year in Boston, earned the AL wild-card berth.

Dhorasoo shines as Lyon beats Red Star 5-3 on aggregate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - Vikash Dhorasoo was again in inspirational
form as Lyon beat Red Star Belgrade 3-2 on Wednesday to qualify for
the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   Lyon's win, completed with 10 men, puts it through 5-3 on
aggregate.
	   Dhorasoo, signed from Le Havre in the close season, created
three first half goals to give the French team breathing space
after an early onslaught from the visiting team.
	   In the 16th minute, the playmaker split the Yugoslav defense
with a 20-yard (meter) pass that found Lyon captain Alain Caveglia,
who controlled the ball neatly on his chest and fired past
goalkeeper Dragoslav Jevric from 10 yards (meters).
	   Goran Bunjevcevic made it 1-1 in the 35th minute after Lyon
goalkeeper Gregory Coupet fumbled a long range free kick.
	   But Lyon scored two more goals just before halftime.
	   First, Dhorasoo made a diagonal pass to Christophe Cocard, and
the Lyon striker - playing in place of the injured Marco Grassi -
shot through the legs of goalkeeper Jevric from eight yards
(meters).
	   Then, Caveglia capped a brilliant Lyon move to score his second
of the match.
	   Again, Dhorasoo was the source of the goal, knocking a 50-yard
(meter) pass to Cocard, whose firm cross from the right was smacked
in by Caveglia from point blank range.
	   Earlier, Dhorasoo had come close to scoring himself, skipping
past three tackles in the 22nd minute before shooting just wide of
the post.
	   Lyon midfielder David Linares was shown the red card in 83rd
minute for a dangerous tackle, and Perica Ognjenovic grabbed a goal
in injury time, but Lyon held on for the win.

 &UR; U.S. Congo peace envoys arrive in Rwanda &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rice arrival in Kigali; comment, CHANGES byline;
no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda _ Senior U.S. diplomats faced another difficult
meeting Tuesday when they arrived in the Rwandan capital on a
mission to convince Rwanda to disengage from the conflict in
neighboring Congo.
	   Fresh from a frosty welcome in Zimbabwe and a two-hour meeting
with President Robert Mugabe, Susan Rice, the top State Department
official dealing with Africa, said tersely that the main thing was
to preserve the territorial integrity of Congo.
	   Rice also publicly recognized Rwanda's security concerns in
Congo, saying any solution to the three-month war must address
border security.
	   ``We believe that it is essential that a peaceful solution be
found to the conflict, which respects the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Congo, addresses the border security
concerns with its neighbors, provides safeguard against further
ethnic violence and genocide, and shares the participation of all
Congolese in the political process and advances democracy
throughout the region,'' she said.
	   The rebellion against Congolese President Laurent Kabila has
already embroiled troops from as many as eight countries, including
Rwanda, which accuses Kabila of anti-Tutsi persecution and failing
to rid the common border of Rwandan rebels.
	   Rice told reporters after meeting with Mugabe that it was too
early to tell whether her shuttle through seven African capitals
had advanced the prospects for peace.
	   ``I think that will have to be determined in the future,'' Rice
told reporters before leaving for Kigali.
	   In Kigali, she will meet Wednesday with President Pasteur
Bizimingu and Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, vice president, minister of
defense and chief architect of Rwanda's policy in Congo.
	   The Congolese rebels requested to meet with Rice, but the
request was apparently turned down, U.S. diplomats said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Kabila and Mugabe have sharply criticized U.S. efforts to broker
a Congo peace agreement, arguing that Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
deployed troops to repel an invasion by rebels which are backed by
Rwandan and Ugandan troops.
	   Mugabe has described U.S. calls for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from Congo as ``absolutely abominable'' and demanded Rwanda
and Uganda withdraw first, saying that would lead to the collapse
of the rebel campaign and bring peace.
	   Rice said she was informed of reports Angola planned to withdraw
some troops from the allied force backing Kabila, ``but I have no
information on that.''
	   Uganda acknowledges it has troops in Congo, but says they are in
Congo to strike at Ugandan rebels.
	   Rice's African trip has taken her to South Africa, Angola,
Congo, Zambia and Zimbabwe. She leaves Wednesday for Kampala,
Uganda, her final destination.
	   Rice is accompanied by U.S. President Bill Clinton's special
assistant, Gayle Smith, and his special envoy to the Great Lakes
region, Howard Wolpe.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Parma, one of the early favorites to win the UEFA
Cup, advanced Tuesday on a 3-2 aggregate after a 2-1 win a
second-round, second-leg home over Wisla Krakow.
	   Italian midfielder Stefano Fiore scored in the 21st and Bogdan
Zajac's own-goal made it 2-0 in the 46th. Zajac also scored the
Pole's only goal in second-half injury time.
	   The victory was the ninth straight home win for Parma in the
UEFA Cup, which it won in 1995. Parma rested stars like Hernan
Crespo and Colombia forward Faustina Asprilla.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux advanced 3-1 after a 2-1 win over
Vitesse Arnhem. Silvain Wiltord got the winning goal in the 64th to
make it 2-1. Arnhem took a 1-0 lead in the 8th minute on a header
by Arco Jochemsen. But two minutes later, Bordeaux midfielder Johan
Micoud made it 1-1 from the edge of the area.
	   In Prague, Czech Republic, Italy's Bologna defeated Slavia
Prague 2-0 to advance 4-1. Giuseppe Signori scored in the 80th off
a pass from Amedeo Mangone and Massimo Cappioli got the other six
minutes later.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, FC Brugge got through with a 3-2 victory
over VfB Stuttgart to advance 4-3. The game was tied 1-1 after
regulation time as Serb playmaker Alexander Ilic headed home the
winner in the 115th minute.
	   Stuttgart mounted its unlikely comeback when, trailing 1-0 in
the second half, Pablo Thiam and Kristian Djordevic were sent off
with their second yellow cards.
	   In Monte Carlo, Monaco, Monaco defeated Austria's Grazer AK 4-0
to advance on a 7-3 aggregate. Monaco, last year's European
Champions Cup semifinalists, went ahead 1-0 in the 8th on Frank
Gava's volley and made it 2-0 10 minutes later on a header by
Robert Spehar. Senegal's Djibril Diawara made it 3-0 early in the
second half and Gava got his second later in the half.
	   In San Sebastian, Spain, Real Sociedad beat Dynamo Moscow 3-0 to
advanced 6-2. Darko Kovacevic scored in the 56th _ his first of the
night _ on a header for the Spaniards, and in the 70th Oscar de
Paula made it 2-0, slipping the ball home on a wet pitch. Kovacevic
got his second in the 75th.

	   ALON SHVUT, West Bank (AP) _ Two young religious Jews wearing
knitted scullcaps pored over Jewish texts Tuesday in a new West
Bank trailer park. A third man stood guard with a machine gun.
	   The mere presence of the students and their bodyguard are a sign
of increasing anger of Israel's right-wing with the Mideast
land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians. They are part of a
larger movement of settlers taking matters into their own hands,
moving trailers onto land that may go to the Palestinians under the
new accord.
	   Overnight, at least 10 mobile homes appeared on scattered rocky
hilltops.
	   Under the Wye agreement in October, Israel is to withdraw its
troops from 13 percent more of the West Bank and hand it over to
Palestinian control.
	   Settlers and religious Jews, like the young men who turned their
trailer into a study hall, believe the West Bank is part of the
biblical land of Israel that God promised to the Jews.
	   Hoping to set their presence in stone, settlers have turned to
tactics which have worked in the past: They station mobile homes on
hills they plan to turn into larger permanent settlements difficult
for Israel to remove.
	   Sitting in his office stacked with maps and plans, Yerach Rotem,
an Israeli official for the settlement of Alon Shvut, said it was
too bad the settlers had to rely on such tactics.
	   ``But with this agreement ... we were afraid that all our work
would just go down the drain,'' he said. ``We are worried.''
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War. Some 150,000 Israeli Jews live in settlements throughout the
area now.
	   The Palestinians want the land as part of a future independent
state for the 1.6 million Palestinians who also live in the West
Bank in eight cities and hundreds of villages.
	   Despite repeated calls by the Palestinians and the United States
to halt settlement construction, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
has said he would allow settlements to expand, in order to
accommodate natural growth.
	   Settlers fear the new peace deal will change all that.
	   Outside the settlement of Maale Michmash, in the heartland of
the West Bank, three homes appeared on an isolated hilltop. The
steep incline, about 700 yards (meters) from the settlement,
commands a view of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea on one side
and the eastern suburbs of Jerusalem on the other.
	   One trailer was being guarded by Yitzhak Sapir, 53, a lecturer
at a community college. The owners of the structures were at work.
	   Sapir, however was not in need of a home. He already has one on
another West Bank settlement. He has moved into the trailer
``partly as a protest,'' he said, against the new peace agreement.
	   ``Our physical presence here gives a feeling of greater security
and permanence,'' he said.
	   Sapir had already decorated the walls of his trailer with framed
photographs of orchids and West Bank landscapes. Lace curtains had
been hung on the window-frames.
	   ``It's my wife,'' he said. ``She tries to create the atmosphere
of a home, no matter how rough it is.''
	   At Alon Shvut and Maale Michmash, Israeli police ordered the
settlers to remove bulldozers, but made no attempt to evict the
settlers.
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the presence of
the new mobile homes were ``a flagrant violation'' of the new peace
deal.
	   ``(Netanyahu) can't have both settlements and peace,'' Erekat
said.

Bora signs two-year deal with MetroStars
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With lots of smiles and few specifics, the New
York-New Jersey MetroStars announced Tuesday they had signed Bora
Milutinovic to coach the Major League Soccer team for the next two
years.
	   ``He is a teacher first and foremost,'' MetroStars vice
president and general manager Charlie Stillitano said. ``He loves
to teach the kids. He loves to teach our American players as well
as our foreign players.''
	   Milutinovic was hired to replace Alfonso Mondelo with one game
remaining in the season and with the MetroStars already having
clinched a playoff berth. Stillitano said he was hired to get the
team ready for the playoffs, intimating he could work the ``magic''
he has a reputation for.
	   The MetroStars won their final game, a shootout victory after a
goalless draw over the New England Revolution, and then lost two
straight to the Columbus Crew (4-2 and in a shootout after a 1-1
draw) in the playoffs to end their season.
	   Despite several and repeated questions as to his plans for the
team, Milutinovic refused to give details as to what he intends to
do differently from the four men who have preceded him in three
years.
	   ``I respect all our coaches,'' Milutinovic said in his broken
English. ``I need to do my way. I need to be Bora.''
	   Milutinovic, the only man to coach four teams into the second
round of the World Cup, has known several MetroStars players _ Tab
Ramos, Alexi Lalas, Mike Sorber, Tony Meola _ from his days as
coach of the U.S. national team from 1991-1995.
	   Despite saying he is excited about several of the young players,
he would not comment about what personnel changes he would like to
see.
	   ``I respect all our players,'' he said.
	   But Stillitano was more blunt, although no more specific.
	   ``I think Bora is being a bit diplomatic,'' Stillitano said.
``We have to make changes. We know that.''
	   Stillitano said this will be the first time the MetroStars have
had a coach in place before January, a critical element he said in
evaluating talent and working within the league's single-entity
structure to get a team ready for the season's March start.
	   MLS commissioner Doug Logan, a Cuban-American who served as
Milutinovic's translator at a news conference at the All-Star Cafe,
has said the MetroStars must get better for the young league to
prosper.
	   ``I think this is a first step,'' Logan said. I think is a very
choice for both the team and Bora. They're both coming in at the
right time for each other.''
	   Milutinovic has a reputation for turning around teams quickly,
but also for being an overly defensive coach, a tactic some say
will disappoint American fans. Logan said Milutinovic's reputation
with his club teams is different than national teams, and
Stillitano doesn't think playing style will be an issue.
	   ``Winning solves all criticism,'' Stillitano said. ``The most
constant criticism I have heard from our fans is that we haven't
been consistent in three years. They want a coach to stick around
and develop some players.''

Italian No.1 player Gaudenzi troubled by sore shoulder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's No.1 player Andrea Gaudenzi is a
questionable starter in the Davis Cup final against Sweden because
of a sore shoulder.
	   Paolo Bertolucci, captain of the Italian Davis Cup team, said
Tuesday that Gaudenzi gave up two tournaments in Argentina and
Chile later this month because of pains in his right shoulder,
already operated twice.
	   Gaudenzi, who led Italy to an upset victory against the United
States in the Davis Cup semifinals, is considered a key to a
possible Italian victory in the Dec. 4-6 final against Sweden,
scheduled on clay at Milan's Forum Dec. 4-6.
	   ``Doctors are confident that Gaudenzi can recover for the final,
but I must think of possible alternatives,'' Bertolucci said.
	   The Italian team which qualified for the final was made with
Gaudenzi, Davide Sanguinetti and doubles specialist Diego Nargiso.

Festina joins campaign to crack down on banned drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Festina, whose team was kicked out of
the Tour de France after admitting to drug use, said Tuesday it has
joined three other cycling sponsors in signing a charter aimed at
clamping down on use of banned substances.
	   The watch company also said it was earmarking 100 million
pesetas (dlrs 715,000) to fight drug use in cycling and train young
riders.
	   The charter was signed last week by French sponsors Bigmat,
Cofidis and Francaise des Jeux in what was seen as a bid to clean
up cycling's tarnished image.
	   The document includes a range of measures designed to make it
tougher for cyclists to take illicit drugs.
	   Among the most far-reaching is one giving sponsors the right to
demand further medical examinations in the event of a positive drug
test, and prevent cyclists who test positive from competing until
undergoing a disciplinary hearing.
	   The move comes nearly three months after the Tour de France was
rocked by a doping scandal that saw Festina team expelled following
revelations that its riders systematically used the
performance-enhancing drug EPO.
	   The measures include allowing sponsors the right to hire doctors
of their own choice to test cyclists and making cyclists on the
three teams guarantee in writing that they will abstain from taking
banned substances during their contracts.

Settlers attack police during arrest of Hebron rabbi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS rabbi released on bail

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers attacked Israeli police
Tuesday, throwing eggs and scratching them as policemen arrested a
rabbi in the West Bank city of Hebron for allegedly inciting
against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   The founder of Hebron's Jewish settlement, American-born Moshe
Levinger, had refused a police order to show up for questioning
over remarks he made at a funeral last week for a Jewish man shot
to death, apparently by Palestinian assailants.
	   At the funeral, Levinger made a speech lambasting Netanyahu for
signing a peace accord last month in which Israel would transfer
more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Police were forced to break down Levinger's door Tuesday when
they came to arrest him.
	   As the police left the home with Levinger, several settlers who
live within the same compound, threw eggs and rocks and scratched
the policemen. Three officers were lightly injured in the attack,
police said. The settlers also tried to physically block police
vehicles.
	   Levinger was released on bail a few hours later after refusing
to answer questions, police said.

Zurich wins 4-2, advances 5-3 to third round of UEFA Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Outsiders FC Zurich downed Celtic
Glasgow 4-2 Tuesday to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup
5-3 on aggregate after a deluge of second-half goals nearly as
heavy as the persistent rain.
	   Georgio del Signore made his scoring debut in European club
competition to put Zurich 1-0 in the lead in the 51st minute. Swiss
international Frederic Chassot staged a fine solo effort to make it
2-0 in the 56th minute.
	   Undeterred, Celtic took advantage of the home team's
celebrations, with Philip O'Donnell sneaking in a goal less than
one minute later.
	   The Zurich forwards broke through a slow Celtic defense in the
61st minute, when South African signing Shaun Bartlett hit the net
for 3-1.
	   Celtic's Henrik Larsson, who helped set up his side's first
goal, narrowed the gap to 3-2 in the 72nd minute.
	   But when Cesar Sant'Anna made it 4-2 in the 75th minute, the
hosts' victory was complete.
	   Zurich went into the home match boosted by their surprise 1-1
first leg draw away against Celtic, the 36-time Scottish champion.
Zurich trainer Raimondo Ponte had vowed that his players would go
all out for a win rather than be content to advance on a goalless
draw. His tactics paid off.
	   For the Swiss side, it was their best European performance for
15 years. The Glasgow team was weakened by injury and suspension.
	   Nearly 15,000 fans braved the pouring rain to turn out to the
Letzigrund stadium.

UN agency urges nations to fish less and save sharks and seabirds
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITS &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Faced with depleting fish stocks and alarmed by the
potential damage to their economies, more than 80 nations on
Tuesday approved a voluntary agreement to limit fishing worldwide.
	   Under the accord, nations also pledged to protect sharks and
seabirds. Each year, thousands of sharks are accidentally caught in
nets used by tuna fishermen while thousands of seabirds die when
they try to feed off bait on fishing lines and become ensnared by
the hooks.
	   The document was adopted at a weeklong conference at the
Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
and has been submitted to the agency's fishing committee for final
approval, expected in February.
	   ``In most cases, the greatest risk is not the extinction of fish
species but the extinction of economies,'' said Serge Garcia,
director of FAO's Fisheries Resources Division.
	   The world ocean catch is valued at about dlrs 80 billion a year,
and fish farming adds another dlrs 42 billion. Fisheries employ
about 200 million people worldwide.
	   Garcia said that too many fish are being caught every year,
preventing many species from reaching reproduction age and causing
the number of fish in the ocean to drop. He estimated that an
additional 10 million tons of fish could be caught each year if
stocks were allowed to regenerate.
	   ``If we reduce our fishing capacity, the fish will be bigger and
there will be more of them,'' said Garcia. He said governments
needed to restrict fishing licenses and encourage the retirement of
vessels, two key recommendations in the accord.
	   China, Russia, Japan, the United States and India lead the world
in fishing tonnage, according to 1995 figures. Backers of the
accord said it won the approval of all the key fishing nations,
including the United States.
	   What has happened with cod in Canada is a prime example of
overfishing, said Garcia. There, the average life of cod, which is
20 years when they are undisturbed, has dropped to just 3, far
below the age when they can start spawning.
	   Species most at risk of further depletion include Atlantic cod
and redfish, haddock, anchovy, swordfish and tunas such as bluefin,
bigeye and albacore.
	   FAO said that an increased trade in shark fins and other exotic
shark products in recent years has critically endangered several
species.
	   The accord asks nations to adopt protective measures including
special nets with holes for sharks to escape. It also calls on
fishermen who accidentally catch sharks to put them back in the
ocean alive and withdraw any hooks from their jaws.

<TEXT>
	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ The UEFA Cup game between Fiorentina and
Grasshoppers was suspended Thursday night after a Belgian off-field
official was injured by the explosion of a device hurled from the
stands.
	   UEFA representatives asked the referee not to start the second
half of the second-round second leg match following the incident.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1, on two goals by its Brazilian-born
Belgian forward Luis Oliveira, after the first 45 minutes of play.
	   The ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield helping the referee
and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a right (cq) knee injury.
	   Fiorentina officials said his condition was not serious and that
he was expected to be released after treatment.
	   The injured official was identified as Philippe Flament.
	   It was not immediately clear if Fiorentina will be penalized or
the match replayed behind closed doors Wednesday.
	   UEFA was expected to take a final decision Wednesday morning.
Draws for third-round games of the European competition are
scheduled on Friday.
	   Fiorentina, which had won the first leg 2-0, was a favorite to
qualify.
	   The game was being played in Salerno, near Naples, to raise
funds for victims of recent floodings in southern Italy.
	   Fiorentina, which had given up the advantage of playing on its
homefield in Florence for charity, still was considered responsible
for the fans behavior.
	   The explosion occurred as players and officials were walking to
the dressing rooms at the end of the first half.
	   Oliveira, who was walking close to the fourth man, was
temporarily deafened by the powerful explosion which made a hole on
the field.
	   The Belgian official was taken away on a stretcher and rushed to
hospital.
	   ``He's in good condition after treatment,'' said Luciano Luna,
managing director of the Florentine club.
	   ``It's a mad action. It was not the work of our fans. It was a
premeditated attack against our players, who were walking near the
official ... we only hope we can replay the game,'' he said.
	   ``Qualification already was in our pocket,'' commented
Fiorentina's coach Giovanni Trapattoni. ``We hope we are not
penalized and eliminated. Of course our first thought is for the
injured official.''
	   Police reported that a local resident was taken into custody for
allegedly hurling the explosive device.
	   Florentine and Salerno fans have a history of bitter rivalry and
were following the match in separated sectors.

Tyson reportedly set to fight Botha Jan. 16 at Las Vegas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Now that Mike Tyson has his boxing license back
from the state of Nevada, he is getting ready to fight again in Las
Vegas.
	   Two London newspapers, The Sun and The Independent, and the New
York Daily News all reported Tuesday that the former heavyweight
champion would return to the ring Jan. 16 against Francois Botha of
South Africa. The bout would be promoted by America Presents.
	   The Independent said the fight would be held at the MGM Grand.
	   The News reported that Tyson, who has been experiencing
cash-flow problems after 16 months away from boxing, had received a
large cash advance.
	   But Shelly Finkel, Tyson's adviser, said no deal had been
finalized.
	   ``Our plan is for him to fight in January, (but) Mike has not
concluded a deal to fight anybody in January,'' Finkel said.
	   A spokesman for Frank Warren, Botha's advisor, would not confirm
the Tyson fight had been made, saying only that Warren's company
was ``advising'' Botha until January.
	   A source in Las Vegas also said that no deal had yet been signed
and that Vaughn Bean also was being considered as a possible
opponent. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added
that Jan. 16 seemed a likely date and the MGM Grand was the
probable site.
	   Another possible opponent could be Germany's Axel Schultz,
according to a spokeswoman for Showtime, the cable company that
will televise the fight. She added that the deal could be closed by
the end of the week.
	   Tyson, who was suspended after biting Evander Holyfield's ears
during their title fight, had his license restored last month by
the Nevada State Athletic Commission. He still faces a Dec. 1 trial
on misdemeanor assault charges stemming from a traffic accident
Aug. 31 at Gaithersburg, Md.
	   Botha has lost only once in 37 fights, stopped in the 12th round
by Michael Moorer in an IBF title challenge two years ago. He is
the No. 1 contender for Holyfield's IBF title.

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Celta Vigo ousted English league
leader Aston Villa from the UEFA Cup with a 3-1 win Tuesday in the
second-round, second-leg as the Spaniards advanced 3-2.
	   Celta, which lost 1-0 at home in Vigo two weeks ago, took a 1-0
lead when Juan Sanchez, with his fifth goal in as many games,
scored in the 26th to give Celta the lead.
	   Stan Collymore leveled for Villa in the 30th on a penalty after
a Celta defender handled the ball in the area, but Russian
Alexander Mostovoi gave Celta a 2-1 lead in the 34th on a perfectly
placed free kick from 20 meters (yards).
	   Bulgarian Luboslav Penev stretched the lead to 3-1 in the 48th
when he chipped in the ball home from 3 meters (yards) after Aston
Villa keeper Michael Oakes failed to control it.
	   Villa got a life when Rafael Berges was sent off with his second
yellow card in the 57th but was unable to mount an offense before a
home sellout.

minutes, had to settle for a scoreless tie against Roma as the
Italian side advanced on a 1-0 aggregate from Tuesday's
second-round, second-leg UEFA Cup match.
	   In a scoreless first half, the highlight was the sending off
just before halftime of Roma's Pierre Wome with his second yellow
card. He was shown the exit door by German referee Bernd Heynemann
for two poorly timed tackles on Lee Bowyer.
	   Roma, more experienced than the mid-table English side, was
seldom threatened in a comfortable victory.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ Playing in pouring rain Tuesday, Schalke and SC
Freiburg struggled to a poorly played 1-1 draw in the Bundesliga.
	   Freiburg, newly promoted, remained unbeaten in six matches,
while a slumping Schalke has failed to win its last five outings.
	   The teams' had been scheduled to play Saturday, but a muddy
field in Schalke forced the makeup game.
	   Steffen Korell provided Freiburg's equalizer in the 71st minute,
after Jiri Nemec put Schalke up in the 25th.
	   Freiburg turned in a weak match, but Schalke couldn't capitalize
despite dominating with a makeshift squad.
	   The 1997 EUFA Cup champions, hit by injuries, played witout
mainstays like Olaf Thon, Mark Wilmonts and Johan de Kock.

Marseille ousts ten-man Werder Bremen with 3-2 win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) - Marseille beat Werder Bremen 3-2 in an
action-packed match on Wednesday to advance to the third round of
the UEFA Cup with a 4-3 aggregate win.
	   Florian Maurice, Pierre Issa and Christophe Dugarry all headed
goals to give the French team victory.
	   The teams drew the first leg 1-1.
	   Maurice scored in the 35th minute, when he dived to head in a
right wing corner from Robert Pires.
	   But the German team equalized in the 47th minute after a
defensive blunder by Patrick Blondeau.
	   The Marseille rightback had plenty of time to clear a bouncing
ball in the penalty area but hesitated long enough for Dieter Eilts
to score from close range.
	   But Werder Bremen's joy was shortlived.
	   In the 51st minute, Sven Benken was sent off after receiving his
second yellow card and a minute later Marseille made it 2-1.
	   Maurice again showed his aerial dominance, rising above the
visitors' defense to head down to Issa, who headed past goalkeeper
Frank Rost from close range.
	   Dugarry looked to have made the game safe in the 77th minute
when he headed in a Titi Camara cross.
	   But in the 82nd minute, ten-man Werder Bremen again profited
from poor defending, when Andreas Herzog's right wing corner
squeezed between Patrick Colleter and the near post and went
directly into the net.
	   Camara nearly gave the home team a wider margin of victory on
several occasions.
	   In the 63rd minute, he beat a defender on the right and fired a
15-yard (meter) shot just wide with the outside of his right foot.
	   And after a surging 40-yard (meter) run in the 80th minute,
Camara shot straight at Rost.

	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ The UEFA Cup soccer game between
Fiorentina and Grasshoppers was suspended at half time Tuesday
night after a Belgian off-field official was injured by the
explosion of a device hurled from the stands.

homefield in Florence for charity, still was considered responsible
for the fans behavior.
	   The explosion occurred as players and officials were walking to
the dressing rooms at the end of the first half.
	   Oliveira, who was walking close to the fourth man, was
temporarily deafened by the powerful explosion which made a hole on
the field.
	   Officials of the Swiss team said that four players of
Grasshoppers were also temporarily deafened.
	   ``However we were ready to resume play in the second half,''
coach Rolf Fringer said.
	   Mats Gren had scored Grasshoppers goal in the 31st minute,
between Oliveira's goals in the 12th and 39th minute.
	   The injured Belgian official was taken away on a stretcher and
rushed to hospital.
	   ``He's in good condition after treatment,'' said Luciano Luna,
managing director of the Florentine club.
	   ``It's a mad action. It was not the work of our fans. It was a
premeditated attack against our players, who were walking near the
official ... we only hope we can replay the game,'' he said.
	   ``Qualification already was in our pocket,'' commented
Fiorentina's coach Giovanni Trapattoni. ``We hope we are not
penalized and eliminated. Of course our first thought is for the
injured official.''
	   Police reported that a local resident was taken into custody for
allegedly hurling the explosive device.
	   Florentine and Salerno fans have a history of bitter rivalry and
were following the match in separated sectors.
	   Police reported that groups of rival fans hurled stones and
clashed before kickoff. Four people were injured in fist-fights and
treated at the local hospital.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Outsiders FC Zurich downed Celtic
Glasgow 4-2 Tuesday to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup
5-3 on aggregate after a deluge of second-half goals nearly as
heavy as the persistent rain.
	   Georgio del Signore made his scoring debut in European club
competition to put Zurich 1-0 in the lead in the 51st minute. Swiss
international Frederic Chassot staged a fine solo effort to make it
2-0 in the 56th minute.
	   Undeterred, Celtic took advantage of the home team's
celebrations, with Philip O'Donnell sneaking in a goal less than
one minute later.
	   The Zurich forwards broke through a slow Celtic defense in the
61st minute, when South African signing Shaun Bartlett hit the net
for 3-1.
	   Celtic's Henrik Larsson, who helped set up his side's first
goal, narrowed the gap to 3-2 in the 72nd minute.
	   But when Cesar Sant'Anna made it 4-2 in the 75th minute, the
hosts' victory was complete.
	   Zurich went into the home match boosted by their surprise 1-1
first leg draw away against Celtic, the 36-time Scottish champion.
Zurich trainer Raimondo Ponte had vowed that his players would go
all out for a win rather than be content to advance on a goalless
draw. His tactics paid off.
	   For the Swiss side, it was their best European performance for
15 years. The Glasgow team was weakened by injury and suspension.
	   Nearly 15,000 fans braved the pouring rain to turn out to the
Letzigrund stadium.

FC Brugge edges past 9-man Stuttgart in thriller
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUGGE, Belgium (AP) _ FC Brugge denied VfB Stuttgart a second
miracle in as many UEFA Cup rounds Tuesday, ending a nine-man
comeback attempt with a goal from Alexandar Ilic for a 3-2 win that
qualifies the Belgian champion for the third round.
	   Brugge advanced on a 4-3 aggregate score following a 1-1 draw in
Germany two weeks ago.
	   Both sides were 1-1 after regulation time on Tuesday, setting up
a spectacular finish in extra time.
	   After Stuttgart came close to the impossible by surging from
behind twice when two men had already been sent off with reds
cards, Brugge pounded the German defense till it finally broke in
the 115th minute.
	   Serb playmaker Ilic headed home a cross from Sven Vermant in the
near corner for the late decider, finally knocking the last wind
out of the incredible Germans.
	   ``We should have finished this off a lot earlier but we didn't.
So it turned into a real thriller,'' said FC Brugge coach Eric
Gerets.
	   Five minutes ahead of Ilic's goal, striker Fredi Bobic had put
Stuttgart with one foot in the third round with a fierce left-foot
shot for 2-2.
	   Stuttgart had made its own comeback near impossible in the
second half when, already trailing 1-0, Pablo Thiam and Kristian
Djordevic were sent off with their second yellow cards.
	   But as it proved with a 3-0 win at Feyenoord following a 3-1
home loss in the first UEFA Cup round, never count Stuttgart out.
	   When Djordevic was sent off in the 73rd minute it seemed the
game was over, Brugge leading on an Olivier De Cock goal and facing
just nine men.
	   But Dutch captain Frank Verlaat gave the Germans hope again,
equalizing with a glancing header in the 76th minute.
	   Buoyed on by the 13,000 fans at the Jan Breydel Stadium, Brugge
went looking for the decider but long failed to find a hole in the
depleted German ranks.
	   Chance seemed to be on Stuttgart's side too. Brugge's Nzelo
Lembi and Khalilou Fadiga hit the bar and the post in a furious
95th minute.
	   Brugge went ahead 2-1 in the 105th minute when Gert Claessens
knocked in a rebound from Stuttgart goalie Marc Ziegler, who was
unable to stop a shot from Fadiga.
	   In a seesaw show of shifting fortunes, Bobic's goal proved to be
insufficient and Ilic prevailed.
	   ``This is truly amazing,'' said Brugge captain Franky Vander
Elst after the match. And, at 37, he has already seen it all.
	   Brugge, which had enough with a goalless draw to advance to the
next round, never held back and boldly went for victory from the
start.

Liverpool ejects Valencia from UEFA Cup with 2-2 draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALENCIA, Spain (AP) _ Patrik Berger and Steve McManaman scored
two goals in the final 10 minutes as Liverpool drew with Valencia
2-2 Tuesday, advancing the English side to the third round of the
UEFA Cup on the away-goal rule.
	   McManaman scored on a header in the 80th minute _ off a cross
from Michael Owen _ as Liverpool rallied to tied 1-1. score that
would have advanced the English on the away goal rule.
	   Berger got what turned out to be the deciding goal in the 86th
to give Liverpool a 2-1 lead.
	   But Valencia made it 2-2 of a free kick in second-half injury
time by Clauido Lopez, a goal that was ruled an own-goal against
Liverpool keeper David James.
	   The clubs played a scoreless draw two weeks ago in Liverpool.
	   Lopez delighted almost 50,000 at Mestalla stadium with a goal
late in the first half to give Valencia a 1-0 lead, which looked
like it would advance the Spaniards in the second-round, second-leg
match.
	   Lopez scored on a sharp-angle drive from just 12 meters (yards)
_ a shot that glanced in off the post to the right of Liverpool
goalie James _ to give Valencia the lead just seconds before the
end of the first half.
	   In a shoving match in the final minutes, Paul Ince and McManaman
were given red cards for Liverpool and Amadeo Carboni got a red
card for Valencia, giving Valencia an edge to get its final goal.

<TEXT>
	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Hundreds upon hundreds of bodies are
buried in the mud that cascaded down Casitas volcano, some with
their hair and limbs entangled in the sugar cane stalks.
	   During a two-hour walk out of the Posoltega town center and into
the sugar cane fields, 22 of the bodies were seen in plain,
gut-wrenching view _ bloated, scratched and crammed in trees, cane
stalks and mud.
	   The tragedy occurred Friday morning following pounding rains
brought by Hurricane Mitch. Part of the volcano's crater collapsed
and the lake inside formed a deluge down the slope.
	   ``It is full, full of bodies,'' Ariel Mendoza, a 26-year-old
construction worker said, pointing at the volcano. ``From where the
mud starts, down to the sea.''
	   Mayor Felicita Zeledon of Posoltega, the largest city near the
disaster area, told The Associated Press Tuesday that 1,950 corpses
had been recovered in villages below the volcano.
	   Other officials gave lower, but still ghastly calculations of
the death toll here: The Red Cross said 1,250, while the
president's office said 1,338.
	   ``We have buried some in mass graves, others we have buried one
by one,'' Zeledon said, as she hitched a ride on the back of a
tractor to where a relief helicopter was landing.
	   ``There are still survivors in the hills,'' she said.
``Four-hundred have walked out and we believe there are another 450
alive up there _ most of them children.''
	   Zeledon said rescue workers charged with burying and burning
bodies were telling the military about survivors they ran across in
the hills. But she didn't know if soldiers had gone back to get
them.
	   ``If they don't get them out, those people will die because
there is no water, no food,'' she said. ``It would be one more
massacre.''
	   ``We have people alive up there and we don't have equipment to
get there,'' added local Red Cross coordinator Ramiro Gallo. ``It
has been four days and people are still there with mud up to their
waist.''
	   Bodies found Tuesday were being burned to prevent the spread of
disease, Zeledon said.
	   Nicaragua's Health Ministry said it was dispatching medical
brigades to help recover and bury bodies and to fumigate the
region.
	   Villagers said they found about 200 bodies at the San Pablo
sugar cane plantation, just outside of town.
	   Amid the crushed cane stalks lie muddy shoes, purses, tires, a
colander.
	   The stench of death crops up every few hundred yards where a
body lies: A little girl with her hair braided into the cane stalks
by the slide. A man still wearing boots, but nothing else. A boy,
perhaps 8, snuggled under a tree trunk. Or just an arm sticking out
of the mud.
	   The government urged people living near Casitas and eight other
nearby volcanos to evacuate their homes Tuesday for fear of new
mudslides. More heavy rains have been falling in recent days.
	   Another small mudslide on the northern slope of the Casitas
volcano wiped out 34 houses Monday night, but there were no
apparent casualties, Defense Minister Pedro Joaquin Chamorro said.
	   Residents ``must be mindful of the situation and look for
refuge,'' President Arnoldo Aleman said.
	   Central American officials say more than 7,000 people died in
floods and mudslides triggered by Mitch, one of the strongest
hurricanes ever to hit the Caribbean.
	   Ricardo Donaires, 34, his wife, and their baby boy spent three
days in the open on a hilltop in the village of Rolando Rodriguez
before hiking to safety on Monday.
	   ``We suffered without eating and without drinking water for
three days,'' Donaires said, now at a schoolhouse converted into an
emergency shelter in Posoltega.
	   At first, soldiers struggled to bury bodies where they lay. But
with the fear of epidemics growing, civilian volunteers set out
from the nearby community of Chichigalpa to burn bodies.
	   ``We need the government to send us gasoline if they want to
avoid an epidemic,'' said Robert Lopez Marcia, a member of
Chichigalpa's emergency commission.
	   At an improvised shelter at a Chichigalpa elementary school,
doctors were in desperate need of medicine, antibiotics and
bandages, and there was little clean water or food. Children lay on
desks with bloody bandages on their heads.
	   Along the Pan American Highway, thousands of people walked in
the pouring rain, some leaving the disaster area, others going in
to search for family members.
	   ``The only thing the federal government does is ask us for a
number every half hour _ how many dead, how many injured,''
complained Chichigalpa Mayor Elijio Palacio. ``But they don't send
us anything.''

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A lackluster Atletico Madrid beat CSKA
Sofia 1-0 Tuesday to advance 5-2 on aggregate into the third round
of the UEFA Cup.
	   In an evening of sluggish play in chilly weather, the Spaniards
scored on a penalty kick by Osvaldo Giroldo 'Juninho' after a foul
against Jose Mari Romero in the 45th minute.
	   They appeared content to rest on the laurels of the 4-2 win they
posted two weeks ago in Sofia.
	   Until the penalty kick, the Spaniards managed only two shots on
goal.
	   After a first half in which they did little but defend, the
Bulgarians showed a bit more pep in the second, firing off three
long-distance shots that threatened but did not get past goalie
Pedro Jaro.
	   A crowd of some 20,000 people watched the game at the Vicente
Calderon stadium.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A U.S.-backed proposal urging the
developing world to take a bigger role in combating global warming
has gotten a cool reception at a U.N. climate summit.
	   Developing nations led by China blocked efforts to discuss
voluntary quotas for poorer nations at the conference, the biggest
since a landmark global warming agreement was reached last year.
	   ``That item is no longer on the agenda'' said Michael Williams,
the U.N. spokesman. ``Although it could come up in some informal
discussions.''
	   Delegates at the two-week summit have now turned their attention
to other issues concerning developing countries, Williams said.
	   On Tuesday, discussions on changing land use and forestry, along
with how to help poorer countries better develop emissions-fighting
technology dominated the day's talks.
	   Just how poorer nations should participate in stopping global
warming is one of the thorniest issues facing the conference
participants.
	   Some nations, such as China and India, balk at the idea of a set
quota for reducing greenhouse gases.
	   Spurred on by China, the 163 nations decided by consensus Monday
to block the issue from even reaching the agenda as they kicked off
their two-week conference.
	   Debate on other issues was continuing Tuesday as the delegates
sought to flesh out the 1997 treaty protocol agreed to in Kyoto,
Japan.
	   ``To say the least, we are disappointed that it appears that
countries will not have an opportunity to explore this matter in
any detail,'' U.S. negotiator Melinda Kimble told the delegates.
	   History was made last December in Kyoto when governments set
2012 as the deadline for cutting back on greenhouse gases in the
United States, Japan, the 15-nation European Union and 21 other
industrial nations.
	   Although the cuts currently apply only to those 38 nations,
greenhouse emissions in India and China are expected by 2015 to
exceed those of the biggest polluter, the United States.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
five gases, chiefly carbon dioxide from power plant and automobile
consumption. Critics say dire warming scenarios remain unproved and
don't warrant potentially costly shifts away from fossil fuels.
	   The United States is not among the 38 signatories of the accord
so far, and the Senate remains skeptical, absent greater efforts by
the developing world.
	   Yet many developing countries argue their economies can't assume
costly greenhouse gas reductions that quotas would require. They
point out industrialized nations in the North loaded the atmosphere
with carbon dioxide to begin with.
	   The Kyoto accord would require the European Union to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases 8 percent
below 1990 levels, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 6
percent.

First half explosion injuries fourth man
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 10th graf that Fiorentina playing in Salerno for
charity and for suspension of own field &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SALERNO, Italy (AP) _ The UEFA Cup soccer game between
Fiorentina and Grasshoppers was suspended at half time Tuesday
night after a Belgian off-field official was injured by the
explosion of a device hurled from the stands.
	   UEFA representatives asked the referee not to start the second
half of the second-round second leg match following the incident.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1, on two goals by its Brazilian-born
Belgian forward Luis Oliveira, after the first 45 minutes of play.
	   The ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield helping the referee
and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a right (cq) knee injury.
	   Fiorentina officials said his condition was not serious and that
he was expected to be released after treatment.
	   The injured official was identified as Philippe Flament.
	   It was not immediately clear if Fiorentina will be penalized or
the match replayed behind closed doors Wednesday.
	   UEFA was expected to take a final decision Wednesday morning.
Draws for third-round games of the European competition are
scheduled on Friday.
	   Fiorentina, which had won the first leg 2-0, was a favorite to
qualify.
	   The game was being played in Salerno, near Naples, following the
suspensiuon of Fiorentina's own homefield and to raise funds for
the victims of recent floodings in southern Italy.
	   Fiorentina was paying the second and last round of suspension of
its Franchi stadium as a result of its fans misbehavior during a
Cup Winners Cup game against Barcelona in 1997. Although playing
away from home Fiorentina still was considered responsible for the
fans behavior in Salerno.
	   The explosion occurred as players and officials were walking to
the dressing rooms at the end of the first half.
	   Oliveira, who was walking close to the fourth man, was
temporarily deafened by the powerful explosion which made a hole on
the field.
	   Officials of the Swiss team said that four players of
Grasshoppers were also temporarily deafened.
	   ``However we were ready to resume play in the second half,''
coach Rolf Fringer said.
	   Mats Gren had scored Grasshoppers goal in the 31st minute,
between Oliveira's goals in the 12th and 39th minute.
	   The injured Belgian official was taken away on a stretcher and
rushed to hospital.
	   ``He's in good condition after treatment,'' said Luciano Luna,
managing director of the Florentine club.
	   ``It's a mad action. It was not the work of our fans. It was a
premeditated attack against our players, who were walking near the
official ... we only hope we can replay the game,'' he said.
	   ``Qualification already was in our pocket,'' commented
Fiorentina's coach Giovanni Trapattoni. ``We hope we are not
penalized and eliminated. Of course our first thought is for the
injured official.''
	   Police reported that a local resident was taken into custody for
allegedly hurling the explosive device.
	   Florentine and Salerno fans have a history of bitter rivalry and
were following the match in separated sectors.
	   Police reported that groups of rival fans hurled stones and
clashed outside the stadium before kickoff. Four people were
injured in fist-fights and treated at the local hospital.

Security Council divided on response if Iraq refuses to lift ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN, US-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ While the U.N. Security Council stands
united in demanding that Iraq reverse its decision to cut dealings
with U.N. weapons inspectors, it remains divided on what to do if
Baghdad refuses.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened to use force if
necessary, but China has called for dialogue and restraint _ and
Russia, which is traditionally sympathetic to Iraq, has indicated
it wants a peaceful solution.
	   France recalled its representative in Baghdad for consultations
Tuesday and warned Iraq that it faced ``total isolation'' if it
didn't resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors. But
diplomats said that France's irritation at the Iraqis did not mean
it would support using force against them.
	   The 15-member Security Council started discussions Tuesday
afternoon on a draft resolution submitted by Britain condemning
Iraq's decision and demanding that Baghdad rescind it ``immediately
and unconditionally.''
	   It makes no mention of the threat of force. And it does not
declare that Iraq is in material breach of U.N. resolutions _
language that could give the United States and its allies the green
light for military action.
	   The proposed resolution does state that ``the situation in Iraq
continues to pose a threat to international peace and security.''
But that language _ tough by U.N. standards _ will probably be
dropped because Russia's Deputy Ambassador Yuriy Fedotov said
before the council meeting began that he doubts the Iraqi action
represented a threat to peace and security.
	   So the resolution, which isn't expected to be finalized until
later in the week, is likely to be similar to the press statement
that the council issued Saturday, hours after the Iraqis halted the
work of the U.N. Special Commission charged with eliminating the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Echoing the press statement, the proposed resolution accuses
Baghdad of ``a flagrant violation'' of council resolutions. Unlike
the statement issued Saturday, a Security Council resolution once
adopted is legally binding.
	   The divisions among the five permanent members of the Security
Council _ who have the right to veto any resolution _ were
reflected in their statements responding to Iraq's surprise
announcement on Saturday.
	   When the Iraqis refused to let inspectors enter Saddam Hussein's
palaces and other sensitive sites early this year, the United
States and Britain threatened air strikes and sent troops and
aircraft to the region.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair suggested this week that military force was again an option,
but both countries want to give diplomacy a chance to work first.
	   ``It's going to be a slow burn ... There are many steps here
before we get to any possibility of force,'' a Western diplomat
said.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned Iraq's decision, saying
it blocked prospects for lifting crippling economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Moscow urged Iraq to
comply with U.N. resolutions calling for the dismantling of the
country's weapons of mass destruction _ a requirement for sanctions
to be lifted.
	   Russia, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq, has
previously called for an early lifting of sanctions. A Russian
parliamentary delegation visiting Baghdad this week for talks with
Saddam called on Moscow to stop abiding by U.N. sanctions against
Iraq, according to news reports.
	   Treading a cautious path, China on Tuesday urged Iraq to end its
latest standoff and resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao asked all sides
to exercise restraint, saying dialogue, not confrontation, would be
``conducive to the early conclusion of arms inspection in Iraq.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Grieving crowds jammed morgues and
hospitals in search of missing loved ones in the Honduran capital
Tuesday, while others throughout the country waited to be rescued
from rooftops and islands surrounded by floodwaters.
	   Meanwhile, the storm, which killed more than 7,000 people,
re-formed as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday
though its 45 mph (70 kph) winds were a shadow of the 180 mph (290
kph) monster of last week.
	   Weather forecasters said the storm, moving to the northeast,
could strike the Yucatan Peninsula and then Florida later in the
week with heavy rains _ but not with anything approaching
hurricane-force winds.
	   Here in the Honduan capital, the sun came out Tuesday after a
week of torrential rains and churning winds but authorities feared
the scope of the disaster caused by one of the worst Atlantic
tropical storms ever could widen.
	   In Honduras alone, 11,000 people were still reported missing and
feared dead. Amid reports of increasing hunger among the survivors,
officials raced to deliver food and water to survivors.
	   Damage to vital coffee and banana crops that sustain the Central
American economies also was extensive. Chiquita Brands
International Inc. said its regional banana farms and operations
suffered an estimated dlrs 50 million in losses.
	   Company officials in Cincinnati said their biggest worry was the
plight of stricken employees.
	   ``Our first priority is literally to save lives,'' said Chiquita
President Steve Warshaw. ``We have had several thousand people
stranded on rooftops.''
	   In New York, coffee and sugar futures rose sharply Tuesday as
damaged roads and washed-out bridges in Honduras, Guatemala and
Nicaragua prevented the arabica beans preferred by American
coffee-drinkers from reaching port.
	   It was the second straight day that coffee prices had surged.
Analysts also speculated that the rains spawned by Mitch damaged
coffee trees and had wiped out several million 32-pound bags of
beans.
	   Although deaths related to Hurricane Mitch were reported from
Nicaragua to southern Mexico, the greatest losses were in Honduras,
where an estimated 5,000 people died.
	   Honduran Communications Minister Tomas Lozano said Tuesday that
1 million had to flee their homes in this nation of 6 million
people. Countless more lacked clean water, food and medicine.
	   ``But we are dealing with preliminary official figures,'' he
said. ``And the number of victims will be greater when the waters
fall and the country returns to normal.''
	   Most of the deaths in Nicaragua occurred when the crater lake of
the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud and debris
onto several villages below.
	   Mayor Felicita Zeledon of nearby Posoltega said 1,950 bodies had
been recovered by Tuesday, though President Arnoldo Aleman's office
reported 1,338 dead.
	   Battered human bodies were found Tuesday half-buried in the mud
and entangled in sugar cane stalks, rotting because villagers had
no gasoline to burn them.
	   U.S. and local helicopters flew emergency missions throughout
the day in Nicaragua and Honduras to reach people trapped by the
floods.
	   In the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, people tried to find
missing relatives at hospitals and morgues.
	   Oscar Triminio, spokesman for the Tegucigalpa fire department,
said more than 30 bodies had been pulled from the Choluteca River
since Monday.
	   Lozano said many people remain trapped on rooftops by
floodwaters a week after Hurricane Mitch began pummeling the
Atlantic coast. The storm destroyed almost all of the highways,
dozens of bridges and 70 percent of the national agriculture.
	   That made it difficult to transport food and impossible to move
gasoline to fuel relief efforts, said Col. Alfredo San Martin, Air
Force chief of staff.
	   ``We now have fuel to operate, but in five or seven days, the
supplies will run out,'' he said.
	   U.S. military helicopters Tuesday ferried Honduran officials on
inspection tours of the refineries and transportation routes.
	   ``If we don't get fuel into the city, it will be utter chaos,''
said Lt. Col. Ricardo Aguilar of the U.S. Air Force.
	   In Guatemala, struck by Mitch over the weekend, President Alvaro
Arzu reported Tuesday that 157 people had died, 100,000 homes were
damaged and 30 highways were blocked.
	   El Salvador's National Emergency Committee reported 222 deaths,
135 missing and 50,000 driven from their homes by the flooding.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Mitch
had re-formed into a small tropical storm centered about 55 miles
(90 kph) west-southwest of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   At the United Nations, U.N. ambassadors from five nations
appealed for international help Tuesday to feed and clothe the
survivors and bury the dead.
	   Rebuilding the hardest-hit countries _ Honduras and Nicaragua _
will take many years and billions of dollars. But with victims
still clinging to trees and rooftops, the ambassadors said the
region's top priority is emergency assistance.
	   Honduran Ambassador Hugo Noe-Pino _ flanked by envoys from
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica _ said the killer
storm had put the country's development efforts back by at least 30
years.
	   In Washington, a Pentagon spokesman said more than two dozen
military aircraft have been sent into the region to assist with air
surveillance and rescue missions.
	   At least 500 U.S. military men and women have also been
dispatched to provide help, spokesman Capt. Michael Doubleday said.

French history with four in 3rd round; Fiorentina match suspended
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES will all 15 matches &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Four French teams recorded a historic first
Tuesday as they all reached the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   Spain got four of its five clubs through to the second round _
the only casualty a 2-2 Liverpool draw with Valencia, sending
through England's lone survivor through on the away-goal rule.
	   Italy, which has won the UEFA Cup seven of the last 10 seasons
with Inter Milan winning last season, advanced three clubs.
	   The fourth, Fiorentina, was leading 2-1 after 45 minutes in
Salerno in southern Italy _ and set to go through after taking the
first leg two weeks ago 2-0 _ when an off-field official was struck
by an explosive device thrown from the stands.
	   The Belgian official Philippe Flament suffered a knee injury _
not believed serious _ and it was initially unclear if the match
would be resumed Wednesday _ or under what conditions.
	   In the French sweep _ the first time France has qualified four
teams for the the UEFA Cup final 16 _ Lyon, Monaco, Marseille and
Bordeaux all advanced. Spain has Atletico Madrid, Real Sociedad,
Real Betis and Celta in the third round.
	   The Italians advancing were Parma, Roma and Bologna.
	   But it was a bad night for Germany with the loss of Stuttgart
and Werder Bremen. If Bayer Leverkusen is ousted in Thursday's
match at Rangers (Rangers lead 2-1), it will mark the first time
since 1967-68 that no German side has made the UEFA third round.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux advanced 3-1 after a 2-1 win over
Vitesse Arnhem. Silvain Wiltord got the winning goal in the 64th to
make it 2-1. Arnhem took a 1-0 lead in the 8th minute on a header
by Arco Jochemsen. Two minutes later, Bordeaux midfielder Johan
Micoud made it 1-1 from the edge of the area.
	   In Monte Carlo, Monaco, Monaco defeated Austria's Grazer AK 4-0
to advance on n
the 16th. Goran Bunjevcevic made it 1-1 in the 35th, but Christophe
Cocard and Caveglia scored late goals in the half to make it 3-1.
Perica Ognjenovic grabbed a goal in injury time.
	   In Marseille, France, Marseille beat Werder Bremen 3-2 and moved
on 4-3. Florian Maurice, Pierre Issa and Christophe Dugarry all
headed goals to give the French the victory. The teams drew the
first leg 1-1.
	   In San Sebastian, Spain, Real Sociedad beat Dynamo Moscow 3-0 to
advanced 6-2. Darko Kovacevic scored in the 56th _ his first of two
_ on a header for the Spaniards, and in the 70th Oscar de Paula
made it 2-0, slipping the ball home on a wet pitch. Kovacevic got
his second in the 75th.
	   In Valencia, Spain, the Spanish picked up their only loss as
Patrik Berger and Steve McManaman scored two goals in the final 10
minutes as Liverpool drew 2-2 Tuesday, advancing the English side
to the third round of the UEFA Cup on the away-goal rule. McManaman
scored in the 80th minute as Liverpool rallied to tie 1-1. Berger
got what turned out to be the deciding goal in the 86th to give
Liverpool a 2-1 lead. Valencia made it 2-2 of a free kick in
second-half injury time by Clauido Lopez, a goal that was ruled an
own-goal against Liverpool keeper David James. Lopez also scored in
the first half.
	   In Birmingham, England, Spain's Celta Vigo ousted English league
leader Aston Villa with a 3-1 win to advance 3-2. Celta took a 1-0
lead when Juan Sanchez scored in the 26th. Stan Collymore leveled
in the 30th on a penalty, but Russian Alexander Mostovoi gave Celta
a 2-1 lead in the 34th on a perfectly placed free kick from 20
meters (yards) and Luboslav Penev stretched the lead to 3-1 in the
48th.
	   In Seville, Spain, Real Betis trounced Willem II of the
Netherlands 3-0 to advance 4-1 for the team's first European win
under new coach Javier Clemente.
	   In Madrid, Atletico Madrid beat CSKA Sofia 1-0 to move through
5-2 with Juninho scoring on a 45th minute penalty kick.
	   In Parma, Italy, Parma advanced Tuesday on a 3-2 aggregate after
a 2-1 win over Wisla Krakow. Italian midfielder Stefano Fiore
scored in the 21st and Bogdan Zajac's own-goal made it 2-0 in the
46th. Zajac also scored the Pole's only goal in second-half injury
time.
	   In Prague, Czech Republic, Italy's Bologna defeated Slavia
Prague 2-0 to advance 4-1. Giuseppe Signori scored in the 80th off
a pass from Amedeo Mangone and Massimo Cappioli got the other six
minutes later.
	   In Leeds, England, despite a man advantage for 45 minutes, Leeds
had to settle for a scoreless tie against Roma as the Italian side
advanced 1-0.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, FC Brugge got through with a 3-2 victory
over VfB Stuttgart to advance 4-3. The game was tied 1-1 after
regulation time as Serb playmaker Alexander Ilic headed home the
winner in the 115th minute. Stuttgart mounted its unlikely comeback
when, trailing 1-0 in the second half, Pablo Thiam and Kristian
Djordevic were sent off with their second yellow cards.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Zurich won 4-2 over Glasgow's Celtic and
advanced 5-3 with all the goals coming in the second half.
	   The only one of the 16 UEFA Cup games not set for Tuesday will
be played Thursday with Bayer Leverkusen at Glasgow Rangers.

<TEXT>
	   SEVILLE, Spain (AP) _ Real Betis trounced Willem II of the
Netherlands 3-0 on Tuesday to advance 4-1 on aggregate to the third
round of the UEFA Cup.
	   Betis dominated throughout the game in its first European
appearance under former national coach Javier Clemente.
	   It scored first in the 28th minute with a goal by Finidi George
of Nigeria, who slammed home a loose ball from just outside
goalkeeper Jim van Fessem's box after several teammates failed to
control it and put it home.
	   Benjamin Zarandona made it 2-0 in the 56th minute, and Fernando
Sanchez scored the Seville side's third goal in the 89th minute.
	   It could have been even worse for the Dutch, as Betis blew two
easy chances to score in the opening minutes of the first half.
	   In the 17th Brazilian superstar Denilson de Oliveira made a nice
display of talent as he dribbled past several defenders and tried
to arc it into the net, only to see it sail over the crossbar.
	   In the 81st minute he had another opportunity, facing van Fessem
straight on from close range, but opted to fire away rather than go
around the keeper and the shot was stopped.
	   A crowd of 30,000 people _ including 800 Dutch _ watched the
game at Benito Villamarin stadium in Seville.

Turkish comedian goes on brief hunger strike to protest censorship

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's leading comedian went on a brief
hunger strike Tuesday, taking a stand against a censorship law that
let the government order a one-day blackout for a TV station that
aired his show.
	   Turkey's broadcasting board ordered Kanal D off the air because
of a skit in which comedian Levent Kirca mocked Women and Family
Affairs Minister Isilay Saygin for publicly declaring last month
that she remained a virgin at 52.
	   About 12 hours after he started his strike, however, Kirca
postponed his action, saying a legislator promised to wage his
campaign within Parliament.
	   Kirca, who has been praised for tackling such touchy matters as
corruption, military coups and torture for over a decade, insisted
the blackout was unjust.
	   After postponing his strike, he said he would ``take more
radical steps,'' if the board did not reverse its decision. He did
not elaborate.
	   The board, which is empowered to black out stations it judges to
be politically biased, slanderous or offensive, has not said when
the shutdown will occur.
	   ``The board cannot be expected to tolerate programs involving
personal insults and so much violence or sexuality that could hurt
children,'' board chief Kutlu Savas said Tuesday.
	   Kirca put his show on hold after the board's decision.
	   Saygin raised something of a storm this year when she defended
virginity tests for girls in state homes and orphanages. The tests
have pushed some state wards to suicide.
	   In the skit that got him punished, Kirca asks an actress playing
Saygin why she is in support of virginity tests.
	   She replied she wasn't just in favor of the tests _ she thought
women should wear some kind of device that would let state
controllers ``check what they have done or not done.''
	   Saygin said she was against censorship ``but everyone should
know their limits.'' She said she was terribly insulted by the
show.
	   Virginity is highly valued in conservative Turkish society. The
board and some viewers found that the sketch by Kirca offended
Turkish family values under which an unmarried woman is expected to
be a virgin, no matter her age.

Real Sociedad stops Dynamo Moscow 3-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ Darko Kovacevic scored twice to lead
Real Sociedad to a 3-0 drubbing of Dynamo Moscow on Tuesday and
advance his team to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   The aggregate score was 6-2 since Real beat Dynamo 3-2 in Moscow
two weeks ago in the first leg of the second round.
	   On Tuesday the two sides played a scoreless first half under
driving rain in Anoeta stadium in this seaside city in the Spanish
Basque country.
	   Kovacevic broke the ice in the 56th minute with a crisp header
after a corner kick from Francisco Jose de Pedro.
	   Five minutes later Ricardo Sa Pinto missed with a blazing
left-footed shot from just outside the area.
	   But in the 70th minute Oscar de Paula stole the ball on an error
by the Russian defense and dribbled past goalie Dmitry Tyapushkin,
who slid in a puddle of water in a vain attempt to stop the shot,
making the score 2-0.
	   Kovacevic, who came up with two goals in Moscow as well, scored
again in the 75th minute as Sa Pinto passed him the ball at
midfield and the Croat ran in solo, then arced the ball above
Tyapushkin's head when the Russian came out to meet him.
	   It was Kovacevic's fifth goal in UEFA Cup play this year.

Brazil condemns Colombian military incursion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso met
Tuesday with top military brass and recalled the ambassador to
Bogota for consultations to protest a Colombian military incursion
onto Brazilian soil.
	   ``The two acts represent an act of public protest,''
presidential spokesman Sergio Amaral told reporters at his daily
briefing.
	   According to a statement issued by the Brazilian Foreign
Ministry, the Colombian government asked Brazil for permission to
use an air base at Querari, in Brazil's western Amazon near the
border with Colombia.
	   But before Brazil could respond to the request Colombian
aircraft began landing at the base.
	   ``The guerrillas were operating on the border with Brazil and
attacking a Colombian military base. So Colombians began to attack
the guerrillas from Brazilian territory,'' Amaral said.
	   The Colombian troops were given until 6:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) to
collect their dead and wounded and leave the area.
	   Amaral said that Cardoso had already discussed the problem with
Colombian President Andres Pastrana.
	   According to Colombian military leader Fernando Tapias, Brazil
was providing ``logistic and humanitarian'' aid to their troops.
	   Some 110 Colombia troops are believed to have died in the region
in fighting that took place over the weekend.

French make history; Fiorentina match suspended
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS throughout, tightens &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Four French teams recorded a historic first
Tuesday as they all reached the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   Spain got four of its five clubs through to the second round _
the only casualty coming as Liverpool drew 2-2 with Valencia,
sending through England's lone survivor on the away-goal rule.
	   Italy, which has won the UEFA Cup seven of the last 10 seasons
with Inter Milan winning last season, advanced three clubs.
	   The fourth, Fiorentina, was leading 2-1 after 45 minutes in
Salerno in southern Italy _ and set to go through after taking the
first leg two weeks ago 2-0 _ when an off-field official was struck
by an explosive device thrown from the stands.
	   The Belgian official Philippe Flament suffered a minor knee
injury and it was unclear if the match would be resumed Wednesday _
or under what conditions.
	   In the French sweep _ the first time France has qualified four
teams for the the UEFA Cup final 16 _ Lyon, Monaco, Marseille and
Bordeaux all advanced. Spain has Atletico Madrid, Real Sociedad,
Real Betis and Celta in the third round.
	   The Italians advancing were Parma, Roma and Bologna.
	   It was a bad night for Germany with losses by Stuttgart and
Werder Bremen. If Bayer Leverkusen is ousted in Thursday's match at
Rangers (Rangers lead 2-1), it will mark the first time since
1967-68 that no German side has made the UEFA third round.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux advanced 3-1 after a 2-1 win over
Vitesse Arnhem. Silvain Wiltord got the winning goal in the 64th.
Arnhem took a 1-0 lead in the 8th minute on a header by Arco
Jochemsen. Two minutes later, Bordeaux midfielder Johan Micoud made
it 1-1 from the edge of the area.
	   In Monte Carlo, Monaco, Monaco defeated Austria's Grazer AK 4-0
to advance 7-3 on aggregate. Monaco, last year's European Champions
Cup semifinalists, went ahead 1-0 in the 8th on Frank Gava's volley
and made it 2-0 10 minutes later on a header by Robert Spehar.
Senegal's Djibril Diawara and Gava got the final strikes.
	   In Lyon, France, Lyon beat Red Star Belgrade 3-2 to advance 5-3.
Alain Caveglia scored his first of two to give Lyon a 1-0 lead in
the 16th. Goran Bunjevcevic made it 1-1 in the 35th, but Christophe
Cocard and Caveglia scored late goals in the half to make it 3-1.
Perica Ognjenovic grabbed a goal in injury time.
	   In Marseille, France, Marseille beat Werder Bremen 3-2 and moved
on 4-3. Florian Maurice, Pierre Issa and Christophe Dugarry all
headed home to give the French the victory. The teams drew the
first leg 1-1.
	   In Valencia, Spain, the Spanish up their only loss as Patrik
Berger and Steve McManaman scored two goals in the final 10 minutes
as Liverpool drew 2-2, advancing the English on the away-goal rule.
	   McManaman scored in the 80th as Liverpool rallied to tie 1-1.
Berger got what turned out to be the deciding goal in the 86th for
a 2-1 lead. Valencia made it 2-2 of a free kick in second-half
injury time by Clauido Lopez, a goal that was ruled an own-goal
against Liverpool keeper David James. Lopez also scored in the
first half. McManaman, Paul Ince and Amadeo Carboni of Valencia
were given red cards for a scuffle just before the final goal.
	   In Birmingham, England, Spain's Celta Vigo ousted English league
leader Aston Villa with a 3-1 win to advance 3-2. Celta took a 1-0
lead from Juan Sanchez in the 26th. Stan Collymore leveled in the
30th on a penalty, but Russian Alexander Mostovoi gave Celta a 2-1
lead in the 34th on a free kick, and Luboslav Penev stretched the
lead to 3-1 in the 48th.
	   In San Sebastian, Spain, Real Sociedad beat Dynamo Moscow 3-0 to
advanced 6-2. Darko Kovacevic scored in the 56th _ his first of two
_ and in the 70th Oscar de Paula made it 2-0, slipping the ball
home on a wet pitch. Kovacevic got his second in the 75th.
	   In Seville, Spain, Real Betis trounced Willem II of the
Netherlands 3-0 to advance 4-1 for the team's first European win
under new coach Javier Clemente.
	   In Madrid, Atletico Madrid beat CSKA Sofia 1-0 to move through
5-2 with Juninho scoring on a 45th minute penalty kick.
	   In Parma, Italy, Parma advanced on a 3-2 aggregate after a 2-1
win over Wisla Krakow. Italian midfielder Stefano Fiore scored in
the 21st and Bogdan Zajac's own-goal made it 2-0 in the 46th. Zajac
also scored the Pole's only goal in second-half injury time.
	   In Prague, Czech Republic, Italy's Bologna defeated Slavia
Prague 2-0 to advance 4-1. Giuseppe Signori scored in the 80th off
a pass from Amedeo Mangone and Massimo Cappioli got the other six
minutes later.
	   In Leeds, England, despite a man advantage for 45 minutes, Leeds
had to settle for a scoreless tie against Roma as the Italians
advanced 1-0.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, FC Brugge got through with a 3-2 victory
over VfB Stuttgart to advance 4-3. The game was tied 1-1 after
regulation time as Serb playmaker Alexander Ilic headed home the
winner in the 115th minute. Stuttgart mounted its unlikely comeback
when, trailing 1-0 in the second half, Pablo Thiam and Kristian
Djordevic of Stuttgart were sent off with their second yellow
cards.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Zurich won 4-2 over Glasgow's Celtic and
advanced 5-3 with all the goals coming in the second half.
	   The only one of the 16 UEFA Cup games not set for Tuesday will
be played Thursday with Bayer Leverkusen at Glasgow Rangers.

PGA season was one for the ages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ The 1998 season on the PGA Tour was
truly one for the ages.
	   Instead of a battle for supremacy between Tiger Woods, David
Duval, Ernie Els and the rest of the 20-something stars, golf
delivered another reminder that it does not discriminate against
age.
	   In between winning the Masters and the British Open, 41-year-old
Mark O'Meara reflected on an 18-year career in which he had won 14
times on tour, six other times around the world and a U.S. Amateur
championship.
	   He is older and wiser, but no less a competitor. A year ago, he
fought off Woods down the stretch at Pebble Beach. Two weeks before
this season ended, he rallied to beat Woods in the 36-hole final of
the World Match Play Championship.
	   When the player of the year is awarded Nov. 20 at the World Golf
Village, he likely will win the vote of his peers over Duval.
	   ``I have said this before,'' O'Meara said earlier this year,
``the golf ball is sitting out there on the ground. It doesn't know
how old you are. It doesn't know if you are 20 or 30 or 50 or 60 or
70. It just sits there waiting to be struck.
	   ``That's what makes this game so special.''
	   The season began with Phil Mickelson, 27, winning the Mercedes
Championship, his 12th victory in a career that is sure to produce
many more.
	   It ended with the resurrection of 40-year-old Hal Sutton, a
former golden boy in golf who carries a little more weight around
the waistline but no less game that won him the PGA Championship
and The Players Championship in 1983.
	   ``We don't want to roll over and play dead yet,'' Sutton said
after his playoff victory over Vijay Singh in the Tour
Championship. ``The focus has been on all those young guys. It's
paved the way for us to quietly go about our business.''
	   A year ago, three players in their 40s won on the PGA Tour _
O'Meara, Nick Price and Greg Norman. This year, that number
increased to seven _ and Norman played only eight rounds before
season-ending shoulder surgery.
	   Along with O'Meara, Scott Simpson won at San Diego, and John
Cook and Tom Watson won on consecutive weekends in Texas. Nick
Price won at Memphis, Jeff Sluman won at Milwaukee and Sutton
finished the year with two victories in a span of six weeks.
	   Clearly, the depth in golf has never been this strong. It has
become increasingly difficult for any one player _ or any one age
group _ to dominate like Nicklaus and Miller and Watson once did.
	   Consider this:
	   _ There were only eight multiple winners on tour this year, down
from 11 in 1997.
	   _ Duval, who won four times, became only the third player in the
past 15 years to win at least three tournaments in consecutive
years. The others were Price in 1993-94 and Curtis Strange in
1987-88.
	   _ For the first time since 1991, only one player won more than
twice in a year.
	   ``I think that's what is great about the tour right now,''
Sutton said. ``It's got so much depth, young and old. The tour
looks bright because there's so many guys that are capable
players.''
	   Golf was supposed to be run over by the 20-something movement,
especially after Woods, Els and Justin Leonard won the first three
majors in 1997 and Duval closed out the season by winning the last
three events.
	   The youngest winner of a major this year was 34-year-old Lee
Janzen, who won his second U.S. Open. Singh, 35, took the PGA
Championship and O'Meara became the oldest player ever to win two
majors in one year.
	   ``Golf isn't a sport where age makes a huge difference,''
Leonard said. ``Sure, the difference between a 15-year-old and a
30-year-old is a big difference, but once you're a professional on
the PGA Tour, I don't think age is as great a factor as people give
it.''
	   Still, the best depth on tour starts in the 20s.
	   That much is clear by looking down the list of the Presidents
Cup team, which was determined by money won over the past two
seasons. The top five qualifiers were Duval, Woods, Jim Furyk,
Leonard and Mickelson.
	   Woods won only one PGA Tour event, but he was always there. He
had 13 finishes in the top 10 _ no one has had more than that this
decade. Mickelson won at least two tournaments for the third year
in a row.
	   All of them figure to be at the top of golf for many years. But
as O'Meara and Sutton proved this year, the young guns might not
have the stage to themselves.

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ WBC welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya was
cut on his left eyelid during a sparring session, forcing the
postponement of his Nov. 21 title defense against Ike Quartey.
	   De La Hoya cannot spar for three weeks because of the cut, said
Lee Samuels, a spokesman for Top Rank, Inc. The injury happened
Saturday, Samuels said, and De La Hoya was told of the training
restrictions when he had the cut examined again on Tuesday.
	   De La Hoya was struck on the left eye during a workout at his
training facility in Big Bear, California, said Bob Arum, Top Rank
president.
	   The fight was to have been held at the Thomas and Mack Center
here, with Caesars Palace hotel-casino as the host. It will be
rescheduled for Feb. 6 or 13 at the same venue, with the same host,
Samuels said.
	   De La Hoya, from East Los Angeles, is 29-0 with 24 knockouts.
Quartey, from Ghana, is 34-0-1 with 29 knockouts.

Former co-manager files suit against Tyson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ John K. Horne, former co-manager of Mike
Tyson, filed a lawsuit against the boxer on Tuesday, claiming
breach of contract and seeking damages in excess of dlrs 14
million.
	   Horne had filed a suit against Tyson's new adviser, Shelley
Finkel, in state District Court in Las Vegas last month, seeking a
10 percent share in any money Tyson makes from his next five
fights.
	   Tyson, who had his Nevada boxing license reinstated Oct. 19 _ a
day before Horne filed his suit against Finkel _ will reportedly
return to the ring Jan. 16 against Francois Botha of South Africa
at the MGM Grand. The bout would be promoted by America Presents.
	   In the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court,
Horne claimed Tyson breached a contract that the two entered into
with Showtime Networks Inc. along with co-manager Rory Holloway and
promoter Don King on March 17, 1995.
	   Horne, now a movie producer in Beverly Hills, Calif., also
claimed that Tyson has failed to repay personal loans of over dlrs
50,000.
	   The lawsuit claims that Horne, Holloway and King _ known as Team
Tyson _ signed a contract with Showtime on March 17, 1995 that
called for the group to handle Tyson's first 10 fights after Tyson
was freed from an Indiana prison on rape charges, and that Horne
would be paid 10 percent of Tyson's earnings.
	   It was during the fifth fight under that contract _ and sixth
fight overall _ that Tyson bit heavyweight champion Evander
Holyfield's ears, prompting a dlrs 3 million fine and a one-year
ban from boxing by the Nevada commission.
	   The lawsuit alleges the purses from the five bouts under the
Showtime agreement totaled dlrs 140 million, and the remaining five
bouts required under the agreement will yield similar purses, of
which Horne is due 10 percent pursuant to the terms of the Team
Tyson Agreement.
	   Tyson broke from Horne, Holloway and King last March, filing
lawsuits against each. He accused King of cheating him out of tens
of millions of dollars, and his co-managers of betraying him by
arranging a deal that made King the former champion's exclusive
promoter.
	   Horne and Holloway have counter-sued Tyson.

French make history; Fiorentina match suspended
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS, trims &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Four French teams recorded a historic first
Tuesday as they all reached the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   Spain got four of its five clubs through to the final 16, the
only casualty coming as Liverpool drew 2-2 with Valencia, sending
through England's lone survivor on the away-goal rule.
	   Italy, which has won the UEFA Cup seven of the last 10 seasons
with Inter Milan winning last season, advanced three clubs.
	   The fourth, Fiorentina, was leading 2-1 after 45 minutes in
Salerno in southern Italy _ and set to go through after taking the
first leg two weeks ago 2-0 _ when an off-field official was struck
by an explosive device thrown from the stands.
	   The Belgian official Philippe Flament suffered a minor knee
injury and it was unclear if the match would be resumed Wednesday _
or under what conditions.
	   In the French sweep _ the first time France has qualified four
teams for the the UEFA Cup final 16 _ Lyon, Monaco, Marseille and
Bordeaux all advanced. Spain has Atletico Madrid, Real Sociedad,
Real Betis and Celta in the third round.
	   The Italians advancing were 1995 champion Parma, Roma and
Bologna.
	   It was a bad night for Germany with losses by Stuttgart and
Werder Bremen. If Bayer Leverkusen is ousted in Thursday's match at
Rangers (Rangers lead 2-1), it will mark the first time since
1967-68 that no German side has made the UEFA third round.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux advanced 3-1 after a 2-1 win over
Vitesse Arnhem. Silvain Wiltord got the winner in the 64th. Arnhem
took a 1-0 lead in the 8th minute on a header by Arco Jochemsen.
Two minutes later, Bordeaux midfielder Johan Micoud made it 1-1
from the edge of the area.
	   In Monte Carlo, Monaco, Monaco defeated Austria's Grazer AK 4-0
to advance 7-3 on aggregate. Monaco, last year's European Champions
Cup semifinalists, went ahead 1-0 in the 8th on Frank Gava's volley
and made it 2-0 10 minutes later on a header by Robert Spehar.
Senegal's Djibril Diawara and Gava got the final strikes.
	   In Lyon, France, Lyon beat Red Star Belgrade 3-2 to advance 5-3.
Alain Caveglia scored his first of two to give Lyon a 1-0 lead in
the 16th. Goran Bunjevcevic made it 1-1 in the 35th, but Christophe
Cocard and Caveglia scored late goals in the half to make it 3-1.
Perica Ognjenovic grabbed a goal in injury time.
	   In Marseille, France, Marseille beat Werder Bremen 3-2 and moved
on 4-3. Florian Maurice, Pierre Issa and Christophe Dugarry all
headed home to give the French the victory. The teams drew the
first leg 1-1.
	   In Valencia, Spain, the Spanish up their only loss as Patrik
Berger and Steve McManaman scored two goals in the final 10 minutes
as Liverpool drew 2-2, advancing the English on the away-goal rule.
McManaman scored in the 80th as Liverpool rallied to tie 1-1.
Berger got what turned out to be the deciding goal in the 86th for
a 2-1 lead. Valencia made it 2-2 of late free kick by Clauido
Lopez, a goal that was ruled an own-goal against Liverpool keeper
David James. Lopez also scored in the first half. McManaman, Paul
Ince and Amadeo Carboni of Valencia were given red cards for a
scuffle just before the final goal.
	   In Birmingham, England, Spain's Celta Vigo ousted English league
leader Aston Villa with a 3-1 win to advance 3-2. Celta took a 1-0
lead from Juan Sanchez in the 26th. Stan Collymore leveled in the
30th on a penalty, but Russian Alexander Mostovoi gave Celta a 2-1
lead in the 34th on a free kick, and Luboslav Penev stretched the
lead to 3-1 in the 48th.
	   In San Sebastian, Spain, Real Sociedad beat Dynamo Moscow 3-0 to
advance 6-2. Darko Kovacevic scored in the 56th _ his first of two
_ and Oscar de Paula made it 2-0 in the 70th. Kovacevic got his
second in the 75th.
	   In Seville, Spain, Real Betis trounced Willem II of the
Netherlands 3-0 to advance 4-1 for the team's first European win
under new coach Javier Clemente.
	   In Madrid, Atletico Madrid beat CSKA Sofia 1-0 to move through
5-2 with Juninho scoring on a 45th minute penalty kick.
	   In Parma, Italy, Parma moved on 3-2 after a 2-1 win over Wisla
Krakow. Italian midfielder Stefano Fiore scored in the 21st and
Bogdan Zajac's own-goal made it 2-0 in the 46th. Zajac also scored
the Pole's only goal in second-half injury time.
	   In Prague, Czech Republic, Italy's Bologna defeated Slavia
Prague 2-0 to advance 4-1. Giuseppe Signori scored in the 80th off
a pass from Amedeo Mangone and Massimo Cappioli got the other six
minutes later.
	   In Leeds, England, despite a man advantage for 45 minutes, Leeds
had to settle for a scoreless tie against Roma as the Italians
advanced 1-0.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, FC Brugge got through with a 3-2 victory
over VfB Stuttgart to advance 4-3. The game was tied 1-1 after
regulation time as Serb playmaker Alexander Ilic headed home the
winner in the 115th minute. Stuttgart mounted its unlikely comeback
when, trailing 1-0 in the second half, Pablo Thiam and Kristian
Djordevic of Stuttgart were sent off with their second yellow
cards.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Zurich won 4-2 over Glasgow's Celtic and
advanced 5-3 with all the goals coming in the second half.

Augusta changes are not so subtle this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ There always seems to be some minor
tweaking of Augusta National Golf Club, real or imaginary. Last
year, players insisted that the 15th tee box had been moved about
15 feet (4.5 meters) to the left, although Masters officials said
that wasn't the case.
	   This time, the changes will be obvious.
	   For starters, Augusta has been remeasured from 6,925 to 6,985
yards (6,302 to 6,356 meters), accounting for revised architectural
standards _ and two new tee boxes.
	   The tee box at No. 2 has been moved back about 25 yards (23
meters) and is surrounded by a 10-foot (3-meter) stone wall to keep
the maintenance area out of sight. The new tee brings the fairway
bunker down the right side into play more often. A big drive can
still catch the slope, but it's doubtful Tiger Woods can get home
in two with an 8-iron.
	   The par-4 17th also is about 25 yards (23 meters) longer and now
plays at 425 yards (128 meters). While a cluster of pines has been
planted on the right, the most noticeable difference is the
Eisenhower Pine _ it's now about 200 yards (182 meters) down the
left side and looks like it sticks out even more.
	   The tee box at the 500-yard (455 meters) 15th still hasn't
moved, but the par-5 figures to play much differently because of
changes to the right side of the fairway.
	   The mounds that some players used as a slingshot to get down the
hill have been flattened and 20 pine trees have been planted in
that spot. From a visual perspective, the driving area looks much
tighter.
	   Also at No. 15, a mound right of the green that used to feed
balls toward the putting area has been removed, and six pine trees
planted.
	   The only other change is at the par-4 11th. The green is 2 feet
(0.6 meters) higher, the pond left of the green was raised by a
foot (0.3 meters) and the two bunkers behind and to the right of
the green have been replaced by a single bunker.
	   Behind the green, Rae's Creek is 50 percent wider and the wooden
dam station is longer to account for the change.
	   The higher green allows for a new pin position, but the changes
were mainly for flood control. The biggest difference is that a
shot like Larry Mize's chip-in to win the 1987 Masters will be even
more improbable with the raised green.
	   The changes come one year after Woods' assault on Augusta, tying
the record with an 18-under 270. However, these had been on the
drawing board before Woods won the first of his three straight U.S.
Amateur titles.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CHANGING HIS STRIPES: &LR;  A year ago, Tiger Woods won the Masters
and three tournaments and had a huge impact on the sport. He
changed his swing this year, won only once and had to answer
questions about a ``slump.''
	   So why the change?
	   Distance control, for one. Woods no longer is missing the green
by 30 yards (27 meters) with a 9-iron in his hands. And coach Butch
Harmon says the new Tiger Woods has been rebuilt for the long run.
	   ``There was so much pull on his lower back,'' Harmon said before
the final round of the Tour Championship, where Woods closed with
two 69s and tied for 20th.
	   But it wasn't just a concern with potential back problems. By
going to a wider backswing, Harmon said Woods can get the club in
better position at the top, allowing him more room on the way down.
This helps keep him from getting stuck inside and blocking shots to
the right.
	   ``He was hitting far too many bad shots under pressure,
especially with the longer irons and the driver,'' Harmon said.
	   Harmon said Woods was the hardest worker he had seen on the PGA
Tour since Greg Norman. The next step _ and perhaps the biggest _
is the putting, which kept Woods from winning this year more than
any other club in his bag.
	   ``He's just in one of those spells when the ball doesn't go in
the hole,'' Harmon said. ``Putting is very individualistic. You
don't want to fool around with it. I think Tiger, in the last part
of the year, has fooled around with it some. But that's human
nature.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CANDID MONTY: &LR;  Expect to see Colin Montgomerie on Spanish
television, and not just because he won his record sixth straight
Order of Merit last week.
	   Before the season's final tournament, Montgomerie took exception
to a camera crew in the interview room that was not part of the
regular media that covers the European tour.
	   ``This is a very private thing,'' the Scotsman told the crew.
	   When the man holding the microphone stayed put, Montgomerie
appealed to a tournament official.
	   ``Just get him to leave, please. He's a nuisance,'' Montgomerie
said. ``He's been annoying all the players.''
	   The man he called a nuisance turned out to be Mario Cabellero,
star of one of the most watched programs in Spain _ ``Caiga Quien
Caiga,'' the country's version of ``Candid Camera.''

On what was supposed to be opening night, the ball doesn't bounce
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Tuesday's developments &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Where Patrick Ewing usually suits up, boxes were
piled high. Exercise cycles and empty ball racks were strewn about,
mops were standing in the corner and three garbage buckets were
stuffed into Terry Cummings' locker.
	   ``Unfortunately, the Knicks' locker room has been turned into a
storage room,'' a tour guide explained. ``My best guess is it will
stay this way until January.''
	   Instead of a basketball court, there was a sheet of pristine ice
for hockey. Outside, where scalpers usually ply their trade, there
was only a stream of office workers shielding themselves from a
harsh wind.
	   That was how things looked Tuesday at Madison Square Garden,
where the New York Knicks were supposed to have opened their
1998-99 season against the Boston Celtics in one of 10 games on the
NBA schedule.
	   The Garden and nine other arenas were as dark as the prevailing
mood.
	   It was Day 125 of the lockout, which meant no Shaq, no Michael,
no Kobe _ and no end in sight to the work stoppage that has forced
the NBA to cancel games for the first time in its history.
	   ``It doesn't look so good,'' commissioner David Stern said on
MSNBC. ``Obviously once we get into December without a deal, if
that occurs, then I'd say the season is in jeopardy.''
	   There were no words of encouragement coming from Stern on the
day when all the talk of missed games finally became a reality. The
league and the players will be back at the bargaining table
Wednesday _ one week after Michael Jordan joined the talks and a
speedy agreement seemed possible _ with both sides now saying not
much progress is being made.
	   ``They have a pie, and they are fighting over how much of the
pie each side gets to eat,'' the Madison Square Garden guide
explained to a group of 16 tourists from the United States, the
Netherlands, Greece, Spain and Ireland. ``The owners and players
are each getting this much,'' he said, holding his hands a few
inches apart, ``and the owners are trying to force the players to
take this much,'' he said, moving his hands within an inch of each
other.
	   ``They should all be disgusted with themselves,'' said Sophia
Bogdasarian, a tourist from outside of Boston.
	   If her words reflected the feelings of basketball fans
worldwide, the lockout moved into a new phase Tuesday as the
reality of canceled games hit home.
	   Instead of having an NBA doubleheader available on TNT,
basketball fans could choose between hockey on ESPN, a movie on
TNT, or a mind-numbing total of 12 sitcoms offered on the main
broadcast networks.
	   ``I guess I'll just do some laundry,'' Toronto Raptors general
manager Glen Grunwald said.
	   In Salt Lake City, where the Jazz were supposed to have played
the Vancouver Grizzlies, the Delta Center was dark and the team's
two Western Conference championship banners were almost covered by
shadows in the rafters. The actual court on which Jordan won his
sixth championship less than five months ago was packed away in
storage.
	   At the Georgia Dome, the sound of the empty, creaking outdoor
escalator was the only break in the silence surrounding the locked
stadium.
	   A few people showed up at the box office to buy Atlanta Falcons
tickets, but otherwise the dome was remiss of the normal hoopla
that takes place in preparation for a Hawks game.
	   ``Not much is happening here,'' ticket manager Keith Ayers said.
	   America West Arena, where the Phoenix Suns were scheduled to
play the Minnesota Timberwolves, was empty except for about 30
people having lunch in the food plaza.
	   Bill Hollis, an assistant manager at a sporting goods shop down
the street, said demand for Suns apparel was down drastically.
	   ``People are asking about the new merchandise, and we really
don't know who's on the team,'' he said.
	   The league may be banking on the belief that basketball fans are
different from baseball fans and will be more likely to forgive and
forget when this dispute is finally resolved.
	   But an ESPN poll conducted Oct. 31-Nov. 1 found that almost 63
percent of sports fans over the age of 18 did not care if the
entire season was canceled, and more than 37 percent of people who
consider themselves NBA fans don't care if the season is canceled.

Antarctic explorers start out on ski trek to South Pole
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Towing sleds carrying their only
provisions for the next 100 days, three men Wednesday began a
journey which if successful will be the longest unsupported ice
adventure of the century.
	   The three hope to ski nearly 1,875 miles (3,000 kms) to and from
the South Pole with no outside assistance as they recreate the
ill-fated 1911 expedition of British Antarctic explorer Robert
Falcon Scott.
	   New Zealander Peter Hillary, son of Everest conqueror Sir Edmund
Hillary, and Australians Jon Muir and Eric Philips set out from New
Zealand's Antarctic Scott Base on Wednesday morning, seen off by
about 60 staff from Scott Base and the nearby U.S. base McMurdo
Station.
	   Delayed in recent days by driving winds, the weather Wednesday
was calm, with the temperature a mild minus 11 F (minus 24 C).
	   Their journey will see each member of the group man-hauling 396
lbs (180 kg) of food, fuel and equipment, to the pole and back.
	   Scott and his team of four men, who had set out with ponies and
husky sled-dogs, died of starvation and weakness only a few miles
(kilometers) from a supply dump and only days from journey's end.
The animals also perished.
	   Hillary's team, however, is banking on the use of modern
technology _ like super lightweight equipment, an Iridium satellite
cellphone and paraglider-style kites _ to see it safely through the
adventure, which is estimated to last about 100 days.
	   ``An unsupported return trip has never been accomplished ... it
looks like a pretty fantastic challenge to take on,'' Hillary said
before setting out.
	   ``Going one way to the pole is like being helicoptered off the
summit of a mountain. You've got to get there and back,'' said
Hillary, who like his father has also climbed Mount Everest, the
world's tallest peak.
	   Some places the team plans to trek, such as the 88-mile long
(140 kms) Shackleton Glacier, is thought to have never been crossed
before. They expect the route will speed up their journey.
	   ``The crevasse fields are intimidating, I think of them as human
mousetraps,'' Hillary said.
	   With tail winds, the trek's quadrofoil kites will allow the men
to double their usual speed. The kites are expected to be used
mostly during the return trip.
	   ``We can average 15 to 25 kilometers (nine to 15 miles) an hour.
Ten hours at that rate would mean we cover a couple of hundred
kilometers (125 miles) and we certainly expect to do that on a few
occasions.''
	   The team expects to lose up to a week at a time because of
blizzard conditions, and Hillary said they would rely on the kites
to help make up lost time.
	   He described the odyssey across the frozen southern continent as
having a mix of ``old-world expeditionary values'' with the modern.
	   ``We will be man-hauling our sleds most of the way ... so many
aspects of the expedition will be very similar to those he (Scott)
had. Let's face it, Antarctica hasn't changed.
	   ``What has changed in 1998 is that we have quadrofoil kites to
help us harness the winds and speed us on the way back,'' Hillary
said.
	   Team member Muir described the trio's mental attitude as healthy
upon starting the trek.
	   The satellite phone carried by the team will keep them in touch
with family and support staff throughout the trip.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Hope for a big victory by either major
American party appeared unlikely as Republicans and Democrats
wrapped up campaigns for Tuesday's elections. At stake was control
of Congress, three dozen state governorships and hundreds of lesser
offices. President Bill Clinton campaigned right up to the last day
for Democrats, hoping to keep Republicans from strengthening their
hold on the House and Senate, as well as their control of the
impeachment process that threatens his six-year presidency. House
Speaker Newt Gingrich was campaigning at home in Georgia after a
year of traveling to 48 states for fellow Republicans. His own seat
was secure, but his future as a leader could depend on the national
totals. (US-ELECTION ROUNDUP)
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Grieving crowds jammed morgues and
hospitals in search of missing loved ones in the Honduran capital
Tuesday, while others throughout the country waited to be rescued
from rooftops and islands surrounded by floodwaters. Meanwhile, the
storm, which killed more than 7,000 people, re-formed as a tropical
storm in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday though its 45 mph (70 kph)
winds were a shadow of the 180 mph (290 kph) monster of last week.
Weather forecasters said the storm, moving to the northeast, could
strike the Yucatan Peninsula and then Florida later in the week
with heavy rains _ but not with anything approaching
hurricane-force winds. In the Honduan capital, the sun came out
Tuesday after a week of torrential rains and churning winds but
authorities feared the scope of the disaster caused by one of the
worst Atlantic tropical storms ever could widen. (MITCH)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Warning again of a possible military attack on
Iraq, top U.S. administration officials sought the cooperation of
Saudi Arabia, a key player in the Gulf and in the U.S.-led combat
operation against Baghdad eight years ago. As Defense Secretary
William Cohen flew overnight to the region, with Saudi Arabia his
first stop, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright made separate telephone calls to Crown Prince Abdallah,
first in line to ailing King Fahd. In Washington, the State
Department cautioned Americans living and traveling abroad to
beware of random anti-American violence. (US-IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a new crisis of confidence, Israel said
Tuesday it will not carry out the land-for-security agreement with
the Palestinians until it gets assurances that 30 Palestinian
fugitives will be arrested by the Palestinian Authority. The
Palestinians said the United States was satisfied with their
antiterror plan and accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
seizing a pretext to avoid handing over West Bank land. The latest
dispute raised questions about whether the two sides could stick to
the 12-week program, which was to have taken effect Monday but was
delayed at the request of Netanyahu. Under the timetable agreed to
at the Wye summit, the first installment of an Israeli troop
pullback from 13 percent of the West Bank is due on Nov. 16. U.S.
Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive Thursday in the Middle East
to oversee implementation, and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
it was up to the Americans to break the latest impasse.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said
Tuesday he had authorized talks with groups linked to the militant
Basque ETA separatists, marking the first time his government has
taken steps to negotiate an end to the 30-year conflict. The
contacts would be through the Basque National Liberation Movement,
a loose grouping of ETA and other militant separatist
organizations, a spokesman for Aznar's office said on customary
condition of anonymity. The official government spokesman, Josep
Pique, told reporters that the contacts were aimed at exploring
possibilities opened up by the cease-fire, ``to find out whether
(ETA) is really willing to give up violence for good.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Most stocks rose Tuesday, but blue-chip shares
encountered some profit-taking, halting a four-session winning
streak by several leading measures. The Dow Jones industrial
average finished unchanged at 8,706.15 after drifting between a
38-point gain and a 28-point loss. Broader stock measures finished
mixed in the lifeless Election Day session. The technology-heavy
Nasdaq composite index suffered the steepest loss after posting
four sessions of big gains. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A key measure of future economy activity was
unchanged in September for the second straight month. The
Conference Board, a private research group, reported Tuesday that
its Index of Leading Economic Indicators held at 105.5 in
September, the same level as in July and August. The figure was a
surprise to economists who had expected a slight decrease. Combined
with the performance of two sister indicators, the leading index
shows the economy will continue to grow at a slow pace, the
Conference Board said. ``The economy will be hard-pressed to match
the robust growth posted the past few years,'' said Michael Boldin,
a Conference Board economist. ``Still, the leading index is
considerably higher now compared with last year, and rising
consumer spending and low interest rates should keep us out of a
recession.'' (US-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar rose against major currencies Tuesday
as three more European central banks cut key interest rates,
leading investors to believe that more cuts are on the way. The
dollar's gain against the Japanese yen was blunted by optimism that
ongoing changes in the banking sector will help that country
recover from its worst recession in decades. In Japan, where that
optimism would have had greater impact, markets were closed Tuesday
for a national holiday. In late New York dealings, the dollar was
quoted at 1.6601 marks, up from 1.6533 late Monday. The dollar also
was changing hands at 115.33 yen, up from 114.73. (US-DOLLAR)
	   UNDATED (AP) _ The central banks in Spain, Portugal and Sweden
cut key lending rates Tuesday in an effort to keep their economies
growing. The cuts could put added pressure on Germany, France and
other European countries to trim their rates as well. The Bank of
Spain lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point
to 3.50 percent. Hours later, the central bank in neighboring
Portugal trimmed a quarter percentage point from its benchmark
lending rate to 3.75 percent. Earlier, Sweden's central bank cut
its one-week fixed securities repurchase rate _ a key indicator of
lending trends _ to 3.85 percent from 4.10 percent. Many European
central banks need to lower their key interest rates before the
European single currency is launched next year. (EUROPE-RATE CUTS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Petroleum PLC announced Tuesday that its
quarterly profits fell 35 percent to 445 million pounds (dlrs 736
million), attributing the lower earnings to weak oil prices and
depressed market conditions. BP said its pretax profits for the
three months ending Sept. 30 compared with earnings of 691 million
pounds (dlrs 1.1 billion) in the same period a year earlier.
Revenues plunged 18.5 percent to 9.2 billion pounds (dlrs 15.2
billion), from 11.3 billion pounds (dlrs 18.6 billion). John
Browne, BP's chief executive officer, said the results reflected a
``difficult business environment.'' (BRITAIN-EARNS-BP)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's chief diamond producer and the South
African cartel De Beers on Tuesday extended an agreement for the
sale of Russian rough diamonds for three more years. The agreement,
effective through the end of 2001, allows Russia's Almazy
Rossii-Sakha (ARS) to sell De Beers at least dlrs 550 million worth
of rough diamonds each year. ARS supplies to the South African
cartel are expected to reach about dlrs 900 million this year, said
ARS president Vyacheslav Shtyrov. Under the agreement, Russia also
may sell 5 percent of its diamonds from current production and 20
percent of diamonds from state reserves on the open market.

	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Prince Charles got a honey of an
early birthday gift Tuesday _ a hive full of bees _ as he ended a
two-day visit to Slovenia.
	   The bad news: The bees themselves will have to be left behind, a
victim of British custom laws that prohibit their import.
	   The prince flew on to Romania after his stop in this former
Yugoslav republic, and later this week will visit Bulgaria and
Macedonia.
	   Recognizing his interest in beekeeping, Slovene President Milan
Kucan presented Charles with the hive to mark his upcoming 50th
birthday on Nov. 14. But only the hive will be allowed back into
Britain.
	   The son of Queen Elizabeth II was welcomed at the city council
of Ljubljana, where he met with Mayor Viktorija Potocnik.
	   Hundreds of onlookers waved and applauded the heir to the
British throne when he dropped in on shoppers at a mall and a
street market and chatted to a vendor behind a spice stall.
	   He also visited an elementary school to talk to some pupils.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Linda Evangelista agreed to renegotiate
her appearance fee at a fashion show after her performance was
criticized as clumsy.
	   Evangelista, 33, was the headline attraction Sunday in the city
of Oporto, but press reports Tuesday described her as overweight
and unsteady on her feet.
	   Manuel Serrao, spokesman for Portugal's National Association of
Young Businessmen, which organized the show, said Evangelista's
agent renegotiated her appearance fee. He wouldn't give details.
	   A spokeswoman for the Look Elite, the Lisbon branch of her
modeling agency, said Evangelista had food poisoning.
	   ``She was sick before she arrived. She was wrong to have come,''
said the spokeswoman, who wouldn't give her name.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A Norwegian whale hunter who says Keiko the
whale should be ground into hamburger was turned away Tuesday when
he tried to meet his enemy at a holding pen.
	   Steinar Bastesen, a member of Parliament, said the hubbub about
``Free Willy'' and returning the movie star whale to the wild
unfairly stacks public opinion against whale hunting.
	   ``He would have been more suited as hamburger on a plate,'' the
Norwegian news agency NTB quoted Bastesen as saying on Tuesday.
	   Bastesen, in town for a conference, tried to see Keiko at his
holidng pen but was turned away, NTB said.
	   Keiko's handlers hope to release him to his native waters off
Vestmann Islands after 19 years in captivity.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) _ John Glenn has so many offers to
write a book about his return to space that he's hired a literary
agent to field the calls.
	   ``He felt it would be best to hire a professional to deal with
these things,'' the senator's spokesman, Jack Sparks, said Tuesday.
	   Sparks said he didn't know whether Glenn would write a book
following his retirement from the Senate in January. Glenn's only
book is ``We Seven,'' a 1962 collaboration with the six other
Mercury astronauts.
	   His literary agent, Mort Janklow, was said to be in a meeting
Tuesday and unavailable for comment.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Hauled into court, Jean-Claude Van Damme
denied trying to keep a writer's name off the film credits of ``The
Quest.''
	   The 38-year-old Belgian action star testified Monday in a
lawsuit filed by Frank Dux, a martial arts expert who accuses Van
Damme of not paying dlrs 1.5 million in profits from the 1996
movie.
	   The lawsuit claims Dux co-wrote a screenplay that became ``The
Quest'' and that Van Damme promised to share profits. His name
appears next to Van Damme in screen credits as ``story by'' but not
as the writer.
	   ``If it were up to you, Mr. Dux's name wouldn't have appeared
within miles of `The Quest,' isn't that true?'' Dux's lawyer,
Steven Kramer, asked.
	   ``It's a lie,'' Van Damme said.
	   The actor left the court shortly after wrapping up his testimony
to return to work on another film.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Six decades after leaving her native
Estonia, Melissa Wells has returned as U.S. ambassador, presenting
her credentials to President Lennart Meri on Tuesday.
	   Wells was only 1-year-old when her mother, opera singer Miliza
Korjus, decided to leave Estonia in 1933 to pursue a career in
Western Europe. Korjus later became a Hollywood actress, noted for
her role in 1938's ``The Great Waltz.''
	   Wells, previously ambassador to Zaire, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau
and Cape Verde, said her family had left Estonia by ship and so she
insisted on returning by ship.
	   She arrived in Estonia on Friday, the first time she had been
back.
	   ``I thought of (my parents) as the city of Tallinn rose up on
the skyline,'' said Wells. ``I thought, 'Mummy and daddy, if you
could see me now!'''
	   As ambassador, Wells says she hopes to raise the profile of the
small country.
	   ``I want Estonia to be better known in the United States,'' she
said. ``I'd also like to focus on increasing investment between the
two countries.''

India's mythology-based serials losing out to soaps, horror

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ God once monopolized the small screen
across India. Today, his ratings are falling as viewers switch to
modern soaps and scary movies.
	   A decade ago, crowds of Indians who couldn't afford a TV would
gather every Sunday to peer through shop windows for a glimpse of
the Hindu god Ram battle demons in the series ``Ramayan.''
	   These days, a network serial on the Hindu god Krishna can't
break into the top 40 shows in Bombay and doesn't do much better in
New Delhi.
	   The top slots in both Delhi and Bombay are reserved for soap
operas on today's life and horror shows offered by satellite and
cable operators, says Indian Market Research Bureau, which compiles
ratings.
	   Ramanand Sagar created both the hit ``Ramayan'' and the
not-so-successful ``Sri Krishna'' for the state-owned broadcaster
Doordarshan.
	   The message conveyed in both is central to the Hindu faith in
karma _ that one does one's duty and leaves the rest to god. And
Sagar used the same formula: extensive research and emphasis on
music and hymns.
	   What's changed is the choice available to Indian viewers.
	   Bombay's shantytowns may not have regular water supply, but
television cables are strung among the shacks built of sheets of
tin and jute.
	   When ``Ramayan'' was on the air, cable and satellite reached
only 28 percent of Bombay. Today, 60 percent of India's largest
city has access to an international fare of slick soaps about
family strife and angst-ridden couples coping with extramarital
affairs.
	   Computer graphics add to the punch of the cable shows. On staid
Doordarshan, the snow-covered peaks on which the gods meditate
could be mistaken for mounds of chalk.
	   ``Mythology has bombed on satellite,'' said Yogesh
Radhakrishnan, president of INTV, Bombay's most popular cable
network. ``There are so many options for the viewer, unless the
product is very good, you can't have the `Ramayan' sort of mass
hysteria.''
	   Cable has not yet penetrated into the Indian countryside, so
religion-based shows like Sagar's still do well there.
	   Sagar is convinced the rural audience for myth will remain
strong. ``The scriptures are alive at the village level. They will
always be well-received by the masses,'' he said.
	   Sagar is 80, but his eyes gleam with youthful energy when he
tells of his plans for another serial, this one based on the
goddess Durga.
	   He produced 25 feature films before switching to television with
``Ramayan.'' He wanted people to be aware of the power of the Hindu
scripture he once found time to read to his children between
selling soap by day and studying Sanskrit and Persian by night.
	   ``We wanted the Ramayan and Gita to be understood by even a
cobbler. That was my concept,'' he said.
	   His success sparked imitators, though Sagar scoffs at
competitors sloppy enough to costume their actors in Greek-style
robes.
	   In an office dominated by statues of Hindu gods and photos of
actors who were worshipped for the roles they played, Sagar points
out that advertisers still flock to the two-year-old ``Sri
Krishna'' series.
	   Despite lower ratings in the cities, the nationwide reach of
Doordarshan ensures an audience of hundreds of millions.
	   ``It is not so much the mythology genre that is attracting ads
anymore, it is the mass base,'' said Tarun Katiyal, media
consultant with Ogilvy and Mather. ``We may advertise top-end
products on satellite and mass-based ones on Doordarshan because of
it's tremendous reach.''
	   Visions of gods moving mountains or parting the sea, helping the
blind see or the crippled walk still enthrall the faithful outside
the big cities.
	   ``I like the fights and the bows and arrows. I like to see how
strong God is and how he can carry mountains. He's also so kind to
people,'' Shray Badam, a 7-year-old in the southern town of
Hyderabad, said in a telephone interview.
	   Not so with urban viewers.
	   Asked if he still watched religion serials, Shashank Karnik of
Bombay responded: ``Are mythologies still being shown? Really? On
which channel?''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Dov Levin, a white-haired history professor,
eagerly pointed to a dark leather ammunition belt he wrestled from
a British soldier and then wore as a scout in Israel's fledgling
army in the 1948 Mideast war.
	   Levin was among thousands of Holocaust survivors who made up
half of the Israeli fighting forces in the struggle for
independence in the later stages of the war.
	   A new exhibit at Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial
documents the experiences of those who found themselves transported
from the death camps and hiding places of eastern Europe to yet
another battlefield.
	   ``We didn't go with enthusiasm, but there was a war going on,''
said Litman Mor, 81, a retired chemist from Tel Aviv.
	   The exhibit displays fading film reels of their arrival in
Israel, black and white photographs showing the rigors of basic
training, snatches of diaries, sketches, weaponry and old Hebrew
notebooks.
	   The artifacts recently brought a group of some 150 Holocaust
survivors, mostly from Israel, back to a time when the past was
still a fresh nightmare and the future was anything but certain.
	   Levin, 73, paused and briefly fell silent in front of a small
glass case holding the journal he kept during the 1948 war.
	   On a page dated from October 1948 and following several lines
describing the fighting, the young Levin had written in bold block
letters that it had been six years since his parents and twin
sister were killed by the Nazis.
	   Wearing a fishing hat, with reading glasses hung around his
neck, Levin greeted Mor warmly and the two former soldiers
exchanged stories animatedly.
	   Both fled the eastern European ghettos and made their way deep
into the forests where they fought alongside partisans against Nazi
Germany during World War II.
	   After the war, they came to Israel, which absorbed about a half
million survivors who arrived as refugees from Europe.
	   Yurek Plonsky, 72, who fought in the Warsaw ghetto uprising
against the Germans and then settled at Kibbutz Megiddo in northern
Israel, gazed at the memorabilia around him and spoke sharply as
his deep blue eyes flashed with emotion.
	   ``These are not just memories; this was life. Without the
survivors, the country would not be here today. We paid with our
lives. We paid with our sons' lives,'' he said.
	   Plonsky's son was killed in the 1973 Mideast war.
	   He said his motivation to fight in 1948 came from losing 100
relatives in the Nazi genocide.
	   ``Here you now had a chance to have your own plot of land, with
your own gun to protect you without being called `dirty Jew',''
Plonsky said.

Gucci ex-wife: she wanted more of the good life, got prison

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Her handsome, ex-fashion scion husband left
her for a wealthy woman. The dlrs 860,000 yearly alimony didn't
ease her humiliation at being barred from the St. Moritz chalet.
	   Maurizio Gucci's ex-wife hated him so much she wanted him dead.
He was shot, four times, the last blast into his head as he lay on
the ground after giving one last, bewildered look at the horrified
doorman at his downtown office on March 27, 1995.
	   Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli swore she didn't order her
46-year-old ex-husband's murder. But after a six-month trial, a
court here Tuesday convicted her and her four co-defendants of
premeditated murder and sentenced her to 29 years in prison.
	   Prosecutors had asked the court for Italy's stiffest punishment,
life imprisonment, for all five defendants. Only one defendant,
Benedetto Ceraulo, an auto mechanic who denied prosecutors'
assertions he was the triggerman, received a life term.
	   In her final plea to the court before the jury began seven hours
of deliberation, Reggiani Martinelli, 49, insisted yet again that
she was framed by her best friend described by some as a
sought-after psychic in the Milan social set.
	   The ex-friend, Giuseppina Auriemma, confessed to arranging the
murder and was sentenced to 25 years in jail.
	   Prosecutors said Reggiani Martinelli paid the co-defendants dlrs
375,000 to eliminate her former, yacht-going spouse. She claimed
she was forced to pay the money as blackmail to Auriemma and his
partners in crime to stop them from pinning the murder on her, a
ripe target, considering her public venom for Gucci.
	   Defense lawyers had argued that Reggiani Martinelli's judgment
was impaired after she suffered a benign brain tumor.
	   Gucci's former wife was particularly galled when he refused to
let her convalesce in the Swiss ski chalet after brain surgery.
	   Orazio Cicala, a pizzeria owner drowning in gambling debts who
confessed to driving the getaway car was sentenced to 29 years.
Ivano Savioni, the doorman of a rundown hotel in Milan's red-light
district who said he served as a go-between, got 26 years.
	   Gucci was the last of his family to hold a stake in the company
that makes loafers, handbags and other accessories with the
prestigious double-G logo. In 1993, Gucci sold the last family
stake in the company in 1993 for dlrs 120 million after a long
history of family discord and went on to live the good life,
including outings on a 70-meter (215-foot) yacht with his
companion.
	   Prosecutors alleged that Reggiani Martinelli was obsessed with
the idea that the girlfriend would spend all of Gucci's money,
leaving nothing for her two daughters with Gucci.
	   Defense lawyers said they were considering appeals.
	   ``Truth is the child of time,'' was the only immediate comment
by Gucci's ex-wife, recounted her attorney, Giovanni Maria Dedola.

Britain's highest court to decide on Pinochet arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Lords hearing scheduled to start 1030 GMT &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With moves under way in seven European countries
to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Britain's highest court will
decide whether to quash his arrest at a London hospital and send
the former Chilean dictator straight home.
	   Five judges, sitting round a horseshoe shaped table in a
committee room at the House of Lords, will start hearing an appeal
by British prosecutors on Wednesday against a High Court ruling
last week that Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish warrant was
illegal.
	   To the dismay of victims, the High Court said that Pinochet, as
a foreign former head of state, has immunity from prosecution for
acts committed during his 17-year rule. The present Chilean
government says some 3,000 political opponents were killed or
disappeared.
	   The hearing on whether the 82-year-old general should be
extradited to face charges of murder, torture and kidnapping was
scheduled to last two days.
	   The judges, headed by Lord Justice Gordon Slynn of Hadley, were
not expected to rule immediately after the hearing Thursday.
	   Legal experts say the warrant _ issued by a Spanish magistrate
investigating human rights abuses after Pinochet seized power in
1973 _ and other extradition moves will become irrelevant if the
Lords also throw out the arrest.
	   However, Pinochet could fly home _ a special medically equipped
jet is waiting at an air base north of London _ to more trouble.
	   In Chile on Tuesday a coalition of center-left parties that
support President Eduardo Frei appointed a legal panel to examine
the possibility of Pinochet standing trial in his native land. As a
senator-for-life and under laws he initiated, Pinochet has so far
had immunity from prosecution in Chile.
	   France and Switzerland also want to extradite Pinochet, and
Chilean exiles in Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Germany have filed
criminal complaints they hope will lead to extradition.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, was arrested while
recuperating from back surgery at a central London hospital. A
British judge granted him bail Oct. 30 and he was moved to another
hospital, Grovelands Priory in north London, but remains under
police guard.
	   At a meeting at the House of Commons on Tuesday, victims of the
secret police that operated during Pinochet's rule described
brutality they said was beyond immunity.
	   The son of Orlando Letelier, Allende's foreign minister killed
in a 1976 car-bombing in Washington, said the assassins were sent
to the United States by Pinochet's secret police.
	   ``My father's legs were severed and he bled to death with the
bottom of his body against the floor,'' said Juan Pablo Letelier.
``No immunity clause can permit that this be left in limbo. ...
Nothing authorizes a head of state to commit international state
terrorism of any sort,'' he added.
	   Letelier, now a left-wing congressman, is among a delegation of
Chilean lawmakers and human rights activists who have come to
London hoping to convince the Lords to uphold the arrest.

Ethnic Albanian leader sees destruction first-hand

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian leader,
venturing into the ravaged countryside for the first time in nine
years, found clear evidence that his people are coming back to
their battered villages, but said more needs to be done to ensure
their safety.
	   ``We saw huge destruction, but we met many people who have begun
returning,'' Ibrahim Rugova said afterward. ``It's a beginning of
the process to return. But for a more massive return, more safety
is needed.''
	   Rugova saw charred and roofless homes during a tour of central
Kosovo on Tuesday. He accompanied U.S. envoy Christopher Hill, who
is trying to persuade the ethnic Albanians to give up their dream
of Kosovo's independence from Serbia and settle for some form of
self-rule.
	   As the head of the ethnic Albanians' outlawed government in
Kosovo, Rugova has remained almost exclusively in the capital
Pristina since Serbia stripped the province's autonomy in 1989 and
installed a huge police presence.
	   But with no fighting in Kosovo for weeks and many Serb forces
withdrawn under an Oct. 12 peace agreement, he visited villages
that were on the front line of fighting between Serb forces and
ethnic Albanian guerrillas last month.
	   Sporadic violence by both sides continues, along with
intimidation by Serb police intended to prevent ethnic Albanians
from returning home in some areas.
	   ``We have to give them a deeper sense of security as there is
still fear for some people to get back home,'' Rugova said.
	   Hill, who is trying to set up negotiations between Albanians and
Serbs on a political agreement to set up a three-year interim
period of self-rule, said a settlement is needed to generate more
confidence and stability.
	   ``It's frankly shocking to see the amount of damage that has
been done _ house after house without roofs, many burned-out homes
and many crops that weren't harvested this year,'' he said.
	   Most ethnic Albanians want independence from Serbia, the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, while Serbs insist that Kosovo
remain part of Serbian territory.
	   While Yugoslavia maintains it has complied with Western demands
to reduce its forces in Kosovo to levels before the crackdown began
last February, the Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that more
special police and soldiers must go.
	   The guerrillas also warned that they are not prepared to
compromise their goal of outright independence.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The Cerro Negro volcano began erupting
Tuesday, just 20 miles (35 km) from where 2,000 people were killed
last week in a massive mudslide, the National Seismology Department
said.
	   The Cerro Negro volcano is near the Casitas volcano, where rains
from former Hurricane Mitch caused a crater lake to overflow and
send mud and debris down upon several communities.
	   Photographs taken at the scene showed massive lava flows
covering about one-fourth of the volcano's face. There were no
immediate reports of damage or casualties in nearby towns.

	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The Irish government pledged Tuesday that
it will donate 200,000 Irish pounds (dlrs 300,000) to help victims
battered by hurricane Mitch in Central America.
	   Mitch killed an estimated 7,000 people, wiped out whole villages
and left hundreds of bodies in rivers of mud. With flood waters
receding and communications improving, the greatest destruction was
being reported in Honduras, where an estimated 5,000 people died in
last week's storm.
	   Trocaire, an Irish aid agency, also announced Tuesday that it
would donate 200,000 Irish pounds (dlrs 300,000) for emergency
supplies to be sent to Honduras.
	   The European Union on Tuesday agreed to donate dlrs 7.7 million
to relief efforts in the region. And the United States was
considering ways to expand its dlrs 3.5 million emergency aid
package.

French make history; Fiorentina suspended by explosive device
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; adds details on Fiorentina disturbance &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Four French teams recorded a historic first
Tuesday, reaching the third round of the UEFA Cup. But that was
marred when another match _ Fiorentina vs. Grasshoppers _ was
suspended when an explosive device injured a game official.
	   Spain got four of its five clubs through to the final 16, the
only casualty coming as Liverpool drew 2-2 with Valencia, sending
through England's lone survivor on the away-goal rule.
	   Italy, which has won the UEFA Cup seven of the last 10 seasons
with Inter Milan winning last season, advanced three clubs.
	   The fourth, Fiorentina, was leading 2-1 over Swiss club
Grasshoppers after 45 minutes _ and set to go through after taking
the first leg two weeks ago 2-0 _ when an off-field official was
struck by an explosive device thrown from the stands.
	   The Belgian official Philippe Flament suffered a minor knee
injury and it was unclear if the match would be resumed Wednesday _
or under what conditions.
	   The game was played in Salerno, near Naples, as a penalty
against Fiorentina for fan misbehavior during a 1997 Cup Winners
Cup match against Barcleona. The match was also raising funds for
the victims of recent floodings in southern Italy.
	   The explosion left a hole on the pitch and took place as players
and officials headed for the dressing room.
	   In the French sweep _ the first time France has qualified four
teams for the the UEFA Cup final 16 _ Lyon, Monaco, Marseille and
Bordeaux all advanced. Spain has Atletico Madrid, Real Sociedad,
Real Betis and Celta in the third round.
	   The Italians advancing were 1995 champion Parma, Roma and
Bologna.
	   It was a bad night for Germany with losses by Stuttgart and
Werder Bremen. If Bayer Leverkusen is ousted in Thursday's match at
Rangers (Rangers lead 2-1), it will mark the first time since
1967-68 that no German side has made the UEFA third round.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux advanced 3-1 after a 2-1 win over
Vitesse Arnhem. Silvain Wiltord got the winner in the 64th. Arnhem
took a 1-0 lead in the 8th minute on a header by Arco Jochemsen.
Two minutes later, Bordeaux midfielder Johan Micoud made it 1-1
from the edge of the area.
	   In Monte Carlo, Monaco, Monaco defeated Austria's Grazer AK 4-0
to advance 7-3 on aggregate. Monaco, last year's European Champions
Cup semifinalists, went ahead 1-0 in the 8th on Frank Gava's volley
and made it 2-0 10 minutes later on a header by Robert Spehar.
Senegal's Djibril Diawara and Gava got the final strikes.
	   In Lyon, France, Lyon beat Red Star Belgrade 3-2 to advance 5-3.
Alain Caveglia scored his first of two to give Lyon a 1-0 lead in
the 16th. Goran Bunjevcevic made it 1-1 in the 35th, but Christophe
Cocard and Caveglia scored late goals in the half to make it 3-1.
Perica Ognjenovic grabbed a goal in injury time.
	   In Marseille, France, Marseille beat Werder Bremen 3-2 and moved
on 4-3. Florian Maurice, Pierre Issa and Christophe Dugarry all
headed home to give the French the victory. The teams drew the
first leg 1-1.
	   In Valencia, Spain, the Spanish up their only loss as Patrik
Berger and Steve McManaman scored two goals in the final 10 minutes
as Liverpool drew 2-2, advancing the English on the away-goal rule.
McManaman scored in the 80th as Liverpool rallied to tie 1-1.
Berger got what turned out to be the deciding goal in the 86th for
a 2-1 lead. Valencia made it 2-2 of late free kick by Clauido
Lopez, a goal that was ruled an own-goal against Liverpool keeper
David James. Lopez also scored in the first half. McManaman, Paul
Ince and Amadeo Carboni of Valencia were given red cards for a
scuffle just before the final goal.
	   In Birmingham, England, Spain's Celta Vigo ousted English league
leader Aston Villa with a 3-1 win to advance 3-2. Celta took a 1-0
lead from Juan Sanchez in the 26th. Stan Collymore leveled in the
30th on a penalty, but Russian Alexander Mostovoi gave Celta a 2-1
lead in the 34th on a free kick, and Luboslav Penev stretched the
lead to 3-1 in the 48th.
	   In San Sebastian, Spain, Real Sociedad beat Dynamo Moscow 3-0 to
advance 6-2. Darko Kovacevic scored in the 56th _ his first of two
_ and Oscar de Paula made it 2-0 in the 70th. Kovacevic got his
second in the 75th.
	   In Seville, Spain, Real Betis trounced Willem II of the
Netherlands 3-0 to advance 4-1 for the team's first European win
under new coach Javier Clemente.
	   In Madrid, Atletico Madrid beat CSKA Sofia 1-0 to move through
5-2 with Juninho scoring on a 45th minute penalty kick.
	   In Parma, Italy, Parma moved on 3-2 after a 2-1 win over Wisla
Krakow. Italian midfielder Stefano Fiore scored in the 21st and
Bogdan Zajac's own-goal made it 2-0 in the 46th. Zajac also scored
the Pole's only goal in second-half injury time.
	   In Prague, Czech Republic, Italy's Bologna defeated Slavia
Prague 2-0 to advance 4-1. Giuseppe Signori scored in the 80th off
a pass from Amedeo Mangone and Massimo Cappioli got the other six
minutes later.
	   In Leeds, England, despite a man advantage for 45 minutes, Leeds
had to settle for a scoreless tie against Roma as the Italians
advanced 1-0.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, FC Brugge got through with a 3-2 victory
over VfB Stuttgart to advance 4-3. The game was tied 1-1 after
regulation time as Serb playmaker Alexander Ilic headed home the
winner in the 115th minute. Stuttgart mounted its unlikely comeback
when, trailing 1-0 in the second half, Pablo Thiam and Kristian
Djordevic of Stuttgart were sent off with their second yellow
cards.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Zurich won 4-2 over Glasgow's Celtic and
advanced 5-3 with all the goals coming in the second half.

Honus Wagner card still tops them all

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ An 85-year-old Honus Wagner baseball card went
for dlrs 222,500 at auction Tuesday, while the ball Mark McGwire
hit for his 50th home run earned a whopping dlrs 46,000 for the New
York Mets fan who caught it last August.
	   A collection of letters, pictures and other memorabilia of
baseball's darkest time _ the 1919 ``Black Sox Scandal'' _ was sold
by Christie's to various buyers for upwards of dlrs 70,000.
	   The collection belonged to ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson, the Chicago
White Sox outfielder who was banned from baseball for life, along
with seven teammates, for throwing the 1919 World Series to the
Cincinnati Reds.
	   The Honus Wagner card, with a portrait of the all-time great
Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop, is one of the rarest of all baseball
cards. An identical one was sold by Christie's in September of
1996, for dlrs 640,000 _ a record for any item of sports
memorabilia at auction.
	   Christie's said the latest one was acquired in 1913 by an Irish
immigrant living in Harlem, who passed it on to a nephew. It sold
for far less than the presale estimated value of dlrs 350,000-dlrs
450,000.
	   Christie's spokeswoman Jessica Salzman identified the purchaser
as Bill Mastro, a collector. The seller was not named.
	   Among the Shoeless Joe-related items sold were letters from
baseball's then-commissioner, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis,
rejecting Jackson's appeals for reinstatement.
	   Jackson died in 1951, still protesting his innocence. Other
baseball veterans, led by former Boston Red Sox slugger Ted
Williams, have recently called for rescinding of the ban so Jackson
can be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame at Cooperstown, New
York.
	   Jackson batted .375 with 12 hits and no errors in the Series,
and his .356 batting average over 13 years is third highest in
major league history.
	   A baseball signed by Wagner went to an anonymous buyer for dlrs
3,600. Christie's said a fan named Larry Shire bought the McGwire
ball, paying more than three times the presale estimated value of
dlrs 12,000-dlrs 15,000.
	   The ball was hit out of Shea Stadium in New York on Aug. 20 as
the St. Louis Cardinals slugger pursued a new season high. He
finished with 70, breaking Yankee Roger Maris' 1961 mark of 61
homers. Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs also passed Maris with 66.
	   Mets fan Mike Scelsi, who caught the McGwire homer in the left
field bleachers, asked that the buyer loan it to the Cooperstown
baseball museum at some future time.
	   Other items in the sale included a McGwire bat, acquired by an
anonymous buyer for dlrs 9,775; baseballs autographed by Babe Ruth,
Lou Gehrig, Marilyn Monroe and President John F. Kennedy; boxing
gloves; baseball and basketball uniforms, and an archive of Lou
Gehrig's papers, including correspondence between the Yankee great
and his doctor at the Mayo Clinic. Gehrig died in 1941 of the
debilitating illness that now bears his name.

Anwar trial enters third day

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As the trial of Malaysian
dissident Anwar Ibrahim enters its third day, prosecutors are
planning to offer testimony that proves the former deputy prime
minister used his influence to mask sexual misdeeds.
	   The former head of Malaysia's police intelligence unit had
testified Tuesday that his men had launched an investigation into
sexual misconduct by Anwar in 1992, one year before he was named
deputy prime minister and finance minister.
	   Mohamed Said Awang, the former chief of the Special Branch, was
the first of 52 prosecution witnesses expected to take the stand in
a case that is likely to have a significant bearing on Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-reign.
	   Mohamad told the court that Anwar asked police to tamper with
evidence showing he had committed adultery and sodomy.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated to
eliminate his challenge to Mahathir. The trial entered its third
day on Wednesday.
	   Anwar's corruption charges relate to his attempts to tamper with
the evidence that government investigators had collected about his
alleged acts of sodomy and adultery.
	   Defense lawyers are trying to establish that the corruption
charges against Anwar are invalid because the special law used to
prosecute him is under review. Lawyers said they planned to appeal
the ruling by the trial judge to dismiss that plea.
	   Despite the seriousness of the charges, thousands of Malaysians
have openly expressed solidarity for Anwar, participating in street
protests since he was arrested on Sept. 20.
	   Stern warnings by the police, tear gas and water cannons have
failed to crush the protests.
	   Mahathir said Anwar was morally unfit to run the Southeast Asian
nation and dumped him on Sept. 2.
	   The first four corruption charges will be heard before the trial
adjourns Nov. 14, as Malaysia hosts 20 world leaders in the capital
for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. When the trial
resumes, the fifth graft charge and the five sex charges will be
heard.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With moves under way in seven European countries
to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Britain's highest court will
decide whether to quash his arrest at a London hospital and send
the former Chilean dictator straight home.
	   Five judges, sitting round a horseshoe shaped table in a
committee room at the House of Lords, will start hearing an appeal
by British prosecutors on Wednesday against a High Court ruling
last week that Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish warrant was
illegal.
	   To the dismay of victims, the High Court said that Pinochet, as
a foreign former head of state, has immunity from prosecution for
acts committed during his 17-year rule. The present Chilean
government says some 3,000 political opponents were killed or
disappeared.
	   The hearing on whether the 82-year-old general should be
extradited to face charges of murder, torture and kidnapping was
scheduled to last two days.
	   The judges, headed by Lord Justice Gordon Slynn of Hadley, were
not expected to rule immediately after the hearing Thursday.
	   Legal experts say the warrant _ issued by a Spanish magistrate
investigating human rights abuses after Pinochet seized power in
1973 _ and other extradition moves will become irrelevant if the
Lords also throw out the arrest.
	   However, Pinochet could fly home _ a special medically equipped
jet is waiting at an air base north of London _ to more trouble.
	   In Chile on Tuesday a coalition of center-left parties that
support President Eduardo Frei appointed a legal panel to examine
the possibility of Pinochet standing trial in his native land. As a
senator-for-life and under laws he initiated, Pinochet has so far
had immunity from prosecution in Chile.
	   Chilean senators also said they will seek a constitutional
amendment allowing members of congress to resign their seats. The
constitution now bans lawmakers from quitting. The move appeared a
clear invitation to Pinochet to leave politics once he returns
home, as suggested by the government.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Shaking off criticism of her search for a
peaceful solution to the war in Congo, the top U.S. diplomat on
African affairs concentrated her efforts on Rwanda Wednesday saying
only a regional solution could end the fighting.
	   Susan Rice flew to Kigali late Tuesday after a two-hour meeting
with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, where she received a
frosty welcome. Upon arrivial in Rwanda, she publicly recognized
Rwanda's security concerns in Congo, saying any solution to the
three-month war must address border security.
	   ``We believe that it is essential that a peaceful solution be
found to the conflict, which respects the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Congo, addresses the border security
concerns with its neighbors, provides safeguard against further
ethnic violence and genocide, and shares the participation of all
Congolese in the political process and advances democracy
throughout the region,'' she said.
	   In Kigali, she plans to meet Wednesday with President Pasteur
Bizimingu and Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, vice president, minister of
defense and chief architect of Rwanda's policy in Congo.
	   The rebellion against Congolese President Laurent Kabila has
already embroiled troops from as many as eight countries, including
Rwanda, which accuses Kabila of anti-Tutsi persecution and failing
to rid the common border of Rwandan rebels.
	   The Congolese rebels requested to meet with Rice, but the
request was apparently turned down, U.S. diplomats said on
condition of anonymity.
	   Kabila and Mugabe have sharply criticized U.S. efforts to broker
a Congo peace agreement, arguing that Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
deployed troops to repel an invasion by rebels which are backed by
Rwandan and Ugandan troops.
	   Mugabe has described U.S. calls for the withdrawal of foreign
troops from Congo as ``absolutely abominable'' and demanded that
Rwanda and Uganda withdraw first, saying that would lead to the
collapse of the rebel campaign and bring peace.
	   Uganda acknowledges it has troops in Congo, but says they are in
Congo to strike at Ugandan rebels.
	   Rice's African trip has taken her to South Africa, Angola,
Congo, Zambia and Zimbabwe. She leaves Wednesday for Kampala,
Uganda, her final destination.
	   Rice is accompanied by U.S. President Bill Clinton's special
assistant, Gayle Smith, and his special envoy to the Great Lakes
region, Howard Wolpe.

Fiorentina match suspended by explosion; French make history
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS RECASTS lead, adds quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A reserve official was hospitalized when an
explosive device went off at halftime of the Fiorentina vs.
Grasshoppers UEFA Cup second-round, second-leg match, forcing a
suspension with Fiorentina leading 2-1.
	   The official, Belgian Philippe Flament, suffered a minor knee
injury and picked up bruises as the explosive device left a hole in
the pitch and deafened players and fans.
	   Fiorentina, almost certain to advance, had won the first leg
2-0. It was unclear if the match would be resumed Wedensday behind
closed doors or if Fiorentina would be forced to forfeit.
	   The Tuesday game was played in Salerno, near Naples, as a
penalty against Fiorentina for fan misbehavior during a 1997 Cup
Winners Cup match against Barcleona. The match was also raising
funds for the victims of recent floodings in southern Italy.
	   ``He's in good condition after treatment,'' said Luciano Luna,
managing director of the Florentine club, of the official.
	   ``It's a mad action. It was not the work of our fans. It was a
premeditated attack against our players, who were walking near the
official ... we only hope we can replay the game,'' he said.
	   The incident took the spotlight away from France.
	   Four French teams made history, reaching the third round of the
UEFA Cup for the first time. Lyon, Monaco, Marseille and Bordeaux
all advanced in the sweep into the final 16.
	   Spain also advanced four _ Atletico Madrid, Real Sociedad, Real
Betis and Celta. The Italians advancing were 1995 champion Parma,
Roma and Bologna.
	   It was a bad night for Germany with losses by Stuttgart and
Werder Bremen. If Bayer Leverkusen is ousted in Thursday's match at
Rangers (Rangers lead 2-1), it will mark the first time since
1967-68 that no German side has made the UEFA third round.
	   In Bordeaux, France, Bordeaux advanced 3-1 after a 2-1 win over
Vitesse Arnhem. Silvain Wiltord got the winner in the 64th. Arnhem
took a 1-0 lead in the 8th minute on a header by Arco Jochemsen.
Two minutes later, Bordeaux midfielder Johan Micoud made it 1-1
from the edge of the area.
	   In Monte Carlo, Monaco, Monaco defeated Austria's Grazer AK 4-0
to advance 7-3 on aggregate. Monaco, last year's European Champions
Cup semifinalists, went ahead 1-0 in the 8th on Frank Gava's volley
and made it 2-0 10 minutes later on a header by Robert Spehar.
Senegal's Djibril Diawara and Gava got the final strikes.
	   In Lyon, France, Lyon beat Red Star Belgrade 3-2 to advance 5-3.
Alain Caveglia scored his first of two to give Lyon a 1-0 lead in
the 16th. Goran Bunjevcevic made it 1-1 in the 35th, but Christophe
Cocard and Caveglia scored late goals in the half to make it 3-1.
Perica Ognjenovic grabbed a goal in injury time.
	   In Marseille, France, Marseille beat Werder Bremen 3-2 and moved
on 4-3. Florian Maurice, Pierre Issa and Christophe Dugarry all
headed home to give the French the victory. The teams drew the
first leg 1-1.
	   In Valencia, Spain, the Spanish up their only loss as Patrik
Berger and Steve McManaman scored two goals in the final 10 minutes
as Liverpool drew 2-2, advancing the English on the away-goal rule.
McManaman scored in the 80th as Liverpool rallied to tie 1-1.
Berger got what turned out to be the deciding goal in the 86th for
a 2-1 lead. Valencia made it 2-2 of late free kick by Clauido
Lopez, a goal that was ruled an own-goal against Liverpool keeper
David James. Lopez also scored in the first half. McManaman, Paul
Ince and Amadeo Carboni of Valencia were given red cards for a
scuffle just before the final goal.
	   In Birmingham, England, Spain's Celta Vigo ousted English league
leader Aston Villa with a 3-1 win to advance 3-2. Celta took a 1-0
lead from Juan Sanchez in the 26th. Stan Collymore leveled in the
30th on a penalty, but Russian Alexander Mostovoi gave Celta a 2-1
lead in the 34th on a free kick, and Luboslav Penev stretched the
lead to 3-1 in the 48th.
	   In San Sebastian, Spain, Real Sociedad beat Dynamo Moscow 3-0 to
advance 6-2. Darko Kovacevic scored in the 56th _ his first of two
_ and Oscar de Paula made it 2-0 in the 70th. Kovacevic got his
second in the 75th.
	   In Seville, Spain, Real Betis trounced Willem II of the
Netherlands 3-0 to advance 4-1 for the team's first European win
under new coach Javier Clemente.
	   In Madrid, Atletico Madrid beat CSKA Sofia 1-0 to move through
5-2 with Juninho scoring on a 45th minute penalty kick.
	   In Parma, Italy, Parma moved on 3-2 after a 2-1 win over Wisla
Krakow. Italian midfielder Stefano Fiore scored in the 21st and
Bogdan Zajac's own-goal made it 2-0 in the 46th. Zajac also scored
the Pole's only goal in second-half injury time.
	   In Prague, Czech Republic, Italy's Bologna defeated Slavia
Prague 2-0 to advance 4-1. Giuseppe Signori scored in the 80th off
a pass from Amedeo Mangone and Massimo Cappioli got the other six
minutes later.
	   In Leeds, England, despite a man advantage for 45 minutes, Leeds
had to settle for a scoreless tie against Roma as the Italians
advanced 1-0.
	   In Brugge, Belgium, FC Brugge got through with a 3-2 victory
over VfB Stuttgart to advance 4-3. The game was tied 1-1 after
regulation time as Serb playmaker Alexander Ilic headed home the
winner in the 115th minute. Stuttgart mounted its unlikely comeback
when, trailing 1-0 in the second half, Pablo Thiam and Kristian
Djordevic of Stuttgart were sent off with their second yellow
cards.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Zurich won 4-2 over Glasgow's Celtic and
advanced 5-3 with all the goals coming in the second half.

Security Council divided on response if Iraq refuses to lift ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with comment from British ambassador
at end of Security Council meeting &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ While the U.N. Security Council stands
united in demanding that Iraq reverse its decision to cut dealings
with U.N. weapons inspectors, it remains divided on what to do if
Baghdad refuses.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened to use force if
necessary, but China has called for dialogue and restraint _ and
Russia, which is traditionally sympathetic to Iraq, has indicated
it wants a peaceful solution.
	   France recalled its representative in Baghdad for consultations
Tuesday and warned Iraq that it faced ``total isolation'' if it
didn't resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors. But
diplomats said that France's irritation at the Iraqis did not mean
it would support using force against them.
	   The 15-member Security Council started discussions Tuesday
afternoon on a draft resolution submitted by Britain condemning
Iraq's decision and demanding that Baghdad rescind it ``immediately
and unconditionally.''
	   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said the council ``made
good progress'' during several hours of debate. ``We're moving
forward with a short, clear resolution. Obviously it will need
further discussion,'' he said.
	   The draft resolution makes no mention of the threat of force.
And it does not declare that Iraq is in material breach of U.N.
resolutions _ language that could give the United States and its
allies the green light for military action.
	   The proposed resolution does state that ``the situation in Iraq
continues to pose a threat to international peace and security.''
But that language _ tough by U.N. standards _ will probably be
dropped because Russia's Deputy Ambassador Yuriy Fedotov said
before the council meeting began that he doubts the Iraqi action
represented a threat to peace and security.
	   So the resolution, which diplomats don't expect to be finalized
until later in the week, is likely to be similar to the press
statement which the council issued Saturday, hours after the Iraqis
halted the work of the U.N. Special Commission charged with
eliminating the country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Echoing the press statement, the proposed resolution accuses
Baghdad of ``a flagrant violation'' of council resolutions. Unlike
the statement issued Saturday, a Security Council resolution once
adopted is legally binding.
	   The divisions among the five permanent members of the Security
Council _ who have the right to veto any resolution _ were
reflected in their statements responding to Iraq's surprise
announcement on Saturday.
	   When the Iraqis refused to let inspectors enter Saddam Hussein's
palaces and other sensitive sites early this year, the United
States and Britain threatened air strikes and sent troops and
aircraft to the region.
	   President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
suggested this week that military force was again an option, but
both countries want to give diplomacy a chance to work first.
	   ``It's going to be a slow burn ... There are many steps here
before we get to any possibility of force,'' a Western diplomat
said.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned Iraq's decision, saying
it blocked prospects for lifting crippling economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Moscow urged Iraq to
comply with U.N. resolutions calling for the dismantling of the
country's weapons of mass destruction _ a requirement for sanctions
to be lifted.
	   Russia, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq, is
generally sympathetic to the Arab nation and has called previously
for an early lifting of sanctions. Reflecting this sympathy, a
Russian parliamentary delegation visiting Baghdad this week for
talks with Saddam called on Moscow to stop abiding by U.N.
sanctions against Iraq, news reports said.
	   Treading a cautious path, China on Tuesday urged Iraq to end its
latest standoff and resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao asked all sides
to exercise restraint, saying dialogue, not confrontation, would be
``conducive to the early conclusion of arms inspection in Iraq.''

Volcano near mudslide disaster erupts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with time of eruption, no apparent
communities in path of lava flow. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ The Cerro Negro volcano began erupting
Tuesday, just 20 miles (35 km) from where 2,000 people were killed
last week in a massive mudslide, the National Seismology Department
said.
	   The Cerro Negro volcano is near the Casitas volcano, where rains
from former Hurricane Mitch caused a crater lake to overflow,
sending mud and rock hurtling on to villages below.
	   Photographs showed lava flows and ash covering about one-fourth
of Cerro Negro's northern face soon after the eruption began about
4 p.m. (2200 GMT).
	   The flows appeared to have reached the base of the volcano and a
plume of vapor rose from the crater.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties. There
are villages on the peak's southern face but apparently none on its
northern side. The largest town of any size, Malpaisillo, is 12
kilometers (7 1/2 miles) away.
	   The 1,000-meter (3,300-foot) volcano last erupted in November
1995, showering volcanic ash on communities as far away as Leon, 90
kilometers (56 miles) to the west. Cerro Negro is one of
Nicaragua's youngest and most active volcanos.
	   The eruption was discovered by experts from Nicaragua's
Institute of Earth Studies, as they traveled by helicopter to
investigate the mudslide at the Casitas volcano, which is believed
to be inactive.

executive of media company News Ltd., will marry Australian model
Sarah O'Hare, his girlfriend of nine months, News Ltd. papers
reported Wednesday.
	   Murdoch, the 27-year-old son of global tycoon Rupert Murdoch,

reported.
	   The couple plan to marry early next year in Australia.

the betrothal will surprise anyone who knows the couple well.
	   O'Hare, one of the world's top models and the spokesperson for
the Wonderbra, is based in the United States, where The Daily
Telegraph says she's likely to stay for the time being.
	   News Ltd. is the Australian arm of Rupert Murdoch's global media

Captains pick Presidents Cup teams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Fred Couples and John Huston have
been picked by captain Jack Nicklaus to fill out the United States
team for the Presidents Cup golf tournament against an
international selection in December.
	   International team captain Peter Thomson went for New Zealanders
Frank Nobilo and Greg Turner as his two selections after 10 others
qualified directly.
	   The selections were announced a telephone hook-up at Melbourne's
Crown Casino on Wednesday. The Ryder Cup-style tournament is being
held outside the US for the first time and will be played at Royal
Melbourne from Dec. 11-13.
	   Thomson said he had chosen Nobilo, who was two places outside
the international top 10 for his ``maturity and his record in this
event.''
	   ``Once he was chosen it was my decision to put Turner with
him,'' Thomson said. ``They are close friends and have played
together in these sort of events many times before.''
	   Teams:
	   International: Ernie Els (South Africa), Nick Price (Zimbabwe),
Vijay Singh (Fiji), Greg Norman (Australia), Steve Elkington
(Australia), Stuart Appleby (Australia), Carlos Franco (Paraguay),
Shigeki Maruyama (Japan), Craig Parry (Australia), Joe Ozaki
(Japan). Captain's choices: Frank Nobilo (New Zealand), Greg Turner
(New Zealand). Non-playing captain: Peter Thomson (Australia).
	   United States: David Duval, Tiger Woods, Jim Furyk, Justin
Leonard, Phil Mickelson, Davis Love, Mark O'Meara, Hal Sutton,
Scott Hoch, Mark Calcavecchia. Captain's choices: Fred Couples,
John Huston. Non-playing captain: Jack Nicklaus.

Japanese stocks rise in early trading, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rose in early trading
Wednesday after a widely-respected U.S. strategist increased his
Japan investment weighting. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 394.84
points, or 2.83 percent, to 14,347.59 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Monday, the average closed up 388.24 points,
or 2.86 percent.
	   The dollar bought 115.34 yen in early trading, down 0.36 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo but marginally higher than its late New
York level of 115.33 yen overnight.
	   Financial markets in Japan were closed Tuesday for a national
holiday.
	   On Wednesday, share prices started higher after Morgan Stanley's
global strategist Barton Biggs raised his Japan weighting to 75
percent of the company's capital international index from the
previous 40 percent, traders said.
	   ``Everyone believes Japan is beyond redemption, but the Japanese
market is truly cheap and Japan is at exactly the opposite end of
the economic, market and sentiment cycle as the U.S.,'' Biggs said.
	   Last month, the Japanese government implemented a set of bank
bailout plans designed to stabilize the nation's banking system.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar changed little
against the yen from its late New York level Tuesday as the
greenback rose against major world currencies after Spain, Portugal
and Sweden cut key interest rates by a quarter point.
	   The dollar benefited as lower interest rates tend to make a
nation's currency less attractive to investors.
	   The dollar was also boosted on overnight firmness in U.S.
stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,706.15 points
on Tuesday, unchanged from the previous day's close.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.830 percent from Monday's finish of 0.825 percent,
driving its price down to 108.63 yen from 108.68 yen.

	   The United States and Britain have threatened to use force, but
China and Russia have called for a peaceful solution.
	   France recalled its representative in Baghdad for consultations
Tuesday and warned Iraq it faced ``total isolation'' if it didn't
resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors. But diplomats said
that France's irritation at the Iraqis did not mean it would
support military action.
	   The 15-member Security Council started discussions Tuesday
afternoon on a resolution condemning Iraq's decision and demanding
that Baghdad rescind it.
	   Britain's U.N. ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, said the council
``made good progress'' during several hours of debate. ``We're
moving forward with a short, clear resolution. Obviously it will
need further discussion,'' he said.
	   The draft makes no mention of the threat of force. And it does
not declare that Iraq is in violation of U.N. resolutions _
language that could give the United States and its allies the green
light for military action.
	   The proposed resolution does state that ``the situation in Iraq
continues to pose a threat to international peace and security.''
But that language _ tough by U.N. standards _ will probably be
dropped because Russia's Deputy Ambassador Yuriy Fedotov said
before the council meeting began that he doubts the Iraqi action
really represented such a threat.
	   The proposed resolution accuses Baghdad of ``a flagrant
violation'' of council resolutions.
	   The divisions among the five permanent members of the Security
Council _ who have the right to veto any resolution _ were
reflected in their statements responding to Iraq's surprise
announcement on Saturday, halting the work of the U.N. Special
Commission charged with eliminating the country's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   When the Iraqis refused to let inspectors enter Saddam Hussein's
palaces and other sensitive sites early this year, the United
States and Britain threatened air strikes and sent troops and
aircraft to the region.
	   President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
suggested this week that military force was again an option, but
both countries want to give diplomacy a chance to work first.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry condemned Iraq's decision, saying
it blocked prospects for lifting crippling economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Moscow urged Iraq to
comply with U.N. resolutions calling for the dismantling of the
country's weapons of mass destruction _ a requirement for sanctions
to be lifted.
	   Russia, which is owed billions of dollars by Iraq, is generally
sympathetic to the Arab nation and has called previously for an
early lifting of sanctions.
	   ``I continue to believe a political solution has not been
exhausted, and moreover, I'm sure that no military solution is
possible,'' Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Tuesday.
	   Treading cautiously, China on Tuesday urged Iraq to end its
latest standoff and resume cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao asked all sides
to exercise restraint, saying dialogue, not confrontation, would be
``conducive to the early conclusion of arms inspection in Iraq.''

Nicklaus sticks with next two guys _ Couples, Huston
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ When it comes to the Presidents Cup,
making the top 12 in the standings is as good as making the team.
	   Jack Nicklaus used his two captain's picks Tuesday night on Fred
Couples and John Huston, the third straight time a U.S. captain has
taken the 11th and 12th players on the points list.
	   Peter Thomson, the five-time British Open champion and captain
of the International team, used his picks on Frank Nobilo and Greg
Turner, both from New Zealand. The matches will be played Dec.
11-13 at Royal Melbourne Golf Club in Australia.
	   Nicklaus had hinted strongly that he would be hard pressed to
take someone other than the next two players in line _ even if that
someone was U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen.
	   ``I said earlier I'd probably pick the 11th and 12th players on
the list unless something unusual happened, and I don't think
anything unusual happened except that Hal Sutton won the Tour
Championship and played his way onto the team,'' Nicklaus said.
	   ``I would have liked to have had our U.S. Open champion, but I
didn't think it would be fair to pick somebody ahead of Lee when
Lee didn't make the top 12.''
	   The U.S. standings were based on money earned the past two
years, with the dollar doubled in 1998. The International team _
every country except Europe _ was determined by the world rankings.
	   Couples, who won twice this year, was 10th going into the Tour
Championship but was knocked out of an automatic berth when Sutton
won the dlrs 720,000 first prize. Couples has a 6-1-0 record in two
Presidents Cups and has played on every Ryder or Presidents Cup
team since 1989.
	   Huston had to use a one-time exemption for being in the top 50
in career money to stay on tour this year. He made the most of it
by setting the PGA scoring record in Hawaii with a 28-under 260,
then won the Disney Classic two weeks ago. He closed with a 68 on
Sunday in the Tour Championship to tie for 11th.
	   Huston finished dlrs 25,799 ahead of Janzen, who is developing a
stigma as ``Mr. Hard Luck'' when it comes to national teams.
	   Lanny Wadkins overlooked Janzen in favor of Curtis Strange for
the 1995 Ryder Cup team. Two years ago, Janzen also finished 13th
in Presidents Cup standings, and captain Arnold Palmer took the
players at 11 and 12 _ David Duval and Kenny Perry.
	   This time, Janzen had only himself to blame. After winning the
Open at The Olympic Club and tying for third a week later in the
Western Open, he never finished higher than a tie for 24th the rest
of the year.
	   ``I knew Lee hadn't been playing particularly well,'' Nicklaus
said. ``I still would have liked to have had Lee on the team. He's
a great competitor. But he didn't play well enough to do it.''
	   What probably hurt Janzen the most was a television viewer who
called in to report a possible rules violation during the World
Series. Janzen had a birdie putt hang on the lip in the first
round, waited for what was later timed at 20 seconds before
watching the ball drop.
	   The rule says a player must tap in after 10 seconds when the
ball is overhanging part of the cup. Janzen was disqualified and
given last-place money _ dlrs 18,475 _ but it didn't count as
official money.
	   Nicklaus also considered Tom Lehman, who has played on every
national team since 1994. Lehman hurt his shoulder in the British
Open and had to miss nearly two months on tour while he recovered.
Still, Nicklaus couldn't find a reason to leave Couples or Huston
off the team.
	   ``If I had somebody in the 11th position who was not playing
well at all, then I might not select them,'' Nicklaus said. ``Both
Fred and John have had good years, and that made the selection a
lot easier.''
	   That wasn't the case for Thomson, although the International
players don't always play the same events _ or on the same tours _
week after week, making it difficult to compare.
	   Jumbo Ozaki, fourth on the International list, said he would not
play in the matches and was replaced by his brother Joe, who was
11th.
	   Thomson then bypassed Frankie Minoza of the Philippines in favor
of Frank Nobilo. He then went down two more notches to take Turner,
looking for two players who might be compatiable in alternate-shot
and best-ball matches.
	   Nobilo has played in the last two matches and has a 3-6-1
record. The United States has won both times.
	   ``In the end, I chose Nobilo for his maturity and his record in
the cup, and the fact he's keen and eager to be in it,'' Thomson
said. ``Once he was chosen, then it was my decision to put Turner
with him over all the others that were in contention.''

	   LA CEIBA, Honduras (AP) _ The ghastly toll of Hurricane Mitch _
now estimated at more than 7,000 _ grew still further on Tuesday,
counted in bodies drifting down rivers, in corpses rotting in
drying mudslides, in hundreds of thousands left homeless.
	   The portents of natural disaster seemed endless as a volcano in
Nicaragua began erupting near the Casitas peak where massive
mudslides killed as many as 1,950 people Friday, and Mitch
re-formed as a weak tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on
Tuesday.
	   Floods and mudslides caused by Mitch were blamed for deaths
across a broad, 500-mile (800-kilometer) corridor from Nicaragua
into southern Mexico, from the hurricane-scoured Bay Islands off
Honduras' Atlantic Coast to the Pacific.
	   Mitch was forecast to move toward Florida later this week,
though the storm's 45 mph (72 kph) winds were a shadow of the 180
mph (290 kph) monster of last week and it was expected to weaken
further.
	   In northern Nicaragua, the Cerro Negro volcano began erupting
Tuesday, just 22 miles (35 kms) from the Casitas volcano, whose
slopes sent a stream of mud crashing into villages Friday.
	   Lava flowed down the Cerro Negro's 1,000-meter (nearly
3,300-foot) northern face, into an apparently unpopulated area.
	   As the sun broke out over Central America after a week of
storms, many cities and settlements found themselves virtual
islands, isolated by destroyed bridges or washed-out roads.
	   Survivors waved frantically to helicopters passing over villages
surrounded by flood waters in Honduras' eastern La Mosquitia region
Tuesday. A U.S. military aid team from Honduras' Palmerola airbase
plans to drop army-issue dehydrated rations to such communities
starting Wednesday.
	   Honduras' Communications Minister Tomas Lozano said Tuesday that
at least 5,000 people had died, 11,000 were missing and 1 million
had to flee their homes in this nation of 6 million.
	   He said the numbers would rise as officials heard from remote
areas. But officials also feared that hunger and disease would
start taking their toll, as relief teams struggled to get to
communities cut off from the outside world.
	   ``We have food. The problem is the areas that are only reachable
by helicopter, and we don't have enough of them,'' said Lt. Col.
Jose Barahona, Honduras' emergency aid chief for the Colon
province, where 11,000 to 12,000 people are cut off.
	   And there were scenes from hell:
	   Reporters on Tuesday found battered human bodies half-buried in
mud below Nicaragua's Casitas volcano, where a crater lake
collapsed on Friday. They bodies were rotting because villagers had
no gasoline to burn them.
	   ``It is full, full of bodies,'' Ariel Mendoza, a 26-year-old
construction worker said, pointing at the volcano. ``From where the
mud starts, down to the sea.''
	   Officials gave conflicting but appalling death tolls: The
Nicaraguan president's office said 1,338. Felicita Zeledon, mayor
of Posoltega, said 1,950. The Red Cross said 1,250.
	   Nicaragua reported 500 people killed elsewhere in the country.
	   In El Salvador, 222 people were reported killed and 50,000 were
homeless. Guatemala reported 157 storm-related deaths.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami reported that Mitch
had re-formed into a small tropical storm centered about 55 miles
(90 kph) west-southwest of Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico.
	   It was moving toward the east-northeast near 6 mph (9 kph) and
was expected to move inland over the Yucatan coast with heavy rains
before weakening. Long-term forecasts had the storm reaching
southern Florida as a tropical depression later this week.
	   But with Mitch, once one of the strongest hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean, the unexpected has become the rule.
	   ``It's not a favorable environment for a tropical storm to
regenerate ... but this one has defied model predictions and
survived after passing over significant land masses,'' said Richard
Pasch, a meteorologist at the Hurricane Center.
	   In the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, hundreds of people crowded
morgues and hospitals seeking missing relatives.
	   In the parking lot of the flooded-out municipal morgue,
relatives claimed the body of a man shot to death during an
attempted prison break during the height of the storm last week.
Eighteen more bodies wrapped in black plastic bags lay on the floor
of a refrigerated trailer truck which now serves as a morgue.
	   Oscar Triminio, spokesman for the Tegucigalpa fire department,
said more than 30 bodies had been pulled from the Choluteca River
since Monday.
	   Lozano said that many people remain trapped on rooftops by
floodwaters eight days after Mitch hit the Atlantic coast.
	   ``Mitch destroyed almost all the highways, 70 bridges and
destroyed 70 percent of national agriculture,'' Lozano said.
	   U.S. military helicopters on Tuesday ferried Honduran officials
on inspection tours of the refineries and transportation routes.
	   ``If we don't get fuel into the city, it will be utter chaos,''
said Lt. Col. Ricardo Aguilar of the U.S. Air Force.
	   For days, residents of Tegucigalpa have trudged through the mud
left throughout the city by Mitch to form long lines in front of
bakeries, grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations. The water
supply had been cut since Monday due to contamination in the
system.
	   In Guatemala, struck by Mitch over the weekend, President Alvaro
Arzu reported Tuesday that 157 people had died, 100,000 homes were
damaged and 30 highways were blocked.
	   El Salvador's National Emergency Committee reported 225 deaths,
135 missing and 50,000 driven from their homes by the flooding.
	   In Mexico, floods just north of the Guatemalan border killed at
least five people Monday and forced the evacuation of hundreds
more.

Tyson set to fight again in Vegas; opponent uncertain
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Now that Mike Tyson has his boxing license
back, he's getting ready to fight again in Las Vegas. Who and when,
however, are still unclear.
	   Two London newspapers, The Sun and The Independent, and the New
York Daily News all reported Tuesday that the former heavyweight
champion would return to the ring Jan. 16 against Francois Botha of
South Africa. The bout would be promoted by America Presents.
	   The Independent said the fight would be held at the MGM Grand.
	   The News reported that Tyson, who has had money problems after
16 months away from boxing, had gotten a large cash advance.
	   But Shelly Finkel, Tyson's adviser, said no deal had been
finalized.
	   ``Our plan is for him to fight in January, (but) Mike has not
concluded a deal to fight anybody in January,'' Finkel said.
	   A spokesman for Frank Warren, Botha's adviser, would not confirm
the Tyson fight had been made, saying only that Warren's company
was ``advising'' Botha until January.
	   A source in Las Vegas also said that no deal had been signed and
that Vaughn Bean also was being considered as a possible opponent.
The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that Jan. 16
seemed a probable date and the MGM Grand was the probable site.
	   Another possible opponent could be Germany's Axel Schultz,
according to a spokeswoman for Showtime, the cable company that
will televise the fight. She added that the deal could be closed by
the end of the week.
	   Tyson, who was suspended after biting Evander Holyfield's ears
during their title fight, had his license restored last month by
the Nevada State Athletic Commission. He still faces a Dec. 1 trial
on misdemeanor assault charges stemming from a traffic accident
Aug. 31 at Gaithersburg, Maryland.
	   Botha has lost only once in 37 fights, stopped in the 12th round
by Michael Moorer in an IBF title challenge two years ago. He is
the No. 1 contender for Holyfield's IBF title.

Report: Japan considers removing secrecy surrounding executions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan may partially lift a veil of secrecy
surrounding its capital punishment practices by confirming when
executions have been carried out, the country's largest newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The Japanese Ministry of Justice has begun mulling a reversal of
its longstanding policy of refusing to confirm whether or not a
specific criminal on death row has been executed, the Yomiuri
newspaper said in a front page article.
	   But a spokesman for the ministry denied the report, saying no
decision has been made to reconsider its position on the issue.
	   The ministry says it does not respond to inquiries about
executions out of respect to the survivors of crimes and the
families of those put to death.
	   Citizen's groups which oppose the death penalty have criticized
this official secrecy, saying people have a right to know more
about the government's execution practices.
	   The Justice Ministry publishes an annual report which publicizes
only the total number of death sentences carried out during the
previous year.
	   The ministry said four people were executed last year. In June
this year, Japanese media cited unnamed sources as saying three
convicted murderers were hanged earlier that month.
	   Prisoners on Japan's death row are believed to be held in
solitary confinement for years, then told of their impending
execution just hours beforehand. The lawyers and families of those
executed are usually informed shortly afterward.
	   Fifty-four people have been sentenced to death and currently
await execution in Japan, according to Amnesty International.

Report: Singapore dog catcher accidentally shoots bystander dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Singapore pound officer accidentally shot and
killed a bystander while aiming at stray dogs, a newspaper reported
Wednesday.
	   Lim Cheng Choon, 59 and unemployed, was hit in the face Monday
by pellets from a 12-gauge shotgun fired by a Primary Production
Department officer, said The Straits Times. Lim was pronounced dead
on the scene.
	   The department has suspended all shooting pending the results of
an internal investigation, while police have arrested two of the
four officers who were involved in the incident.
	   A team was rounding up dogs near a highway in a remote
northeastern part of the island republic when officers spotted
strays below a flyover, according to the news report.
	   One of the men fired his shotgun twice, but then found Lim's
body near two dead dogs.
	   The PPD told the newspaper that officers received training in
how to shoot at Singapore's Police Academy, and also said that they
are required to clear an area of all people and traffic prior to
firing their shotguns.
	   ``The PPD should ban the use of guns, because they may not be
able to control the direction of the pellets,'' the victim's
brother, Lim Cheng Khoon, was quoted as saying.
	   In September 1996, a 71-year-old retiree was struck by pellets
fired by a pound worker, but survived.
	   Monday's fatal mishap follows tighter safety guidelines issued
after the incident two years ago.

Mitch leaves more dead in Mexico, reforms in Gulf of Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE storm's wind speed, position,

Wednesday, Mitch was located near latitude 20.0 north, longitude
90.6 west. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Residents of Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula braced for a possible lashing from Mitch as the
onetime hurricane regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico and
became a tropical storm.
	   At least five people died when their car was swept away by a
swollen river in the southern state of Chiapas as Mitch spread
rains over southeastern Mexico, officials said Tuesday.
	   The storm had apparently dissipated in recent days after raging
through the Caribbean and Central America. But Tuesday, it
strengthened into a tropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico with 45
mph (72 kph) winds. Still, the storm was only a shadow of the
hurricane that had packed winds up to 180 mph (290 kph).
	   Officials estimated that more than 7,000 people died in Central
America in flooding and mudslides caused by Mitch.
	   The storm was expected to move inland over the Yucatan coast
with heavy rains before weakening. Long-term forecasts had the
storm reaching southern Florida as a tropical depression later this
week.
	   Late Tuesday, the storm was located on Mexico's Gulf coast just
off the port city of Campeche, 550 miles (880 kms) east of Mexico
City, and was moving east-northeast at 12 mph (19 kph). the U.S.
National Hurricane Center reported.
	   About 200 people were evacuated from a low-lying neighborhood in
Campeche, local media reported.
	   The five died Monday when their car was carried away by the
flooded Cacaluta River about 50 miles (80 kms) northwest of the
Guatemalan border, according to Deputy State Attorney General Jorge
Espinosa.
	   He said the driver tried to cross the usually small river across
a temporary road base placed after massive flooding in the area
earlier this year had knocked out a bridge.
	   But rains from Mitch had flooded the river again, washing away
the road base.

Japanese stocks rise in morning trading, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rose sharply in morning
trading Wednesday after a widely-respected U.S. strategist
increased his Japan investment weighting. The U.S. dollar gained
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped 455.40
points, or 3.26 percent, to 14,408.23 points to end the morning
session. On Monday, the average closed up 388.24 points, or 2.86
percent.
	   The dollar bought 115.89 yen at midday, up 0.19 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and higher than its late New York level of 115.33
yen overnight.
	   Financial markets in Japan were closed Tuesday for a national
holiday.
	   On Wednesday, share prices started higher after Morgan Stanley's
global strategist Barton Biggs raised his Japan weighting to 75
percent of the company's capital international index from the
previous 40 percent, traders said.
	   ``Japan could be the next great trade,'' Biggs said. ``Everyone
believes Japan is beyond redemption, but the Japanese market is
truly cheap and Japan is at exactly the opposite end of the
economic, market and sentiment cycle as the U.S.''
	   Share prices were also boosted by expectations that Japan will
implement additional measures to boost the economy, traders said.
Government ministers met early Wednesday to discuss new economic
stimulus steps, but did not reach any concrete decisions.
	   Last month, the Japanese government enacted a set of bank
bailout plans designed to stabilize the nation's banking system.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange climbed 32.77 points, or
3.07 percent, to 1098.61. It had risen 30.24 points, or 2.92
percent, Monday.
	   On the foreign exchange market, short-term investors scrambled
to buy dollars to cover short, or oversold, positions after the yen
failed to reap the benefits of the sharp surge in Tokyo stock
prices.
	   The greenback rose overnight against major world currencies
after Spain, Portugal and Sweden cut key interest rates by a
quarter point.
	   The dollar benefited as lower interest rates tend to make a
nation's currency less attractive to investors.
	   The dollar was also boosted on overnight firmness in U.S.
stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,706.15 points
Tuesday, unchanged from the previous day's close.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.855 percent from Monday's finish of 0.825 percent,
driving its price down to 108.39 yen from 108.68 yen.

Soccer star says he may eclipse Princess Diana as land mines
</HEADLINE>
campaigner &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A French soccer star told a British tabloid that
he may be a more effective campaigner against land mines than the
late Prince Diana.
	   ''In Angola, if they see a blond woman arriving, it means
nothing important. But to see a footballer is really something,''
David Ginola, who plays for England's Tottenham Hotspur soccer team
in north London, said in an interview published Wednesday in The
Express.
	   Ginola, a native of France who is also a part-time model, agreed
this summer to be the public face of the International Committee
for the Red Cross campaign against land mines. He visited the
war-devastated Angola in August.
	   The princess, who helped give the anti-mine crusade huge
worldwide publicity, visited in January 1997 and was photographed
in a blue flak jacket and visor used by the mine clearance crews.
	   She died in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997.
	   Soccer ''is an international language and is the best means of
communicating this issue around the world,'' Ginola is quoted as
saying in the newspaper. ''You get someone like me who uses their
legs to earn a living, then you see pictures of people whose legs
have been blown up by land mines. The two images send a very
powerful message.''
	   But Ginola told The Express that ''I understand my place.''
	   Saying that he could never replace Princess Diana, Ginola added,
''The work has to carry on. It is something that I can do and have
the time to do.''
	   Some 60 million land mines are estimated to be scattered around
the globe in 70 countries.

Flames down Red Wings; Penguins tie Flyers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Tyler Moss won his first National Hockey League
game since January and Cory Stillman scored two goals as the
Calgary Flames beat Detroit 5-2 on Tuesday night, handing the Red
Wings their third straight loss.
	   Theoren Fleury and Andrew Cassels both had a goal and an assist
and Steve Dubinsky scored for the Flames, who were 0-6-2 against
the Red Wings since last beating them Oct. 11, 1996.
	   Tomas Holmstrom had a goal and an assist and Martin Lapointe
added a goal for the Red Wings, who are 2-4-0 since coach Scotty
Bowman returned to the bench Oct. 23.
 &UR; Penguins 4, Flyers 4
	   In Pittsburgh, Maxim Galanov scored his first two NHL goals,
including the game-tying score with 5:24 left, as the Penguins
rallied from a three-goal deficit to tie the Philadelphia Flyers.
	   The Flyers' three-game losing streak ended, but Philadelphia is
1-4-2 since starting the season 4-0-1.
	   The Penguins lost goaltender Peter Skudra with 1:29 left in the
third after a collision in the crease with the Flyers' John
LeClair. Pittsburgh is already without No. 1 goalie Tom Barrasso,
who missed his seventh consecutive game on Tuesday because of a
groin injury. Rookie Jean-Sebastian Aubin finished the game.
 &UR; Devils 3, Rangers 1
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Scott Stevens scored the first
goal this season by a New Jersey defenseman on a long slap shot
late in the second period and the Devils ended the New York
Rangers' six-game unbeaten streak.
	   The game was somewhat of a homecoming as Devils defenseman Scott
Niedermayer played his first game of the year after a contract
problem and long-time Devil John MacLean returned in a Rangers'
uniform.
	   The result wasn't surprising as the Devils extended their
unbeaten streak against New York to 11 games (7-0-4) by becoming
the first team in three games to score against Mike Richter. He had
come into the game off shutouts against Buffalo and Carolina but he
was beaten by Brendan Morrison, Stevens and Jay Pandolfo, who
clinched the game with 2:27 to play.
 &UR; Sabres 4, Bruins 2
	   In Buffalo, New York, Dominik Hasek became the winningest
goaltender in Sabres history with his 157th victory, moving past
Don Edwards with a 4-2 win over the Boston Bruins.
	   Curtis Brown's first goal of the season proved to be the
game-winner, as the Sabres continued what for them is a scoring
binge.
	   Dixon Ward, Miroslav Satan and Michal Grosek also scored for the
Sabres. The Sabres were coming off a home-and-home sweep of Toronto
in which they ended a scoring drought with 10 goals.
	   Buffalo is unbeaten in its last four games, while Boston has won
just one of its last six. Steve Heinze and Hal Gill scored for
Boston.

Observers allowed to view third day of Malaysian dissident's trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial
 &UR; By R. MAGESHWARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Representatives of international
human rights and jurist groups were able to attend the trial of
Malaysia's leading dissident on Wednesday, the third day of
proceedings in a case which has drawn attention worldwide.
	   Dozens of foreign observers and local opposition figures have
been clamoring to get into the courtroom since the trial of ousted
Malaysian deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim got underway on
Monday.
	   Only a few had succeeded in gaining entry during the first two
days of the trial, but most observers hoping to view the
proceedings managed to get into a public viewing gallery on
Wednesday.
	   The development came after harsh criticism at home and abroad
over High Court Judge Augustine Paul's ruling Monday against giving
observer privileges to representatives of watchdog groups.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts. He denies the charges and says they were fabricated to
eclipse his challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year
rule.
	   The improved access to the trial was welcomed by a local
opposition leader, Syed Husin Ali of the Malaysian People's Party.
But another opposition leader was denied entry.
	   Court bailiffs told Fadzil Noor, president of the main Muslim
party, Parti Islam SeMalaysia, there was no room for him.
	   The Muslim party is part of a pro-Anwar coalition outlawed last
week after it organized a series of meetings to campaign for Prime
Minister Mahathir's resignation.
	   Meanwhile, Justice International, a lawyers group that promotes
human rights, complained that Anwar was still being treated harshly
in prison.
	   ``Anwar's human rights continue to be denied in prison where he
is kept in solitary confinement and deprived of any facilities,
including a watch,'' the group said in a statement. ``He complains
of (a) hearing impediment as a result of beatings in detention and
is rapidly losing weight.''
	   The group also said Anwar was not being allowed enough time with
his lawyers.
	   Anwar's treatment became an issue after the 51-year-old former
No. 2 leader showed up for an arraignment hearing with a black eye
and bruises on his neck and body. He alleged he was beaten on the
first night of custody on Sept. 20.

Philippine police arrest suspects in businessman kidnapping case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Police in the Philippines arrested
four suspects in the kidnapping of a wealthy businessman just hours
after he was released, the chief of an anti-crime task force said
Wednesday.
	   The four taken into custody include a woman and a 14-year-old
boy, who allegedly picked up the 5 million peso (dlrs 125,000)
ransom from the family of kidnap victim Regan King near a mall in
central Cebu City.
	   Chief Superintendent Panfilo Lacson, head of the Presidential
Anti-Organized Crime Task Force, said in a radio interview from
Cebu that the alleged leader of the gang, Ronald Peleno, and
another suspected member also were arrested.
	   Lacson said the King family, one of the wealthiest in Cebu, had
refused to cooperate with police in helping solve the kidnapping.
Police did, however, monitor the family's negotiations with the
kidnappers.
	   King, manager of his father's heavy equipment company, was
seized at his office on Oct. 21.
	   The kidnappers initially demanded a 50 million peso (dlrs 1.25
million) ransom and then settled for 5 million pesos (dlrs
125,000). Police on Tuesday had reported that only 2 million pesos
(dlrs 50,000) had been paid.
	   Lacson said the police recovered guns and 3.5 million pesos
(dlrs 87,500) from the suspects' hideout in the town of Compostella
north of Cebu City.
	   King was released unharmed Monday near a drug store in Mandaue
City near Cebu and took a taxi home without informing police,
Lacson said.
	   President Joseph Estrada has launched a high-profile campaign
against kidnappings and scored a major victory last month with the
rescue of several victims and the arrest of their alleged abductors
in Manila.
	   Estrada promised upon taking office in June to end the
kidnappings within six months.
	   An anti-crime citizens' group reported that 249 people were
kidnapped last year and 306.4 million pesos (dlrs 7.6 million) in
ransom was paid.

Report points finger at military involvement in Indonesia's riots
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous.
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security agents helped incite deadly
riots last May during which dozens of ethnic Chinese women were
gang raped, an Indonesian fact-finding panel has said in a damning
report that attacks the Southeast Asian nations' powerful military.
	   After a three month-long investigation, a team set up by
President B.J. Habibie found some members of the military urged
crowds to loot and burn in the capital city of Jakarta and
elsewhere in an apparent attempt to destabilize the government.
	   Others simply let rampaging mobs go wild during the May 13-15
riots, the report concluded.
	   There was no immediate response from the military or the
government on Wednesday.
	   The unrest was sparked by the shooting of four student
protesters by the military on May 12. It left 1,200 people dead and
prompted former President Suharto to end his 32-year authoritarian
rule.
	   The report, released on Tuesday night, implicates Suharto's
son-in-law, a general who was recently dismissed from the army, in
the turmoil, along with a former Jakarta military commander.
	   The findings are a further blow to the armed forces, now caught
between widespread allegations of human rights abuses under Suharto
and a new role as a promoter of democratic reforms promised by his
successor, Habibie.
	   It comes as the military prepares a huge security operation to
protect a government assembly that will draft guidelines next week
for general elections in 1999.
	   Student activists, who earlier opposed Suharto, plan big
protests again, saying Habibie's government is not moving fast
enough on its reform agenda.
	   ``The riots in Jakarta can be described as an effort to topple
the power unconstitutionally,'' said Marzuki Darusman, chairman of
the panel that includes human rights activists, senior police
officers, lawyers, bureaucrats and community leaders.
	   The report disputes military claims that no mass sexual attacks
were committed during the riots, concluding that 66 women were
raped and another 10 were assaulted.
	   ``Not all the victims of sexual violence were with from the
ethnic Chinese (group)...but the majority were,'' Darusman said at
a news conference.
	   Many of the rapes were committed by gangs as crowds watched, he
said.
	   Darusman acknowledged that much of the unrest was triggered by
anger over price increases amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis
in decades.
	   He did not speculate on who was trying to topple the government
nor whether military involvement in the riots was approved by top
commanders.
	   Without elaborating, he said infighting between political
leaders also helped provoke the riots.
	   He urged the military to court-martial former Lt. Gen. Prabowo
Subianto, a son-in-law of Suharto. The general was fired from his
post as commander of Indonesia's special forces after admitting to
involvement in the kidnapping of nine political activists during
the final months of Suharto's rule.
	   Darusman also said the government should investigate Maj. Gen.
Syafrie Sjamsuddin, an ally of Prabowo who was head of the Jakarta
military at the time of the riots. Sjamsuddin was later sent to a
less prominent post.
	   Some government opponents have alleged military hard-liners
provoked the riots because they wanted an excuse to crack down on
dissidents, a charge that the military has vehemently denied.
	   The government-backed investigators said the military bungled
efforts to restore order in Jakarta, in many cases ignoring looters
or taking payoffs to guard terrified ethnic Chinese.
	   ``The security officers in several places let the riots
happen,'' he said.
	   The Chinese minority, which dominates the economy, has been a
frequent target of attacks as Indonesia endures a period of
prolonged economic hardship.

Britain's highest court to decide on Pinochet arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add in graf 16 resolution passed by Chilean senate;
Lords hearing scheduled to start 1030 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With moves under way in seven European countries
to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Britain's highest court will
decide whether to quash his arrest at a London hospital and send
the former Chilean dictator straight home.
	   Five judges, sitting round a horseshoe shaped table in a
committee room at the House of Lords, will start hearing an appeal
by British prosecutors on Wednesday against a High Court ruling
last week that Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish warrant was
illegal.
	   To the dismay of victims, the High Court said that Pinochet, as
a foreign former head of state, has immunity from prosecution for
acts committed during his 17-year rule. The present Chilean
government says some 3,000 political opponents were killed or
disappeared.
	   The hearing on whether the 82-year-old general should be
extradited to face charges of murder, torture and kidnapping was
scheduled to last two days.
	   The judges, headed by Lord Justice Gordon Slynn of Hadley, were
not expected to rule immediately after the hearing Thursday.
	   Legal experts say the warrant _ issued by a Spanish magistrate
investigating human rights abuses after Pinochet seized power in
1973 _ and other extradition moves will become irrelevant if the
Lords also throw out the arrest.
	   However, Pinochet could fly home _ a special medically equipped
jet is waiting at an air base north of London _ to more trouble.
	   In Chile on Tuesday a coalition of center-left parties that
support President Eduardo Frei appointed a legal panel to examine
the possibility of Pinochet standing trial in his native land. As a
senator-for-life and under laws he initiated, Pinochet has so far
had immunity from prosecution in Chile.
	   Chilean senators also said they will seek a constitutional
amendment allowing members of congress to resign their seats. The
constitution now bans lawmakers from quitting. The move appeared a
clear invitation to Pinochet to leave politics once he returns
home, as suggested by the government.
	   France and Switzerland also want to extradite Pinochet, and
Chilean exiles in Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Germany have filed
criminal complaints they hope will lead to extradition.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, was arrested while
recuperating from back surgery at a central London hospital. A
British judge granted him bail Oct. 30 and he was moved to another
hospital, Grovelands Priory in north London, but remains under
police guard.
	   At a meeting at the House of Commons on Tuesday, victims of the
secret police that operated during Pinochet's rule described
brutality they said was beyond immunity.
	   The son of Orlando Letelier, Allende's foreign minister killed
in a 1976 car-bombing in Washington, said the assassins were sent
to the United States by Pinochet's secret police.
	   ``My father's legs were severed and he bled to death with the
bottom of his body against the floor,'' said Juan Pablo Letelier.
``No immunity clause can permit that this be left in limbo. ...
Nothing authorizes a head of state to commit international state
terrorism of any sort,'' he added.
	   Letelier, now a left-wing congressman, is among a delegation of
Chilean lawmakers and human rights activists who have come to
London hoping to convince the Lords to uphold the arrest.
	   Meanwhile in Chile, the right-wing dominated Senate passed a
resolution on late Tuesday ''formally protesting'' Spain's
violation of Chile's sovereignty for seeking to extradite Pinochet
to face charges of alleged human rights abuses.

Hostage escapes as young captors take video game break
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A kidnapped businessman was able to escape when
his teen-age captors let their guard down and went off to play
video games, it was reported Wednesday.
	   Leung Man-fai, 19, and Lui Wan-fei, 17, pleaded guilty to
kidnapping and robbery and face sentencing later this month, the
South China Morning Post said in its report on the case.
	   The foiled kidnapping began on Sept. 8, 1997, when businessman
Kwok Chi-ho was lured to a bungalow on the small Hong Kong island
of Cheung Chau, prosecutor Jackson Poon told a Hong Kong court on
Tuesday.
	   Leung and Li bound and blindfolded Kwok at knife-point, then
robbed him of his bank cards, Poon said. Kwok was then ordered to
sign an IOU note for 3.5 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
450,000) _ which was faxed the next day to his family.
	   The family started putting money into Kwok's bank account, but
the crime soon unraveled when the young kidnappers left Kwok alone
so they could go to an amusement arcade, where they became
engrossed in the video games.
	   The defendants returned three hours later, only to find that
Kwok had broken free, the prosecutor said. The escaped hostage led
police to the kidnappers' bungalow.

	   The new estimated death toll, reported late Tuesday by Col. Rene
Osorio of Honduras' national emergency commission, came as reports
trickled in from remote areas of this Central American nation.
	   The scope of the tragedy was likely to expand: Osorio said
11,100 people remained missing almost a week after Mitch began
lashing the country with heavy rains. And many throughout Honduras
still waited to be rescued from rooftops and islands surrounded
with floodwaters left by Hurricane Mitch.
	   Meanwhile, the one-time hurricane, which killed more than 9,000
people throughout Central America, re-formed as a tropical storm in
the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, though its 45 mph (72 kph) winds
were a shadow of the 180 mph (290 kph) monster of last week.

New Japan economic stimulus measures may exceed proposed amount
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ New government spending measures to boost Japan's
sagging economy may exceed the 10 trillion yen (dlrs 86 billion)
promised by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Japan's economic planning
chief said Wednesday.
	   The government is expected to announce the fresh stimulus steps
on Nov. 16, and Cabinet ministers held an emergency meeting
Wednesday to discuss the plan.
	   Economic Planning Agency Director General Taichi Sakaiya told
reporters after the meeting that any new economic steps must
trigger an immediate boost in domestic demand in order to ensure a
return to economic growth next year.
	   ``Right now, the economy is in an extremely severe condition,''
Sakaiya said. ``The government's economic steps shouldn't be
limited to the 10 trillion yen framework.''
	   Japan has been mired in a deep recession, and the government is
struggling to come up with a strategy to prevent the economy from
shrinking in fiscal 1999 for a third consecutive year.
	   The government estimates gross domestic product will contract by
1.8 percent for the current fiscal year, which ends next March.
	   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan may
provide financial assistance to Brazil after the country finishes
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for an estimated
dlrs 30 billion aid package.
	   The mass-circulation Yomiuri newspaper reported Wednesday that
the Japanese government would commit up to dlrs 1 billion in aid
for the struggling Latin American giant.
	   Brazil has been the latest country to be rocked by global
financial turbulence, and experts fear that a sharp economic
downturn in South America could seriously damage the already
vulnerable U.S. economy.

Pacific Rim leaders to wear custom-made batik shirts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Asian recession won't prevent
Pacific-Rim leaders from donning pricey batik shirts handpicked by
Malaysia's prime minister.
	   Tradition has it that world leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum wear identical clothing symbolic of the host
county during their daylong retreat.
	   Last year in Vancouver it was matching leather bomber jackets.
But this year in Kuala Lumpur, no two leaders will look alike
during the informal retreat, which comes at the end of their
summit, Nov. 17-18.
	   The shirts were handpicked by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and cost 600 ringgit (dlrs 160), according to Wednesday editions of
The Star newspaper.
	   Each shirt has its own color and design and was tailored
according to each leader's measurements after Mahathir selected his
favorites from a local designer.
	   ``The prime minister chose 21 shirts from a selection of about
40 or 50,'' a spokesman at the APEC secretariat at the
International Trade and Industry Ministry told The Star.
	   The batik shirts will be worn during the group photograph that
has become synonymous with the APEC summit.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru will join at the Kuala
Lumpur summit.

Britain's highest court to decide on Pinochet arrest

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix coding
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add in graf 16 resolution passed by Chilean senate;
Lords hearing scheduled to start 1030 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With moves under way in seven European countries
to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Britain's highest court will
decide whether to quash his arrest at a London hospital and send
the former Chilean dictator straight home.
	   Five judges, sitting round a horseshoe shaped table in a
committee room at the House of Lords, will start hearing an appeal
by British prosecutors on Wednesday against a High Court ruling
last week that Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest on a Spanish warrant was
illegal.
	   To the dismay of victims, the High Court said that Pinochet, as
a foreign former head of state, has immunity from prosecution for
acts committed during his 17-year rule. The present Chilean
government says some 3,000 political opponents were killed or
disappeared.
	   The hearing on whether the 82-year-old general should be
extradited to face charges of murder, torture and kidnapping was
scheduled to last two days.
	   The judges, headed by Lord Justice Gordon Slynn of Hadley, were
not expected to rule immediately after the hearing Thursday.
	   Legal experts say the warrant _ issued by a Spanish magistrate
investigating human rights abuses after Pinochet seized power in
1973 _ and other extradition moves will become irrelevant if the
Lords also throw out the arrest.
	   However, Pinochet could fly home _ a special medically equipped
jet is waiting at an air base north of London _ to more trouble.
	   In Chile on Tuesday a coalition of center-left parties that
support President Eduardo Frei appointed a legal panel to examine
the possibility of Pinochet standing trial in his native land. As a
senator-for-life and under laws he initiated, Pinochet has so far
had immunity from prosecution in Chile.
	   Chilean senators also said they will seek a constitutional
amendment allowing members of congress to resign their seats. The
constitution now bans lawmakers from quitting. The move appeared a
clear invitation to Pinochet to leave politics once he returns
home, as suggested by the government.
	   France and Switzerland also want to extradite Pinochet, and
Chilean exiles in Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Germany have filed
criminal complaints they hope will lead to extradition.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, was arrested while
recuperating from back surgery at a central London hospital. A
British judge granted him bail Oct. 30 and he was moved to another
hospital, Grovelands Priory in north London, but remains under
police guard.
	   At a meeting at the House of Commons on Tuesday, victims of the
secret police that operated during Pinochet's rule described
brutality they said was beyond immunity.
	   The son of Orlando Letelier, Allende's foreign minister killed
in a 1976 car-bombing in Washington, said the assassins were sent
to the United States by Pinochet's secret police.
	   ``My father's legs were severed and he bled to death with the
bottom of his body against the floor,'' said Juan Pablo Letelier.
``No immunity clause can permit that this be left in limbo. ...
Nothing authorizes a head of state to commit international state
terrorism of any sort,'' he added.
	   Letelier, now a left-wing congressman, is among a delegation of
Chilean lawmakers and human rights activists who have come to
London hoping to convince the Lords to uphold the arrest.
	   Meanwhile in Chile, the right-wing dominated Senate passed a
resolution on late Tuesday ``formally protesting'' Spain's
violation of Chile's sovereignty for seeking to extradite Pinochet
to face charges of alleged human rights abuses.

TEGUCIGALPA: last week.

	   Weather forecasters said the storm, moving to the northeast,
could strike the Yucatan Peninsula and then Florida later in the
week with heavy rains _ but not with anything approaching
hurricane-force winds.
	   Here in the Honduran capital, the sun came out Tuesday after a
week of torrential rains and churning winds, but with reports of
increasing hunger among the survivors, officials raced to deliver
food and water to survivors.
	   The United States sent more than two dozen military aircraft and
500 military personnel into the region to assist with air
surveillance and rescue missions.
	   Damage to vital coffee and banana crops that sustain the Central
American economies also was extensive. Chiquita Brands
International Inc. said its regional banana farms and operations
suffered an estimated dlrs 50 million in losses.
	   Company officials in Cincinnati said their biggest worry was the
plight of stricken employees.
	   ``Our first priority is literally to save lives,'' said Chiquita
President Steve Warshaw. ``We have had several thousand people
stranded on rooftops.''
	   In New York, coffee and sugar futures rose sharply Tuesday as
damaged roads and washed-out bridges in Honduras, Guatemala and
Nicaragua prevented the arabica beans preferred by American
coffee-drinkers from reaching port.
	   It was the second straight day that coffee prices had surged.
Analysts also speculated that the rains spawned by Mitch damaged
coffee trees and had wiped out several million 32-pound bags of
beans.
	   Honduran Communications Minister Tomas Lozano said Tuesday that
1 million had to flee their homes in this nation of 6 million
people. Countless more lacked clean water, food and medicine.
	   ``But we are dealing with preliminary official figures,'' he
said. ``And the number of victims will be greater when the waters
fall and the country returns to normal.''
	   Most of the deaths in Nicaragua occurred when the crater lake of
the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud and debris
onto several villages below.
	   Mayor Felicita Zeledon of nearby Posoltega said 1,950 bodies had
been recovered by Tuesday.
	   Battered human bodies were found Tuesday half-buried in the mud
and entangled in sugar cane stalks, rotting because villagers had
no gasoline to burn them.
	   U.S. and local helicopters flew emergency missions throughout
the day in Nicaragua and Honduras to reach people trapped by the
floods.
	   In the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, people tried to find
missing relatives at hospitals and morgues.
	   Oscar Triminio, spokesman for the Tegucigalpa fire department,
said more than 30 bodies had been pulled from the Choluteca River
since Monday.
	   Lozano said many people remain trapped on rooftops by
floodwaters a week after Hurricane Mitch began pummeling the
Atlantic coast. The storm destroyed almost all of the highways,
dozens of bridges and 70 percent of the national agriculture.
	   That made it difficult to transport food and impossible to move
gasoline to fuel relief efforts, said Col. Alfredo San Martin, Air
Force chief of staff.
	   ``We now have fuel to operate, but in five or seven days, the
supplies will run out,'' he said.
	   U.S. military helicopters Tuesday ferried Honduran officials on
inspection tours of the refineries and transportation routes.
	   ``If we don't get fuel into the city, it will be utter chaos,''
said Lt. Col. Ricardo Aguilar of the U.S. Air Force.
	   In Guatemala, struck by Mitch over the weekend, President Alvaro
Arzu reported Tuesday that 157 people had died, 100,000 homes were
damaged and 30 highways were blocked.
	   El Salvador's National Emergency Committee reported 222 deaths,
135 missing and 50,000 driven from their homes by the flooding.
	   And Mexican authorities said remnants of Mitch killed at least
five people in the southern state of Chiapas.
	   At the United Nations, U.N. ambassadors from five nations
appealed for international help Tuesday to feed and clothe the
survivors and bury the dead.
	   Rebuilding the hardest-hit countries _ Honduras and Nicaragua _
will take many years and billions of dollars. But with victims
still clinging to trees and rooftops, the ambassadors said the
region's top priority is emergency assistance.
	   Honduran Ambassador Hugo Noe-Pino _ flanked by envoys from
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Costa Rica _ said the killer
storm had put the country's development efforts back by at least 30
years.
