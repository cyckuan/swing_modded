<HEADLINE> Onetime 'junk' fish, dogfish now endangered by overfishing  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Fishermen who turned a onetime ''junk'' fish into
a moneymaker are upset about plans to place limits on their catch.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the restrictions are necessary to protect
the spiny dogfish, or cape shark, from being overfished.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either we act now and save what's left of the population or we
let them fish this public resource to collapse within a few years
and they'll be out of business either way,'' said Sonja Fordham,
fisheries project manager at the Center for Marine Conservation in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Frady, a spokeswoman for the Northeast region of the
National Marine Fisheries Service, said new regulations to protect
the spiny dogfish were going into effect today, barring any
unforeseen developments.
</P>
<P>
   They call for limiting the catch for the current fishing year to
10,000 metric tons, or about 22 million pounds, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that number, which would affect the fishing year from
May 1, 1999 to April 30 of this year, would probably be met.
</P>
<P>
   But she said there was considerable controversy over where the
limits should be set for the next fishing year.
</P>
<P>
   The two quasi-governmental bodies that jointly regulate the
dogfish industry off the East Coast are at odds, with the New
England Fishery Management Council calling for much less
restrictive limits than the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a deep cutback in the allowable haul of spiny
dogfish sticks in the craw of the fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Mickelson, attorney for the American Dogfish Association,
which represents both dogfish processing plants and fishermen, said
more study is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line to the whole thing is that if it's true that
the fishery should be sharply reduced or closed down, it should be
done with good, substantial and in-depth information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Manley, fisheries commissioner for the city of New
Bedford, said cutbacks would have ''a major impact'' on his city.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was ironic because fishermen had been encouraged
in the 1990s to go after species such as the dogfish because of the
depletion of stocks of more popular fish like the haddock, cod and
flounder.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did their job well and now here we go again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham said environmentalists had been ''calling for management
of this particular vulnerable species for more than five years so
we could avoid exactly this situation. But there's been too much
opposition to this plan so it's years behind schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If we act now, we ... have an opportunity to recover the
population perhaps within a decade. If we continue the status quo,
the population will collapse in just a few years and rebuilding
will be stretched out more than three decades,'' she said.

Net Cited in Insider Trading Scheme
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nineteen people were charged Tuesday with illegally
pocketing more than $8 million from secrets traded in cyberspace chat rooms, an
insider trading case that prosecutors said was the first to use the Internet.
Two of main organizers pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit insider trading
and other charges. Richard Walker, director of enforcement for the Securities
and Exchange Commission, called the case ''one of the most elaborate insider
trading schemes in history.'' The Internet figured so prominently in the scheme
that U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White and the commission noted that the case was the
first ever alleging that the Internet was used to pass inside information.

Nominations Clinched, Bush With Advantage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new poll shows George W. Bush holds a slight advantage
among likely voters in the presidential race against Al Gore, as both
presidential candidates clinched their party's nominations in the southern
primaries Tuesday. Bush is also drawing more of the John McCain supporters that
both he and Gore are aggressively trying to attract, according to the poll
released Tuesday. The Texas governor has 49 percent to 43 percent for Gore in
the CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. Other recent polls have shown the race very close
or with the vice president slightly ahead, but many of them polled registered
voters. Narrowing the poll to likely voters often improves the numbers of the
Republican candidate.

U.S., Britain Urge Open Gene Access

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shares in biotechnology companies hoping to profit from
the sale of genetic data were hammered Tuesday after the United States and
Britain agreed to openly share data from a groundbreaking project to decode the
human genetic pattern. The two governments are the leading players in the
nonprofit Human Genome Project, which plans to publish a full genetic map on the
Internet by 2003. The information, which President Clinton called ''the
scientific breakthrough of the century, perhaps of all time,'' would be
available free to scientists and researchers.

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A judge threw out the nation's first statewide
school voucher system Tuesday, ruling that Florida's Constitution bars public
money from being spent on private education. Gov. Jeb Bush, who championed the
program, promised to find the money to keep it going despite what happens in
court. An appeal is certain. ''We'll raise the money,'' Bush said. ''This is the

U.S. Releases China Trade Text
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, under pressure from Congress,
released the text of its landmark trade agreement with China Tuesday and pledged
intensive enforcement to ensure that China opens its markets. Administration
officials insisted the 250 pages of detailed text that it sent to each member of
Congress and released to news organizations confirm its claims that U.S.
exporters stand to reap billions of dollars from lowered trade barriers promised
by China. Opponents quickly seized on what they view as serious shortcomings of
the agreement: the lack of protections for workers, the environment or human
rights.

Ind. OKs Posting Ten Commandments

   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Democratic Gov. Frank O'Bannon signed legislation
Tuesday allowing schools and other government entities to post the Ten
Commandments in their buildings if they are displayed with other historical
documents. The governor also said a new monument will be erected on the
Statehouse grounds this summer featuring the commandments, the preamble to the
U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The law takes effect July 1. The
Indiana Civil Liberties Union, which contends the law violates the
constitutional separation of church and state, said it likely would sue shortly
after the monument goes up.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks 111, Pacers 90  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Dirk Nowitzki scored 28 points -- 13 during a 15-0
run to open the second half -- and the Dallas Mavericks beat the
Indiana Pacers 111-90 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash added 21 points and Michael Finley had 16 points and
11 assists to help the Mavericks to their second-largest margin of
victory this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Greg Buckner had 10 points and 11 rebounds for the
Mavericks, his first career double-double.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Best led Indiana with 26 points and Jalen Rose added 18
points and 13 rebounds. Austin Croshere had 10 points and 13
rebounds for the Eastern Division-leading Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller had only seven points, 12 under his team-leading
average and just one better than his lowest scoring game this
season. Miller has been bothered by a bruised right quad and was
listed as questionable for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas took a 36-18 first-quarter lead and was in front by as
many as 20 in the second quarter. Best scored 15 points in the
second quarter to keep the Pacers within range, but Dallas held a
60-46 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks maintained first-half momentum by opening the
third quarter with 15 straight points, including three 3-pointers
by Nowitzki, for a 75-46 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which had won four of its previous five games, failed
to score over the first four minutes of the third quarter until
Croshere's follow.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas went on to lead by as many as 32 points in the third
quarter and took an 86-61 advantage into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mavericks hired Brad Davis as an assistant coach. The
team hired former Lakers coach Del Harris as their defensive
coordinator on Monday. Davis will assist Harris as the Mavericks
attempt to improve a defense that was allowing 103.1 points per
game entering Tuesday night, third-worst in the league. ... The
Mavericks also are talking to Gar Heard about an assistant's
position. Heard was coach of the Mavericks in the 1992-93 season.
He was fired as coach of the Washington Wizards this season. ...
The Mavericks activated center Bruno Sundov off the injured list.
... Indiana's Dale Davis missed the game with leg cramps.

<HEADLINE> Clinton defends fundraising; says Giuliani slow to aid libraries  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton, launching one of her
toughest attacks yet against Senate rival Rudolph Giuliani, says
the New York City mayor should get an overdue notice when it comes
to helping libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are too many leaders on the Republican side, from
Capitol Hill to Gracie Mansion (the mayor's official residence) who
year after year, come budget time, reject their responsibilities to
our public libraries,'' the first lady told several hundred
librarians attending a conference Tuesday sponsored by the New York
Library Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year, once again, the mayor of New York has proposed
cutting the library budget by a whopping 19 percent,'' she added.
''Imagine if someone in the Senate from New York ... stood for a 19
percent cut to our libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the Giuliani campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton sought to stay on the attack against the
Republican mayor, reporters were intent on asking her about a
report in The New York Times that she had benefitted from a $50,000
fund-raising dinner hosted by Pakistani-Americans for her on Staten
Island on Feb. 22. At the time, Pakistani-Americans were lobbying
the Clinton administration to have the president visit Pakistan
during his upcoming trip to India. Last week, the president
announced he would also visit Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady at first refused to talk about the issue, saying
she wasn't going to conduct a ''walking news conference'' as she
left the librarians' event. Later, after speaking to the New York
State School Boards Association, Clinton told reporters that the
fund-raising event had no impact on her husband's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anybody thinks they can influence the president by making a
contribution to me, they are dead wrong, and I think there is no
evidence of that,'' she said, adding that it was well known that
her husband had always wanted to include Pakistan in his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Clinton said that if any contributors are saying they
are giving to her with the hope of influencing administration
policy, ''that is inappropriate and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady also said that if a Senate candidate were to
eliminate as contributors any New Yorkers who belonged to an ethnic
group with foreign policy concerns, ''it would be very difficult to
run for office in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In her speech to the school board members from across the state,
Clinton continued her attacks on Giuliani and his support for
school vouchers for parents who want to take their children out of
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Calling vouchers ''gimmicks,'' Clinton said ''this election
presents New Yorkers with a stark choice, a choice to walk away
from our public schools, cutting schools and slashing (city
education) budgets by almost $7 billion, or digging in and making
sure that not a single child from a single school falls through the
cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the librarians that local communities and local
libraries should decide on an individual basis whether to employ
filters on their computer systems designed to keep children from
being exposed to smut or violence on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she also said that ''personally, if I were in a
library I would employ filters because I think that there is a lot
of stuff on the Web that is just not appropriate for children, or
for adults for that matter. But you wouldn't want to do anything
other than filter for children.''

<HEADLINE> Republican assemblyman lashes out at top Pataki aide  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A war of words has broken out between Gov.
George Pataki and a Republican assemblyman who says the governor's
chief aide threatened to run someone against him in a primary for
refusing to support George W. Bush for president.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I was Pataki, I would just fire'' Zenia Mucha, said
Assemblyman Thomas Kirwan, a former state trooper and Orange County
Republican who was one of the first prominent New York Republicans
to endorse Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Mucha on Tuesday denied threatening Kirwan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sad commentary that people will say or do anything to
get attention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zenia Mucha is an extremely valuable member of this
administration,'' Pataki said. ''If he has a problem with her or
any member of this administration, he shouldn't run to reporters,
he should pick up the phone and call me.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first public fallout from McCain's unsuccessful
attempt to win New York state in the Republican presidential
primary. Most of the party establishment was behind Bush and tried
to keep McCain from being able to compete on the primary ballot in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kirwan was elected as a McCain delegate, garnering the
second-most votes in the state's 26nd Congressional District. The
other delegates elected in the district were state Sen. Thomas
Libous, R-Binghamton, and Joseph Laughney, Broome County's GOP
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush won the March 7 presidential primary in New York with at
least 67 of the 93 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican Party, with the support of Pataki, Bush's
state campaign chairman, had tried earlier to keep McCain off the
ballot but failed. After that, the party put all of its resources
into ensuring Bush would win the state's delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of this, a couple of members have told me that Zenia
Mucha has said with expletives deleted, in fact with language that
rivaled Joe Pesci in 'Goodfellas,' that I better be prepared for a
primary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a Bush sweep of the primaries on March 7, McCain dropped
out of the GOP presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Mucha, known for her fierce and sometimes coarse defense of
Pataki, denied ever threatening Kirwan. ''Before today, I've never
given a passing thought to ... what is his name?'' Mucha asked.
</P>
<P>
   When prompted with Kirwan's name, she continued, ''And in spite
of today's events, that statement holds true. All I can say is, you
know, I guess people will say or do anything to get attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Mucha, once an aide to former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, is
Pataki's chief spokeswoman and among his closest advisers. Mucha,
who makes $147,490 a year, successfully ran his reelection race for
governor in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as I can convince Zenia Mucha to turn down much
greater offers in the private sector and keep working to improve
this state, I'm going to try to do everything I can to keep her
here,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirwan admitted that Mucha never personally threatened him and
that he heard about it secondhand. He refused to say who his
sources were, and said he had not tried to call Mucha or Pataki to
confirm what he was told. ''I didn't see a point to it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kirwan said if Mucha wants to see him in a primary, she
should move into his district and challenge him herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she does, I will kick her rear end back to Albany,'' Kirwan
promised.
</P>
<P>
   Kirwan has been in the state Legislature since 1994.

<HEADLINE> Unions say they won't oppose CSEA contract with state  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A union president who agitated against the
state's contract offer to the Civil Service Employees Association
last year said he supports the new tentative contract agreement it
has reached with the Pataki administration.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Quirk, president of the 1,500-member State Court Officers
union, said Tuesday that with a few modifications, the Civil
Service Employees Association contract is one he would endorse to
his own members.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative CSEA pact includes across-the-board salary
increases of 3 percent retroactive to October 1999, 3 percent
effective April 2000, and 3.5 percent in both April 2001 and April
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were given the exact same offer today and it has some big
positives,'' Quirk said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, fearing the state would base his union's contract
negotiations upon the tentative agreement reached by the
77,000-member CSEA, Quirk led an advertising campaign urging CSEA
members to reject the state's offer of an 11 percent increase over
four years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state has been telling us for 25 years that we can't have
more than CSEA,'' Quirk said. ''I got sick and tired of CSEA
accepting bad deals that caused harm to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The union then representing state prison guards, Council 82,
also campaigned among CSEA members in favor of rejecting the 1999
tentative contract agreement. Council 82 has since lost the right
to bargain for guards.
</P>
<P>
   The state has traditionally tried to settle contracts first with
CSEA, and make its contracts with all other state worker unions fit
within the wage and benefit parameters of the CSEA deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new contract they've got is a direct result of the actions
we took,'' Quirk said. ''We forced the CSEA's hand, and without
that, they'd have accepted the offer of last year that wasn't good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's offer to the CSEA last year was overwhelmingly
rejected and in the year since, CSEA and other unions have staged
protests at Pataki events across the state demanding a sweeter
deal.
</P>
<P>
   CSEA spokesman Stephen Madarasz said that Quirk had no impact on
the CSEA's contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had ads that attacked CSEA and caused turmoil but that's
it,'' Madarasz said. ''He hasn't been anywhere working to advance
the cause of New York State workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our members didn't need Dennis Quirk telling them to vote
no,'' Madarasz said. ''And for him to even suggest that he had
something to do with the process that resulted in this contract is
a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a scavenger -- a parasite who just waits by to reap the
benefits of what CSEA has done.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to wage-increase provisions, CSEA's contract also
eliminates the 3 percent yearly pension contribution for employees
who have worked 10 years or more.

<HEADLINE> Charlotte Frank, Harry Phillips III elected as Regents  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- There will be two new faces at Board of
Regents meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Frank, of Manhattan, and Harry Phillips III, of
Hartsdale, were elected Tuesday to the 16-member educational
policy-making panel and will step into the board's two vacant
slots.
</P>
<P>
   They replace retiring Regent Ed Meyers, the board's
longest-serving member, and Harold Levy, who left to become the
interim chancellor of the New York City school system.
</P>
<P>
   Five other Regents -- Diane McGivern, Adelaide Sanford, Robert
Johnson, James Dawson and Robert Bennett -- were reappointed by the
state Legislature to new five-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Regents are unpaid and one is chosen from each of the state's 12
judicial districts. The other four are at-large selections.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the majority of the Republican senators boycotted
the election process. Since the Assembly has 150 members and the
Senate 61, the process of selecting the Regents is essentially
controlled by the Assembly Democratic majority plus the Democrats
in the minority in the state Senate. The Republican members can't
stop the Democrats from electing who they want for the Regents
board and complain about the process every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we again are witnessing a process that will compromise
the quality of education in New York state,'' said Senate Education
Chairman John Kuhl, one of the few Republicans who showed up in the
state Assembly chamber Tuesday to protest the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kenneth LaValle, a Suffolk County Republican, has sued to
overturn the Regents' election process. While he lost in state
Supreme Court, the case has been appealed to the midlevel Appellate
Division of state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The irony is that the Democrats talked about the Republican
presidential primary being Byzantine and a throwback to the old
Soviet Union,'' LaValle said of the recently completed GOP
balloting won by George W. Bush. ''The senators aren't even needed
for this process.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When they allow us to take part in the confirmation process,
we'll talk about the election process,'' said Patricia Lynch,
spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. The Senate gets to
confirm most gubernatorial nominations of cabinet-level
commissioners, and trustees and board members at state agencies and
authorities, without input from the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Education Chairman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan
Democrat, said more than 90 people applied for the seven slots on
the Board of Regents. In 1998, only about 20 people applied for two
positions on the 15-member educational policy-making panel.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders also conducted seven days of public interviews of all
the candidates. ''We made an exhaustive search to find the best
people,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank is vice president for research and development for the
McGraw Hill Educational and Professional Publishing Group in
Manhattan. She also worked for the New York City School Board as
the executive director of the division of curriculum and
instruction, director of curriculum development as well as a former
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has been chairman of Westchester Community College's
board for the last five years, and has been a trustee since 1989.
He also served as director, treasurer and vice president of the New
York Community College Trustees of SUNY and served on several of
its committees.

<HEADLINE> Comptroller: Thruway Authority low-balled revenue figures  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Thruway Authority underestimated
traffic and revenue figures in order to justify a proposed toll
increase, New York's comptroller is contending.
</P>
<P>
   H. Carl McCall said the Thruway Authority projected an
''artificially low'' growth rate in traffic of 2 percent over the
next six years when making its case for a toll hike -- though over
the past 12 years passenger vehicle traffic on the Thruway has been
increasing by 3 percent a year and commercial traffic by 4 percent
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The authority said last month it needed tolls to be raised by up
to 3 percent a year to generate $216 million more for improvements
to the superhighway and other transportation facilities over the
next five years. With Gov. George Pataki and the chief leaders of
the state Legislature coming out against a toll hike, Thruway
administrators later withdrew the toll hike plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the Thruway first proposed its toll increase, I said
there wasn't justification for the level of increase they wanted,''
McCall said Tuesday. ''Here's the proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Thruway officials have defended their revenue projections,
saying a projected falloff in traffic is one of the chief reasons
why they need to embark on an expansion and repair program.
</P>
<P>
   Terry O'Brien, a Thruway Authority spokesman, said the agency is
basing its estimates on ''sound, conservative revenue
projections.'' Because of Thruway traffic increases over the past
decade, there are congestion overloads at certain times on some
stretches of the roadway which will hinder traffic expansion,
O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worst thing we can do is to sit out our hands and do
nothing,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   McCall insisted Tuesday that the Thruway Authority's traffic
expansion figures are not compatible with economic projections from
Pataki, who appointed the board of the Thruway Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor is predicting a much stronger economy than what
appears to have been incorporated in the Thruway forecast,'' said
McCall, a Democrat who may be the Democratic challenger to the
Republican governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the state Assembly have proposed taking the
operation and maintenance of the state canal system away from the
Thruway Authority and returning them to the state's general fund.
That means all taxpayers, and not just tollpayers on the Thruway,
would bear the cost of keeping up the canal system.
</P>
<P>
   It costs the Thruway Authority between $55 million and $60
million a year to maintain the canal system, which includes
remnants of the historic Erie Canal.
</P>
<P>
   McCall also said the Authority does not need to turn over two
other stretches of non-toll superhighway it also maintains --
Interstate 287, the Cross-Westchester Expressway, and Interstate 84
between the Connecticut and Pennsylvania lines -- to another state
agency as a cost-saving move.
</P>
<P>
   Thruway administrators have not endorsed divesting any
non-Thruway holdings to other state agencies but they have insisted
that the renovation and expansion program is necessary to keep the
highway safe and productive.
</P>
<P>
   Thruway officials say this year's toll increase, tied to a
multi-city construction cost index under the Authority's proposal,
would have been 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even with that increase, the Authority said the tolls on its
roadway would still be among the lowest for toll highways in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Minority Leader John Faso, a Columbia County
Republican who early on championed the idea of the Thruway
Authority giving up the state canal system, said Tuesday that
McCall's analysis was flawed. He argued it did not take into
account the cost to the Authority of higher interest payments when
the Thruway borrowed money due to what Wall Street has perceived as
its added exposure to risk because of the canal.

<HEADLINE> Pataki to propose wide-ranging gun-control legislation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki will call today for
mandatory trigger locks to be installed on all guns sold in New
York and insist that ballistic ''fingerprints'' be made by
manufacturers of all firearms marketed here.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he will also call for the minimum age for handgun
purchases in New York to go from 18 to 21, for a ban on assault
weapons and for instant background checks to be made of gun buyers
at flea markets and gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''At a crime scene people don't leave the gun very often but
they do leave bullets or shell casings,'' Pataki told ABC News
Tuesday night, ''and what we would have now is a tool where the
police could check the ballistic DNA of that bullet or shell casing
against every gun that would be sold here in New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki scheduled a news conference today in New York City to
formally propose the legislation, as well as an appearance on ABC's
''Good Morning America'' to outline the bill. His aides Tuesday
night refused to say more about the governor's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's legislation would require gun makers to fire all guns
before they are sold so that the telltale markings the barrels make
on bullets can be recorded. That information -- likened to
fingerprints in humans -- would be stored in a state computer which
authorities could use to match against bullets and shell casings
found at scenes of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of
bullet samples for the government, contending that it is a
preliminary step toward national gun registration. A spokesman for
the NRA did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment on
Pataki's pending legislation Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   All the provisions the Republican governor will propose have
been supported in the past in some form by the Democrat-dominated
state Assembly in New York. But the Republican state Senate,
despite proposals from some of its majority members from New York
City and its suburbs, has not approved any of the anti-gun
measures.
</P>
<P>
   John McArdle, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno, said Republicans have been ''looking'' at various gun
provisions for years. In some cases, Republicans have been trying
to determine whether federal gun legislation would supersede what
the Legislature could do on a state level, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have not been given details of Pataki's
impending legislation, McArdle said, but would review whatever the
governor sent them.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he knows his legislation would put him out of step
with Republicans nationally, who generally oppose too-stringent
anti-gun measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately if you think it's the right thing you have to
pursue it,'' he told ABC News. ''I'm hoping we can get this through
the Legislature.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Republicans propose $2.5 billion road, bridge bond act  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Approval by one chamber of a new $2.5
billion borrowing proposal and by the other of new ''tax-free''
development zones will be among the highlights of today's expected
passage by the state Legislature of budget resolutions for New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption by the Democrat-dominated Assembly and
Republican-controlled Senate of budget resolutions for the 2000-01
spending package will be largely symbolic acts on the road toward
passage of a new state budget.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Republicans Tuesday proposed placing the bond act
before voters this November, with the proceeds going for highway
and bridge improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno acknowledged that the state
is already in too much debt, but he said it was nevertheless proper
to bond for $2.5 billion to pay for transportation construction and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public understands that it is appropriate to bond out,''
Bruno said. ''Why? Because you'll use the roads and bridges for the
next 20, 30, 40, 50 years. So why should the public this year pay
for roads they're going to use for the next 40 years?''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans said the bond act proposal would be included in
their resolution advocating the spending of about $77 billion in
the 2000-01 fiscal year, or what Bruno said would be about $500
million more than Gov. George Pataki proposed spending in January.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the Democrats who dominate the Assembly said their
budget resolution -- also to be approved in that chamber today --
would include $85 million in tax cuts in the next fiscal year. The
tax cuts would total $750 million when fully implemented in four
years. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said Democrats would wait
until today to reveal the bottom line on how much their budget
resolution proposes spending.
</P>
<P>
   And, Pataki said Tuesday he would like to increase from $750
million to $1.25 billion the amount of surplus state funds New York
applies to reducing debt in the fiscal year beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said the proposed bond act would be designed to bring the
size of the overall five-year plan for bridge- and highway-building
in New York to $16.5 billion, or to precisely what the new
five-year capital plan for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority advocates spending.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno said there has been parity historically between spending
on MTA transit facilities in the New York City region and on
bridges and highways.
</P>
<P>
   If placed before voters, the $2.5 billion borrowing proposal
would be the largest in New York since 1988, when New Yorkers
approved a $3 billion road- and bridge-building plan.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent bond act proposal, a $2.4 billion plan for
school construction, was defeated in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The specific highway and bridge projects to be funded through a
new bond act would be agreed to by Bruno, Silver and Pataki before
going to voters, according to the Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said Tuesday he had not seen the Senate proposal and was
waiting for details.
</P>
<P>
   The bond act proposal was only one of several budget-related
initiatives Tuesday in Albany:
</P>
<P>
   --Senate Republicans proposed a $400 million tax cut in the next
fiscal year, including a previously announced plan to eliminate the
state's 4 percent sales tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. The Senate
plan would total $1.9 billion when fully implemented in four years.
The Republicans said they would spend $875 million more on public
school education than in the current fiscal year or $520 million
more than Pataki has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate budget resolution would expand the maximum Tuition
Assistance Program college grant from $4,150 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   --Assembly Democrats advanced a more modest tax-cut plan. Much of
the $85 million would go to a two-month suspension of the state's
gasoline tax to encourage motorists to vacation in New York this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno called the Assembly tax-cut plan ''paltry,'' at least in
the first year, while Silver suggested the Senate wants to cut
taxes far more deeply than the state can afford.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly will propose turning state Economic Development
Zones into ''tax-free'' zones, with state aid focused on
encouraging businesses in economically disadvantaged parts of the
states.
</P>
<P>
   --Pataki's debt-reduction plan would apply $1 billion toward
reducing debt in the 2000-01 fiscal year, with the rest going to
offset debt in the 2001-02 fiscal year. Debt can be cut by funding
some programs on a pay-as-you-go basis instead of bonding for it,
and by refinancing particularly high-cost obligations at lower
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Approval today of the Senate and Assembly majorities' budget
resolutions could set the stage for the appointment of conference
committees to work out differences.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and the governor have failed to pass a budget by the
April 1 start of a new fiscal year for 15 straight years.

<HEADLINE> Lightning 4, Canadiens 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Fredrik Modin scored twice and Vincent
Lecavalier added his 20th goal as the lowly Tampa Bay Lightning
ended a seven-game losing streak Tuesday night with a 4-3 victory
over the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   After losing captain Saku Koivu for the rest of the season with
a knee injury Saturday night, Montreal also lost center Trevor
Linden with broken ribs. Linden scored his 13th goal on the
Canadiens' first shot at 2:51 of the first to tie it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Linden was hurt when he was wrestled to the ice by Lightning
defenseman Pavel Kubina midway through the first period. Kubina
fell on top of Linden in the Tampa Bay crease.
</P>
<P>
   Modin ended a 10-game scoring drought at 3:56 of the third when
his snap shot from outside the blue line tipped off the top of
goalie Jeff Hackett's glove and fell over the line to give Tampa
Bay a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning, with only 46 points, have the NHL's second-worst
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, who have dropped two straight, wasted a chance to
improve their playoff positioning. Montreal is in a seventh-place
tie with Pittsburgh, just one point ahead of Carolina and the New
York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Zholtok scored his 22nd at 5:05 of the third to draw the
Canadiens within 3-2, but Modin added his 19th goal at 14:03 and
the Lightning won for just the fifth time in 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Stevenson cut the deficit to 4-3 at 17:44.
</P>
<P>
   Lecavalier, the first pick overall in the 1998 draft, redirected
Mike Johnson's shot off his skate at the edge of the Montreal
crease to put Tampa Bay ahead 2-1 just 5:39 in.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martins deflected defenseman Jassen Cullimore's shot past
Hackett at 1:43 to give the Lightning a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning goalie Dan Cloutier was taken to the hospital for
observation after he was struck in the side of the neck by a
Dainius Zubrus slap shot early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Parent stopped 17 of 18 shots after replacing Cloutier.

<HEADLINE> Suns 107, Timberwolves 100  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Penny Hardaway scored a game-high 26 points and
the Phoenix Suns hit 24 fourth-quarter free throws to beat the
Minnesota Timberwolves 107-100 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway was 12-for-12 from the line for the Suns, who won for
the sixth time in seven games and kept pace with San Antonio in the
Western Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix trails the Spurs by a half-game for fourth place and
home-court advantage in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were a season-high 43-of-49 from the free-throw line,
including 24-of-27 in the fourth quarter. Three Timberwolves fouled
out as Minnesota was whistled for 34 fouls, 16 in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson added 24 points, five capping a 9-0 run that gave
the Suns their first lead since midway through the first quarter.
Rodney Rogers had 16 points for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Brandon led the Timberwolves with 18 points, but was
held scoreless over the final 21 minutes. Kevin Garnett missed 10
of his first 13 shots and finished with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   Malik Sealy and Wally Szczerbiak each had 13 for Minnesota,
which saw its franchise-record five-game road winning streak end.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns went more than three minutes without a field goal
midway through the fourth quarter, but converted 11 straight free
throws to take control.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was fouled by Szczerbiak while shooting a 3-pointer and
hit all three free throws to give Phoenix an 86-82 lead with 6:01
left. Szczerbiak made consecutive baskets to tie the game, but the
Suns went on a 10-0 run -- all but two coming from the free-throw
line -- to take a 96-86 lead with 2:42 left.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix shot 40.9 percent from the floor in the first half, but
trailed only 51-47 with the help of some uncharacteristically
sloppy play by the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which entered the game averaging an NBA-low 13.8
turnovers per game, gave the ball away 10 times in each half.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Peeler converted a three-point play as Minnesota
stretched its lead to 58-53 with 8:54 left in the third quarter.
Robinson rallied the Suns, scoring off a tip-in and adding a
3-pointer as Phoenix took a 62-58 lead with 6:50 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's 3-pointer was one of only two for the Suns on 13
attempts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Suns have won 11 of their last 12 home games. ...
Phoenix, which won the first 25 meetings between the teams and 27
of the first 28, beat Minnesota for just the sixth time in the last
14 games. ... Garnett has averaged 14.3 points (19-for-58), 8.7
below his season average, in the Timberwolves' three games against
Phoenix this season. ... Suns guard Rex Chapman (back spasms) did
not dress. Chapman has missed 10 games this season through injury
or suspension. ... Timberwolves forward Sam Mitchell missed his
13th straight game with a sprained left ankle.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Clinch Party Nominations  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, and
<TEXT>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush clinched their
presidential nominations in a sweep of Southern primaries Tuesday
night, ensuring a bare-knuckles November matchup that quickly
turned contentious.
</P>
<P>
   With both candidates securing delegate majorities needed to lead
their parties' tickets, Bush predicted victory in the fall and
tried to chain Gore to President Clinton's scandals. ''He can't
distance himself from the president when, for eight years, he's
served as cheerleader-in-chief,'' the Texas governor told
supporters, American and Texas flags serving as a colorful
backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told The Associated Press that voters will soon get ''a
choice between keeping prosperity going or going back to the
Bush-Quayle days of gigantic budget deficits and paralyzed
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Their chief rivals vanquished less than a week ago, the Southern
sons of political patriarchs racked up huge victories in Florida,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas and Louisiana. Exit
polls exposed weaknesses of both general election candidates: Gore
supporters were not as motivated as Bush's, while Texas Republicans
reported little progress on education under Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Saying Americans have ''caught on'' to Gore's political tactics,
including questionable fund-raising in 1996, Bush said, ''Al Gore
can't solve campaign finance problems when he symbolizes them. He
can't talk about rebuilding the military when his administration
has dismantled our military.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore rattled off a laundry list of issues he would address,
including education, health care, Social Security, Medicare and the
national debt. And he suggested that Bush is beholden to his
party's right wing, warning that the Texan would give anti-abortion
evangelical leaders Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell a ''working
majority'' on the Supreme court.
</P>
<P>
   ''This election is a fork in the road. I represent one
direction. He represents another,'' Gore told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Gore addressed supporters in Florida, a general election
battleground and home of Bush's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush. Bounding on
stage to Tina Turner's ''Simply the Best,'' the vice president
said, ''We've got to move into the fall election strong and united
and ready for what's going to be a very tough fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who once claimed to have invented the Internet, e-mailed
Bush and said Democrats won't air TV ads purchased with unlimited,
unregulated donations called ''soft money'' unless Republicans do
so first. After expensive primary fights, both parties are planning
ad campaigns to help their nominees.
</P>
<P>
   An AP analysis showed that Bush's delegate count would reach
1,093, and Gore's would reach at least 2,530 -- far more than
required.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm humbled with the knowledge that I am a step closer to
assuming the highest office in the land,'' Bush told the AP in a
telephone interview from Texas. He is the son of former President
Bush. Gore's father was a longtime Tennessee senator with
unfulfilled White House ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley abandoned their
campaigns Thursday, ending an exciting primary season that tested
the front-runners and spurred record-breaking voter turnout. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes remained on GOP ballots, but was not a threat
to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With suspense drained from the race, turnout was low Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'm just going to have to vote for Gore, though I'm
not really happy about it,'' said Dennis McHale, a Democrat from
New Orleans who was drawn to the polls by a city council election.
</P>
<P>
   In a hopeful sign for the Republican candidate, exit polls
suggested that Bush ran stronger among Democratic voters than Gore
did among GOP voters. Just 6 percent of voters in Republican
primaries said they would for Gore in November; twice as many
Democrats said they would defect to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's home state of Tennessee, Republicans showed an intense
dislike of their native son: only 4 percent of the GOP voters said
they would vote for the vice president in November, and more than
80 percent had an unfavorable opinion of their one-time senator.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, half the Republicans as well as half the Democrats
said Bush was more conservative as presidential candidate than he
was in 1998, when he won a landslide re-election as governor. As
Bush tries to campaign on his education record, nearly half of
Texas Republicans said the governor had produced no meaningful
school reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, Bradley was taking nearly three in 10 votes,
running particularly strongly among whites, conservatives and the
poorest voters. Those Bradley voters said they favored Bush over
Gore in November, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polling was conducted by Voter News Service, a
consortium of the AP and television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Both nominations become formal when the major parties conduct
conventions in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore and Bush cast ballots for themselves in their home
states, Bush's parents voted for their son in Houston. The elder
Bush had trouble expressing his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets down to family and how lucky we are,'' the former
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Politics runs in both families. Gore is the son of the late Sen.
Albert Gore Sr., a critic of the Vietnam War and early convert to
civil rights who lost his Tennessee seat in 1970. The elder Gore
once bragged that his son was raised to succeed in presidential
politics.

<HEADLINE> First Somali TV on Air Since 1991  </HEADLINE>
By OSMAN HASSAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- For the first time since civil war
broke out nearly a decade ago, Somalis can tune in to local
television stations and watch programming in their own language.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Somali Television Network became the second
private station to broadcast local content programming.
HornAfrique, the first, went on the air March 3.
</P>
<P>
   In this nation in the Horn of Africa that has been plagued by
clan-based fighting since President Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted
in 1991, the advent of two private TV stations is another sign that
despite continuing insecurity, things are improving in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are being motivated by the desperate need of the people for
a Somali-speaking television,'' said Ali Iman Sharmarkeh, head of
HornAfrique Media.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our main target is the common people who don't speak any
foreign language. We are bringing programs speaking about the
Somali culture, tradition, religion and needs of Somalis.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 10 million Somalis are Muslim, and they all speak
Somali.
</P>
<P>
   Abdurahman Robleh Ulayereh, STN's managing director, said Monday
his 22-channel station will offer Somalis more for their money than
the six-channel HornAfrique -- and at a much lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   HornAfrique, a $1 million investment by 11 local and expatriate
Somali businessmen, offers two Somali-speaking channels, an
international sports program and three Arabic-language channels
from Arab Sat, the Saudi-based satellite operation. It costs $150
to subscribe and obtain reception equipment, and there is a $10
monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   The station now only serves Mogadishu, which has a population of
about 1.5 million. But there are plans to expand the network.
</P>
<P>
   STN will charge subscribers $60 for an antenna and then give
them six months of free programming, including one Somali channel,
BBC World, The Discovery Channel, two Indian channels and others in
French, English and Arabic. After that, there will be a $5 monthly
fee.
</P>
<P>
   Ulayereh said 650 subscribers had already signed up.
</P>
<P>
   STN officials declined to discuss the amount of their investment
and how many investors are involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia's last pre-war television station, the government-run
National Television Co., collapsed when fighting engulfed Mogadishu
in January 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The HornAfrique Media group was launched last year and since
January has been operating the country's first independent FM radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   Sharmarkeh said the company was created after the group carried
out a feasibility study that showed investing in the electronic
media could be profitable in Somalia. He called TV ''more
profitable than we ever expected,'' and said 200 subscribers had
signed up during the first week of broadcasting. He said the
network would also sell commercial space.
</P>
<P>
   There are also dozens of newspapers published in Mogadishu, but
they tend to be allied to one or another of the clan leaders and
are devoted mainly to politics.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no reliable economic statistics out of Somalia
since the collapse of the government, and it is impossible to know
what the average per capita annual income is now. But although most
Somalis are poor farmers and herders, there are many successful
traders and importers in urban areas who do a brisk business in
exporting goats, camels and fish to the Gulf States.
</P>
<P>
   But one Mogadishu businessman predicted the private networks
will have a difficult time financially because there is no culture
of commercial television in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   ''TV has always been a government activity aimed at promoting
its policies ... or one of companies in developed countries who
might make money through advertisement,'' said Abdulkarim Ali
Hambeh. ''But in Somalia, none of the largest companies can
understand the use of advertising.''

<HEADLINE> Pacific Stock Exchange To Merge  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In a move that could signal the future of U.S.
stock markets, the Pacific Stock Exchange plans to close its two
West Coast trading floors and merge with electronic marketplace
Archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Tuesday represents the first time a
traditional U.S. stock exchange will discard the centuries-old
practice of completing stock trades face-to-face auction-style on a
trading floor in favor of a fully electronic system.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership also signals the first combination in the United
States between a bricks and mortar exchange and a so-called
electronic communications network, or ECN, where trades are matched
entirely by computer without interference by middlemen. European
exchanges have been gradually shifting to electronic trading
platforms for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The 118-year-old Pacific Exchange, which operates trading floors
in San Francisco and Los Angeles, is the fourth largest U.S. stock
market, though its average trading volume of 23 million shares a
day accounts for just a tiny fraction of the total U.S. volume.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, average daily volume on the New York Stock
Exchange is about 1 billion shares, while daily volume on the
Nasdaq Stock Market regularly exceeds 2 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Archipelago, which trades some 50 million shares a
day, is the second largest ECN behind Instinet.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Exchange will become a full partner in Archipelago,
along with several large brokerage firms, including Goldman Sachs
and Merrill Lynch. No other details of the agreement were released.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Exchange Chairman Philip DeFeo said he expects the new
''virtual marketplace'' to be in operation by the end of the year,
pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. An SEC
spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   DeFeo said that the exchange would close its San Francisco and
Los Angeles exchange floors but didn't offer a time frame. He said
the new electronic exchange will be able to absorb many of the 78
floor traders whose jobs will be eliminated when the floors close.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Laurent, 30, a specialist at the exchange, welcomed the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad we're moving forward. We're not sitting on our hands
waiting to have our jobs eliminated,'' said Laurent, whose job is
to create an orderly market by bringing buyers and sellers
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be more much fluid,'' he added. ''Definitely, with the
larger stocks, customers are going to be getting better prices and
more efficient, timely reports.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Exchange's stock options trading business won't be
affected by the merger, DeFeo said.
</P>
<P>
   Stock market analysts said the proposal doesn't immediately
threaten the NYSE because the Big Board's auction system remains
the most efficient place to complete large, complex trades.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ''the NYSE should think long and hard about
this,'' said Charles Jones, a Columbia University business
professor who studies the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   All of the traditional stock markets are scrambling to fend off
competition from the upstart ECNs, whose quick and low-cost trading
systems have already siphoned off nearly one-third of the volume in
Nasdaq traded stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the key to the agreement between the Pacific Exchange
and Archipelago is that it will allow the ECN access to large and
actively traded stocks listed on the NYSE. ''Make no mistake, it's
the ability to trade NYSE stocks that's driving this partnership,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the stocks currently traded on ECNs are listed
on the computerized Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   ECNs want access to NYSE stocks because the electronic networks
make their money based on the number of trades they complete, and
the NYSE is home to many of the most actively traded stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Exchange and the other so-called regional exchanges
in Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago can trade NYSE stocks through
an electronic network that links those exchanges with the NYSE.
Archipelago will have access to that link if the merger is
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Archipelago Chairman Gerald Putnam said the new market's trading
system will operate over technology created by Archipelago and
regulated under a structure already in place at the Pacific
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to the NYSE and the Nasdaq, the Pacific Exchange plans
to remake itself as a for-profit company with an independent
regulatory unit. Those plans will not change under the merger
proposal.

<HEADLINE> GM Quits Global Warming Lobby Group  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Environmentalists are claiming victory following
General Motors Corp.'s decision to quit a lobbying group that has
led the opposition to a 1997 global warming treaty reached in
Kyoto, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler Corp. withdrew earlier.
</P>
<P>
   GM notified the Washington-based Global Climate Coalition on
Monday that it was ending its membership, GM spokesman Bill Noack
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''GM's withdrawal ... makes me hopeful that opposition to real
solutions is in permanent decline,'' said John Passacantando,
executive director of Ozone Action.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the impacts of global warming worsen, it will take
increasing moral maturity on the part of our corporations and
country to rise to the occasion,'' said Sister Patricia Daly of the
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. ''General Motors'
departure from the global warming skeptics is a step towards
achieving this maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   GM remains opposed to the Kyoto agreement but acknowledges that
carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere could be changing the
world's climate.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal ''really doesn't reflect any change in our
position,'' Noack said from Washington. ''We continue to oppose the
Kyoto Protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   After the GM announcement, coalition Executive Director Glenn
Kelly said the group was restructuring and individual companies no
longer could join. Instead, he said membership would consist only
of trade associations.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
greenhouse gas emissions -- mainly carbon dioxide from automobiles,
factories and power plants.
</P>
<P>
   If ratified by the U.S. Senate, the climate treaty would require
that the United States reduce greenhouse emissions to below 1990
levels by 2008-2012.
</P>
<P>
   Noack said the decision to leave the coalition was a strategic
one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our company has taken more of a global focus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford quit the coalition in December, and DaimlerChrysler
followed in January.
</P>
<P>
   When it left, DaimlerChrysler cited possible evidence of global
warming. Ford said the coalition had become an impediment to
pursuing environmental initiatives in a credible way.
</P>
<P>
   Other major companies that have left the group include British
Petroleum, Shell Oil and Dow Chemical.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Global Climate Coalition said its
reorganization was ''part of a long-term initiative to refocus the
public debate on climate policy to the issues at hand -- namely, a
policy contest between the unworkable Kyoto Protocol versus a more
pragmatic and viable solution to the climate issue that relies on
technology, innovation and American ingenuity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kyoto treaty would not impose limits on economically
developing countries such as China and India. Automakers and the
coalition have said that because those countries account for a
significant portion of the world's population, and therefore its
pollution, they also must agree to emissions cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said prospects for the Kyoto treaty look increasingly
bleak, and the coalition believes the best course is one that
emphasizes technology-based solutions to the climate question.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're eager under our new structure to continue working with
the Congress, the administration, and others to continue advancing
those solutions,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Tribune Deal: It's a Family Affair  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Like other parts of the media industry,
newspaper companies have been consolidating rapidly in order to
build their clout in an increasingly competitive business. But the
boardroom coup that led to the Tribune Co.'s purchase of Times
Mirror Monday showcases a major difference that still sets
newspaper publishers apart from the rest of the media world: family
control.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Chandler family, which controlled the Los
Angeles Times for more than a century, had been scaling back direct
involvement since Otis Chandler retired as publisher in 1980, they
continued to wield great behind-the-scenes power with two-thirds of
the company's voting stock.
</P>
<P>
   That's what allowed the Chandlers do an end-run around their
controversial chairman and CEO Mark Willes, who was unaware of the
buyout talks until two weeks ago and will leave the company when
the deal is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a wave of consolidation in the newspaper business, most
of the leading publications -- The New York Times, The Washington
Post, The Wall Street Journal -- continue to have strong control by
families, often through separate classes of stock that have greater
voting power than the shares commonly traded on the market.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of control has long been held up as an important
element of American journalism, allowing publishers to look beyond
the short-term profit concerns to keep an independent voice and
consider issues of editorial integrity and community service.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it's no surprise that the decline of family ownership and
control in recent years has been bemoaned by many industry
observers as a worrisome trend. Some are already seeing the
Chandlers' $6 billion deal to sell Times Mirror to Tribune in the
same light.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion piece for Tuesday's Wall Street Journal entitled
''American Journalism Loses Another Family,'' Duke journalism
professor Susan E. Tifft wrote: ''Newspapers need leadership that
looks beyond the bottom line. And family owners are more likely to
provide that kind of leadership than are corporate behemoths
obedient to the quarterly whip of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other examples of family operations which have sold their
newspapers:
</P>
<P>
   --Chronicle Publishing Co., owned by the descendants of founder
M.H. de Young, sold the San Francisco Chronicle last year to Hearst
Corp., publisher of the rival San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   --The Daniels family sold The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh to The
McClatchy Co. in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Still, opinions are divided on the issue of whether family
ownership is still a must-have for good newspapers. In fact,
Tribune has a strong reputation with leading papers such as the
Chicago Tribune, but it has no major family ownership or control.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the mere fact of family ownership does not guarantee
that a newspaper will rise above its peers, says Ben Bagdikian,
former dean of the journalism school at the University of
California, Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ''Historically, there have been many unexceptional ones that
were family-owned,'' Bagdikian said. ''But all of the exceptional
ones have been family-owned, so it does make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times, the flagship of Times Mirror, has been on
both sides of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Otis Chandler, the Times publisher from the 1960s through 1980
built the Times into a respected national newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Willes, the former cereal company executive hired in 1995, was
accused of boosting profits at the expense of good journalism.
</P>
<P>
   He closed profit-poor newspapers like New York Newday and The
(Baltimore) Evening Sun.
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to generate new revenue by pulling down the
traditional wall between the news and advertising departments.
</P>
<P>
   That drew sharp criticism from advocates of journalistic
independence, which culminated last year when The Times agreed to
share advertising revenue with The Staples Center sports arena, the
subject of a special section in The Times' Sunday magazine.

<HEADLINE> Tribune Went Around Times Mirror CEO  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Merger talks between Times Mirror and The
Tribune Co. were rekindled in January after an initial overture
last spring went nowhere, a former Times Mirror executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Tribune made its first inquiry in May with Times
Mirror chief executive Mark Willes, who briefly discussed it with
the board before the issue was dropped, said Tom Unterman, Times
Mirror Co.'s former chief financial officer who is now advising the
controlling Chandler family through the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Co. executives then decided to go around Willes and
speak directly to the Chandler family, which has operated the
flagship Los Angeles Times for more than a century and controls
about 65 percent of Times Mirror stock.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first discussions were in January over lunch'' in Los
Angeles, Unterman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Willes didn't find out about the negotiations until two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly $6 billion deal, which requires shareholder
approval, will create the nation's third largest newspaper company.
Diversified operations of the new company will include 22
television stations and Internet news sites that will attract 3.4
million visits a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that Camilla Chandler
Frost, one of seven trustees of the two Chandler Trusts, said many
on the Times Mirror board were becoming ''disillusioned'' with
Willes' leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members were unhappy with Willes' concentration on
the company's core newspaper business, feeling Times Mirror needed
to diversify into other media to remain profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not doing what we should be doing -- looking toward the
future,'' Frost said. ''Everything we had that wasn't absolutely
core was sold off.''
</P>
<P>
   Unterman said the family opted to merge largely because of
Tribune's extensive holdings in electronic media. The decision had
little if anything to do with the controversy over the newspaper's
profit-sharing arrangement with the downtown Staples Center sports
arena, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Diversification in media type was an issue in the Chandler
family's mind and a plus as an investor,'' Unterman said. ''I think
for every one of them, the No. 1, 2 and 3 reason was the fit and
the strategic importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Unterman said he and Willes were part of a small group of people
who knew of Tribune's initial approach last May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mark and I knew, but I don't think anybody else at Times
Mirror knew,'' said Unterman, now partner and CEO of Rustic Canyon
Group, a company that manages a venture capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   They told the attorney for the Chandler Trust, and then Willes
discussed it briefly in June with the board, which at the time
chose not to pursue it, Unterman said. At the time, Times Mirror
stock had more than doubled since the day Willes took over in June
1995, closing at more than $58 a share on the last day of trading
in May.
</P>
<P>
   Willes has said he was surprised when he heard about the recent
negotiations because he believed the paper could not be sold or
merged under the terms of the Chandler family trust.
</P>
<P>
   That impression made the offer last spring ''a difficult thing
to pursue,'' Unterman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't language in the trust that forbids it (selling).
There's a sense that they wouldn't do it,'' Unterman said. ''It
required unanimity of all the trustees, and there were some
trustees on record as saying they would never do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what changed their mind.
</P>
<P>
   A message left for Times Mirror on Tuesday was not returned, and
members of the Chandler family could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The family will continue to have a say in the Times' fortunes.
An expanded Tribune Co. board gives four seats to the Chandlers,
who also will have 40 percent of the membership on a new Los
Angeles Times board.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandlers likely concluded that the time was right to sell
because newspaper properties are in demand but might not be in the
near future, said John Morton, president of a Silver Spring, Md.,
media consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's greater risk that newspaper values will decline than
they will rise,'' he said. ''How that turns out depends on how the
Internet develops.''

Nominations Clinched, Bush With Advantage
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush holds a slight advantage among likely
voters in a new poll in the presidential race against Al Gore, as both
presidential candidates clinched their party's nominations in the southern
primaries Tuesday. Bush is also drawing more of the John McCain supporters that
both he and Gore are aggressively trying to attract, according to the CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll released Tuesday. The Texas governor has 49 percent to 43
percent for Gore. Other recent polls have shown the race very close or with the
vice president slightly ahead, but many of them polled registered voters.
Narrowing the poll to likely voters often improves the numbers of the Republican
candidate.

Tuesday. The bodies were found Monday along a highway near the town of Cahuita,
about 90 miles east of San Jose, the capital, said Jesus Urena, a spokesman for
the Public Security Ministry. Costa Rican officials identified the victims as
Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky., and Emily Eagen of Detroit. The women were
driving a sports utility vehicle when the attack occurred, said a police
spokeswoman. The officials said one had been shot twice in the head and the
other three times in the back, and that one was nude and the other

Two of main organizers pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit insider trading
and other charges. Richard Walker, director of enforcement for the Securities
and Exchange Commission, called the case ''one of the most elaborate insider
trading schemes in history.'' The Internet figured so prominently in the scheme
that U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White and the commission noted that the case was the

elections. Riot squads stood ready to protect the exchange and stock brokers
fled out the back door of the building after the market's general index dropped
6.6 percent, or 320.90 points, to close at 4542.65 -- its lowest point since
August. ''I lost not only my money, but the money of my clients who will one day

<HEADLINE> Jones Univ. Drops 'Cult' Statement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Bob Jones University has dropped from its
Web site statements from its president calling Catholicism and
Mormonism cults.
</P>
<P>
   A new message on the site has Bob Jones III recounting how he
contemplated on Christmas Eve ''the growing worldwide hostility
toward the evangelizing efforts of Bible-believing Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   But gone is the ''President's Corner'' message there as late as
March 2 in which Jones said, ''The diminution of evangelistic
enterprise to cults which call themselves Christian, including
Catholicism and Mormonism, is frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   The language was cited after Texas Gov. George W. Bush was
criticized for speaking on campus Feb. 2 to bolster his Republican
presidential campaign. Arizona Sen. John McCain, his top opponent,
made the visit a campaign issue, and Bush later apologized for not
challenging the school's interracial dating ban and anti-Catholic
views.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, Jones lifted the dating ban.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Shamblin, secretary to school spokesman Jonathan Pait, said
the president's message on the Web site comes from the school's
quarterly magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time that comes out (the Web page) is updated and, as I
understand it, they were a couple of issues behind,'' Shamblin
said. ''It's up to date now.''

<HEADLINE> ABC's winning streak hits 11  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Don't look for a repeat of ''Donnie Brasco'' on
NBC anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The gangster movie, coupled with two hours of prime-time NBA
basketball, dragged the network to its lowest ratings for a Sunday
night since Nielsen Media Research began its more precise measuring
system in 1987. Summer rerun season doesn't count in the
tabulations.
</P>
<P>
   In an organized crime face-off, the average audience for
''Donnie Brasco'' was even smaller than HBO's competing episode of
''The Sopranos.'' That's remarkable because HBO, a pay cable
station, is available in roughly one-third the number of homes that
get NBC.
</P>
<P>
   On basic cable, the Discovery Network's ''Raising the Mammoth''
even beat out the Al Pacino movie. The documentary was by far the
highest-rated show in Discovery's 15-year history, with more than
double the audience of the previous best, a 1997 ''Raising the
Titanic'' special.
</P>
<P>
   It was another bad night for the NBA on NBC, which filled two
hours of prime-time Sunday with either a Sonics-Raptors matchup or
Knicks-Spurs. The NBA's ratings are down 27 percent from last year,
and 31 percent from 1998, Michael Jordan's last season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is usually the most-watched night of television during
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Two midseason replacement series -- CBS's ''Grapevine'' and NBC's
''God, the Devil and Bob'' -- are both doing so poorly that they're
not likely to have a long life.
</P>
<P>
   ABC won its 11th week in a row in the ratings, drawing an
average prime-time audience of 14 million people (9.3 rating, 16
share). The three airings of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' were
the week's three most-watched programs.
</P>
<P>
   CBS was second with 11.8 million viewers (8.3 rating, 14 share),
NBC had 9.6 million (6.8, 11), Fox had 8.9 million (5.7, 9), UPN
had 3.7 million (2.6, 4), the WB had 3 million (2.2, 3) and Pax TV
had 1.1 million (0.9, 1)
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ''World News Tonight'' won the evening news ratings race
with 10.5 million viewers last week (7.7 rating, 16 share). NBC's
''Nightly News'' averaged 10 million viewers (7.6, 16), and the
''CBS Evening News'' had 8.2 million viewers (6.3, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of March 6-12, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC,
19.5; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday), ABC, 17.5; ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday), ABC, 17.2; ''60 Minutes,''
CBS, 14.7; ''Friends,'' NBC, 13.9; ''The Practice,'' ABC, 13.4;
''ABC News Special Report: Super Tuesday'' (8 p.m.), ABC, 13.1;
''Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 12.9; ''ABC News Special Report:
Super Tuesday'' (9 p.m.), ABC, 12.0; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,''
CBS, 11.0.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Has 6th Day of Power Outage  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- When the lights go out in Nigeria, as they
often do, diesel generators roar to life in rich suburbs. For the
poor, candles will have to do.
</P>
<P>
   Public hospitals postpone surgery. Government offices shut down.
Africa's most populous nation -- and potentially one of its
wealthiest -- grinds to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   This struggling young democracy had its sixth straight day of
intermittent, nationwide power failures Tuesday, posing a new
threat to stability under President Olusegun Obasanjo's
administration just weeks after Muslim-Christian religious riots
are believed to have taken thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Energy experts said the blackout was worse than the frequent
outages -- called ''lights out'' by Nigerians -- that became
synonymous with the economic collapse during 15 years of rule by
the country's former army dictators.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in the commercial capital of Lagos treated accident
victims in a generator-lighted parking lot Monday night. Because
the power failure means water also stopped flowing, women and
children have been carrying jars and plastic barrels on their
heads, roaming the city in search of water.
</P>
<P>
   The government-owned National Electric Power Authority -- known
unaffectionately by Nigerians as ''Never Enough Power Anywhere'' --
shut down its nationwide network Thursday after thermal power
generating systems in Lagos broke down. An explosion at a
hydroelectric plant in northern Niger State compounded the
company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, furious over the widespread outages, Obasanjo fired
NEPA's entire senior management because of their inability to deal
with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be only one verdict and this is that NEPA has failed
woefully,'' Obasanjo said, announcing the firings. He did not say
how many people would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Energy experts said the worst is yet to come, warning that
Nigeria's fuel and hydroelectric generators are in disrepair and
need to be immediately replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the entire power grid in Africa's energy giant is on
the brink of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government knows what the problem is,'' said Aret Adams, a
Nigerian energy consultant and former senior government adviser.
''Its just a matter of fixing it -- and I'm surprised they haven't
done it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The power outage is seen by many Nigerians as another reason to
grumble that their new democracy, which was elected last year
following the military's 15 years in power, is not moving fast
enough to improve lives.
</P>
<P>
   Although this West African country of 110 million is the world's
sixth largest oil exporter, the wealth is unevenly distributed and
essential services are poor.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has busy freeways and nearly a dozen airlines linking
its bustling, cosmopolitan cities -- but it is also a country of mud
huts, donkey carts and dugout canoes.
</P>
<P>
   Many former military officials illegally enriched themselves
with government revenues while the vast majority of Nigerians lived
in poverty without even basic services. Most government and aid
officials say the gulf between rich and poor fuels existing ethnic,
religious and regional tensions that frequently flare into
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, thousands of people were killed in a chain-reaction of
Muslim-Christian killings sparked by proposals to implement Islamic
law, or sharia, in some northern states.
</P>
<P>
   And while Obasanjo has made a priority of eliminating corruption
and spreading development, so far these goals have been impeded by
bureaucratic wrangling in national and state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Full measures become half measures by the time they go through
the National Assembly,'' Adams said. ''And half measures will not
help Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Nigerians complain the latest power outages are evidence of
the government's inability to act decisively.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital, Abuja, even the grand hallways and meeting
chambers of the National Assembly have been dark during much of the
blackout. Meetings were postponed or canceled.
</P>
<P>
   A NEPA spokesman said Monday the company had received inadequate
funding over the years to maintain its plants, warning that power
failures were likely to persist until a major overhaul was done.
</P>
<P>
   The government asked legislators to approve $120 million for new
thermal stations, radio stations reported Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Supplements May Help Arthritis  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two popular nutritional supplements won't cure
arthritis but might have fewer side effects than traditional
treatments, concludes an analysis of 15 studies published today.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the research on glucosamine and chondroitin
compounds is flawed and probably overstates their benefits so more
study is needed to determine if they really help achy joints,
according to the analysis in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The supplements are marketed as treatments for osteoarthritis,
the degenerative joint disease that afflicts about 21 million
people nationwide. They are sold in health food stores and became
popular after being recommended in a 1997 book, ''The Arthritis
Cure.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, it seems probable that these compounds do have some
efficacy in treating osteoarthritis symptoms and that they are
safe,'' the authors wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy McAlindon, a Boston University rheumatologist and
lead author of the analysis, said his conclusions are ''a little
more positive'' than the ''profound skepticism which has existed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not actively recommending'' chondroitin and glucosamine,
''but I certainly don't discourage people from trying them provided
they're cognizant of the available data,'' McAlindon said.
</P>
<P>
   Both supplements are synthetic versions of body substances that
help build cartilage, the tough tissue that lines the joints.
Laboratory studies have suggested they might promote cartilage
growth, though whether they do in humans remains to be seen,
McAlindon said. The studies he analyzed compared the supplements
with a placebo's effects on pain and mobility rather than measuring
any changes in joints.
</P>
<P>
   The authors evaluated six studies on glucosamine and nine on
chondroitin published between 1966 and 1999. All involved patients
with arthritis in the hip or knee.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the studies showed moderate to large benefits from the
supplements. Chondroitin seemed to be the most effective.
</P>
<P>
   But studies showing the biggest benefits were also the most
flawed, McAlindon said.
</P>
<P>
   Many failed to detail how the authors hid the identity of
substances given to subjects -- a crucial element in
placebo-controlled studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We also found evidence of publication bias,'' McAlindon said,
referring to selective publication of the most positive results.
</P>
<P>
   Most, if not all, of the studies were sponsored in some way by
the supplements' makers.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the most common conventional arthritis treatments
-- aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen -- can cause gastrointestinal
bleeding or liver damage, none of the studies showed significant
side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis is ''an important contribution'' because the
authors deciphered hard-to-interpret studies and provide a useful
assessment of the latest research, said Dr. John Klippel, medical
director of the Arthritis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

<HEADLINE> Black Schools Kept in Loan Program  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government has spared 13 historically black colleges
from being cut from the federal student loan program after the
schools agreed on plans to get students to pay up.
</P>
<P>
   The schools risked losing their ability to take part in the loan
program because of high default rates by their students.
</P>
<P>
   Most steps to be taken involve working with students so they
understand their duty to repay the loans, said Greg Woods, chief
operating officer of the Student Financial Assistance office at the
Education Department in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't know exactly how much money was at stake, but on
Tuesday said the 105 historically black colleges and universities
receive an average of $12 million in grants and student loans.
Funding for the 13 schools would come to roughly $130 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically black schools serve 280,000 students in 20 states,
Washington and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They're attended by about
25 percent of blacks in higher education. A legacy of slavery and
legal segregation, the schools are singled out for their continuing
mission to educate blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 legislation, Congress required any school with a default
rate exceeding 25 percent to be cut automatically from the loan
program. But it exempted historically black colleges and
universities because of their mission. A 1998 amendment ended that
exemption on July.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 16 months, school after school, the 13 institutions
negotiated a default management plan with the government and agreed
to get outside help, such as consultants or advisers, Woods said.
The last agreement was reached a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said many of the schools had already cut their defaults
below 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government's reversal in lifting the exemption caused
concern at Paul Quinn College in Dallas, said Gloria Richard, the
school's vice president for development. The private liberal arts
school with about 740 students was among the 13 required to provide
default management plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden, everyone has to provide our plans for a
situation that was created for us very quickly, and we did,''
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   A report last summer by Sallie Mae, the nation's leading
financer of student loans, said historically black schools could
cut their high rate of student loan defaulters by making sure more
students graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The schools generally have three times more students failing to
repay federal loans than other institutions -- about 21 percent
compared with 7 percent -- the report found.
</P>
<P>
   While black colleges usually offer more open enrollment, they
also suffer from lower retention rates. And unlike other schools,
black colleges tend to lack institutional support, such as large
endowments and other donations, to help students pay for their
educations.

<HEADLINE> Drugs Lower Angioplasty Risk  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- New clot-blocking drugs cut the risk of
serious complications nearly in half after angioplasty and should
be routinely given to the 600,000 Americans who undergo the heart
procedure every year, according to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The leading drug in the new category, ReoPro, is given to the
one-quarter of angioplasty patients who are considered at
especially high risk. Doctors say the main reason it's not more
widely used is the high cost -- about $1,500 for one course of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A new study shows that a similar competing drug, Integrilin, is
highly effective in the three-quarters of patients undergoing
routine angioplasty who do not get ReoPro. The cost is much less,
about $400 per patient, partly because ReoPro is more expensive to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted at Duke University, found that Integrilin
cuts the risk of death and heart attacks by 40 percent in the first
two days after angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a landmark trial that will change the practice of
cardiology,'' predicted Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Boston's Brigham
and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Angioplasty uses tiny balloons to squeeze open clogged arteries
in the heart. Usually, doctors leave behind tiny wire tubes, called
stents, that are intended to keep the arteries from growing shut
again.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study was financed by COR Therapeutics Inc. and
Schering-Plough Corp., which developed Integrilin. Dr. James Tcheng
of Duke presented the results at the annual meeting of the American
College of Cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   Integrilin, ReoPro and Merck &AMP; Co.'s Agrastat are known as
IIB/IIIa platelet inhibitors. All work by slowing the body's
ability to make blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, 2,064 patients at 92 hospitals in the United
States and Canada were randomly assigned to get Integrilin or dummy
infusions during angioplasty with stents. After 48 hours, 5.5
percent of Integrilin patients had died or suffered heart attacks,
compared with 9.2 percent in the comparison group.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have finally eliminated the financial barrier that has
limited use'' of these drugs, Tcheng said, referring to Integrilin.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Elliot Barnathan of Centocor Inc., which makes
ReoPro, said many doctors may prefer to put patients on ReoPro
despite its higher cost, since much longer followup data is
available on the drug's benefits after angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   Barnathan said the latest study ''will make it very difficult
ethically'' for doctors to withhold IIB/IIIa inhibitors from
routine angioplasty patients.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors cannot say which of the drugs is best since they have
not been compared head to head. A comparison study of ReoPro and
Agrastat is under way.
</P>
<P>
   All three must be given by IV infusion. Drug companies are
trying to develop pill forms of the medicines as a substitute for
aspirin in heart patients with serious chest pain. But none so far
has beaten aspirin in large-scale testing.
</P>
<P>
   Four large studies that were combined by Dr. Robert Califf of
Duke showed the death rate in patients given the pills is slightly
higher than people given aspirin alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is worse than disappointing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other studies presented at the meeting Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   --About half of all heart attack patients routinely get
angioplasty after heart attacks. Dr. Uwe Zeymer of Klinikum Kassel
in Kassel, Germany, studied 288 patients to see if that reduces the
risk of death and complications. Angioplasty did not significantly
improve patients' outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   --The B vitamin niacin appears to boost the effects of statin
drugs on cholesterol levels. Dr. Moti Kashyap of the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in Long Beach, Calif., tested
Nicostatin -- a combination of niacin and lovastatin -- on 814 men
and women. It increased protective HDL cholesterol by 41 percent
and lowered harmful LDL by 47 percent. Statin drugs are widely used
to lower cholesterol.

<HEADLINE> Viagra-Linked Heart Problems Rare  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Heart problems triggered by Viagra are
extremely rare, suggests an analysis of 82 studies of the popular
anti-impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston said
deaths and heart attacks among Viagra users were about what would
be expected in middle-aged and older men in similar physical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Many men with erectile dysfunction also often have heart
trouble, since both conditions can have the same underlying causes,
such as diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are men with lots of risk factors, and lots of them will
have heart attacks and die, whether or not they are taking
Viagra,'' said Dr. Murray Mittleman. ''We know that sexual
intercourse itself can trigger a heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Mittleman combined study data on 4,497 men who got Viagra and
3,136 who took dummy pills. There were 21 heart attacks or deaths
among the Viagra users and 12 in the comparison group. But the
Viagra users were followed up longer, and when this was factored
into the results, the risk of heart attacks or death was virtually
the same for the two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''These data are reassuring and suggest that treatment of
erectile dysfunction and resumption of sexual activity are not
associated with even a moderate increase in cardiac risk,''
Mittleman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mittleman presented the results Tuesday at a meeting of the
American College of Cardiology. The research was financed by Pfizer
Inc., which makes Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate analysis, Dr. Sanjay Kaul of Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles reviewed reports of ill effects linked to
Viagra that were sent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
between April 1998 and May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 522 deaths were reported among Viagra users. Of these,
200 were heart attacks and 94 were cardiac arrests. Heart attacks
result from clots that cut off blood flow to the heart muscle,
while cardiac arrest is a sudden disruption of the heart's rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Heart patients who take nitroglycerin for chest pain are warned
not to use Viagra, since the combination can trigger a dangerous
drop in blood pressure. Kaul said that 79 of the heart attacks and
deaths were in people using the two drugs together.
</P>
<P>
   Kaul said that most of the Viagra-associated deaths occurred in
men younger than 65 without known risk factors for heart trouble.
But he noted that the FDA reports were incomplete, and many of
these men could have heart-related problems that were not noted in
their case reports.
</P>
<P>
   Kaul also cautioned there is no proof that Viagra actually
caused any of the deaths reported to the FDA. Reports of ill
effects can be sent to the agency by doctors, victims or anyone
else who hears of them.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A burning desire to win enables Garry Kasparov
to be the world's finest chess player. It doesn't matter who the
opponent is -- or for that matter, how old the opponent is --
Kasparov, 36, is always seeking victory.
</P>
<P>
   When facing 30 young chess players during a worldwide Internet
chess tournament, the reigning world champ shuffled from one player
to the next and from computer screen to computer screen, which were
used by 20 of his opponents competing from other countries. His
face rarely displayed any emotion.
</P>
<P>
   But there was plenty of head shaking, chin rubbing and arm
crossing, and in those, parents of the children who were receiving
a drubbing found some solace. Those meant the children had made
moves that propelled Kasparov into deep thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's gotten a couple of head shakes,'' said Richard Zletz, of
Manhattan, about his 13-year-old daughter, Lauren. ''She's gotten
more chin scratches. Chin scratches are good, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But 10-year-old Evan Alvarez's offer of a draw forced some
emotion out of Kasparov.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Excuse me?''' Evan said later.
</P>
<P>
   Kasparov turned down the offer. The two continued the game. Evan
misplayed one of the final moves, and that was it. He had lost.
</P>
<P>
   The moment left Evan, who looked as though he had been punched
in the stomach, with a lesson learned: In the world of chess,
protocol discourages a lesser opponent from offering the draw,
which is the equivalent of a tie. Getting a draw with Kasparov
would have been quite a feat for the 10-year-old, given that the
world champ played the white pieces, enabling him to take the
enviable first attack move.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't do that -- it's a no-no,'' said Marley Kaplan, the
deputy director for Chess-in-the-Schools, a nonprofit organization
that brings chess to children at 160 schools in New York City.
''That made Kasparov mad.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Kasparov's other opponents was able to prevail. Viktoria
Zaks, 12, one of 20 competitors playing via computer, earned a draw
from Israel, where she lives.
</P>
<P>
   The competition, some of which was broadcast from the studio at
Times Square to a giant screen nearby, helped officially launch
KasparovChess.com. The Web site offers live coverage of
international chess matches and gives instruction on all levels.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many kids don't have teachers available, or even someone to
play against,'' said Elizabeth Elman, a spokeswoman for the Web
site. ''This really levels out the field.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the matches, Evan became one of Kasparov's 29
victims, all of whom were teen-agers or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Another Bronx opponent, Daniel Marriomon, had high hopes. He
expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was beating him three-quarters of the way, and then I choked
up and lost,'' said Daniel, 10. ''I had him on the ropes for a long
while. It was like football: I was running 100 yards and I got
close, and then he tripped me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Daniel, Evan was left with what-ifs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a dead draw. I thought he didn't want to play,'' said
Evan, an honor student who placed second in the 1999 national chess
championship for his age division.
</P>
<P>
   David MacEnulty, Evan's chess teacher, acknowledged that his
pupil had erred.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, he is only 10,'' MacEnulty said. ''He hadn't played a
world champion before.''

<HEADLINE> Bid To Keep Vatican UN Seat Begins  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Pro-life and religious groups from around
the world are launching a new campaign in support of the Vatican to
counter efforts to review the Holy See's unique and influential
status at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   As a non-member state with permanent observer status, the
Vatican enjoys many of the same rights and privileges as the 188
countries that are full-fledged U.N. members.
</P>
<P>
   While it has no vote, the Vatican can take active part in U.N.
debates and conferences, where it has made a strong mark in family
planning and abortion issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice
announced it was seeking a formal review of the Holy's See's
status, saying its claim to be a ''state'' was questionable and it
should be treated more like a non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   Such organizations cannot directly negotiate treaties or speak
during formal debates, but must instead lobby individual
governments to incorporate their positions.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-life lobbying group, the Catholic Family and Human Rights
Institute, and other conservative groups were to announce today a
campaign to counter the Catholics for a Free Choice effort.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Ruse, president of the Catholic Family and Human Rights
Institute, said the effort to review the Vatican's status was
clearly intended to quiet the strongest pro-life voice at the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is against one of the founding principles of the U.N.,
where the smallest nation can stand up to the biggest nation and be
treated as an equal,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruse said that in two months, his campaign has garnered
signatures from 1,015 organizations from more than 50 countries,
including the conservative groups Focus on the Family, Concerned
Women for America and the Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is unusual in that it includes evangelical
Protestant groups who long resented recognition of the Vatican as a
sovereign state. Those groups, however, are now lobbying to keep
that recognition to preserve a strong anti-abortion voice at the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, said
her campaign, known as ''See Change,'' had over 400 signatures from
organizations that want to review the Vatican's claim to be a
sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Only Switzerland enjoys the same U.N. status as the Vatican,
while groups representing religions such as the World Council of
Churches are relegated to less influential affiliate status.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have all seen the Holy See misuse a status that it obtained
within the U.N. to some extent by accident,'' Kissling said
Tuesday. The ''See Change'' campaign was not a threat ''to any
legitimate state that sits in the U.N. that may hold positions that
we disagree with,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has spilled into U.S. politics, where nearly identical
resolutions have been introduced in the House and Senate warning
that any degradation of the Holy See's U.N. status would damage
U.S.-U.N. relations.
</P>
<P>
   Kissling said she feared the resolutions could garner more
support than they normally might because of election-year concerns
of alienating Catholics in the wake of the Bob Jones University
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush's failure
to criticize the fundamentalist Christian school's anti-Catholic
statements drew criticism from Democrats and some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. lawmakers may think that supporting the resolutions ''is an
easy way to show that they are indeed not anti-Catholic,'' Kissling
said. ''We think the 60-some million Catholic people of the U.S.
will let them know that support for the Holy See is not synonymous
with support for Catholicism.''

<HEADLINE> Clippers 110, Nuggets 106  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Piatkowski scored a career-high 31
points and Lamar Odom got 13 of his 25 points in the final six
minutes as the Los Angeles Clippers rallied to stun the Denver
Nuggets 110-106 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson added 20 points the Clippers, who rallied from 14
point down in the fourth quarter. They have won back-to-back games
for the first time since late December after ending a 19-game road
losing streak Monday night against Golden State. The win was only
the fourth for Los Angeles in its last 37 games.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McDyess had 31 points and Chris Gatling added 19 for the
Nuggets, who have lost a season-worst seven straight and have
dropped their last 13 road games against Pacific Division
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 92-78 with 10:27 to play, the Clippers outscored Denver
17-9 over the next five minutes. The Clippers capped the rally with
Odom's 3-pointer and driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles got within two points on a 13-footer by Derek
Anderson and Piatkowski's steal led to a three-point play by
Anderson for a 102-101 edge with 3:13 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   George McCloud's 19-footer gave the Nuggets their last lead,
103-102. Anderson made one of two free throws and Odom followed
with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The play that killed the Nuggets was an offensive charge by
McDyess, who earned a technical foul with 1:04 left. Piatkowski
converted the free throw and Odom sank three foul shots in the
final minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets lost despite shooting 57 percent from the field.
They committed 21 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers tied the score at 70 on Maurice Taylor's short
jumper with 5:38 left in the third. The Nuggets responded with a
9-2 spurt that included seven points by Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, the Clippers' second overall pick in the 1995 draft --
he never played a game for them -- converted a three-point play with
three seconds left in the period for an 86-75 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The teams ended the first half tied at 55. After Keon Clark
scored the game's first basket, the Nuggets fell behind by as many
as nine points. They didn't lead again until rookie Chris Herren's
driving layup gave them a 36-35 edge with 7 1-2 minutes left in the
second quarter. Piatkowski, who scored 11 points in the first 5:48
of the game, hit a game-tying 21-footer with seven seconds left in
the half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Nuggets have won only two of their last 44 road games
against Pacific Division teams since Jan. 7, 1997 -- and both
victories have been against the Clippers. ... McCloud, coming off a
season-high 25 points at Orlando, returned to the Nuggets lineup
after serving a one-game suspension for his post-game altercation
with Magic guard Ron Mercer on Saturday night. ... Guard Jeff
McInnis, a former second-round draft pick by the Nuggets whose
second 10-day contract with the Clippers expired on Tuesday, was
re-signed by Los Angeles through the end of next season.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Buy More Drought Insurance  </HEADLINE>
By JESSICA FARGEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLAIR, Neb. (AP) -- Farmer Brent Arp sat in one of two leather
chairs in insurance agent Jim Realph's small office as the two
pored over a piece of paper crowded with percentages, puzzling
acronyms and costs for crop insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Arp had to decide whether the potential risks of a looming
drought were reason enough to pay a higher premium to insure 85
percent of his corn crop instead of 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, one after another -- 10 in all -- visited Realph's office
Tuesday. Eight decided to pay a higher premium and get more
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Arp was an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't feel 85 was in my best interest,'' said Arp, who
farms 1,400 acres of corn and soybeans near Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers have until the end of business today to buy federal
insurance for crops such as corn, oats, sunflowers, soybeans and
millet. And with a large portion of the state in a severe drought
that may continue through the growing season, many farmers are
opting to pay a little more to get a little more security.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a safety net,'' said Realph, who is also a farmer. ''It
provides a farmer with a way to get his expenses back.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Clark, president of Farmers State Bank in Weeping Water,
said the deadline was crunch time for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the March 15 deadline made some of them face up to the
reality that we could have a very dry spring and a very dry
summer,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska last year had one of the driest falls in 105 years,
causing the soil's water reserves to dry out. Eastern Nebraska is
in a severe drought, and long-term forecasts show little chance for
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers are conserving water through less tillage and use
of drought-tolerant crops. Others have increased their crop
insurance coverage or have taken out a policy for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The increased coverage does not come cheap. Realph said crops
covered at 65 percent have a premium of $6.77 an acre. That doubles
at 75 percent and doubles again at 85 percent. Coverage at 85
percent could cost about $26 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Realph guesses about two out of five area farmers do not have
crop insurance.
</P>
<P>
   He does not think being a part of that minority is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the only option they have that's guaranteed,'' Realph
said. ''The rest is faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Arp added, ''Then you rely on Mother Nature to take care of the
rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Crop insurance has been on the rise in the past 10 years, said
John Scherle, spokesman for American Agrisurance in Council Bluffs,
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, there was $13 billion in crop insurance liability
nationwide. That increased to $30 billion by 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Crop insurance has gotten more affordable and the government
increasingly puts more risk management responsibilities in the
hands of farmers, Scherle said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government currently pays from 13 percent to 57
percent of a farmers' premium, depending on the level of coverage.
Under a bill pending in the Senate, the government's share would
range from 45 percent to 60 percent. Under a similar House measure,
the government would pay from 31 percent to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Arp has insured about 70 percent of his crop since the early
1980s, and he has managed to get by just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't do any good to worry,'' Arp said. ''That's why I
have the crop insurance -- for a cushion.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit India, Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When he visits India and Pakistan next week,
President Clinton will have a chance to try personal diplomacy to
persuade the world's two newest declared atomic powers to back away
from the nuclear brink. But getting progress on nuclear reduction
will be a tough sell.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hand was weakened by the Senate's refusal last fall to
ratify an international nuclear test ban treaty that the
administration has been pressing both India and Pakistan to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he wants to have maximum impact, he should not hinge the
trip on nuclear proliferation issues,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback,
R-Kan., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
Near Eastern and South Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said in an interview that he is deeply troubled that
both nations ''are doing missile testing for delivery systems.'' He
thinks the United States lacks the influence to change that
dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than emphasize nuclear politics, Brownback suggested that
Clinton would be better served by trying to ''move aggressively
forward'' in improving economic ties with India and use his stop in
Pakistan to urge a return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told India in a
strongly worded speech Tuesday that ''significant progress'' in
curbing weapons and exports of military technology is necessary for
improved relations between the world's two largest democracies.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling neighbors on the South Asian subcontinent have
been nettlesome to the United States for decades. During the Cold
War, India -- although it maintained a thriving Western-style
democratic system -- generally aligned itself with the Soviet Union
as a buffer against antagonist adversaries China to the northeast
and Pakistan to the northwest. Pakistan, with the warm-water
coastline that Soviet strategists coveted, kept tenuous friendship
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, both Pakistan and India stunned the world with
back-to-back series of nuclear tests, drawing automatic U.S.
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Many were waived in India's case, but sanctions on Pakistan were
intensified with the October coup that brought Gen. Pervez
Musharraf to power.
</P>
<P>
   Both Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Musharraf
reiterated last week that tensions over the disputed Kashmir region
would not lead to a nuclear war. ''There is no possibility,''
asserted Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last spring, the two countries narrowly averted a full-scale
war in Kashmir, which could have escalated to the nuclear level,''
CIA Director George Tenet said in a recent report to Congress.
''Recent changes in government in both countries add tensions to
the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani coup has made New Delhi reluctant to reopen peace
talks. Muslim Pakistan is suspicious of India's newly elected
coalition government, in which Hindu nationalists hold significant
sway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrives Sunday in India, the first visit there by a U.S.
president in 22 years, and will spend the week there except for a
side visit to Bangladesh and a stop in Pakistan on his way home.
</P>
<P>
   India, which enjoys a vast conventional military advantage over
smaller Pakistan, successfully flight-tested its newest
medium-range ballistic missile, the Agni2, in April.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Pakistan flight-tested both its Ghauri medium-range
ballistic missile and the Shaheen-2, a short-range missile. It
again tested the short-range missile last month.
</P>
<P>
   Because each country closely guards information about such
matters, it's hard to know how many warheads and missiles either
India or Pakistan has. But the Institute for Science and
International Security suggests that India has enough nuclear
material to build 40 to 90 nuclear weapons; Pakistan, between 22
and 43.
</P>
<P>
   The Federation of American Scientists has been distributing
high-detail satellite images showing nuclear and missile plants in
various countries. They planned to release one of Pakistan today.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, the program director, said the photographs show
Pakistan has laid groundwork for ''dozens of nuclear-tipped
missiles'' capable of striking Indian targets. Many of them are
clumped together, he said, and would be ''a tempting target for a
pre-emptive Indian attack.'' Pakistan is believed to have at least
30 medium-ranged China-built missiles.
</P>
<P>
   India may have up to 200 missiles, by some counts.
</P>
<P>
   India's ambassador to the United States, Naresh Chandra, told
reporters not to expect major breakthroughs from Clinton's visit or
for India to ask Clinton to ''carry a message'' to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haass, a nuclear security adviser to former President
Bush, said Clinton can hope at best to make some progress toward
getting leaders of both countries to agree to limits on nuclear
exports and perhaps an informal agreement not to conduct further
tests.
</P>
<P>
   But ''these countries are not about to get out of the nuclear
business,'' Haass said.

<HEADLINE> Judges Rule Finances Can Be Released  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coming soon to the Internet: financial
disclosure reports on about 1,600 federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite concerns that such postings could cause security
problems for judges, the U.S. Judicial Conference, the judiciary's
policy-making body, said Tuesday it had reversed a committee's
decision last year to refuse to provide the reports to the Web site
APBnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   APBnews.com sued, and the Judicial Conference, prodded by Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist, voted 16-8 to reverse the committee's
action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this is a victory both for the online public and the
American public,'' Mark Sauter, APBnews.com's chief operating
officer, said. ''It reaffirms the right the public has to see
public documents in the most convenient and expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Judge Ralph Winter of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, who chairs the conference's executive committee, told
reporters ''there is not discretion to deny entirely the reports of
all ... judges simply because they are going to be placed on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Judicial Conference's financial disclosure
committee had said posting the reports, which contain information
on judges' stock holdings, family assets and gifts they receive,
would create a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said that before forms are released judges will be
allowed to ask that security-related information be deleted. After
those issues are resolved, ''I would assume they (APBnews.com) will
get them,'' Winter said.
</P>
<P>
   Sauter said that once his organization receives the reports,
''we intend to put these documents on the Internet as soon as we
possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Sauter said his news site seeks to post the reports to help the
public decide whether judges are properly following conflict of
interest rules that bar them from deciding cases involving
organizations in which they have a financial interest.
</P>
<P>
   APBnews.com will decide whether to withdraw the lawsuit it filed
against the federal judiciary in December when more is known about
the details of the new policy, said Sauter. APBnews.com covers
crime, justice and safety news.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, federal judges and other high-ranking federal
officials have been required by federal law to report all stock
holdings and other family assets within broad ranges of estimated
worth. They also must report gifts and other reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   Federal court officials routinely have made copies of the
reports available to anyone who requests them after requesters
identify themselves and disclose their occupation. But the
conference's committee said in December it would not release the
reports on 1,600 federal judges sought by APBnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   The decision sparked heavy criticism from free-press advocates
who said the decision went beyond the need to protect judges'
safety.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, Rehnquist, who chairs the policy-making
Judicial Conference, sent members a memorandum saying the federal
law requiring judges to file financial disclosure forms allows some
information to be deleted but does ''not seem to support
withholding the reports in their entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice noted that members of Congress and the
executive branch also must file such forms and added that key
members of Congress ''have indicated their intentions to require
all of the reports to be disclosed'' even if it required new
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said judges had legitimate security concerns. Trial
judges in particular ''face often dangerous and often deluded
individuals on a recurring basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They never know when something is going to become
threatening,'' the chief judge added. ''The last three
assassinations occurred without a prior threat.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sending India Mixed Message  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The message President Clinton will take to
India is a mixed one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest democracy in the world has good relations with the
United States. But those ties could be strengthened, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said in a speech Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She urged India to curb development of nuclear weapons and
missiles and its exports of military technology.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking four days before Clinton's departure for South Asia,
Albright said ''significant progress in this area is necessary
before India and the United States can realize fully the vast
potential of our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The message on Pakistan was simpler.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who seized control in a
coup last October, must restore democracy, giving the Pakistani
people ''the ability to choose their leaders sooner rather than
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said Clinton was going to Pakistan because the United
States has important and urgent interest there, especially
controlling the spread of dangerous weapons technology.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to leave no room for doubt,'' she told the Asia
Society. ''In no way is this a decision to embrace the military
coup or government led by Gen. Musharraf. And no one should
interpret it as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip is the first by a president to South Asia since
1978, the longest ever and the first by an American president to
Bangladesh, his first stop.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said India made ''an historic mistake'' in testing
nuclear weapons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While India has the right to make security decisions, she said
''we do regard proliferation -- anywhere -- as our number one
security concern.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Clinton's five-hour stop in Pakistan at the end
of the trip, he intends to spend five days in India, visiting five
cities and several historic sites.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will join Clinton in India after attending a two-day
conference on Europe in Venice, Italy, next weekend sponsored by
the Aspen Institute, a private group. While in Italy, she will meet
with Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
   From India, Albright will fly separately to Geneva on March 23
for a U.N. human rights conference.

<HEADLINE> House Targets FCC Authority  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission's review
of industry mergers would be narrowed in scope and put on a tight
time schedule under legislation drafted by leading
telecommunication lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee's telecommunications panel, and other lawmakers have been
pushing for such language to curtail what they believe is the FCC's
overbroad jurisdiction to determine whether deals serve the public
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC evaluation is separate from the antitrust review
typically conducted by the Justice Department and Federal Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At a Capitol Hill hearing Tuesday, some lawmakers accused the
FCC of using its review process to extract unrelated concessions
from parties to the deals.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are a remarkable exercise in arrogance,'' said Rep. John
Dingell of Michigan, the Commerce Committee's senior Democrat. He
said the FCC identifies potential harms that could result from a
deal, then gets the companies to concede to conditions unrelated to
those harms.
</P>
<P>
   ''There should be a clear nexus between the conditions placed on
a merger and the predicted detrimental effects of the
transaction,'' Dingell said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation drafted by subcommittee member Rep. Chip Pickering,
R-Miss., would restrict the FCC to impose conditions on deals only
to bring them in compliance with FCC rules. The language spells out
that the commission is not to duplicate antitrust considerations
that the Justice Department or FTC have already addressed and sets
the commission on a tight schedule -- two to three months -- to
complete its review.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, who frequently
criticizes the commission's approach to mergers, testified that the
agency is exceeding its narrow authority under the law to review
the transfer between companies of communication licenses.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the FCC review of the merger between Baby Bell
phone companies SBC Communications and Ameritech. As part of
securing approval in the fall, the companies agreed to a
wide-ranging set of conditions, including that they enter markets
they were not already in.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman Bill Kennard, in approving the SBC-Ameritech deal,
said it would help to realize a fundamental goal of a landmark 1996
telecommunications law, which was to promote competition.
</P>
<P>
   In prepared testimony, Kennard said the drafted legislation
would not give the FCC enough flexibility to achieve that end.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bill is, in short, a recipe for making scrutiny of mergers
less public, less flexible and less likely,'' Kennard said. He
added that the FCC has set up its own task force to streamline its
review.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., also stressed that the public
interest standard over the years has helped to open monopoly
markets. The standard also has been used to ensure a diversity of
voices on the nation's airwaves -- even when a deal might not have
triggered traditional worries about concentration, said FCC
Commissioner Michael Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Powell also offered lawmakers some suggestions for improving the
process. He noted that the FCC review puts the onus on companies to
show how a deal would actively benefit consumers. By shifting the
burden to the commission, and adding timeline benchmarks, ''It
corrects a substantial amount of the problem,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee's antitrust panel, and Sen. Herb Kohl of Wisconsin, the
subcommittee's top Democrat, have introduced a companion measure
that would set a six-month limit for the FCC's merger review. That
bill is awaiting floor action.

<HEADLINE> PM-CT--Murder in Greenwich, Conn Bjt, 800  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Dorthy Moxley has waited nearly 25 years
to see her daughter's killer brought to justice. When the Kennedy
cousin accused in the killing faced Mrs. Moxley in court for the
first time, he told her, ''You've got the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel, now 39, was arraigned as a juvenile Tuesday in
the October 1975 killing of Martha Moxley. Both Skakel and Moxley
were 15 at the time of the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   In a simple, four-minute court appearance, Skakel heard the
charge read aloud and was advised of his rights. Skakel was charged
with being a juvenile delinquent ''based on an underlying charge of
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, he stunned the crowded courtroom when he walked
over to Mrs. Moxley, seated in the front row, and told her,
''Dorthy, I feel your pain, but you've got the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moxley did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll find out in court,'' Martha's brother, John, told
Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, John Moxley said Skakel's comment was ''just for
himself -- just theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think for 24 years, they've thought they're above the law,''
he said of the Skakel family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to find out now,'' said Moxley, who was 17 when
his sister was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moxley said Skakel's remark to her sounded rehearsed and
made no difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really feel as though I know what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said trying a
25-year-old case would be difficult, but added: ''We did an awful
lot of work in the case; we developed an awful lot of evidence in
the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's defense lawyer, Michael Sherman, said Skakel's remark
to Mrs. Moxley was sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ''He truly meant that,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael Skakel has no idea who killed Martha Moxley. If he
did, he'd be the first one to tell the state's attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the case is in juvenile court, Skakel gets a
''reasonable cause'' hearing, when prosecutors must prove to a
judge that there is enough evidence to proceed to trial with the
case. That hearing is scheduled for June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., who is the
brother of U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
   The Skakels and the Moxleys were neighbors in an exclusive
enclave in Greenwich, Conn. Martha was beaten to death the night of
Oct. 30, 1975, with a golf club later traced to a set owned by the
Skakels.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, who did not enter a plea during the appearance Tuesday,
has denied any involvement in her death.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's case was reopened after more than two decades when an
investigative grand jury was appointed in June 1998. The
appointment followed the publication of books about the case,
including one by former Los Angeles police Detective Mark Fuhrman.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman, who gained notoriety during the O.J. Simpson trial for
his racist remarks, has been hired by ABC to provide commentary on
the case.
</P>
<P>
   He identified Michael Skakel as the likely killer in his book.
Prosecutors deny that Fuhrman's book had any influence on their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the court session Tuesday, Fuhrman blamed police mistakes
and deference to the wealthy Skakel family for the delay in making
an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''You walk into a house with a chandelier in the foyer that
costs more than your whole house, that's intimidating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of confidentiality laws surrounding juvenile cases,
Skakel's arraignment would normally have been closed to the public.
But Judge Maureen Dennis, acting on a request from five newspapers
and The Associated Press, last week agreed to open the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis found that Skakel had already effectively waived his
juvenile confidentiality rights, both because he is an adult and
because his name and the charges against him are already
well-known.
</P>
<P>
   Although the grand jury proceedings were closed to the public,
prosecutors have said in court documents that they were told by
former students at a private school and substance abuse center in
Poland Spring, Maine, that Skakel made ''admissions as to the
murder of Martha Moxley'' while a student there from 1978 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman called the alleged statements by former students
''garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They're old; they're inconsistent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was arrested in January after Judge George Thim -- acting
as a one-man grand jury -- ruled there was enough evidence to charge
him.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said he expects it will take at least a year for the
case to go to trial. He said he is confident the case will be
transferred to adult court.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 96, Kings 91  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Arvydas Sabonis had 20 points and 16
rebounds as the Portland Trail Blazers, despite going scoreless for
the first 5:13 of the fourth quarter, beat the Sacramento Kings
96-91 on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace added 19 points, Detlef Schrempf 16 and Scottie
Pippen had 10 rebounds for the Blazers, who won their third in a
row and beat the Kings for the 10th straight time.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber had 21 points and 11 rebounds before fouling out
with 15.5 seconds left, and Predrag Stojakovic had 20 points to
lead the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Portland led 74-68 to start the fourth quarter but turned it
over three times in the opening minutes and couldn't find the
basket. A free throw by Vlade Divac gave the Kings a 75-74 lead
with 8:05 to play, but Schrempf's 3-pointer put the Blazers back in
front 77-75.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis had three big defensive rebounds in the next few
minutes, and his 23-foot jumper made it 88-81. Two free throws by
Jon Barry pulled the Kings to 90-87 with 48 seconds left, but they
couldn't get closer.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers had a season-high 59 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   In a wild third quarter, the Kings tied the game at 55, got down
by nine and then pulled close again as the Blazers picked up three
technical fouls -- one each on Sabonis and Wallace and another on
coach Mike Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy was not asked to wear a microphone by TNT, and it was
just as well. When Steve Smith failed to get the ball down low to
Sabonis and instead launched an airball, Dunleavy cursed and kicked
the scorer's table.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Barry drove for an easy layup to pull Sacramento
within 68-66.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams hit his first basket of the game, a 19-footer, to
open the fourth and cut the lead to 74-70. But the Kings could get
only a hook by Webber and three free throws in the next 6:37, and
Portland surged back ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was badly outplayed by Damon Stoudamire, who hit three
long jumpers, including a 3-pointer, early on to put the Blazers
ahead 15-12.
</P>
<P>
   Williams finished with just two points on 1-of-6 shooting,
including 0-for-4 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Delk, playing strong minutes in place of the erratic
Williams, had 12 points and five rebounds. Delk muscled past
Wallace for a layup to cut the lead to 49-48. Portland got a dunk
by Wallace and a finger roll from Schrempf to take a 53-49 halftime
lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sacramento hasn't won in Portland since a 105-102 victory
on Nov. 16, 1995. ... The Kings' Nick Anderson missed his third
straight game with a sore left knee. ... In his last two games
against the Blazers, Williams has four points, six assists and
eight turnovers. ... The Blazers have beaten the Kings 31 of 32
times at home. ... Wallace leads the NBA with 26 technical fouls.

<HEADLINE> 2 US Women in Costa Rica Shot Dead  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC NUNEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A college student on a photography
project and a friend who was visiting her were shot death near a
Caribbean beach town in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky., and Emily Eagen of
Ann Arbor, Mich., were found Monday along a highway near the town
of Cahuita, 90 miles east of San Jose, the capital, said Jesus
Urena, a spokesman for the Public Security Ministry. Both were 19
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said one had been shot twice in the head and the other
three times in the back, and that one was nude and the other
partially nude. Credit cards, clothing and other belongings were
found near the bodies, Urena said.
</P>
<P>
   A sport utility vehicle that had been used by the women was
found burned Monday on a major highway just outside San Jose, said
judicial police spokeswoman Margarita Morales.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no arrests and no word of any suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Warren, dean of students at Antioch College in Yellow
Springs, Ohio, said Howell was a student there who had been in the
Central American nation since January on a photography project.
Eagen was a former student who was visiting her and had been in the
country 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   He said authorities were uncertain about the motive for the
attack. ''It appears to be a random, tragic incident,'' Warren
said.
</P>
<P>
   Howell's roommate was also in Costa Rica but was elsewhere when
the killings occurred, Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a horrible loss and cause for mourning for all of us,''
Warren said. Of Howell, he said: ''She was a wonderful person, very
warm, very caring.''
</P>
<P>
   Eagen's mother, Shirley Eagen, described her daughter's trip as
her ''fling'' before re-entering college as an education major in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no idea how they'd got where they were,'' she told the
Detroit Free Press.
</P>
<P>
   She said the family had researched Costa Rica and believed it
was safe. ''This could have happened anywhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Howell's family attended a private memorial service Tuesday
night. They declined any comment.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy said a consular official had gone to the area
to discuss the case with local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The area is part of Limon province, where five slayings have
occurred so far this month. The region contains a depressed banana
industry and has beaches popular with tourists.

<HEADLINE> Census Reports 2.4M Forms Returned  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the census well under way, federal
immigration officials have unveiled revised guidelines designed to
get more questionnaires back from illegal immigrants wary of
revealing information to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service executive associate
commissioner Michael Pearson, in a memo this week to regional
directors, said that while the agency would continue to enforce
immigration laws during the census period, ''steps will be taken to
avoid adverse effects on census participation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The willingness of illegal aliens to participate in Census
2000 depends much on their confidence that INS will not be able to
access the information collected,'' Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 2.4 million people have sent in their form, Census
Director Kenneth Prewitt said Tuesday, urging the rest of the
country's citizens to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   With forms arriving at millions of homes this week, the early
returns represent about 2 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we have 98 percent to go,'' Prewitt observed.
</P>
<P>
   The national head count is required by the Constitution every 10
years. Unlike years past when census takers went home to home, most
families are expected to reply by mail, though they can also answer
by e-mail or phone. If they don't do so, or if they live in some
rural areas, census workers will come knocking.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt stressed that any information provided on the forms is
confidential and cannot be obtained by any other government agency,
including INS, or a private individual.
</P>
<P>
   While some critics called for a moratorium on INS activities,
''we are pleased that the guidance significantly and clearly limits
enforcement activities during this critical period,'' said Karen
Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American
Legal Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Besides English, Census forms are available in Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, Vietnamese and Tagalog, the language of the Philippines. In
addition, written guides to the form are available in nearly 50
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have flooded a helpline -- 1-800-471-9424 -- that
assists people filling out forms. On Monday, 636,000 calls came in.
</P>
<P>
   People can also ask questions on line or file a short form at
www.census.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The count's original purpose was to allocate House seats
appropriately among the states. Today the figures are also used to
determine how best to distribute billions in federal dollars for
education, health, housing, police and other programs, making the
census vital to many communities.
</P>
<P>
   Most families will receive a basic short form with only a few
questions, while one in six homes receives a longer form seeking
more detail to establish a statistical profile of the nation.

<HEADLINE> State, city officials promise crackdown on phony firearms  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- State and city officials are targeting
the sales of mock firearms, promising to get decoy weapons out of
stores and cut down on the shootings they can cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a dark hallway or alley ... they can easily be mistaken for
the real thing and provoke the kind of bloodshed we have seen all
too often,'' Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale or possession of a realistic fake gun such as a cap
gun, cigarette lighter or water pistol, was prohibited about six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about the would-be weapons have resurfaced since
Hartford police officer Robert Allan fatally shot 14-year-old Aquan
Salmon. Salmon's companions were toting gun-shaped cigarette
lighters. The teen-ager was not carrying one of the fake weapons at
the moment he was shot, but police found one gun-shaped cigarette
lighter at the shooting scene and another in the car in which
Salmon was riding.
</P>
<P>
   The boys were suspects in an attempted mugging, and witnesses
said they saw the guns.
</P>
<P>
   Public Safety Commissioner Henry Lee has said the gun-shaped
lighter was so realistic, he could not tell it was a fake by sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Dr. Lee can't tell the difference, a police officer at 2
o'clock at night cannot tell the difference,'' said Chief State's
Attorney John Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Allan was cleared of state charges last month following a
10-month investigation by Bailey's office. Federal and departmental
investigations are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Hartford police Chief Deborah Barrows said her department
will be checking city stores to ensure fake guns are not being
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said his office will also try to keep the replicas --
many of which he said are made overseas -- from reaching Connecticut
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our primary focus is on the importers and distributors,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said the crackdown also involves the Internet.
Officials from eBay, the Internet auction site, have said they will
also watch for fake guns being posted for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal contacted the company after seeing a cigarette
lighter gun being sold on their website. eBay then pulled the
replica off the virtual auction block.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Blumenthal, eBay lawyer Robert Chestnut said the
Internet site will warn all sellers of tobacco lighters about the
replica firearms laws.
</P>
<P>
   Sale or possession of a realistic fake gun is punishable by a
6-month prison sentence and $1,000 fine. Using one to commit a
crime is a felony that could carry a 20-year prison term, Bailey
said.
</P>
<P>
   In order to be exempt from the law, bogus firearms -- including
water pistols -- must be a different color than a real gun,
Blumenthal said.

<HEADLINE> Floods Hurting Venezuelan Tourism  </HEADLINE>
By FABIOLA SANCHEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The floods and mudslides that
devastated Venezuela's Caribbean coast last December have taken a
heavy toll on the tourism industry as well, hurting one of
President Hugo Chavez's top initiatives for reviving the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism in Venezuela, both domestic and international, has
declined by 60 percent so far this year, according to the National
Federation of Venezuelan Hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas state used to be the favorite beach destination for
Caracas' 6 million residents because of its proximity. But the
avalanches of mud, water and boulders that came crashing down the
mountain separating the capital from the Caribbean Sea rendered
scores of hotels, resorts, restaurants and beach clubs inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   Beaches have been turned into cemeteries, and the roads
connecting towns and villages have been badly damaged. Where palm
trees, open-air restaurants and beach kiosks once stood, there are
buildings buried up to four floors high in mud, overturned cars and
wooden crosses in the sand that serve as memorials to the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism decline began even before December's disaster,
largely because of Venezuela's painful 7 percent economic
contraction last year. The flooding and mudslides, which killed
between 5,000 and 30,000 people, made the situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the country's tourist destinations were not affected by
the natural disaster, however, and industry executives are trying
to spread the word that Venezuela remains a viable choice for
international travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Teodoro Rivas, a 56-year-old tourist guide at the pristine
Tacarigua Lagoon 120 miles northeast of Caracas, said the drop in
visitors has forced him to take up fishing to support his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''If things don't improve soon I don't know what we'll do,
because we live from tourism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicola Carusella, owner of a small hotel in Chichiriviche, 160
miles northwest of Caracas, said tourist activity in the area --
traditionally one of Venezuela's most popular destinations because
of its palm-filled, white-sand keys -- ''has been almost nil'' this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chichiriviche was spared the devastation of the floods,
Carusella said reduced tourism is decimating the livelihood of the
town's 5,000 inhabitants, who have always relied on tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel federation's president, Hugo Arriojas, said hotel
occupation is down 35 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Federico Garcia, president of the Association of Venezuelan
Tourism Chambers, said the ''bad image'' of the flooding hurt a
tourism industry that already was reeling from Venezuela's
perceived political instability and soaring crime.
</P>
<P>
   He said the political climate -- namely, the election of Chavez,
who had led a failed coup years ago -- ''has put tourism operators
on a state of alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has repeatedly said he hopes to make tourism one of the
country's main engines of economic growth, overcoming the downturn
of recent months. To counteract the tourism decline, the government
announced a plan last month to repair roads, clean up the
environment and install signs at key tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Tourism Minister Maria Eugenia Loriente says the idea is
to improve infrastructure in Venezuela's most desirable regions:
the 1,700 miles of coastline that boast more than 150 tourist
beaches, Amazon jungles ideal for adventure travel and vast
wildlife preserves in the country's western plains.
</P>
<P>
   The government has promised a major campaign to promote
Venezuelan tourism abroad, as well as tax and other financial
incentives for tourism investors.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Against Jay Leno Dismissed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing ''Tonight Show'' host Jay
Leno of slandering a car designer has been dismissed, Leno's
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   However, an attorney for auto designer Claudio Zampolli, who
sued Leno in November 1999 for $150 million, has appealed. Tristram
Buckley is asking the state's appellate court to reinstate the case
and name a new judge.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges Leno damaged Zampolli's reputation by
calling him names during a 1998 classic car show in Los Angeles.
The suit claims Leno called Zampolli a ''crook'' and spread rumors
that Zampolli promised cars but never delivered them.
</P>
<P>
   Leno's attorney, Ronald Berg, said the suit was dismissed
earlier this month after Buckley, failed to follow court
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley contends the judge assigned to the case was biased in
favor of Leno.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every single ruling he has made, irregardless of the law, has
been in Mr. Leno's favor,'' Buckley said. ''This is far from
over.''

<HEADLINE> Nia Long Talks To Essence Magazine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Nia Long says watching her single mother
struggle to support the pair when she was growing up gave her the
drive she needed to succeed as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   ''My motivation to be successful was the conviction that we
couldn't live like that forever, not knowing how we were going to
pay the bills,'' says Long, who was raised in Los Angeles. ''My
mother was on welfare, working a job under the table until she made
enough to get off of welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Long's film credits include ''The Best Man'' and ''love jones.''
She currently stars in the movie ''Boiler Room'' with Giovanni
Ribisi and Ben Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   Long tells the April edition of Essence that acting is her
''most favorite thing'' in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what I live for. Acting is very therapeutic. It teaches
you not to be afraid of emotions.''

<HEADLINE> FAA Aims To Improve Airport Safety  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With airliners and private planes taking off
and landing, trucks carrying food, fuel and luggage carriers
scurrying about and buses shuttling passengers, airport tarmacs can
be hazardous places. The government is moving to reduce the danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we have a problem. That's why we're focusing on it,''
FAA Administrator Jane F. Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   She announced Tuesday a series of workshops across the country
to focus attention on runway hazards as well as a yearlong study of
close calls in airports to determine how to avoid them in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said both private and commercial pilots are joining in an
effort that also will include increased training for air traffic
controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 325 incidents in 1998 and 322 last year when airplanes
came dangerously close to one another or to vehicles on runways and
taxiways, 57 percent resulted from pilot error, said John
Mayrhofer, director of the FAA's runway safety program.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic control errors accounted for about 25 percent, he
said, and the rest were problems with vehicles and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Mayrhofer said the Airplane Owners and Pilots Association, which
represents private pilots, is working with the agency to provide
training to its members.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, air traffic controllers will receive
monthly refreshers on ground safety and commercial pilots also are
working with the agency.
</P>
<P>
   During the next year, officials said, they will investigate
reports of runway close calls -- what the FAA calls runway
incursions -- to try and determine the causes.
</P>
<P>
   Problems differ from airport to airport, Garvey said, and
solutions may also have to vary.
</P>
<P>
   She noted the agency hopes within two years to outfit the
nation's 34 largest airport with ground radars that can issue
warnings of potential close calls in time to avoid accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA also is experimenting with new runway lighting systems
and other technology that may help avoid ground incidents,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Tar Heels Not Expected To Advance  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina, an underachieving team
that starts five former prep All-Americans, has one last chance to
salvage its season in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best programs in college basketball history has been
inconsistent this season, starting 8-2 before losing 11 of its
final 21 games -- some with seemingly uninspired play.
</P>
<P>
   In last Friday's first-round game in the Atlantic Coast
Conference tournament, the Tar Heels managed a season-low 52 points
in a loss to Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't expect 18-13, but it could have been worse. It could
have been not making the tournament,'' senior point guard Ed Cota
said of North Carolina's worst season in 10 years. ''We're in there
now, and we have new life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels aren't favored to advance to the round of 16, and
some doubt they can even beat No. 9 seed Missouri in their South
Regional opener Friday in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've running out of opportunities to start (winning),'' coach
Bill Guthridge said Tuesday. ''But I've been pleased with our work
this week. The players have done a good job of keeping their
spirits up.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor defense and turnovers have been North Carolina's two major
weaknesses. The nation's best field-goal shooting team has
committed 112 more turnovers than its opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there are plenty (of doubters) out there,'' said Cota,
who is seven assists shy of becoming the third player in NCAA
history to reach 1,000 for his career. ''I don't blame them, but
we've got a good enough team to make a run.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's first-round game against Missouri (18-12) is
not an easy game. First-year coach Quin Snyder is a former Duke
player and assistant coach under Mike Krzyzewski.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's job for Krzyzewski last season was advance scouting,
meaning he knows the Tar Heels well.
</P>
<P>
   ''And having been on the sideline, he has an advantage,''
Guthridge said. ''In a way, it's like we're not going outside the
conference. We're playing a team that knows us pretty well. I hope
by Friday we know Missouri well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels, who lost to Weber State in their NCAA opener last
year, would have to win the national title to avoid the program's
most losses since the 1951-52 season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not used to losing this much, and am disappointed I have
not been able to come up with some of the solutions to our
problems,'' Guthridge said. ''We've worked hard at it and the
players have worked hard. No one wants to win more than I do and no
one wants to win more than our players do. We certainly aren't
giving up.''

<HEADLINE> Knight Accused of Choking Player  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Neil Reed portrays Bob Knight as a bully who
abuses his players. Knight's defenders portray the former Indiana
player as a crybaby who couldn't meet the volatile coach's
demanding standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without this system, without coach Knight challenging me, that
would not have been possible,'' senior A.J. Guyton said of his
selection this week as first-team All-America by The Associated
Press. ''I say that because at Indiana you know you're going to be
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Neil Reed understood that,'' Guyton said Tuesday
night. ''In order to become an All-American, you're going to be
challenged by a coach that pushes you to the limit. It's all a
process of a boy becoming a man.''
</P>
<P>
   The accusations by Reed, who transferred from Indiana after his
junior season three years ago, were released earlier Tuesday by
CNN/Sports Illustrated for broadcast that night. Reed accused
Knight of choking him during an argument at practice. He said when
he transferred to Southern Mississippi in 1997 that Knight had
abused him physically and mentally, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's CNN/SI story, Reed said Knight choked him for about
five seconds and that other coaches had to separate them.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came at me ... and grabbed me with one hand,'' Reed said.
''I grabbed his wrist and started walking back, and by this time
people ... grabbed coach Knight and pulled him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Indiana player Richard Mandeville also was interviewed by
CNN and said Knight once came out of a bathroom, pants around his
ankles, and showed players soiled toilet paper, saying, ''This is
how you guys are playing.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at Assembly Hall in Bloomington on Tuesday
night, Indiana basketball media director Todd Starowitz read
statements from former assistant Dan Dakich, who denied Reed and
Knight had to be separated, and from former player Robbie Eggers,
who disputed the bathroom incident.
</P>
<P>
   Knight did not attend the news conference and did not return a
phone call from the AP for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Eggers said in his statement: ''I would certainly remember if an
incident like that occurred. ... Coach Knight walked in the locker
room one day with a roll of toilet paper and acted as if he was
wiping himself through his pants and used that to describe our poor
play. Any statement to the contrary is false.
</P>
<P>
   ''The statement that he (Reed) was choked by coach Knight is
totally ridiculous,'' Eggers said.
</P>
<P>
   Dakich, now the head coach at Bowling Green, said in his
statement: ''I was an assistant when Reed was playing, and his
allegation that I had to separate him from coach Knight is totally
false.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Michael Lewis said the timing of the CNN story ''was not
by accident. ... They planned it to come out the day before the
(NCAA) tournament, so we thought we should make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's going to bother us as a team,'' Lewis said.
''We've been through a lot. That's one reason were talking now, so
we don't have to deal with it Thursday and Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Starowitz also said the timing of the CNN report was
''calculated'' to embarrass Knight, who was aware the story was in
the works, but refused to comment to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Knight last summer also was accused by a Bloomington man of
choking him in a restaurant parking lot. The county prosecutor
refused to file charges, saying Knight was provoked.
</P>
<P>
   Reed left the team in March 1997, when Indiana was on spring
break. He said he knew Knight was tough on his players, but he felt
singled out for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody says you know what it's going to be like,'' he told
CNN/SI. ''I didn't know that was going to happen. No one knew that
was going to happen. No one would believe that was going to happen,
but it happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed also said Knight threw Indiana president Myles Brand out of
a practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coach Knight could hear him and just stopped practice and
said, 'Quit that talking. I don't come in your office and talk
while you are working. Get the hell out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brand denied the claim. ''Anyone who suggests otherwise is
totally incorrect,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   University vice president Christopher Simpson said he was with
the president at every practice he attended during Reed's years,
and just about every one since. He told the AP the report is a
''total fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said he has never seen Knight physically abuse a player,
although he acknowledged Knight yells at players.
</P>
<P>
   ''But don't most coaches?'' Simpson said. ''I'm not an expert on
basketball, but I saw nothing at any of the practices I attended
that I wouldn't expect to see at any other top-ranked team's
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''If CNN is saying Neil Reed said it, then I question
anything Neil Reed says.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Henderson, now playing for the Atlanta Hawks, told CNN that
Knight ''got on me sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got on everybody, but I could take it,'' he said. ''I never
let it get me down.''

<HEADLINE> NIT Rdp  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michigan was passed over for the NCAA tournament three
years ago, the Wolverines used it as motivation to win the NIT and
beat Notre Dame in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the Irish (18-14) are ready to
return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Matt Doherty admits it could be tough to fire up the Irish
for their first-round NIT game against Michigan tonight after they
barely missed their first trip to the NCAA tournament in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad we're not playing today, personally,'' Doherty said
Tuesday. ''It'll give us another day to get it out of our system
and enjoy playing another college basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you come down to it, we're playing a great program like
Michigan on national TV.''
</P>
<P>
   In opening-round games Tuesday night, ACC teams were 2-for-2 as
Wake Forest beat Vanderbilt 83-68 and North Carolina State beat
Tulane 64-60.
</P>
<P>
   In tonight's other first-round games, it's Georgetown at
Virginia, Princeton at Penn State, Delaware at Villanova, Marquette
at Xavier, North Carolina Charlotte at Mississippi, Bowling Green
at BYU, New Mexico State at Arizona State, Long Beach State at
California and South Florida at New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The first round finishes Thursday with Massachusetts at Siena,
Rutgers at Kent, Southern Illinois at Colorado, and SMU at
Southwest Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   The next two rounds are at school sites, with the semifinals and
final moving to New York on March 28 and March 30.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish had visions of playing in the NCAA tournament after
big wins against Ohio State, Connecticut and St. John's. But losses
to Miami of Ohio, Pittsburgh and Providence didn't help the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty complained the Irish were penalized for playing a
tougher schedule than other teams that made the tournament and were
rewarded more for the number of wins rather than the quality of
those victories.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if something didn't add up while he was looking over the
list of teams that did make the tournament, Doherty said, ''About
five or six things didn't add up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to write letters and make phone calls. You want to
shout from the top of the mountain, but you can't control that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines (15-13) are happy to be playing anywhere after
losing 10 of their final 13 and limping into the NIT. But Michigan
can take solace in the fact that both times the Wolverines have won
the NIT, they beat the Irish on their way to the title.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a last-second jumper by Louis Bullock gave
Michigan a 67-66 win that propelled the Wolverines to the NIT
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty wants the Irish to follow Michigan's example.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's got to be our motivation, to prove that we deserve to
be in the NCAA tournament,'' Doherty said. ''But it's hard. We have
to be really challenging ourselves to overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   Says senior point guard Jimmy Dillon: ''We've got to go out and
prove to the world that we belong with these teams in the NCAA. The
NIT is going to give us a chance to take a lot of our frustration
out.''
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest 83, Vanderbilt 68
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt was unable to overcome the disappointment of being
left out of the NCAA tournament, and Craig Dawson matched a career
high with 19 points to lead the Demon Deacons to a surprise win at
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest (18-14) next plays the South Florida-New Mexico
winner. Vanderbilt (19-11) ended the season by losing seven of its
final 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Demon Deacons put the game away with a 12-2 run in the
second half for a 57-44 lead with 12:22 left.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 64, Tulane 60
</P>
<P>
   At Raleigh, N.C., Damien Wilkins scored 18 points, and the
Wolfpack (18-12) got two clutch baskets in the final 2:27 to move
into the second round against the New Mexico State-Arizona State
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane closed its season 20-11, losing for only the third time
in 11 games decided by five points or less. NC State reversed a
73-62 loss to the Green Wave on Dec. 22.

<HEADLINE> UConn Has More Flash Than '95 Team  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Connecticut won its only national championship in women's
basketball with sound, consistent, fundamental play. If the No.
1-ranked Huskies win another this season, it will be for entirely
different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This Connecticut team, 30-1 and the top seed in the East
Regional, is winning with flash and dash. And they prevail despite
more than the occasional turnover and bonehead plays.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're quicker, faster, have more depth and are more
explosive,'' said coach Geno Auriemma, comparing his current team
to the group that won the NCAA title in 1995 with Rebecca Lobo and
Jennifer Rizzotti. ''That team was just steady. They killed you
with their consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We blocked shots, we rebounded and we got any shot we wanted,
any time we wanted. This team helps a lot of stores in Connecticut
sell a lot of Pepsin and Zantac.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut begins its title quest Friday night at home against
Hampton, winner of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference tournament.
Fifteen other games will be played Friday, and there are 16 more on
Saturday, the first step in the process of deciding who goes to the
Final Four in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to start over and focus on another whole season,''
said Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw, whose team is seeded second in
the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Led by first-team All-Americans Shea Ralph and Svetlana
Abrosimova, Connecticut has been dazzling at times this season. But
Auriemma said it's also a team that can drive him crazy because of
its inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the top seven scorers are sophomores and another is a
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We play two kinds of basketball,'' Auriemma said. ''When this
team is playing well, we're as good if not better than any team
I've ever seen. When everybody clicks, we just destroyed people. It
was like nothing I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we went 10 minutes against Rutgers without a field goal.
That never happened to that other unit. That was unthinkable to
that other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Connecticut should have no trouble with Hampton, more
difficult foes would await the Huskies later. Duke, the national
runner-up last season, is the No. 2 seed in the East, and defending
national champion Purdue is seeded fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma, which shared the Big 12 championship with Iowa State
and Texas Tech, also is in the region, and so is Xavier, the mere
mention of which is enough to get UConn fans reaching for that
antacid. As a No. 8 seed last year, Xavier took top-seeded
Connecticut to the wire before losing 86-84 in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ''Did anybody think Xavier was a heart attack waiting to
happen?'' Auriemma said. ''That's why this is the greatest three
weeks in sports. You better bring your A game every night just in
case the other team brought theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest and West regionals look especially tough, with each
having three Top Ten teams.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Louisiana Tech is the top seeded-team in the Midwest,
which has sixth-ranked Penn State as the No. 2 seed and
seventh-ranked Iowa State as the No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said she thought it was the most
difficult bracket top to bottom, and that was good enough for Iowa
State coach Bill Fennelly.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Pat Summitt says it's the toughest region, that's like
coming from the top of the mountain,'' Fennelly said. ''I think you
have a lot of very good teams, teams from good leagues. Anybody
that gets out of this region is going to have to play four darn
good games.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Regional has fourth-ranked Georgia, eighth-ranked
Rutgers and ninth-ranked Cal Santa Barbara, whose 26-game winning
streak is the nation's longest.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, the No. 1 seed, got sent West despite coach Andy
Landers' pleas beforehand. But before the Lady Bulldogs fly across
the country to the regional semifinals in Portland, Ore., they have
to get by two stiff challenges at home.
</P>
<P>
   Their first-round game Saturday night is with Montana, which is
making its 14th NCAA appearance. Then they'd have to play Stanford,
a two-time national champion, or Michigan, the Big Ten runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the West is North Carolina, rejuvenated by the return of
guard Nikki Teasley after a midseason leave of absence. The
selection committee thought so much of Teasley's impact that it
seeded the Tar Heels fifth despite their 18-12 record.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people say that's probably a little high,'' said
Summitt, whose own team is seeded No. 1 in the Mideast. ''I'd say
I'm glad they're not in our bracket. With Teasley back, it's
legit.''

<HEADLINE> Authorities: Internet takes center stage in insider trading scheme  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet chat rooms became a breeding ground for
an insider trading scheme that delivered more than $8 million in
profits and brought criminal charges to 19 people who illegally
traded on stock tips, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the main organizers pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy
to commit insider trading and other charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet figured so prominently in the scheme that U.S.
Attorney Mary Jo White and the Securities and Exchange Commission
noted that the case was the first ever alleging that the Internet
was used to spread Wall Street secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, SEC director of enforcement, called the case
''one of the most elaborate insider trading schemes in history.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Freeman, 34, of Brooklyn, and James Cooper, of Bowling
Green, Ky., pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   ''I met an individual over the Internet who ... had access to
information. I took the information over a period of about 2{ years
and traded on that information for profit,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman declined to comment after entering his plea.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said he was at the core of the scheme. Freeman
allegedly stole information from documents he viewed as part of
doing part-time computer graphics work at two investment banks,
Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston. He also
allegedly examined and took documents with information on upcoming
deals from the desks of coworkers and from garbage cans.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman allegedly used sensitive information about 23 mergers
and did research on the Internet to decipher the coded references
meant to shield the identities of the companies from workers at the
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman started the scheme in mid-1997 after he lost money
investing in a helmet manufacturer, the complaint alleged.
</P>
<P>
   He then went online and found other disgruntled investors of the
company in America Online chat rooms, prosecutors said. Before
long, he was speaking with Cooper, an insurance agent, and Benton
Erskine, a West Virginia day trader and computer supply store
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman allegedly offered to pass inside information on clients
of Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse to Cooper and Erskine in
exchange for a percentage of any profits they earned by acting on
it. Prosecutors said Freeman did not have money to invest himself
and thought the market was too risky.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 2{ years, Freeman passed inside information to
Cooper and Erskine, communicating almost solely through online
chats and instant messages, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Assistant Director Lewis Schiliro said the defendants made
the mistake of thinking they were anonymous in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who rely on the myth of anonymity in using the Internet
to pursue their criminal activity should understand that law
enforcement has the ability to pierce the veil they hide behind,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Freeman earned between $70,000 and $100,000 in
kickbacks while Cooper made $227,000 and Erskine $273,000.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Freeman began giving the tips to neighbors in
Brooklyn; co-workers at his full-time job at the Phillip Morris
Companies; and employees and customers at Les Halles, a Manhattan
restaurant where he worked part-time as a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing for Freeman and Cooper was set for Sept. 15, when the
defendants could face up to 10 years in prison and $1 million in
fines.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said 15 of the defendants had been arrested.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It seemed like the perfect Republican issue:
temporarily roll back gas taxes to help motorists get through a
steep price spike and heap criticism on Vice President Al Gore,
whose 1993 vote resulted in the tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP is growing cool to a plan to suspend the
4.3-cent-a-gallon gas tax. Key Republicans, road builders and even
truckers are concerned about the potential impact on highway,
bridge and transit projects that depend on the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not get bogged down on only one dimension of the problem
-- a short-term dimension that offers scant relief,'' House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have taken to calling it the ''Gore tax'' because
Gore's vote broke the tie in the Senate vote seven years ago that
raised federal gas taxes to 18.4 cents a gallon. But transportation
projects are favorites on Capitol Hill, and some estimates conclude
that temporarily suspending the tax would cost states $7 billion
for those projects.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to Senate staff, the American Road and Transportation
Builders Association said the suspension, combined with a separate
proposal for a one-year rollback of the 24.4-cents-a-gallon tax on
diesel fuel, would cost highway programs an estimated $10.3
billion. Some truckers agreed that would seriously damage critical
road and bridge maintenance and construction plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that's going in the wrong direction,'' said Todd
Spencer, executive vice president of the Owner Operator Independent
Drivers Association. ''Any money that is collected goes to
highways, and highways need to be maintained and repaired.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent truckers are planning a protest at the Capitol on
Thursday -- the second this year -- to demand action to lower fuel
prices. But their top priorities are getting the U.S. government to
press harder for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to increase supply, to oversee freight rates to ensure they are
fair, and to release fuel from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawmakers also questioned whether suspending the 4.3-cent
tax would do any good or would even be noticed by consumers. For
example, a motorist who drove 12,000 miles a year at 20 miles per
gallon would realize savings of only $26, assuming oil companies
actually passed on the tax cut to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if it has any effect on fuel costs,'' said Rep.
J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, a member of the House GOP leadership.
''Supply and demand is driving price right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are shifting their focus from gas tax
legislation to criticism of the administration's efforts to
persuade the OPEC countries to increase supply and improve U.S.
domestic oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Armey pointed out that the United States prevented Iraqi
aggression in the Middle East and helped bail out Mexico during
economic hard times and said: ''It seems like our diplomatic
relationships and our diplomatic standing with these OPEC countries
is not what it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, has introduced legislation that
would reduce or end any U.S. assistance or arms sales to countries
found to be engaging in oil price fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, appearing Tuesday on three
morning TV programs, said President Clinton had not ruled out
suspension of the gas tax but said the focus should be on
negotiating with OPEC, getting more gasoline to market and
increasing research into alternative energy sources, fuel-efficient
vehicles and use of abundant natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're moving ahead with getting refiners and gasoline people
and oil companies to get more gasoline out into the market,''
Richardson said on ABC's ''Good Morning America.'' ''We know people
are hurting. But we're moving and we're considering a number of
options.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the GOP's ''Gore tax'' label, Gore campaign spokesman
Doug Hattaway said Republicans should stop making ''political hay''
out of rising gas prices and work for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway also said Gore's tie-breaking vote in 1993 produced a
budget the administration considers a key to ending the federal
deficit. The gas tax increase originally was used to reduce the
deficit, then was shifted by Congress in 1997 into the highway
account.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's proud to have cast the deciding vote on an economic
stimulus package that has helped bring about the longest economic
expansion in U.S. history,'' Hattaway said.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Expected To Win 7th Term  </HEADLINE>
By CAREN BENJAMIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last time Massachusetts Sen. Edward
Kennedy sought re-election, he faced one of the stiffest challenges
of his long political career. This time around, he may not even
break a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's likely Republican challenger is Michael J. Sullivan,
district attorney in Plymouth County, Mass. He has little money or
name recognition despite a solid political background that includes
three terms in the Massachusetts House and two terms as district
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kennedy got a real scare in 1994,'' said Jennifer Duffy, an
analyst for the Cook Political Report. ''He learned the lessons you
learn from that kind of experience. He raised a lot of money early,
he tended the home fires. He's been running for this election ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is Kennedy, 68, now appears to have among the safest
seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no one alive who can beat Ted Kennedy,'' said
Democratic political consultant Michael Goldman of Boston. ''And
Abraham Lincoln would have a problem if he were to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Most campaign watchers give Sullivan, 45, about the same odds as
the race's other two candidates: Libertarian Carla Howell, whose
mantra is ''Small government is beautiful,'' and Philip Hyde,
running as a ''Timesizer'' who says he can eliminate poverty,
racism, sexism, unemployment and homelessness by shortening the
work week to 30 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In 37 years in the Senate, Kennedy has made a name for himself
as a champion of progressive causes, from voting and civil rights
to raising the minimum wage and universal health coverage. But his
triumphs often were obscured by personal problems, most notably his
decision to leave the scene of a fatal car accident in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   During his 1994 re-election bid, Kennedy still was dealing with
fallout from the rape trial of his nephew, William Kennedy Smith.
Kennedy testified at the trial and acknowledged going to a bar with
his son, Rep. Patrick Kennedy, and Smith, who while there met the
woman who later claimed she was raped. Kennedy suffered politically
even though Smith was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was also up against the notion that the new Democrats had
taken over, and old liberal icons were a bit out of date,'' said
Paul Watanabe, a political science professor at the University of
Massachusetts, Boston. ''All of that seemed to indicate he was
potentially ripe for the picking.''
</P>
<P>
   The race was bruising. Republican candidate Mitt Romney spent
$7.6 million and attacked Kennedy repeatedly. Kennedy painted his
opponent as a heartless capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   It was a close race until Kennedy ran an ad blitz featuring
workers laid off from an Indiana company financed by Romney's
business. In the end, Kennedy beat Romney 58 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it doesn't appear Sullivan will have enough money to
mount a serious challenge. At the end of last year, Sullivan had
only $11,000 in his campaign war chest, compared to $3.5 million
for Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan believes he can make up for his lack of money through
free media coverage and retail politicking. He also hopes
Massachusetts voters are looking for a change after nearly four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's an opportunity to bring a new perspective, a new energy
to the United States Senate,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan touts his blue-collar credentials. He worked his way
through Boston College and Suffolk University law school, beginning
on the Gillette factory floor and rising to an executive position
before starting his private law practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voters are at least open to the idea there's an opportunity to
elect somebody from the middle class that is much more impacted and
affected by the policies that come out of Washington, D.C.,''
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Republican Party Executive Director John
Brockelman said Sullivan's longshot status is par for the course
for the GOP in the state, which has an all-Democrat congressional
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Running as a Republican in Massachusetts is always like having
one arm tied behind your back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brockelman insists there is reason for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   November's ballot contains a state income tax reduction
question. ''That is certainly going to energize Republicans and the
blue-collar Democrats and independents the Republicans need to
win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy will not comment on potential opponents, his spokesman
Will Keyser said. But Goldman, the Democratic consultant, said
Massachusetts voters don't buy the concept of a blue-collar
Republican. And Kennedy has made a career out of helping the poor
and middle class, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone in the state knows that Ted Kennedy can deliver,''
Goldman said. ''If you're voter, why the heck would you want to get
rid of someone like that?''

<HEADLINE> Palm Springs' Vegas Look Draws Fire  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- It's a fast-growing getaway from the
sprawl of Southern California. Frank Sinatra lived there, and the
rest of the Rat Pack used it as a stomping ground. It draws the
lounge acts of Wayne Newton and Tom Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Springs is beginning to look like a little like Las Vegas
and some residents aren't happy about it. They don't want their
sleepy desert community of 43,000 to become California's city of
sin.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to be compared to Las Vegas,'' said Howard
Jacobs, acting general manager of the Palm Springs tourism bureau.
''We have a very different atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is getting harder to avoid. Voters last week
legalized Nevada-style gaming on California Indian tribal lands and
the Palm Springs area -- a two-hour drive from Los Angeles -- is
expected to be ground zero for a major expansion in casino
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The Agua Caliente tribe said Monday it would spend at least $150
million to renovate and enlarge its casino in downtown Palm
Springs. It is also planning to throw in an additional $80 million
to build a casino in Rancho Mirage, 20 minutes up the road.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts Inc. and the
Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians announced plans for a $60
million casino expansion in the Coachella Valley near Palm Springs
.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement came a day after voters approved by a 2-to-1
margin Proposition 1A, which amended the state Constitution to
allow a dramatic increase in Indian gambling across California.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect more deals and growth in a region that already
lures 3 million tourists a year for its golf, natural spas, weather
and limited gambling at five casinos. It also helps that the valley
is right in the path of Southern California motorists headed toward
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place will be California's closest thing to Las Vegas,''
said Vincent Battaglia, who sells commercial real estate in the
Coachella Valley and sees a boon in the making.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard for the valley to rival the dense glitz of
Vegas. But, at the very least, it will siphon gamblers from the
less showy Nevada casino towns like Reno and Laughlin that will no
longer offer the kind of wagering Californians can't get at home.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 1A allows the tribes to replace video gambling
machines that spit out paper instead of money into standard
coin-dispensing slots, whose numbers could jump more than fivefold
across the state. For card games, the casinos will be allowed to
eliminate fees charged per hand and to run house-banked games.
</P>
<P>
   With 2,000 slot machines, 70 table games and off-track betting
at its two Coachella Valley casinos, the 350-member Agua Caliente
tribe will be able to offer about the same gambling opportunities
as a Las Vegas casino like The Paris, which is licensed for 2,100
slots and up to 90 table games.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Jim Jones grumbles that Palm Springs has no
power to control or tax the activities of the tribe. The downtown
casino's brightly lit marquee is a particular source of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be OK in Las Vegas, but not in Palm Springs,'' said
Frank Tyson, owner of a nearby bed and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Milanovich, the Agua Caliente tribal chairman, said his
architects and landscape designers -- both with Vegas casino
experience -- will make sure the Rancho Mirage projects blend with
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ''It won't be another Las Vegas, nor will it become Atlantic
City,'' Milanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Thompson, a Republican state legislator, cautioned that
the increase in gambling could bring rising crime, indebtedness and
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nevada is not exactly something we should aspire to here in
the Golden State,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, City Manager Dallas Flicek welcomed the tourist
dollars, and notes that the crime and social ills predicted five
years ago -- when the casino opened -- never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the casinos, the Coachella Valley is expected to
grow fast as more baby boomers retire. Officials expect the
valley's population to jump from 235,000 to 300,000 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The combination may be too much for some residents, said Mimi
Aiken, a business owner playing video slots at the tribe's downtown
casino.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it got as big as Vegas, the locals would move out,'' said
Aiken, who moved from Orange County a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason we live here is because it's peaceful and quiet,''
she said. ''If it changes, I think you'll see people move out to
Arizona.''

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Fire Rockets at Israelis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Guerrillas fired volleys of Katyusha
rockets toward Israeli military positions near the border in
southern Lebanon today, sparking airstrikes, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 rockets fired from up to seven areas in hills southeast
of the port city of Tyre slammed near the international border 10
miles east of the coastal border town of Naqoura, said Timur
Goksel, spokesman for a U.N. peacekeeping force in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said it will withdraw by July from a border strip in
south Lebanon it has occupied since 1985 as a buffer against
cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern towns.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours after today's rocket attack, Israeli warplanes
pursuing the source of fire twice struck the hills, the spokesman
said from Naqoura, headquarters of the 4,500-member U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon. The force has been deployed in parts of the south
of Lebanon since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on casualties from today's violence
and it was not clear whether any Israeli position was hit or
whether any rockets landed in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed guerrilla group fighting Israeli
forces in southern Lebanon, claimed responsibility for ''heavy
rocket and gun attacks on enemy border positions.''
</P>
<P>
   It said in a statement issued in Beirut that its Islamic
Resistance military wing launched the attack in retaliation for
Israel's recent air raids and attacks on civilians in the south.
''The Islamic Resistance affirms its maximum readiness to deter the
enemy,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's rocket attack came two days after Israeli-backed
militiamen from the South Lebanon Army shelled the village of
Mansouri on the edge of an Israeli-occupied border strip south of
Tyre, killing a Lebanese army soldier at a checkpoint and a
Lebanese civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has in the past fired missiles on northern Israel to
retaliate for Israeli and allied militia attacks on Lebanese
civilians in the south. However, the guerrillas have since last
June limited their attacks on Israeli forces in the occupied
enclave in southern Lebanon or near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has promised harsh retaliation if guerrillas attacked
northern Israel. On Feb. 8, its warplanes destroyed three power
stations in Lebanon, causing widespread electricity outages, to
retaliate for military casualties in Hezbollah attacks in the
south. Seven Israeli soldiers and about a dozen allied militiamen
have been killed in guerrilla attacks in southern Lebanon since
Jan. 25.

<HEADLINE> UN Pressured Over Cambodia Tribunal  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After taking a hard line on a proposed
tribunal to prosecute Cambodia's Khmer Rouge leaders, the United
Nations is under increasing pressure to compromise to reach a deal
in talks starting Friday in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been at loggerheads with Cambodia for
months over international participation in a tribunal to judge
Khmer Rouge chieftains, blamed for the deaths of an estimated 1.7
million Cambodians during the group's radical communist rule in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. blessing is crucial to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen for
the tribunal to be viewed as legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations has withheld approval and demanded more
international control over the proceedings to ensure Cambodia's
corrupt and politicized judiciary isn't manipulated by Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan has made clear that any joint
tribunal meet minimum standards of international justice -- and a
senior U.N. official warned that the United Nations wasn't
interested in ''settling this at any price.''
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, France and Japan have been urging Annan
to take a more flexible and creative approach in defining those
minimum standards, suggesting compromise proposals as a way to
break a the impasse, U.N.-based Western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The three countries have also lobbied Cambodia to move closer to
the U.N. formula, but all concerned recognize that the United
Nations cannot impose a tribunal on the country, one Western
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a balance,'' said French Ambassador Alain Dejammet. ''We
have to look at what has been done with regard to Indonesia, with
regard to South Africa, and to try to find out something similar.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to moves by the United Nations to allow
Indonesia to proceed with its own prosecution of military officials
accused of atrocities in East Timor, and South Africa's own process
of finding justice for victims of apartheid, mainly through a Truth
and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Annan has taken at least some of their suggestions
and advice to heart, particularly concerning the role of
international judges on the court, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   David Sheffer, the U.S. ambassador for war crimes, wouldn't go
into details about the proposals or negotiations, but said he
believed a deal could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that the differences that remain between the U.N. and
Cambodia on these issues are resolvable,'' Sheffer said in a
telephone interview from his Washington office. ''But they do
require some very serious discussions between the two parties, and
we look forward to that actually taking place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge were expelled from power by a Vietnamese
invasion in 1979, but remained a fierce fighting force throughout
the 1980s with the help of Thailand, China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas' power rapidly declined after the end of the Cold
War. Hun Sen orchestrated the collapse of the movement in the late
1990s by offering defection deals to several senior leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear that several defectors will escape justice if a
tribunal is left in the hands of an underdeveloped Cambodian
judiciary that has close links with Hun Sen's ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   In his last letter to Hun Sen dated Feb. 8, Annan repeated the
U.N. demand for a majority of international judges and an
international prosecutor who could work independently of a
Cambodian prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats say Annan had already indicated a new willingness
to consider a U.S.-sponsored compromise that the Cambodians had
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ''super-majority'' formula, Cambodian judges would
have a majority on the court but would require a vote from an
international judge for any decision to convict or acquit.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 10 letter, Hun Sen said he was surprised by ''the gap
between the position raised in your letter and ours, which has been
already supported by a number of distinguished U.N. member states''
-- an apparent reference to the U.S.-sponsored super-majority
formula, which France has also supported.
</P>
<P>
   When Annan and Hun Sen met in Bangkok on Feb. 12, it appeared
the dispute was resolved. Both emerged after 30 minutes of talks
upbeat and expressing hope that the remaining differences could be
hammered out. Annan announced a team would go to Phnom Penh to try
to reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen told reporters that the two had overcome
misunderstandings sown through the media and a recent exchange of
letters -- a suggestion that Annan's Feb. 8 letter simply hadn't
reflected a possible U.N. compromise on the ''super-majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the judges, Annan's letter lists three other
''fundamental'' issues that must be worked out: an international
guarantee that those indicted be arrested, guarantees about limits
on amnesty, and prosecutorial independence -- considered to be the
key sticking point.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the U.N. delegation that left New York on Tuesday
for Phnom Penh is Hans Corell, the U.N. legal counsel who is
believed to have pressed hardest for the rigid line in U.N.
demands. But Annan has also dispatched a trusted aide, Shashi
Tharoor, in hopes of reaching a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffer urged all sides to ''keep their eye on the big
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The picture is that 1.7 million Cambodians were extinguished
during the Pol Pot era, and it remains our collective
responsibility to bring senior Khmer Rouge leaders to justice for
that,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> White House Knocks GOP Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans say their $1.8 trillion budget for
fiscal 2001 maps sensible levels of spending and tax cuts -- and
ensures a clash with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a huge bunch of spending, we don't increase
taxes, and we don't spend the Social Security surplus,'' House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said Tuesday. ''I know he doesn't
like that,'' he said of Clinton. ''He wants bigger government and
more spending.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP package proposes at least $150 billion in tax cuts from
2001 through 2005, about $50 billion more than Clinton wants. Its
$307 billion for next year's defense budget is $1 billion higher
than Clinton's plan. But its $290 billion for domestic programs
ranging from farm loans to energy conservation is nearly $30
billion less than Clinton prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to get a leg up in their election-year budget duel, White
House officials gave the GOP package a scathing review on Tuesday,
a day before Republicans were expected to push the budget through
the House Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority in Congress is poised once again to propose a
budget based on irresponsible tax cuts that would require deep
reductions in key priorities,'' White House Chief of Staff John
Podesta said in a letter to House Budget Committee Chairman John
Kasich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   And White House budget chief Jack Lew and economic adviser Gene
Sperling told reporters that, compared to this year's spending
totals, domestic programs that Republicans are not protecting would
face 10 percent reductions next year under the GOP plan. Those
programs range from FBI agents to Superfund toxic waste cleanups.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to fight this policy because we think it is
wrong,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans retorted that the administration was overstating the
cuts. The White House ignored that billions in this year's budget
for one-time events like the 2000 census can be used for other
programs, lessening the impact of the cuts, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP blueprint would boost spending over this year's levels
for defense, schools, biomedical research, veterans health care and
other programs. And like Clinton's proposal, it would set aside the
$978 billion in Social Security surpluses projected from 2001
through 2005 for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Budget Committee plans to vote on a similar plan next
week. Congress' budget, which maps tax and spending changes to be
made in later bills, does not need the president's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a $9 billion measure financing U.S. efforts to
stabilize the government of Colombia and paying for American troops
in Kosovo and other activities appeared in peril, and House debate
on the measure was delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee approved the package last
week, and the House had planned to consider it later this week. But
conservatives say the measure, well above the $5.2 billion Clinton
requested, is too expensive. And Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., has expressed reluctance to move the package at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll wait and see what happens in the Senate'' when they
return from a one-week recess next week, said DeLay.

<HEADLINE> Few Satisfied With Nuclear Changes  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress created the National Nuclear Security
Administration last year to help streamline an Energy Department
bureaucracy blamed for security lapses and other problems with the
government's nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks after the semi-autonomous agency got going, it
came under fire from both congressional critics and department
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said the department had interfered with the agency's
autonomy and had perpetuated unclear lines of authority. Department
officials said the law creating the NNSA gave some program managers
the idea they would be insulated from Energy Department oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ''This (NNSA) legislation was not ideal, in our opinion,''
Deputy Energy Secretary T.J. Glauthier told a House Commerce
subcommittee Tuesday. ''We want to make the best of what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the agency late last year in response to
allegations that lax security at the Energy Department and nuclear
weapons laboratories may have led to the theft of nuclear secrets
by China.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy came to a head last year when Wen Ho Lee, a
former scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico was fired after being investigated for possible espionage.
</P>
<P>
   He was later indicted on charges he transferred top-secret
computer files to portable data tapes. Although Lee had been named
as a suspect in Chinese espionage, he has not been charged with
giving secrets to China or any other foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a Taiwan-born U.S. citizen, has pleaded innocent and sued
the federal government over news leaks about his case.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department resisted creating the semiautonomous
agency. Then it drew fire from critics by giving several of its
security and safety managers the same jobs within the new agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., and several other Republicans said
Tuesday that ''dual hatting'' violated the law creating the new
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department appears to be violating the semi-autonomous
intent of the law in order to comply with its implementation,''
said Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla. Stearns later asked Glauthier,
''You're not breaking the law, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this is well within the statute,'' Glauthier
replied.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's key stock index fell on Wednesday, pulled
down by slumping technology shares. The U.S. dollar slipped against
the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 63.24
points, or 0.33 percent, to 19,078.60. On Tuesday, the average fell
48.09 points, or 0.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.80 yen in afternoon trading, down 0.34 yen
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and below its overnight level of 105.05
yen in late New York trading.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, big names in electronics and
telecommunications were prominent among retreating shares. An
overnight pullback by technology stocks on Wall Street provoked
selling in Tokyo, though the Nikkei gained back some ground in late
trading.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Tuesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index
fell 200.61, or 4.1 percent, to close at 4,706.63. That fall was
second only to a 229.46-point slide it suffered on Jan. 4. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average closed down 135.89, to 9,811.24.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed
on the first section gained 23.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to
1,605.43. The TOPIX closed up 23.82 points, or 1.5 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers picked up a wide range of stocks amid signs that Japanese
institutional investors had finished their customary selling ahead
of book closing for the end of the fiscal year on March 31, said
Hiroichi Nishi, a deputy general manager at Nikko Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar's slip came after Japanese
banks sold the greenback in a round of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar moved as low as 104.96 yen at one point in the
morning, but recovered some of its early losses as dealers bought
back the U.S. currency amid concern over possible yen selling by
Japanese monetary authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, the Bank of Japan intervened on the foreign
exchange market in Tokyo in an attempt to stem the yen's rise.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese government officials have said a strong yen could hurt
the country's already ailing economy by cutting into exporters'
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The yen has gotten a lift in recent sessions from data
suggesting the world's second-largest economy may be starting to
lift out of its slump. Machine orders and capital spending both
rose in the October-December quarter even as gross domestic product
shrank 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 102.12 yen, up from
101.22 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.8100 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.7950 percent. Its
price fell 0.6 point to 99.44.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Militia Has Little Option  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAJIDIYEH CAMP, Lebanon (AP) -- On the rocky slopes beneath an
Israeli border outpost, South Lebanon Army militiamen learn to use
the semiautomatic rifles and well-worn tanks provided by their
Israeli allies.
</P>
<P>
   Training hasn't let up, officers say, even though Israel's plan
to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon by July has made the
future of the 24-year-old militia uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The soldier works to the end,'' said Maj. Said Ghattas, who is
in charge of training at Majidiyeh Camp, about half a mile from the
Israeli border. ''You can't say 'I don't want to because Israel is
leaving.'''
</P>
<P>
   SLA members speak with bravado about following their general,
Antoine Lahd, whatever the course. But the options -- from fighting
on to fleeing the country -- look bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a day after the Israeli Cabinet's decision to
withdraw, the Supreme Court rejected a request for political asylum
from fighters in an Israeli-backed Lebanese militia.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials, however, say they are making plans to protect
the militiamen if a unilateral Israeli withdrawal goes through.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has pledged to act on Israel's
''moral and actual obligation'' to the SLA and said a commission
headed by his adviser on Lebanese affairs, Uri Lubrani, would
determine the needs of SLA members and recommend action.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA, active before allying with Israel in the 1980s, has not
indicated whether it would stop fighting after an Israeli withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not say anything until we see what happens in the
future,'' Raymond Abu Murad, chief spokesman for Lahd, told The
Associated Press in Marjayoun, 10 miles west of the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the militia's fate is whether an Israeli withdrawal from
the border zone accompanies an agreement with Syria, Lebanon's
neighbor and chief power broker.
</P>
<P>
   If Syria wants to, it could exert enough pressure to stop a
guerrilla campaign to end the Israeli occupation. With Syria's
approval, Israel also could win safety for the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement, many residents and some SLA militiamen
predict worse bloodshed in the form of revenge attacks by
guerrillas. Hezbollah, the main guerrilla group fighting Israel,
says it will not stop the guerrilla war until Israel has left every
inch of Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
   Ghattas said SLA fighters are ready to turn their guns over to
the Lebanese army if it moves in and ensures security in the area.
Lebanese government forces could throw SLA fighters into jail,
since under Lebanese law cooperating with Israel a crime.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no security, Ghattas said he is willing to fight on.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Israel moves out, we will take the orders from General
Lahd,'' he said. ''We are ready. We have armies, guns, tanks. We
are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The SLA has about 160 tanks, he said, including the dozen
45-year-old Russian T-55s and three American M-130s parked at
Majidiyeh.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 new members are in a two-month, weekends-off training
program, he said. SLA veterans also participate in weeklong courses
updating them on the latest Israeli information on Hezbollah
tactics and logistics.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA alliance provided Israel with a friendly force along the
border amid the chaos of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. The militia
also reduced Israel's dependence on their own troops to patrol the
border and protect northern Israeli towns from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many Lebanese, however, saw the militiamen as traitors who were
fighting their own people and serving as sandbags for their masters
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The late Maj. Saad Haddad formed the militia in the late 1970s
after leading his troops to take control of a border strip from
Palestinian guerrillas. With his back to the border, he sought --
and received -- Israel's help and was fired from the Lebanese army.
Lahd took over a revamped force after Haddad died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 Christian, Shiite Muslim and Druse fighters are part
of the SLA, out of belief in the cause, for economic reasons or
because they were coerced into the service. Hundreds have been
killed or wounded fighting alongside Israeli soldiers against the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Ghattas said he also is ready for what he considers the least
desirable option after an Israeli withdrawal -- leaving his hometown
and country. Israel, he is confident, will not to abandon Lebanese
who fought alongside its soldiers for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel knows all that we need -- money, passports, homes, any
country. But this is what I do not want,'' Ghattas said.
</P>
<P>
   If all the militiamen and their families were to leave that
would mean resettling around 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Gantous Abu Farhad, 24, said he joined SLA three months
after his brother and brother-in-law were killed in a Hezbollah
explosion in 1998, and has no plans to leave Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't come for the money or anything. I came because I want
to be a soldier,'' he said. ''I'm not afraid. ... I know we are not
losing. We are winning.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Prepare for Battle Ahead  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Their presidential nominations at last
secured, Al Gore and George W. Bush dug in for the eight-month
battle to November. Bush declared his mission is ''ending the
Clinton-Gore era'' while Gore warned that Bush would resurrect the
policies of his father that ''drove our economy into the ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also brushed off as a stunt Gore's latest challenge, his
promise to hold off on television ads funded by ''soft money'' as
long as Bush does, too.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a president who lost the White House in 1992 to
Democrats Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Bush cast his own Republican
effort as pay back for his father's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must face one more Clinton-Gore campaign,'' Bush told
cheering crowds at an Austin, Texas, community center. ''We will
confront their tactics one more time, and this time, we will
prevail and they will fail.'' His mission, he said, is ''ending the
Clinton-Gore era in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose late father was a longtime Tennessee senator with
unfulfilled White House ambitions, was equally personal in
describing himself as better prepared to manage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two avenues leading from November of 2000. The path
that I want to lead our country toward continues our prosperity,
uses the surplus for constructive purposes,'' Gore told supporters
at a Tallahassee, Fla., high school gym.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other fork in the road leads off toward the right wing and
curves around back toward the approach that failed during the
Bush-Quayle years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush, the Texas governor, and Gore, the Democratic vice
president, celebrated Tuesday night after anticlimactic primaries
in six Southern states -- Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma,
Tennessee and Texas -- pushed each man well beyond the number of
delegates needed to win their parties' presidential nominations at
the national conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   An AP analysis showed Bush's delegate count would reach 1,093,
and Gore's would reach at least 2,530 -- far more than required by
each party.
</P>
<P>
   All suspense was drained from the primaries last week when
Republican John McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley bowed out of a
race that had spurred record-breaking voter turnout. Former
ambassador Alan Keyes remained on GOP ballots, but was not a threat
to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was low Tuesday but exit polls exposed general-election
vulnerabilities for both candidates: Gore's supporters were not as
motivated as Bush's, while Texas Republicans reported
disappointment with Bush's education agenda.
</P>
<P>
   After 2{ grueling months of virtually nonstop campaign travel,
Gore promised ''there will be no let up at all.'' He was headed
today to Pennsylvania, whose April 4 primary is now essentially
moot, to address an AFL-CIO state convention and attend a
fund-raiser in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to savor his victory and try to wipe out a
lingering cold by relaxing at the Governor's Mansion. A brief
vacation also was planned following a day trip Thursday to
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to campaign as hard as we did during the
primaries,'' Bush said on ABC's ''Nightline,'' adding: ''I'm going
to build the base.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made a feint at collegiality with an e-mail to Bush --
subject: ''Hello and congratulations'' -- to challenge him on the
ads, funded by unregulated contributions, that both parties plan to
use to help their nominees after the costly primary fights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will take the first step by requesting the Democratic
National Committee not to run any issue ads,'' Gore wrote. ''It's
up to you and your party whether you want to start the ad war arms
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed the offer. ''If I believed him, I might be
willing to accept it. But this is a man who said he wanted to ban
soft money, and then turned around, announced he's going to go out
and raise $35 million of soft money,'' Bush told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   He did not, however, dismiss fascination with retired Gen. Colin
Powell as a potential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little early to talk about vice presidents, but there's
no question that a man of Colin Powell's stature would send a
strong signal to America that I know how to attract the best minds
in America. Of course, I'm going to talk to him. And I hope I can
count on his support,'' Bush said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   In a hopeful sign for Bush, exit poll surveys by Voter News
Service for The Associated Press and the television networks
suggested that he ran stronger among Democratic voters than Gore
did among Republican voters. Just 6 percent of voters in Republican
primaries said they would vote for Gore in November; twice as many
Democrats said they would defect to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's home state of Tennessee, Republicans showed an intense
dislike of their native son with only 4 percent of those voters
saying they would vote for Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, half the Republicans as well as half the Democrats
said Bush was more conservative as presidential candidate than
during his landslide re-election as governor in 1998. And, as Bush
tries to campaign on his education record, 40 percent Texas
Republicans said there have not been ''significant reforms'' in
Texas public schools during Bush's six years as governor compared
to 50 percent who said there have been significant reforms.

<HEADLINE> Chasm Between Ky. Cops, Mayor Grows  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CHAMBERS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- When the police chief honored two white
officers involved in the shooting death of an unarmed black
suspect, the mayor skipped the ceremony to show his disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Dave Armstrong didn't stop there. The next day, he fired
Chief Gene Sherrard, saying the commendations were ''insensitive''
and widened the chasm between the black community and the police
department. Both the mayor and the chief are white.
</P>
<P>
   If Sherrard's decision to honor the officers damaged relations
between blacks and the police, Armstrong's decision to fire
Sherrard has devastated the relationship between police and the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police officers and supporters marched to City Hall
in Sherrard's defense early this month after the chief was fired.
They plan another demonstration Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That should stop, that should not happen,'' Armstrong said.
''The citizens are speaking out -- unfortunately someone is not
listening or else they are trying to further divide the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the marches illustrate how out of touch police are with
blacks, who make up about 30 percent of Louisville's 269,000
residents. The police force is 16 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uproar is a dramatic drop in the number of
arrests. Officer David James, vice president of the Louisville
Fraternal Order of Police lodge, has said police ''are consciously
afraid to make arrests because the mayor doesn't support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Rudolph, 18, was shot last May as he tried to escape in
a stolen vehicle. Police fired 22 rounds into the vehicle, saying
they feared Rudolph was going to run them down.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting sparked outrage in the black community. A grand
jury cleared the officers of criminal wrongdoing, but a city probe
found errors by police in the shooting and subsequent
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual police awards banquet, Officers Chris Horn and
Paul Kinkade were among several given the Exceptional Valor Award.
A police spokeswoman said the two were honored not for shooting
Rudolph but for surviving a risky situation.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony angered not only the mayor but the black community.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation of Desmond Rudolph is not an isolated case in
Louisville, Kentucky. These are repeated incidents,'' said Dr.
Walter Malone Jr., a black minister who serves on the city's
Interdenominational Coalition, a group of ministers and other
advocates for civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has also suggested that some officers engage in racial
profiling, a charge that prompted the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his
Rainbow Coalition to call for a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   George Osborne, a 43-year-old black resident, said he believed
Armstrong's comments about racial profiling -- where minorities are
singled out by police -- were correct.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know it goes on for a fact. I've never had any problem with
them, but I know people who have,'' Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Black leaders and some on the city's Board of Aldermen have
renewed a drive for civilian review of the police department.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Swicegood, an attorney for the FOP, said Armstrong should
reinstate Sherrard.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the one pouring gas on the fire,'' Swicegood said of the
mayor.

<HEADLINE> Gore Has Hard Road in the South  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has his work cut out for him in the
South. A chunk of Democratic voters say they will support
Republican George W. Bush for president in November, but the bloc
of GOP voters willing to cross party lines to vote for Gore is much
smaller, according to exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   About 13 percent of Democratic voters interviewed after leaving
the polls Tuesday in the six Southern states that helped Bush and
Gore clinch their parties' presidential nominations said they
preferred Bush -- twice the portion of GOP voters who said they'd
cross over to support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And more than 20 percent of Democrats said they had a favorable
view of Bush, the governor of Texas. Half as many Republicans had a
favorable view of Gore, the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews, conducted by Voter News Service, a consortium of
The Associated Press and the television networks, contained even
more good news for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Bill Bradley's supporters said they'd pick Bush over
Gore in November. And in Louisiana and Oklahoma, Bradley backers
preferred Bush by a 3-to-1 margin. By contrast, just a third of
those who voted for Sen. John McCain in the GOP primary said they
would support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Bradley and Republican McCain dropped out of the race
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Bush and Gore enjoyed across-the-board support Tuesday,
particularly among partisans in their home states of Texas and
Tennessee, respectively. More than 90 percent of Democrats in
Tennessee and of Republicans in Texas said they would support their
favorite sons in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We voted for George W. Bush. He's our man,'' said Gertrude
Miller, 55, of Lubbock, Texas. ''We are pleased with what he's done
in the state of Texas and we look forward to what he can do for the
nation. Obviously we feel like we know him.''
</P>
<P>
   And 76-year-old Athaleen Watson, voting in Gore's hometown of
Carthage, Tenn., cast her vote for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who else?'' she said. ''I've voted for Gore for as far back as
I can remember... We've got good times and I'd like to see that
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, 16 percent of Democratic voters said they'd cross
parties to vote for their governor. But only 6 percent of Tennessee
Republicans plan to vote for Gore. In fact, eight in 10 Tennessee
Republicans have an unfavorable view of Gore, compared with just
two-thirds of Texas Democrats with unfavorable views of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were warnings for Bush in the exit polls from his
home state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush often points to his widespread support in Texas, where he
cruised to a second term as governor in 1998. But half of the
voters Tuesday, in both Democratic and Republican primaries, said
he has been more conservative as a presidential candidate than he
was in that Texas landslide.
</P>
<P>
   And while Bush is running on his education record in Texas, many
Texans aren't convinced. About four in 10 GOP voters said there
have not been ''significant reforms'' in Texas schools under Bush,
while five in 10 said there have been. More than six in 10
Democratic voters agreed the schools have not been significantly
reformed under Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls were conducted at selected precincts in the six
states -- Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 6,297 voters in the GOP primaries and 5,312 voters
in the Democratic primaries had error margins of plus or minus 1.5
percentage points. Margins of error are larger for subgroups,
including individual states.

<HEADLINE> Police, NATO Take Over Serb Bridge  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Italian police and NATO
troops took control of a key bridge today despite Serb warnings of
trouble, a first step toward uniting this ethnically divided city
and reasserting international control.
</P>
<P>
   About 250 armed peacekeepers backed by armored personnel
carriers set up a cordon on the Serb-controlled north side of a
bridge linking the ethnic Albanian south bank of the Ibar River
with an ethnically mixed neighborhood called Little Bosnia on the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   Troops ordered four Serbs who had been guarding the north end of
the bridge to leave, and they did so quietly. A crowd of up to 300
Serbs gathered around the cordon 250 yards from the northern end of
the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   More than two hours after the operation began, there had been no
incidents. One Serb man, who gave his name only as Vasile, said he
was outraged at the NATO action.
</P>
<P>
   ''They pretend they are trying to protect us but they are trying
to expel us'' from Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once access to Little Bosnia is secured, troops plan to take
full control of a larger bridge that has been the scene of
confrontation among Serbs, ethnic Albanians and peacekeepers since
the effective division of the city, which began soon after NATO
entered Kosovo in June.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs oppose unification because they claim NATO cannot protect
them against revenge attacks by the ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Ivanovic, a Serb official in northern Kosovska Mitrovica,
said he had been told of the plan Tuesday evening by French Gen.
Pierre de Saqui de Sannes. Ivanovic said Serbs cannot accept the
move and warned that it could spell trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The only civilians who would be allowed in the zone are those
who live there, Ivanovic said -- meaning Serb bridge guards would be
required to leave the area.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians who used to live in the neighborhood are afraid
to return as long as the Serb guards remain there. The Serbs,
however, consider the guards their only reliable defense against
revenge-seeking ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ''This measure will create greater tension, and I think that it
will lead to a certain amount of conflict and I think it could lead
to the expulsion of Serbs or their fleeing the area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic said he was told that NATO's commander in Kosovo, Gen.
Klaus Reinhardt, and the chief U.N. administrator, Bernard
Kouchner, were expected here today to oversee the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have our army, we don't have our police. Therefore,
we aren't capable of resisting,'' Ivanovic said. ''We believe the
safety zone will become an area of insecurity.''

<HEADLINE> Ross' attorneys present evidence omitted from first trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) -- Evidence the state Supreme Court ruled
was improperly withheld from Michael Ross' defense before he was
sentenced to die was presented to jurors at the serial killer's
second penalty hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The defense rested Tuesday after attorney Barry Butler read to
the jury a letter written by Dr. Robert Miller, a former
prosecution psychiatrist, in an attempt to show the existence of a
mitigating factor in Ross' life that would spare him the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't see how I could testify to psychopathology not playing
a mitigating role in the type of penalty,'' Miller wrote 13 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was sentenced to die in 1987 for the murders of four young
women in Eastern Connecticut and currently is serving two life
sentences for two other killings.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, which upheld Ross' capital felony
convictions, ordered the new penalty hearing after ruling the
exclusion of Miller's letter in the first trial prevented the
defense from possibly swaying the jury to impose a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Miller letter goes to the core of this case,'' Butler
said. ''The Supreme Court seized on this very document in their
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense has attempted to build an argument that Ross suffers
a mental defect rendering him unable to control his actions.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution disagrees, and argued Ross had no remorse in the
killing of the four women.
</P>
<P>
   If the defense can show the existence of a single mitigating
factor, Ross must be sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to end the case came as a surprise, because several
people on the defense witness list, including the Most Rev. Daniel
P. Hart, Roman Catholic bishop of Norwich, were not called to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   The court recessed until Friday, when rebuttal arguments are
expected to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Thomas P. Miano said the matter could go to
the jury for deliberation as early as Tuesday.

Bush, Gore Prepare for Battle Ahead
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Their presidential nominations at last secured, Al
Gore and George W. Bush dug in for the eight-month battle to November. Bush
declared his mission is ''ending the Clinton-Gore era'' while Gore warned that
Bush would resurrect the policies of his father that ''drove our economy into
the ditch.'' Bush also brushed off as a stunt Gore's latest challenge, his
promise to hold off on television ads funded by ''soft money'' as long as Bush
does, too. The son of a president who lost the White House in 1992 to Democrats
Bill Clinton and Al Gore, Bush cast his own Republican effort as pay back for
his father's defeat.

Judges Rule Finances Can Be Released
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Financial disclosure reports on about 1,600 federal judges
are coming soon to the Internet. Despite concerns that such postings could cause
security problems for judges, the U.S. Judicial Conference, the judiciary's
policy-making body, said Tuesday it had reversed a committee's decision last
year to refuse to provide the reports to the Web site APBnews.com. APBnews.com
sued, and the Judicial Conference, prodded by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, voted 16-8 to reverse the committee's action. ''We think this is a
victory both for the online public and the American public,'' Mark Sauter,
APBnews.com's chief operating officer, said. ''It reaffirms the right the public
has to see public documents in the most convenient and expeditious manner.''

White House Knocks GOP Budget
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans say their $1.8 trillion budget for fiscal 2001
maps sensible levels of spending and tax cuts -- and ensures a clash with
President Clinton. ''We don't have a huge bunch of spending, we don't increase
taxes, and we don't spend the Social Security surplus,'' House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas, said Tuesday. ''I know he doesn't like that,'' he said of
Clinton. The GOP package proposes at least $150 billion in tax cuts from 2001
through 2005, about $50 billion more than Clinton wants.

Supplements May Help Arthritis
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Two popular nutritional supplements won't cure arthritis but
might have fewer side effects than traditional treatments, concludes an analysis
of 15 studies published today. But much of the research on glucosamine and
chondroitin compounds is flawed and probably overstates their benefits so more
study is needed to determine if they really help achy joints, according to the
analysis in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The supplements are
marketed as treatments for osteoarthritis, the degenerative joint disease that
afflicts about 21 million people nationwide.

Drugs Lower Angioplasty Risk
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- New clot-blocking drugs cut the risk of serious
complications nearly in half after angioplasty and should be routinely given to
the 600,000 Americans who undergo the heart procedure every year, according to
doctors. The leading drug in the new category, ReoPro, is given to the
one-quarter of angioplasty patients who are considered at especially high risk.
Doctors say the main reason it's not more widely used is the high cost -- about
$1,500 for one course of treatment. A new study shows that a similar competing
drug, Integrilin, is highly effective in the three-quarters of patients
undergoing routine angioplasty who do not get ReoPro. The cost is much less,
about $400 per patient, partly because ReoPro is more expensive to produce.

First Somali TV on Air Since 1991

   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- For the first time since civil war broke out
nearly a decade ago, Somalis can tune in to local television stations and watch
programming in their own language. On Tuesday, the Somali Television Network
became the second private station to broadcast local content programming.
HornAfrique, the first, went on the air March 3. The advent of two private TV
stations is another sign that despite continuing insecurity, things are
improving in Somalia. ''We are being motivated by the desperate need of the
people for a Somali-speaking television,'' said Ali Iman Sharmarkeh, head of
HornAfrique Media.

Tuesday night with a 4-3 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. After losing
captain Saku Koivu for the rest of the season with a knee injury Saturday night,
Montreal also lost center Trevor Linden with broken ribs. Linden scored his 13th
goal on the Canadiens' first shot at 2:51 of the first to tie it 1-1.

<HEADLINE> First lady drew cash from Pakistanis, as president pondered visit  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Those who think they can gain White House
influence through a check to Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S. Senate
campaign are wrong, the first lady says.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anybody thinks they can influence the president by making a
contribution to me they are dead wrong,'' Clinton said Tuesday
after a campaign event in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady defended her decision to take thousands of
dollars from Pakistani-Americans as negotiations were underway at
the White House over whether the president should visit Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser in question -- a $1,000-a-person dinner held Feb.
22 on Staten Island -- gave contributors a chance to spend two hours
pressing the first lady on why the president should visit Pakistan
and become involved in the dispute over Kashmir, a Himalayan
territory also claimed by India. It raised $50,000 for Mrs.
Clinton's Senate bid against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a brief stopover in Pakistan was added to the
president's planned tour of South Asia that begins Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she had spoken with the president about visiting
Pakistan after the fund-raiser, the first lady said, ''I don't talk
about what I talked to the president about on any issue.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was nothing illegal about the fund-raiser, Scott
Harshbarger, president of the advocacy group Common Cause, said it
still feeds the perception that access can be bought.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we find troubling is that a group of Americans are being
told that the price of admission is $50,000 to have access to a
future U.S. Senator,'' Harshbarger said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the fund-raising event, Clinton said she hoped her husband
would visit Pakistan, her campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson
confirmed. But Wolfson stressed that the president has been saying
for more than a year he would like to visit Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has denied that the first lady played a role in
the president's choice to go to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The contentious relationship with India made the decision to
visit Pakistan a difficult one for the Clinton administration. The
world's two newest nuclear countries reached the brink of war last
summer. Tensions were heightened again last October by a military
coup in Pakistan and the Christmas-eve hijacking of an Indian
Airlines plane with what many in India believe was Pakistan's
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The February fund-raiser was hosted by Suhail Muzaffar, a Staten
Island businessman, and Asim Malik, a Long Island doctor, on behalf
of the Pakistani community on Staten Island and Pakistani-American
Physicians Political Action Committee, according to The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers told The Times they had pushed the event to an
earlier date so that it could take place before the president's
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it went very well, in terms of the message and the
timeliness of it, especially in terms of the president's going to
the region,'' Muzaffar said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in attendance was Lanny Davis, a special counsel to the
president during the fallout from the 1996 fundraising scandals.
Davis, now a lobbyist for the Pakistani government, has urged the
president to visit Pakistan and said there was nothing unseemly
about the first lady's fund raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is there anything wrong with people concerned about issues to
raise those issues with a candidate?'' Davis said Tuesday. ''That's
about as shocking as finding gambling at Rick's casino.''
</P>
<P>
   News of Clinton's attendance at the fund raiser was first
reported in the Staten Island Advance and picked up by newspapers
in India.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson pointed out that the first lady has also taken donations
from Indian-American contributors largely opposed to the president
visiting Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just Clinton's ties to the president that are drawing
Pakistanis to support her Senate bid. Some are unhappy with
Giuliani's crackdown on taxi cab drivers and street vendors, many
of whom are Pakistani.

   Giuliani said little about Clinton's fund-raiser at a news
conference at City Hall on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever happened with Pakistan -- or didn't happen -- I don't
know. Somebody else can figure that out,'' the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Pitch Perfect Game  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Roger Maris temporarily got an asterisk
when he needed more than 154 games to break Babe Ruth's home run
record. When the strike canceled the 1994 World Series, the Toronto
Blue Jays got to call themselves champions for another year.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of tainted baseball achievements, add this: The
Boston Red Sox pitched their first perfect game since Cy Young, but
they did it in an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care if it's spring training or not,'' catcher Joe
Sidall said Tuesday after six Boston pitchers combined on the 5-0
victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. ''We've got a lot of pride, and
we're trying to do the best we can. Everybody strives for
perfection, and to achieve it is an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez struck out six in three innings, then Fernando De
La Cruz pitched two innings and Dan Smith, Rheal Cormier, Rich
Garces and Rod Beck one apiece. Nomar Garciaparra homered and drove
in four runs for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   As its name suggests, the perfect game -- 27 up, 27 down -- is
considered the ultimate baseball accomplishment. There have been 14
perfect games in the modern era, most recently David Cone's for the
New York Yankees last July 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox haven't had a regular-season perfect game since
Young pitched the first of the modern era on May 5, 1904. No Boston
pitcher has pitched a no-hitter since Dave Morehead in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no formal records kept for no-hitters in spring
training exhibitions. The last no-hitter in spring training was on
March 16, 1996, when California beat San Francisco 15-0.
</P>
<P>
   As baseball accomplishments go, this one was more like the home
run that went over the right-field wall off Jose Canseco's head
than Don Larsen pitching a perfect game in the 1956 World Series:
It was memorable, even noteworthy, but not important.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll take it,'' Garces said. ''It's kind of exciting.
Hopefully, it will happen in a real game.''
</P>
<P>
   The achievement inspired so little awe, in fact, that fans were
streaming out of the park in the late innings, and several of the
pitchers involved didn't know what they'd done until later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had no clue. Someone just told me,'' Cormier, who pitched
the seventh inning, said about 20 minutes after the game. ''It
would probably be more exciting if you were watching the whole
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Players don't always sit in the dugout for the whole game in
spring training. Starters who are taken out early run sprints in
the outfield, get treatment in the clubhouse and sometimes leave.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who threw nine innings of a perfect game in 1995
before allowing a hit to lead off the 10th, was talking to
reporters outside the Boston clubhouse when the last out was
broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pitched a perfect game!'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Although many fans had left, those who remained stood and
cheered for the final outs. Beck knew something was going on
because Sidall celebrated every strike, but the reliever had to
wait until the last out in the ninth to find out what was up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm kind of embarrassed about that,'' Beck confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Woodward hit a fly ball to the warning track for the
second-to-last out. When Alberto Castillo struck out, ending the
game, Sidall pumped his arm and ran out to greet Beck -- and tell
him what he'd done.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pointed to the scoreboard and said, 'I think that's right,'
'' said Sidall, who caught a no-hitter in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Although a regular-season perfect game is usually celebrated
with a pileup on the mound, the Red Sox shook hands and headed back
for the clubhouse. Beck made sure Martinez got the game ball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew what was going on. You see three eggs on the wall,
you're hoping for nine before it,'' manager Jimy Williams said,
referring to all the zeros on the scoreboard. ''You put a dozen
eggs on the wall, that's a pretty good indication that you've got a
pretty good chance to win.''

<HEADLINE> Rocker Pitches Perfect Inning  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- A standing ovation didn't surprise John
Rocker, who didn't have to throw a pitch to claim a personal
victory in his spring debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta reliever took another step to put a turbulent
offseason behind him, pitching a perfect ninth inning Tuesday night
in a 4-0 exhibition win over the Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said his control could have been sharper, though he only
needed 13 pitches to retire Gregg Jefferies, Javier Cardona and
Robert Fick to finish a three-hitter by Braves pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Fans stood and cheered at the end, just as they did when he
sprinted to the mound from the right-field bullpen for the first
time since the World Series -- and the controversial magazine
interview that resulted in his suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing I got out of the standing ovation was it
finally showed you people in the media that not everybody is
against me, the 25-year-old left-hander said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been running into nothing but positives ever since all
this stuff happened ... And yet every night I turn the TV on and
see how horrible a person everyone says I am. I don't see it in the
public when I'm out. Now maybe some people will say, 'Not everyone
is against him,' like the majority of the media is trying to make
it be.''
</P>
<P>
   The outing didn't attract the horde of reporters that Rocker's
arrival to spring training did two weeks ago. However, it was an
overwhelming hit at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   The game drew a record 10,078 to the Braves' spring training
complex at Disney World, including one young fan who held up a
''Rocker for President'' sign when the reliever entered the game.
</P>
<P>
   And while Schuerholz and manager Bobby Cox insisted the game was
like any other exhibition for the Braves, the only thing routine
about the night was Rocker's performance.
</P>
<P>
   He saved 38 games to help Atlanta win the NL pennant last
season, and it didn't look like missing two weeks of spring
training set him back far, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was disappointed with my control, pleased with my stuff,''
said Rocker, who threw three straight balls to Jefferies before the
Tigers outfielder took a called strike and then popped out to third
base.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the left-hander's last 10 pitches were for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told everyone I was going to come and throw 75 to 80 percent
to let myself get in shape first. I can't pitch like that. I tried
it. I can't do it ... My fastball was really good in the pen. My
slider was really bad in the pen. It was kind of reversed on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardona grounded to third before Fick struck out to end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said that from his perspective, it was difficult to consider
the outing anything but an opportunity to get ready for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He threw like we thought he was going to throw,'' the manager
said. ''It was his first time out, but it looked like his fifth. He
was outstanding. All of our pitchers were.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager also said the reception from the crowd, the largest
for a Braves home game since the team moved its spring training
camp to Disney in 1998, was predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody's willing to give people a second chance,'' Cox
said. ''He's getting his second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Fick, who struck out on a 2-2 pitch, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know what? People say things. People make mistakes. He's
not a drug addict. I've made mistakes. We all do,'' Fick said.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was suspended for all of spring training and the first 28
days of the season by commissioner Bud Selig after the reliever's
disparaging comments about minorities, gays and foreigners were
published in Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   But an arbitrator allowed the pitcher to report March 2, cut the
regular-season suspension to two weeks and reduced a $20,000 fine
to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Rocker got a feel for what kind of crowd was in
the stands when he worked his way up the right-field foul line,
signing autographs and chatting with fans crammed against a
railing.
</P>
<P>
   Two amusement park security guards, dressed in black-and-white
striped referee's shirts, accompanied him and kept a group of
photographers and television cameramen out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Atlanta's regulars showered and left the complex by the
end of the game. Rocker finished a postgame workout before speaking
with reporters, he said, ''out of respect for Cox.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It just seemed like another night to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pitched 75 games last year -- 10, 15 spring training games.
Once again, the media is out here making a big deal out of it. It
was an inning of a meaningless spring training game.''

<HEADLINE> Parties Mull 2004 Campaign Changes  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Al Gore and George W. Bush campaign for
the White House, the Democratic and Republican parties both are
looking at changes in the presidential primary system to keep
future nominations from being settled so swiftly that voters lose
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, keeping them interested is the challenge now facing the
vice president and the Texas governor after both beat challengers
in coast-to-coast primaries last week, before capturing on Tuesday
night the delegate majorities that will make them the nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said voters may go into a period of political hibernation
in the months ahead, but he and Gore can't afford a campaign
standstill in the longest head-on contest for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The front-loaded primary and caucus schedule, which got that way
as states moved up their primaries in order to gain influence in
the campaign, enabled the 2000 nominees to clinch delegate
victories earlier than previous candidates, except unopposed
presidents seeking renomination.
</P>
<P>
   Six states voted in the no-contest campaign Tuesday, bringing to
28 the number of states awarding delegates in one party or both in
just eight days, since the Democrats resumed voting.
</P>
<P>
   Until the first Tuesday in March, only Iowa and New Hampshire
were allowed to start selecting Democratic delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Oklahoma
helped Bush and Gore clinch the nominations Tuesday night, in
voting that reflected an attempt dating from 1988 to have the South
vote on the same day so as to strengthen its regional hand. Three
of the states that were part of that combination have since moved
up a week, and Florida party leaders already are talking about
doing so in 2004 so that their primary won't be, as one said,
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   Gore swept the March 7 primaries, ending Bill Bradley's
challenge. Bush won the major Republican contests that day, and
John McCain dropped his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So a week later was too late to do anything but ratify the
outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Before this campaign started, the Republican and Democratic
national committees began weighing the nomination process for the
next one, with panels considering whether to seek a more measured
pace for the 2004 primary calendar and beyond. Even if they decide
to try, history and political reality put the odds against them.
</P>
<P>
   There's been talk of change for more than 20 years, perhaps to a
system of regional primaries, which is one of the options now.
</P>
<P>
   But the obstacles that always have blocked changes in the
primary process are still there. Both parties would have to sign
off on the same plan to make it work. Or Congress would have to
step in where it has been wary of treading, and enact a law
creating a presidential primary framework, over the certain
protests of the states.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have tried before, and the Democrats did set rules
on when a state can vote, with penalties to enforce them. They let
Iowa and New Hampshire go first, and require that the rest of their
delegates be awarded between the first Tuesday in March and the
second Tuesday in June.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tried to discourage primary leapfrogging by offering
a 10 percent delegate bonus to reward states that would wait. That
didn't work because extra delegates are no lure when they won't be
chosen until the contest is over.
</P>
<P>
   So to change the system, the Republicans would have to tell
their state parties what to do, which goes against their grain.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a big philosophical hurdle in our party,'' said
Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson. But he added
that it should be confronted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think change is badly needed,'' Nicholson said in an
interview. ''If we don't change it, we're headed inexorably to a
national primary day, and I think that would be bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Without change, he said smaller and later states will have
neither influence nor an incentive to turn out voters. ''It's just
going to continue to get worse until we do something,'' Nicholson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal has got to be voter participation,'' said Democratic
National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew. ''Not just a rigid system
that tries to spread things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said timing isn't the only issue. He said the Democrats
took a major step to open the process by barring winner-take-all
primaries and awarding delegates in proportion to the popular vote.
Had the Republicans done so, he said McCain would still be
competing.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said the GOP committee studying the primary system is
looking at that question. But ending winner-take-all rules is
another matter. In New York, where Bush won the primary last week,
Gov. George Pataki is now proposing to change to a winner-take-all
GOP primary in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Trade Talk Follows Angels' Edmonds  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Despite an offseason full of rumors, Jim
Edmonds is still where he's always been as a major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation had him playing in Seattle by now, or maybe Oakland
or even New York. But Edmonds remains the Anaheim Angels' starting
center fielder. At least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody says I'm getting traded, but our front office says
I'm not,'' Edmonds said. ''Who do you believe? I've heard them say
I'll be in the opening-day lineup, but then I hear they're calling
everyone about me. I'm not naive. I know what's going on out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   With Darryl Strawberry suspended and George Steinbrenner growing
disillusioned with Ricky Ledee, the Yankees might be the most
likely team to acquire Edmonds at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's interest has cooled with the surprising play of
Terrence Long in spring training. Long is hitting .469 with 17 RBIs
in 32 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is hesitant to trade for the potential free agent unless
they can sign him to a long-term deal -- something Edmonds insists
he won't do for any team.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Yankees, who have the players and the
willingness to wait until after the season to talk contract.
</P>
<P>
   While Angels general manager Bill Stoneman has said he needs to
be ''overwhelmed'' to trade his starting center fielder, a scare
with rookie right-hander Ramon Ortiz could change all of that.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz was scratched from his start Monday with tightness in his
right biceps. The injury is not believed to be serious, although it
does raise questions. Anaheim already had a surplus of outfielders
-- with Garret Anderson, Tim Salmon and Darrin Erstad -- and a need
to shore up a shaky pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels could be going into the season with a rotation of
Ortiz, Ken Hill, Tom Candiotti, Kent Mercker and Jarrod Washburn --
a group that went a combined 22-30 last year.
</P>
<P>
   That has piqued their interest in New York's Ramiro Mendoza, 9-9
with a 4.29 ERA last season as he shuttled between the rotation and
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But Yankees manager Joe Torre is wary about parting with
Mendoza, who provides insurance for the rotation if rookie Ed
Yarnall shows he's not ready for the big leagues or if age catches
up to David Cone or Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as Mendoza proved in last year's playoffs against Boston,
the right-hander could be Torre's most valuable set-up man in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can we be a better offense team? Possibly,'' Torre said. ''But
at the expense of taking away from your strength. Then you have to
make a decision. Unless there is a gaping hole, I'm reluctant to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with Strawberry gone, Ledee struggling and Shane Spencer
and Roberto Kelly unable to seize either the left field or DH job,
Torre doesn't believe there is a gaping hole in New York's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have enough bodies here,'' Torre said. ''I'm sure
we can cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   New York also might part with shortstop prospect Alfonso
Soriano. The Yankees have been giving Soriano time at second base
recently, which just happens to be one of the positions the Angels
would like to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds not only would fill an immediate need for New York as a
left-handed power hitter who averaged nearly 28 homers a year
between 1995-98, he also provides insurance if Paul O'Neill decides
to retire after the season.
</P>
<P>
   But getting him could create an ego clash in the outfield for
New York, where three-time Gold Glove winner Bernie Williams is
already entrenched in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Torre is loyal and would prefer to keep Williams there, while
Edmonds, a two-time Gold Glove winner himself, expressed doubts
about changing positions earlier this spring. He has changed his
tune recently.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to happen,'' Edmonds said of a trade. ''But I'd
play third base if it meant I could win a World Series.''

<HEADLINE> FBI's Most Wanted List Turns 50  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At age 50, the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives
list has international criminals not seen in earlier decades. And
it appears on the Internet now, not just in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have heightened the FBI's enthusiasm for the
program, which celebrated its 50th anniversary Tuesday and was
lauded by the bureau as a partnership among the public, the media
and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1950, 458 people have been listed and 429 of them have
been captured. Tips from citizens are credited with 137 of the
apprehensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a tremendous success because of the media's interest
and the public's interest,'' said Deputy FBI Director Thomas
Pickard, dedicating an updated most-wanted exhibit on the public
tour at bureau headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Most Wanted Internet page is credited with a major role in
the 1996 apprehension of Leslie Isben Rogge after six years on the
list, Pickard noted. The 56-year-old bank robber eluded capture by
living under an assumed name in Guatemala until a 14-year-old
American boy there, whose computer Rogge had hooked up as a favor,
found his wanted picture on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Pickard said the list has changed with crime trends. The 1950s
list contained mostly bank robbers, burglars and car thieves.
During the political turmoil of the 1960s, destruction of
government property, sabotage and kidnapping emerged as more
frequent charges.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, organized crime figures and terrorists dominated
the list. These days, the list regularly includes international
terrorists, major international drug dealers, anti-abortionists
charged with lethal violence, and organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI offers a $50,000 reward for any tip that leads to an
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Criminals are put on if they face federal charges, are
considered particularly dangerous and if publicity would help catch
them. They are taken off when arrested or if federal charges are
dropped, they die or no longer fit the other criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The shortest stay was two hours by Billie Austin Bryant on Jan.
8, 1969, after he fatally shot two FBI agents in Washington, D.C.
He was arrested four blocks from his home where the shooting had
occurred
</P>
<P>
   Donald Eugene Webb, wanted in connection with the 1980 murder of
a Saxonburg, Pa., police chief, has the longest tenure. He was
added to the list May 4, 1981 and remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's 1949 story on the toughest guys sought by the
bureau brought such a response that Director J. Edgar Hoover made
the list permanent a year later. The list also has expanded to
radio and television programs, like Fox's ''America's Most
Wanted.'' The Internet site is at
http://www.fbi.gov/mostwanted.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Webb, the current list includes:
</P>
<P>
   --Ramon Eduardo Arellano-Felix, a leader of the Tijuana
drug-trafficking cartel in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   --Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi Arabian exile now in
Afghanistan, charged with directing the 1998 bombings of U.S.
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   --James J. ''Whitey'' Bulger, a Boston organized crime leader.
Bulger fled after then-FBI agent John J. Connolly Jr. warned him he
was about to be indicted, according to another federal indictment.
Connolly had used Bulger as an informant.
</P>
<P>
   --Victor Manuel Gerena, wanted in connection with the 1983 armed
robbery of $7 million from a West Hartford, Conn., security
company.
</P>
<P>
   --Glen Stewart Godwin, a convicted murderer who escaped from a
California prison in 1987 and a Mexican prison in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   --James Charles Kopp, charged with the 1998 killing of a doctor
who performed legal abortions in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   --Eric Robert Rudolph, charged with fatal bombings at the Atlanta
Olympics in 1996 and a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   --Agustin Vasquez-Mendoza, charged in connection with the 1994
murder of an undercover U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   --Arthur Lee Washington, Jr., sought in connection with the
attempted murder of a New Jersey state trooper in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan President Battles Rumors  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's president today denied rumors
that he is secretly urging supporters to dump his ruling
Nationalist Party's candidate and support the opposition's
presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a white Nationalist campaign jacket instead of his usual
dark suit, President Lee Teng-hui assured party leaders at their
weekly meeting that he still backs Lien Chan in Saturday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more votes Lien gets, the more secure our country will
be,'' Lee said about his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   He urged supporters not to listen to rumors spread by what he
described as dirty tricks squads deployed by the two other top
candidates in the tight race, Taiwan's second direct presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's critics within his party have long suspected that the
popular president is closer to candidate Chen Shui-bian of the
Democratic Progressive Party. Chen has supported Taiwanese
independence, and many believe Lee secretly shares this view.
However, Chen has softened his stance on independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who will retire, easily won the island's first direct
presidential election in 1996. ''People are trying to judge whether
he is throwing his weight behind Lien or Chen,'' said Joseph Wu,
deputy director of the Institute of International Relations in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding the rumors, some close Lee supporters have endorsed Chen
in recent days, saying the candidate would be more likely to carry
on the ''Lee Teng-hui line.'' Many believe Lien may abandon crucial
parts of Lee's China policy, which insists the two sides should
discuss their differences as equals.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is Lee's hatred of independent candidate James
Soong, a former protege of the president who was expelled from the
party for running against Lien.
</P>
<P>
   Today, while Lee reaffirmed his belief that Lien would be best
able to deal with rival China, Soong told reporters at a news
conference that he would be the best negotiator with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not only the favored leader of the people here but also
the favored leader of this region,'' Soong said. ''Not only favored
by neighboring countries like (China) but also by the U.S. and
Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party today
defended Beijing's right to use force to keep Taiwan from declaring
independence.
</P>
<P>
   A commentary in the People's Daily, the ruling party's flagship
newspaper, claimed a victory for Beijing, suggesting that it
successfully pressured pro-independence candidates to moderate
their stances ahead of Taiwan's election.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of independence ''recently have had to temporarily
pack up the banner of Taiwan independence'' because of ''strong
pressure from the Chinese government and Taiwanese voters' desire
for peace and stability,'' said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
   To steer voters away from pro-independence candidates, Beijing
has repeatedly threatened in recent weeks to attack Taiwan if it
declares independence or indefinitely rebuffs demands for talks on
unification.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan split amid civil war in 1949. But Beijing still
regards the island as part of its territory, to be united by force
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Taiwan's slumping stock market closed 195.55 points,
or 2.2 percent, lower, despite buying by government-linked funds.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said nervous investors have been selling stocks
this week, fearing that post-election political changes could hurt
the market.

<HEADLINE> China Text Leaves Opponents Unmoved  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is hoping that
release of the full text of its sweeping trade agreement with China
will help round up the congressional votes needed for passage.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say nothing in the 250 pages should persuade
wavering lawmakers to vote yes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The big news on the release of the trade deal with China is
what's not in it,'' House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan
said Tuesday. ''There is nothing on worker rights, nothing on the
environment, nothing on human rights or democratization and no
strong enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials sent the text of the agreement Tuesday
to every member of Congress and released it to news organizations,
hoping to counter attacks from critics who argue that Congress
should not vote on a deal that voters could not see.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that once people have reviewed the agreement,
they will see for themselves that this is a tremendous deal for
American workers, farmers and businesses,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations last November, China offered to open its vast
market in return for U.S. support for China's membership in the
World Trade Organization. Under WTO rules, however, American
exporters cannot receive benefits of the reduced trade barriers
until Congress scraps its annual reviews of China's trade
privileges in the U.S. market and bestows low tariff rates
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents charged that the wording of the text released by the
administration raised serious questions about how enforceable
China's commitments were.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, various U.S. administrations have
negotiated deals to open China's markets to American companies only
to complain later that China did not live up to its commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have is the same mushy language we have had in the
past,'' said Scott Nova, director of the Citizens Trade Campaign,
one of the consumer groups joined with organized labor and
environmental organizations to fight the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, however, argued that the deal reveals
specific language, including target deadlines, by which time China
has promised to dismantle a host of trade barriers that American
exporters have long complained about.
</P>
<P>
   ''To those who are concerned that these commitments by China
will not be honored, let me assure you that we are already
preparing for the most intensive enforcement effort ever mounted
for a single trade agreement,'' U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence
Summers said Tuesday in a speech to the American Electronics
Association.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration expects China's permanent trade status
to win Senate approval with little difficulty, the legislation
faces a difficult struggle in the House, where labor unions are
putting pressure on Democratic lawmakers to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has said the
administration will have to come up with 100 Democratic votes
before he will call up the measure for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said he believed two-thirds of the 211 House Democrats
will oppose, which would give the president only 70 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier, R-Calif., said Tuesday
that release of the actual text should make the job of supporters
easier. But he agreed with Hastert that a full vote is impossible
until Republicans are assured of sufficient Democratic support.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been holding a series of meetings with
lawmakers at the White House, but Republican leaders have
complained that he and Vice President Al Gore have not done enough
to round up Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky's office said Tuesday that a decision has not been
made whether to post the text on the Internet. It covers specific
tariff cuts and trade barrier reductions for more than 5,000
products and services.

<HEADLINE> Eight Texans Seek Archer Seat  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Rep. John Culberson emerged from a field of eight
Republican candidates as the top vote-getter in the state primary
Tuesday for a chance to replace retiring House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Bill Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Culberson fell short of the majority needed for an outright
victory and will face businessman Peter Wareing in an April 11
runoff in the solidly Republican 7th District centered in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual GOP nominee is considered a shoo-in this November
against Jeff Sell, the lone Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who went to Congress in 1970 replacing future President
George Bush, was the only one in Texas' 30-member House delegation
not to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In East Texas, actor Noble Willingham of ''Walker, Texas
Ranger'' fame won the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Rep. Max
Sandlin, who defeated a primary challenge from a plumber.
</P>
<P>
   And in Dallas, former Clinton White House official Regina
Montoya Coggins easily turned back a primary opponent and will face
Republican Rep. Pete Sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was unopposed in her
primary as she bids for a second full term. Democratic Party
leaders pinned their hopes on Charles Gandy, who served one term in
the Legislature in the early 1980s. But Gene Kelly, a retired Air
Force lawyer who has lost six previous statewide bids, snared the
top berth in the April runoff and Gandy was in a tight battle for
second place.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republicans also approved a non-binding resolution
supporting voluntary student-led prayer at sporting events. The
referendum was approved 94 percent to 6 percent in early returns.
Republicans called it a way for voters to speak up before the U.S.
Supreme Court hears arguments March 29 in a closely watched Texas
case involving student-led prayers before high school football
games.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
   --In Mississippi, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who is
seeking his third term, escaped a primary challenge. Troy D. Brown
Sr., an unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor last year,
will face national party committeeman Rickey Cole in the April 4
Democratic runoff. In the 4th Congressional District, District
Attorney Dunn Lampton beat off a primary challenge to face freshman
Democratic Rep. Ronnie Shows.
</P>
<P>
   --In Florida, two-term Orlando Mayor Glenda Hood easily won
re-election in a hotly contested race where the city's clogged
streets had become the central issue. In tiny Briny Breezes, an
oceanside mobile home park near Boca Raton, voters re-elected
77-year-old Mayor Robert Conkey, who spent $11 in his campaign. His
83-year-old opponent didn't spend a cent. No elected official in
the town has had any competition since 1977. And in Wilton Manors,
John Fiore, an openly gay city council member, was elected mayor of
the city north of Fort Lauderdale.

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged on Extradition Laws  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Siblings of the woman killed by former
counterculture guru Ira Einhorn have asked Congress to reform
extradition laws to make it easier to return fugitives to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a few black-and-white things left in this world,''
Buffy Hall, one of Holly Maddux's sisters, said at a news
conference outside the Capitol on Tuesday. ''This very much
addresses the issue of bringing countries into line to do what is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn, 59, fled the country in 1981, shortly before his trial
in a Pennsylvania court. The former prominent anti-war activist in
Philadelphia was sentenced in absentia to life in prison for
Maddux's 1977 slaying. The Tyler, Texas, woman's corpse was found
stuffed in a trunk in a closet at Einhorn's Philadelphia home.
</P>
<P>
   After living in England, Ireland and Sweden under false names,
Einhorn was arrested in France in June 1997. France's high court
threw out an appeal in May, leaving it up to Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin to sign an extradition decree.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn has denied killing Maddux but blames her death on a
conspiracy involving ''large intelligence agencies.'' Under a new
Pennsylvania law, he would face retrial on his return.
</P>
<P>
   The family is supporting legislation that would penalize people
in the United States who knowingly provide money to fugitives to
help them remain abroad. The law also would ban military or
economic assistance to any country that the State Department
classifies as uncooperative in helping return fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   It also would require the State Department to submit annual
reports on extradition to Congress that provide details about the
number of criminals awaiting extradition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials were not available for comment on
their position on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., the bill's sponsor, said it probably
would have no effect on the Einhorn case but would force countries
to cooperate and force the State Department to pay more attention
to extraditing criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he and Maddux's three sisters and a brother had a
''very positive'' meeting Monday with officials at the French
Embassy but said they had been given no timetable for Jospin to
sign the decree.

<HEADLINE> Demand outstrips capacity as new Stephen King story is publishedonline  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stephen King's latest story is definitely scary,
but not in the way he intended.
</P>
<P>
   The fright comes before you even read ''Riding the Bullet,''
which was published Tuesday only on the Internet. Web sites
including Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble.com were swamped by high
demand for the horror master's 66-page ghost story, and downloading
it was near impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the servers have reached 100 percent capacity and gone
over several times today,'' said Pat Eisemann, a spokeswoman for
Scribner, the co-publisher with King's Philtrum Press. ''Everybody
is pretty much crashing, and you can't get through.''
</P>
<P>
   The story went online at several book-related Web sites at 12:01
a.m. at a cost of $2.50, although Barnes &AMP; Noble made it available
for free on Tuesday and Amazon.com had no plans to charge for the
download.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press began trying to download ''Riding the
Bullet'' via Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon.com at 10 a.m. Tuesday and
had not succeeded by 3 a.m. today. Attempts to read the story using
Glassbook Reader, software that had to be downloaded first, were
met with, ''We're sorry. Due to overwhelming demand, we are
experiencing much greater load on our servers than normal. Please
try your download again later.''
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt posted on the Simon &AMP; Schuster Web site begins with a
college student learning that his mother has suffered a stroke. The
story is told in the first person and is set in Maine, King's home
state.
</P>
<P>
   King wrote the story while recuperating from near-fatal injuries
he sustained when he was hit by a van last June.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his secretary, the best-selling
author of more than 30 books said he was ''very excited at the
possibility of a new market opening up.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''and as a dedicated and long-term Mac user, I am
surprised and a little unhappy at how hard it is for Mac users to
access the story, but thank God for the Palm Pilot, which is making
it accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisemann, the Scribner spokeswoman, said Mac users were not able
to access the story Tuesday but the problem would be fixed as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're finding out through this what some of the glitches
are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While many books are available on the Internet, few prominent
writers have chosen to publish online only.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stephen King's decision to publish his new short story in
electronic format is a concrete declaration that the e-book format
has arrived,'' said Steve Riggio, vice chairman of Barnes &AMP;
Noble.com. ''We see a time in the not too distant future when
virtually every book in print will be available in both physical
and electronic formats.''
</P>
<P>
   King was more cautious in his own statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I think that the Internet and various computer
applications for stories have great promise, I don't think anything
will replace the printed word and the bound book,'' he said. ''Not
in my lifetime at least. At the end of the day, I am still a great
fan of hard copy, as my longtime secretary and personal assistant,
Marsha DeFilippo, will attest.''

<HEADLINE> Bourque Close To 400th Goal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A week ago, Ray Bourque's chances of getting 400
career goals before the end of the season were an afterthought.
Four games with the offensive minded Colorado Avalanche, and the
possibility doesn't seem so remote.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not after Bourque scored his 398th goal as the
Avalanche beat Anaheim 4-2 Tuesday night for their sixth straight
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I would get there this year,'' Bourque, in his
21st season, said. ''I had five to go when I got here and I have
scored three in four games. That is not like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque scored his third goal for the Avalanche, 4-0 since the
March 6 trade that brought the defenseman to Colorado from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew what we were getting,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley
said. ''He is a proven all-around defenseman, he is a great passer
with a great shot, and so far no one has been disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   In other NHL games, it was Tampa Bay 4, Montreal 3; and Detroit
3, Nashville 2 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque has also helped improve Colorado's power play. During
the last 10 games, the Avalanche have produced five power-play
goals, three by Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have so many options on our power play now,'' Hartley said.
''If they want to take Ray's shot away, it leaves more room for
Milan Hejduk, Peter Forsberg and Joe Sakic to work down low.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Or they can give Ray time to tee it up like he did tonight,''
Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque broke a 1-1 tie with his 13th goal at 2:20 of the third.
He also added an assist. Sakic also set up a goal and has 16 points
in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Sakic scored for the seventh time in as many games as the
Avalanche extended their lead in the Northwest Division to four
points over Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Tverdovsky and Ted Donato scored for Anaheim, winless in
three games (0-2-1). Dominic Roussel started in place of Mighty
Ducks goalie Guy Hebert, who was injured Saturday when hit by
teammate Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
Lightning 4, Canadiens 3
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Modin scored twice, and Vincent Lecavalier added his
20th goal as Tampa Bay ended a seven-game losing streak by winning
at Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Linden scored an early goal, but broke two ribs and is
out for the season. Montreal is in a seventh-place tie with
Pittsburgh in the playoff race, just a point ahead of Carolina and
the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
Red Wings 3, Predators 2, OT
</P>
<P>
   At Detroit, Brendan Shanahan scored his second goal of the game
4:10 into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Fedorov also scored for the Red Wings, who moved within
two points of idle St. Louis for first place in the Central
Division. Detroit, on a season-best eight-game unbeaten streak
(6-0-2) also got three assists from Nicklas Lidstrom and two from
Tomas Holmstrom.

<HEADLINE> Study: Diesel Exhausts Cause Cancer  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Toxic chemicals in diesel exhausts from trucks
and buses are responsible for at least 125,000 cancers over a
lifetime, according to a study by a coalition of state and local
air pollution control agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The state officials' report being released today comes as the
petroleum industry is stepping up a campaign to persuade the
Clinton administration to back off from plans for tougher pollution
controls on diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new regulations for diesel, now under review at the
White House, would not go into effect until 2006, industry groups
hoped the current turmoil about diesel fuel prices -- and to some
extent supply -- might help sway the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency's proposal, sent to the
White House Office of Management and Budget earlier this year,
would sharply reduce the sulfur content in diesel fuel and require
other pollution improvements.
</P>
<P>
   An EPA spokeswoman, Kim Ruby, declined to comment on the
proposal, except to say it had been sent to the White House. Some
industry groups and government sources said it would require sulfur
levels in diesel to be reduced from 500 parts per million to 15 per
million by 2006, though the specifics could still be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The state regulators, along with environmentalists and health
advocates, planned to release the new analysis on diesel and cancer
risks, partly in response to the industry push to try to get the
EPA regulation withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''These (diesel) fumes are putting us at risk of cancer, a risk
that can be almost completely eliminated with modern pollution
controls,'' said William Becker, executive director of the State
and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which represents state pollution control officials,
conducted the analysis that concludes an additional 125,000 people
would be expected to get lung cancer during their lifetime as a
result of exposure to chemicals and soot from diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said there have been many epidemiological studies linking
diesel soot and lung cancer and that the 125,110 estimated of
additional cancers was ''an extremely conservative figure'' using
the same methodology used by regulators in California in estimating
diesel-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The actual numbers of cancers could easily be 10 times as
high,'' maintained Becker.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, the
air pollution control agency in the Los Angeles area, concluded
that 70 percent of the total cancer risks from transportation
sources in the region came from diesel emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said his group's analysis used the California methodology
and extended it nationwide, using air pollution monitoring data
from both metropolitan and rural areas and accounting for
population distributions. It estimated 119,570 additional cancers
in metropolitan areas and 5,540 such additional cancers in rural
areas nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The state regulators as well as the American Lung Association
and several environmental groups including the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group and the Clean Air Network, maintain these health
statistics make a strong argument for pressing ahead with the
proposed EPA diesel rules.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter earlier this week to the EPA, nine organizations
representing a variety of interests from refiners and oil companies
to convenience store operators and farm cooperatives, urged that
the diesel rule be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''EPA's proposal for diesel sulfur is likely to reduce the
supply of diesel fuel as well as heating oil and even gasoline,''
they said in a letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner.
</P>
<P>
   The letter noted recent trucker protests about soaring prices
and said the EPA proposal was ''a blueprint for future shortages of
diesel and home heating oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Diesel prices have soared from a nationwide average of 96 cents
a gallon a year ago to more than an average of $1.50 a gallon,
according to the Energy Department, with prices in some areas of
more than $1.86 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The increases have been attributed by the Energy Department to
increases in crude oil costs and supply shortages caused by a
cutback in world oil production.

<HEADLINE> Judge calls Hamilton the 'gatekeeper' of the election fraud plan  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The political director for ousted Teamsters
President Ron Carey says he got so carried away in his desire to
free the union of corruption that he became corrupt himself.
</P>
<P>
   William W. Hamilton told U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa
that his crimes were meant to help keep the union out of the hands
of those who had corrupted it in the past. Griesa sentenced him to
three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes when you try to do something you believe in deeply,
you do dumb things, you cross the line, you overreach,'' he said at
the Tuesday sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Griesa said his desire to do right did not absolve him of his
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge also said it would be ''unreasonable and
unmerciful'' not to credit Hamilton for his devotion to public
service and civil rights causes throughout a 30-year career.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he somewhat reluctantly moved downward from
federal sentencing guidelines calling for a nearly four-year prison
term, as he is permitted to do for extraordinary public service.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was convicted of authorizing $885,000 in contributions
to four political organizations in 1996 in exchange for
contributions to Carey's 1996 re-election campaign. Prosecutors
said the amounts were staggering considering the union was nearly
broke.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Hamilton did not initiate that concept but he agreed to
play a role in it and his role was crucial,'' Griesa said. ''He
was, in effect, the gatekeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 57, was convicted last November after a three-week
trial for embezzlement, mail and wire fraud and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he was thrilled in 1989 when the federal
government seized control of the powerful Teamsters union -- which
has more than one million members -- through a consent order meant
to separate union from mob influence.
</P>
<P>
   He said his trial and conviction had been a ''degrading and
humiliating'' experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am ashamed and deeply angry at myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial featured testimony from Richard Sullivan, former
finance director of the Democratic National Committee. He said
President Clinton's close friend and chief fund-raiser, Terence
McAuliffe, urged him and others to find donors for Carey.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we could get a $50,000 donor to Carey, ... he knew we would
get $500,000 from the Teamsters,'' Sullivan said McAuliffe told
him. The union is not permitted to use its money to fund elections
for union members.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats failed to produce a donor and the Teamsters did
not make a donation. McAuliffe was not charged with any crime and
his lawyer, Richard Ben-Veniste, said he cooperated with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Carey narrowly defeated James P. Hoffa in the 1996 Teamsters
election, which was overturned after investigators found Carey's
campaign improperly benefited from donations the union made to
organizations.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper: Charges to be filed against Allegheny executives  </HEADLINE>
phqjkb1 charges today against the director and two other former
officials of the bankrupt Allegheny health system, alleging misuse
of endowment funds, anonymous sources told The Philadelphia
Inquirer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former CEO Sherif S. Abdelhak is scheduled to be arraigned in
Pittsburgh today, according to two law-enforcement officials who
spoke to the newspaper on condition of anonymity. Former chief
financial officer David McConnell and former general counsel Nancy
Wynstra also are to be arraigned today.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what charges would be filed and whether they
would be felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the trio, who once led the state's largest health
system, did not return repeated phone calls Tuesday. Wynstra
declined comment when she was reached at home. Abdelhak and
McConnell could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Attorney General Mike Fisher would not confirm
the report.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general filed a civil lawsuit last month against
Abdelhak, McConnell, Wynstra and five former Allegheny trustees
charging that they spent $78.5 million in restricted funds,
including medical endowments, before the system's Philadelphia-area
operations filed for bankruptcy in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In that lawsuit, Fisher accused Allegheny executives of
violating state law by diverting charitable assets to pay operating
expenses. Executives also may have used restricted funds to help
repay an $89 million loan to Mellon Bank and three other lenders.
At least five executives with ties to Mellon Bank were Allegheny
trustees; they have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The former executives have been under investigation for more
than a year by state and federal authorities, including the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Investors say that even as Allegheny executives were skimming
from endowment funds, the executives received pay raises, bonuses
and lavish expense accounts.
</P>
<P>
   After Allegheny's collapse, eight of its Philadelphia-area
hospitals were sold to Tenet Healthcare Corp., the nation's
second-largest for-profit hospital chain. Drexel University took
over Allegheny's medical university, which includes MCP Hahnemann
School of Medicine.

<HEADLINE> Judge finds solitary confinement was wrong for inmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Placing a convicted cop killer in
solitary confinement for more than four years after he refused to
testify against a co-defendant was inappropriate, a judge ruled.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Jonathan Feldman on Tuesday upheld a
jury's verdict that said David McClary suffered emotional distress
when he was placed in special housing units for 23 hours a day
after refusing to testify against Howard ''Pappy'' Mason.
</P>
<P>
   McClary, 34, was convicted of second-degree murder for the 1988
slaying of New York City police officer Edward Byrne and is serving
25 years to life in prison. Officials believed Mason was a New York
City drug kingpin and brought McClary to New York to testify when
Mason was charged with ordering McClary to kill Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   The jury last year awarded McClary $660,000. But Feldman called
that ''excessive'' and reduced the award to $237,500, the amount
McClary originally sought in his lawsuit against prison officials.
That equals about $125 for each day McClary spent in solitary
confinement, plus $50,000 for emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evaluating excessiveness in the context of an individual
spending four uninterrupted years in solitary confinement is no
easy task,'' Feldman said in a 36-page decision. He said McClary's
sentencing to isolation ''was potentially limitless, a fact that
exacerbated the damages he suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   McClary, who lived in Queens, was convicted of shooting Byrne as
the officer sat in a patrol car guarding the home of a drug-case
witness in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials had claimed the notoriety of McClary's crime
made it risky to put him in the general prison population, even
though that's where McClary began his term in Attica.
</P>
<P>
   Following his refusal to testify against Mason, McClary was
returned to Attica and subsequently sent to Wende Correctional
Facility near Buffalo. There he was placed in solitary confinement
for a total of four years, three months and 19 days.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman said McClary has 10 days to accept the new amount of
damages awarded or to seek a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   McClary remains in custody at Shawangunk Correctional Facility
in Ulster County with his first parole hearing scheduled for 2013.

<HEADLINE> Will Regis Be This Year's Lucci?  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that Susan Lucci has finally won, the
Daytime Emmys needs another lovable loser looking for that first
trophy. Would you believe Regis Philbin?
</P>
<P>
   The host of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' earned Daytime
Emmy nominations today for best game show host and best talk show
host.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin has been nominated seven times before for his role on
''Live with Regis and Kathie Lee,'' but has never won an Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' earned a nod for best game
show. Even though it is routinely the top-rated show in prime-time,
''Millionaire'' was shunted off to the Daytime Emmys, since there's
no game show category for prime-time Emmys. The move was made much
to the annoyance of ABC, the show's producer and Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why a prime-time show ends up on the Daytime
Emmys,'' Philbin said today. ''But I never understood the Daytime
Emmys all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   The soap opera ''The Young and the Restless'' earned a
staggering 28 nominations, more than twice its closest competitor,
''Sesame Street,'' which had 13.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin's ''Live with Regis and Kathie Lee'' will compete with
''Donny &AMP; Marie,'' ''The Martin Short Show,'' ''The Rosie O'Donnell
Show'' and ''The View'' for best talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee Gifford, who announced she will stop doing ''Live
with Regis and Kathie Lee'' this summer, shared a nomination with
Philbin for best talk show host. She's been nominated six times
before with no wins. In past years, the show itself has earned 25
nominations and zero wins.
</P>
<P>
   Lucci knows something about paying dues. She won her first
Daytime Emmy as best soap opera actress last year in her 19th try.
She was not nominated this year for her role as Erica Kane on ''All
My Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Nominees for best actress on a daytime soap opera were Finola
Hughes of ''All My Children''; Susan Flannery of ''The Bold and the
Beautiful''; Hillary B. Smith of ''One Life to Live''; Jeanne
Cooper of ''The Young and the Restless''; and Jess Walton of ''The
Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   Best actor nominees for soap operas were David Canary of ''All
My Children''; Anthony Geary of ''General Hospital''; Robert Woods
of ''One Life to Live''; Peter Bergman of ''The Young and the
Restless''; and Eric Braeden of ''The Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Philbin and Gifford, nominees for best talk show
host were Donny and Marie Osmond, Short, O'Donnell and the crew
from ''The View'': Barbara Walters, Meredith Vieira, Star Jones,
Joy Behar and Lisa Ling.
</P>
<P>
   Notably missing from the nominations for talk show and talk show
host was Oprah Winfrey, who has won 15 Daytime Emmys. She took
herself out of the running in both categories.
</P>
<P>
   Competing against Philbin for best game show host are Tom
Bergeron of ''Hollywood Squares''; Alex Trebek of ''Jeopardy''; Bob
Barker of ''The Price is Right'' and Pat Sajak of ''Wheel of
Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Best game show nominees include ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire''; ''Jeopardy''; ''The Price is Right''; ''Hollywood
Squares'' and ''Win Ben Stein's Money.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be given out May 19 in a ceremony at Radio City
Music Hall in New York, televised by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   The winners are selected by members of the National Academy of
Television Arts &AMP; Sciences and the Academy of Television Arts &AMP;
Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as
investors awaited a pair of inflation reports due out later this
week. Technology stocks fell, extending Tuesday's selloff.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 32.57 at 9,843.81.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 52.12 at 4,654.51, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 2.03 at 1,361.18.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's decline compounded its 341-point loss in the past
two sessions. Yahoo! was off 6 13/16 to 161 15/16 today, and Ariba
lost 13[ to 267 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in those shares, which have been among the market's top
performers in 2000, suggested investors are taking profits from
their sharp gains this year.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies, which led the market's decline on
Tuesday after the United States and Britain agreed to share data on
genetics, regained some ground today. Human Genome Sciences rose 3
31/64 to 127.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle rose 4\ to 81\. The company, a leading maker of business
software, said after the close of trading Tuesday that
third-quarter profits soared 160 percent, easily surpassing
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks, which have dramatically underperformed the
Nasdaq so far this year, were holding up better today, but still
had trouble attracting buyers. Technology stocks helped push the
Dow into positive territory, with Intel rising 3 3/16 to 121 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said investors were reluctant to take major new
positions in the days ahead of the government's reports on the
Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The PPI, due for release Thursday, and the CPI, due out Friday,
are closely watched gauges of inflationary pressures. The Federal
Reserve is expected to take both reports under consideration when
it meets next Tuesday to discuss interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street expect the Fed to raise rates. An increase
would be the fifth since last June, when the Fed began trying to
engineer a gradual slowdown in the economy to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 141.37 million
shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.80 to 566.19.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.3 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 2.0 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 2.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Census Want Illegals To Contribute  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the census well under way, federal
immigration officials have unveiled revised guidelines designed to
get more questionnaires back from illegal immigrants wary of
revealing information to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration and Naturalization Service executive associate
commissioner Michael Pearson, in a memo this week to regional
directors, said that while the agency would continue to enforce
immigration laws during the census period, ''steps will be taken to
avoid adverse effects on census participation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The willingness of illegal aliens to participate in Census
2000 depends much on their confidence that INS will not be able to
access the information collected,'' Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 2.4 million people have sent in their forms, Census
Director Kenneth Prewitt said Tuesday, urging the rest of the
country's citizens to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   With forms arriving at millions of homes this week, the early
returns represent about 2 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   ''So we have 98 percent to go,'' Prewitt observed.
</P>
<P>
   The national head count is required by the Constitution every 10
years. Unlike years past when census-takers went home to home, most
families are expected to reply by mail, though they can also answer
by e-mail or phone. If they don't do so, or if they live in some
rural areas, census workers will come knocking.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt stressed that any information provided on the forms is
confidential and cannot be obtained by any other government agency,
including INS, or a private individual.
</P>
<P>
   While some critics called for a moratorium on INS activities,
''we are pleased that the guidance significantly and clearly limits
enforcement activities during this critical period,'' said Karen
Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American
Legal Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Besides English, Census forms are available in Spanish, Chinese,
Korean, Vietnamese and Tagalog, the language of the Philippines. In
addition, written guides to the form are available in nearly 50
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have flooded a help line -- 1-800-471-9424 -- that
assists people filling out forms. On Monday, 636,000 calls came in.
</P>
<P>
   People can also ask questions online or file a short form at
http://www.census.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The count's original purpose was to allocate House seats
appropriately among the states. Today the figures are also used to
determine how best to distribute billions in federal dollars for
education, health, housing, police and other programs, making the
census vital to many communities.
</P>
<P>
   Most families will receive a basic short form with only a few
questions, while one in six homes receives a longer form seeking
more detail to establish a statistical profile of the nation.

<HEADLINE> Black Schools Kept in Loan Program  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON, AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government has spared 13 historically black colleges
from being cut from the federal student loan program after the
schools agreed on plans to get students to pay up.
</P>
<P>
   The schools risked losing their ability to take part in the loan
program because of high default rates by their students.
</P>
<P>
   Most steps to be taken involve working with students so they
understand their duty to repay the loans, said Greg Woods, chief
operating officer of the Student Financial Assistance office at the
Education Department in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Woods didn't know exactly how much money was at stake, but on
Tuesday said the 105 historically black colleges and universities
receive an average of $12 million each in grants and student loans.
Funding for the 13 schools would come to roughly $130 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically black schools serve 280,000 students in 20 states,
Washington and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They're attended by about
25 percent of blacks in higher education. A legacy of slavery and
legal segregation, the schools are singled out for their continuing
mission to educate blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 legislation, Congress required any school with a default
rate exceeding 25 percent to be cut automatically from the loan
program. But it exempted historically black colleges and
universities because of their mission. A 1998 amendment ended that
exemption on July. Of the 105 schools, just 13 schools ended up in
jeopardy after the exemption ended.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 16 months, school after school, the 13 institutions
negotiated a default management plan with the government and agreed
to get outside help, such as consultants or advisers, Woods said.
The last agreement was reached a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said many of the schools had already cut their defaults
below 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government's reversal in lifting the exemption caused
concern at Paul Quinn College in Dallas, said Gloria Richard, the
school's vice president for development. The private liberal arts
school with about 740 students was among the 13 required to provide
default management plans.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden, everyone has to provide our plans for a
situation that was created for us very quickly, and we did,''
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   A report last summer by the Student Loan Marketing Association,
the nation's leading financer of student loans, said historically
black schools could cut their high rate of student loan defaulters
by making sure more students graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The schools generally have three times more students failing to
repay federal loans than other institutions -- about 21 percent
compared with 7 percent -- the report found.
</P>
<P>
   While black colleges usually offer more open enrollment, they
also suffer from lower retention rates. And unlike other schools,
black colleges tend to lack institutional support, such as large
endowments and other donations, to help students pay for their
educations.

</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has been on a rocket ship, and I think investors
will work a bit harder to bring it down before it can start moving
higher again,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at
Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''The Nasdaq is in the midst of a corrective
process, which is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies, which led the market's decline on
Tuesday after the United States and Britain agreed to share data on
genetics, regained some ground today. Human Genome Sciences rose 3
31/64 to 127.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle rose 5 5/16 to 82 5/16. The company, a leading maker of
business software, said after the close of trading Tuesday that
third-quarter profits soared 160 percent, easily surpassing
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip stocks, which have dramatically underperformed the
Nasdaq so far this year, were holding up better today. Technology
stocks helped push the Dow into positive territory, with Intel
rising 3 to 120~.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Alcoa rose 1] to 62| and DuPont rose 2 to 49 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said investors were reluctant to take major new
positions in the days ahead of the government's reports on the
Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The PPI, due for release Thursday, and the CPI, due out Friday,
are closely watched gauges of inflationary pressures. The Federal
Reserve is expected to take both reports under consideration when
it meets next Tuesday to discuss interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street expect the Fed to raise rates. An increase
would be the fifth since last June, when the Fed began trying to
engineer a gradual slowdown in the economy to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 333.61 million
shares, behind Tuesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.16 to 566.83.

<HEADLINE> Demand outstrips capacity as new Stephen King story is publishedonline  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Getting a copy of Stephen King's new ghost story
is proving to be a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ''Riding the Bullet'' is available on the only on the Internet
and was made available at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. Web sites including
Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble.com were swamped by high demand for
the horror master's 66-page work, and downloading it was downright
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the servers have reached 100 percent capacity and gone
over several times today,'' said Pat Eisemann, a spokeswoman for
Scribner, the co-publisher with King's Philtrum Press. ''Everybody
is pretty much crashing and you can't get through.''
</P>
<P>
   The story went online at several book-related Web sites at a
cost of $2.50, although Barnes &AMP; Noble made it available for free
on Tuesday and Amazon has no plans to charge for the download at
all, according to company spokeswoman Kristin Schaefer.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press reporter began trying to download ''Riding
the Bullet'' via Barnes &AMP; Noble and Amazon at 10 a.m. Tuesday and
had not succeeded by 5 p.m. An attempt around 3 a.m. today also
fell short, as well as a try on Amazon around 9:15 a.m. The story
finally was downloaded from Amazon at 11:05 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   King wrote the story while recuperating from serious injuries he
sustained when he was hit by a van last June.
</P>
<P>
   While many books are available on the Internet, few prominent
writers have chosen to publish online only.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stephen King's decision to publish his new short story in
electronic format is a concrete declaration that the e-book format
has arrived,'' said Steve Riggio, vice chairman of Barnes &AMP;
Noble.com. ''We see a time in the not too distant future when
virtually every book in print will be available in both physical
and electronic formats.''
</P>
<P>
   King was more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I think that the Internet and various computer
applications for stories have great promise, I don't think anything
will replace the printed word and the bound book,'' he said in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> Books: Edward Kennedy Biography  </HEADLINE>
By LESLIE MILLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- It was midnight Good Friday nine years ago, and a
sad and restless Edward M. Kennedy could not sleep. He was haunted
by memories of Stephen Smith, his favorite brother-in-law, who had
just died.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who had a reputation for boozing and womanizing,
asked his son, Patrick, and his nephew, William Kennedy Smith, to
join him for a few drinks at one of Palm Beach's more fashionable
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Events that day would lead to rape charges against Smith, a
sensational trial, an acquittal -- and a low point in a Senate
career marred by recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   But the tawdry trial also was a turning point for a man now
hailed in a new book as one of the greatest senators in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   During the year of the trial, veteran New York Times reporter
Adam Clymer began writing a book about Kennedy, whom he met in 1955
when Kennedy started as left end for Harvard against Yale. His
book, ''Edward M. Kennedy: A Biography,'' provides a serious new
view of the Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer had in 1991 what he called a ''conceptual scoop'': the
iconoclastic idea that the Kennedy known as ''Teddy'' was a
towering political leader who had achieved more than his older
brothers, Sen. Robert Francis Kennedy and President John F.
Kennedy, both assassinated before they reached 50.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're used to Kennedys who stop in their 40s,'' Clymer said.
''He didn't die a hero's death. In that respect, he has suffered,
but his accomplishments, through a much longer career, exceed
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy helped bring about voting rights for blacks, greater
inclusion of women and the disabled in the workplace, a volunteer
military, the Meals on Wheels program, deregulation of the airlines
and the ending of parole in the federal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ''He deserves recognition not just as the leading Senator of his
time, but as one of the greats in its history,'' wrote Clymer in
the conclusion of the book, which was published in November.
</P>
<P>
   The view has become more accepted since Bill Clinton became
president, Clymer said in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   As Kennedy, 67, prepares for an easy race for an eighth term
this year, his legacy is likely to undergo re-examination --
especially after his recent hospitalization for pneumonia
underscored his mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer's 609-page book, though sometimes dry, covers the
scandals in Kennedy's life. It includes his expulsion from Harvard
as a freshman for cheating and his decision to leave the scene of a
fatal car accident in Chappaquiddick in 1969, which many believe
doomed his 1980 bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer argues that Kennedy's failings spurred him to greater
achievement -- a view Kennedy apparently endorses, having
autographed 130 copies of the book and given them to friends.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of nine, Kennedy was born into the wealthy
Irish-Catholic political dynasty in Boston. And as an inexperienced
30-year-old, he won a Senate seat from Massachusetts in 1962,
thanks to the popularity of his brother, the president.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately took to the Senate, said Clymer, who attributes
Kennedy's success to a knack for finding Republican allies and a
willingness to give others credit.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has shepherded many bills into law, only one bears his
name: the 1999 Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act,
which allows disabled people to keep their government health
insurance while working.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's most cherished goal of universal health insurance
eluded him, but he expanded neighborhood clinics, increased funding
for cancer research, made health insurance portable and speeded
approval of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clymer also reveals in his book Kennedy's previously unpublished
foreign-affairs achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ''He never wanted a committee seat on Foreign Affairs, because
he could always see foreign leaders anyway,'' Clymer said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy fought President Reagan on domestic issues, but
intervened personally with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to help
broker a nuclear arms treaty. He has worked for peace in Northern
Ireland since 1971 and played a crucial role in bringing about the
Good Friday peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's extramarital affairs and his drinking, though,
obscured his accomplishments. By 1991, the Palm Beach affair had
rendered him powerless to stop the appointment of Clarence Thomas,
whom he considered unqualified, to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   After Thomas, Kennedy got the worst press of his career,
including being lampooned as a drunk on TV's ''Saturday Night
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had quietly begun dating Vickie Reggie, who became his
second wife. And he had resolved to turn his life around, which he
cryptically explained at a speech at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very tough guy and he understands that if somebody
accuses you of something that's true, maybe you're your own worst
enemy, and you have to hope that when people add up the score,
there will be more pluses than minuses,'' said President Clinton,
who was on the receiving end of pep talks from Kennedy during his
impeachment trial in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's image has softened considerably in the past few years,
especially as he has taken his oratorical gifts to so many family
funerals: He buried his mother Rose in 1995, his 39-year-old nephew
Michael in 1998, his 36-year-old nephew John F. Kennedy Jr. last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think he'll ever be completely rehabilitated,'' Clymer
said.
</P>
<P>
   His final legacy, though, will not depend on political spin,
Clymer said, but on what he continues to get done in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Austin City Limits  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Since Willie Nelson took the stage for the
very first show, Ray Lucero has worked as stage manager on ''Austin
City Limits,'' catering to stars before they were stars.
</P>
<P>
   Lucero remembers a large-haired Lyle Lovett shopping demo tapes
in between gigs at local lounges and a young Garth Brooks about 100
million albums ago. And he's made sure legends delivered legendary
performances, like the time Lucero comforted a grieving Jerry Lee
Lewis, who was performing soon after his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   But he insists most of his duties are unglamorous.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm also the glorified parking attendant, the laundry guy, the
ironing man,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lucero is just one of many faces behind the laid-back show that
has kept music from this laid-back city in the spotlight since
''Austin City Limits'' first aired March 22, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Now television's longest-running music series, ''Austin City
Limits'' keeps a down-home feel (free beer is served before each
taping) while showcasing fresh talent (pre-superstar Dixie Chicks,
Lovett and Brooks, to name a few).
</P>
<P>
   ''So many people have performed here. It's been tremendous, just
tremendous,'' Lucero marvels over the licks of a rehearsing Lovett.
''What's great about the show also is seeing all the classic,
classic people like Fats Domino and Jerry Lee Lewis, B.B. King,
Stevie Ray Vaughan.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Lucero can continue his list, a co-worker rushes in from
the studio across the hall, yelling, ''Ray, Lyle needs you!''
</P>
<P>
   Lovett wants help finding an ice chest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things like that always happen,'' Lucero says.
</P>
<P>
   It's that extra effort from Lucero and 50 other full- and
part-time staffers -- many of whom have worked unpaid for years --
that keeps ''Austin City Limits'' center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We make sure everybody's happy,'' says Steve Maedl, a
production worker who's served the show for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The folks here at 'Austin City Limits' make you feel as
comfortable as you can,'' Lovett says. ''I mean you see those big
cameras pointed at you so it's not quite like doing a live show.
You're naturally more self-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Likona, the show's producer for 22 years, says creating a
comfortable environment has always been the key to making the show
work: ''There always seems to be a lot of tension in the air, and
pressure, and so we just try to take a lot of that out of the
picture and make it as relaxed ... as possible, which is easy to do
here in Austin. That's the whole style of Austin to begin with,
which is another reason why it works so well here.''
</P>
<P>
   John T. Davis, who's written the history of the show (''25 years
of American Music: Austin City Limits,'' Billboard Books, $35, 192
pages), says it's the focus on the music that has made the show
stand out.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Benson, leader of the Grammy-winning band Asleep at the
Wheel, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty simple deal. It's a show that's all about the
music, to present the artists' music the way they do on a daily
basis,'' says Benson, who credits the show for much of his band's
success.
</P>
<P>
   ''Austin City Limits'' allowed musicians to perform for TV
unscripted and unrehearsed long before unplugged became an
MTV-generation buzzword, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the show, he says, ''when people around the
country think of the Texas capital, they don't necessarily envision
billionaire moguls like Michael Dell, or pontificating state
politicians. They think instead of Stevie Ray Vaughan or the
Neville Brothers or Emmylou Harris playing on a hillside above a
glittering skyline.''
</P>
<P>
   Founder Bill Arhos wanted a national showcase for up-and-coming
Texas talent and pitched the pilot, starring Willie Nelson, to
public television.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the show has seen competition come from MTV, VH1
and other cable shows with more money. It endured federal budget
cuts and other changes at PBS, with the never-ending quest to raise
the minimum $800,000 it takes to produce the show every year.
</P>
<P>
   Arhos -- who retired this year from daily operations of the show
and its home station, Austin's KLRU-TV -- says getting money has
been a recurrent challenge. But Mary Beth Rogers, the station's
president, says the series is in good shape for the future.
</P>
<P>
   National underwriters have signed on for the next three years
and there's talk of taping 26 instead of 13 shows per season. Plans
are in the works to expand the show's presence on the Web, take it
on a national tour and distribute some of the show's archives on
compact disc, DVD, video and through TV syndication.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the competition for bookings with shows that have
more money, Likona says: ''I think that given the name, the
reputation and the history that the show has, there will still be a
place for us somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next five years, the historic set will be rebuilt as the
station converts to high-definition television, and the ''Austin
City Limits'' sign that has shone over acts for 25 years will be
retired to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lucero, who'll soon retire, believes it's the old formula
that will keep faithful fans tuned in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Austin City Limits'' is for ''someone who really appreciates
it, who comes and gets something out of it,'' he says. ''The fact
that you come here free, get free beer and see a great show, see
some of your idols. That, I think, that's a lot.''

<HEADLINE> German Exhibit Honors Quaker Relief  </HEADLINE>
By KEN KUSMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Horst Winkler stared into the photographs,
searching for an image that captured his own desperation more than
half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Was his among the expectant faces of hungry German
schoolchildren queuing for food distributed by Quaker relief
workers in the days after fighting had ended in Nazi Germany?
</P>
<P>
   ''I had forgotten about the Quakers after all these years, to be
honest with you,'' said the 69-year-old Winkler.
</P>
<P>
   But as he looked at the photo and a sampling of the worn metal
containers in which the children had received their food, the years
faded away. Winkler remembered the Quaker volunteers who provided
the sustenance that kept him, a younger sister and their mother
alive.
</P>
<P>
   His homeland hasn't forgotten, either. A German-sponsored
exhibit touring the United States recalls the kindness and relief
provided by Quakers, also called the Society of Friends, at a time
when others could not let go of the hatred forged by wartime
hostilities and the horrors of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quiet Helpers,'' a collection of photographs, documents,
artifacts and news clippings, began a six-week run last week at the
Lilly Library at Earlham College in Richmond, Ind. It tells the
story of Quaker-run groups -- many of the volunteers practiced other
religions -- feeding the defeated German populations after both
world wars and helping victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The work earned U.S. and British Quaker groups the 1947 Nobel
Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, a car dealer who was 15 when World War II ended in
1945, said he emerged from the cellar where his family had holed up
for days without food wary of the GIs and other Americans the Nazis
had told him to fear.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers lounging around an armored personnel carrier offered
him bananas, and at a nearby school the American Friends Service
Committee set up a kitchen where he and his sister drank hot cocoa,
slurped lima bean soup and filled coffee cans with more food to
take home to their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had been starving for a year, more or less. We were all
just skins and bones,'' Winkler said. He came to the United States
in 1963 and now owns two Mercedes-Benz dealerships in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''You cannot possibly imagine the emotions we were under and the
conditions we were under. They were the enemy, and they didn't turn
out to be the enemy,'' he said. ''They were saints.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 500 U.S. and British volunteers served in Germany
after World War II, and about a dozen of them came to the First
Friends Meeting in Indianapolis for the exhibit's U.S. debut.
</P>
<P>
   The German Historical Museum in Berlin mounted the exhibit,
which traveled to 21 German cities over three years before making
its U.S. debut in Indianapolis. After Earlham, a Quaker-run
institution, it will travel to Dayton, Ohio; Seattle; San
Francisco; Washington, D.C.; Baltimore; Boston; Chicago;
Philadelphia and other stops over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-person unit from Britain's Friends Relief Service had been
among the first civilian relief groups to reach the liberated
Bergen-Belsen concentration camp near Hamburg. A video loop in the
exhibit includes Hugh Jenkins' description of finding the bodies of
many of the camp's 10,000 dead stacked like wood by the side of the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, 85, who now lives in Washington, D.C., said the
experience was ''shattering.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There was so much we had to do, we just concentrated on what
we were doing. That tended to insulate us a bit from the
circumstances in which we were working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six teams of relief workers, including Friends, the Red Cross
and the Salvation Army, rescued about 25,000 people from
Bergen-Belsen, ferrying them by ambulance to a makeshift hospital.
They worked for weeks until authorities, worried about typhus and
dysentery epidemics, used flame-throwers to burn the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the items in the exhibit have never been displayed
before, and others come from collections at Quaker institutions.
They include a yellow Star of David the Nazis forced a Munich-born
Quaker child to wear because she had been classified as a Jew; a
gingerbread Christmas cookie cut into the shape of the
eight-pointed Quaker star was one of the thousands the AFSC
commissioned German bakers to make in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Quaker beliefs and practices include peacemaking, living simply,
and seeking ethnic and sexual equality. The American Friends
Service Committee was formed in 1917 to provide conscientious
objectors with an opportunity to aid civilian victims during World
War I. Its latest relief efforts include aid to the victims of
flooding in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana is a stronghold of U.S. Quakerism with approximately
16,000 followers in the state, and provided many of the volunteers
who served in Germany.

<HEADLINE> Rick Springfield Holds Comeback Tour  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- In the shady chill of a Malibu morning,
Rick Springfield shivers and sips chocolate-flavored soy milk in
anonymity on the deck of the local Starbucks, with a Pacific Ocean
vista.
</P>
<P>
   The singer-actor is treated with casual indifference in this
coastal town, where he lives with his wife of 18 years and their
two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   The serene scene is a far cry from the heady days of teen
idol-dom in the 1980s, when the shaggy-haired Springfield couldn't
go anywhere without being accosted by eager fans or just plain
stared at.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was fun at first, but then it got to be really kind of
stressful,'' he said. ''You'd meet somebody and you'd go, 'What am
I not being that they're projecting onto me?' It was great to get
away and not have to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back, an older (yikes! he's 50) and wiser soul than the
Australian cutie who captivated ''General Hospital'' viewers as
sexy Dr. Noah Drake.
</P>
<P>
   His teen-age son, he said, ''calls me, very jokingly, the babe
magnet.''
</P>
<P>
   After years out of the spotlight, Springfield resurfaced last
year in a popular ''Behind the Music'' episode that ran repeatedly
on VH1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got people going, 'All right, he's not dead,''' he cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield is currently on a nationwide tour with ''Karma,''
his first album in 11 years. He'll play everywhere from county
fairs to casinos through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The screaming of young girls has given way to an audience that
includes the offspring of his original fans. And Springfield
doesn't disappoint in concert, performing all the old hits like
''Jessie's Girl,'' ''Don't Talk to Strangers'' and ''I've Done
Everything for You.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's almost like a camaraderie now because we've been
through the years together and they're still connected to those
songs,'' he said. ''It's almost like a club.''
</P>
<P>
   Springfield draws attention on a smaller scale now, but he
enjoys it much more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a better relationship with the audience live. I know
the people who hear the music hear what I'm saying now,'' he said.
''There's more life experience in the audience now, so I enjoy that
because I love to relate to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way.
</P>
<P>
   His father died in 1981, but Springfield was too busy keeping
the teen-idol machinery rolling to grieve. ''I kind of stuffed it
down and went on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Disillusioned when he lost his place in the changing musical
landscape of the late '80s, Springfield became a recluse. He sought
therapy for a depression that he says didn't involve drugs. A
serious motorcycle accident in 1988 put him in another downward
spiral. Through it all, however, his marriage to a former recording
studio secretary stayed strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always been a pretty dark guy. As a kid, we called it
moody,'' he said. ''I kind of half-heartedly tried to off myself at
one point. It did get pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   When his music fell off the charts, Springfield returned to
acting in such low-profile gigs as the syndicated TV series ''High
Tide.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless you were an insomniac or a late-night watchman at
Sears, you didn't really see it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the show wasn't renewed after three years, Springfield took
it as a sign to return to the recording studio. While working on
''Karma'' last year, he landed a recurring role on the NBC comedy
''Suddenly Susan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at the height of his popularity, Springfield couldn't avoid
the sting of critics who rebuked his music as bubblegum. But unlike
a lot of teen idols, he actually wrote his own material.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be viewed as this staggeringly one-dimensional figure was
really painful to me. It was hard for me because I was so super
self-critical,'' he said. ''I was comforted just by the fact that I
loved to write and when a song would be successful, I could look at
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Springfield has his own website (rickspringfield.com), which he
visits to find out where his next gig is. His current band went
online to learn the words to his old songs. But he doesn't snoop in
chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to see people saying bad things about me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   No longer does he worry that fans are only drawn to him for his
looks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not so cute anymore, so I kind of proved my point that
maybe it was the music,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Scythian Gold Tells Story of Nomads  </HEADLINE>
By THERESA BOWEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Across the flat grasslands of Ukraine, ancient
burial mounds stretch up to 100 feet high, preserving the gold
treasures of the nomadic Scythian warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these items are on display in Baltimore with ''Gold of
the Nomads'' at The Walters Art Gallery. The exhibition is the
largest and most all-inclusive collection of Scythian gold items
ever displayed outside of Ukraine, curators said.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts tell the story of the Scythian horsemen's culture
and lifestyle from the 7th through the 3rd centuries B.C.
</P>
<P>
   The gold, bronze and clay items have been preserved in the
Scythian tombs, called kurhans, which rest from 6 to 45 feet
beneath the ground and are covered by up to 100 feet of top soil.
The mounds span 300 feet in diameter at the base.
</P>
<P>
   ''While other nomadic tribes that at one time dominated this
region, such as the Huns and the Mongols, survive primarily through
tales of their ruthless conquests, the Scythians also left lavishly
provisioned tombs that have preserved one of the most complete and
stunning material records of any nomadic people,'' said Dr. Gerry
Scott III, curator of ancient art at the San Antonio Museum of Art
in Texas, where the exhibit made its U.S. debut in November.
</P>
<P>
   The nomads buried their dead with an elaborate combination of
ritual and ceremony, which varied based on the importance of the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists have found that the writings of 5th-century B.C.
historian Herodotus accurately describe the embalming, human and
animal sacrifice, and burial process reserved for group leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonies were less elaborate for common men and women, but
they were often buried with an arsenal of weapons, helmets,
shields, and cooking and storage pots.
</P>
<P>
   The Scythians prospered through trade with the Greeks, and
commissioned Greek and Scythian artists to craft gold jewelry and
plaques for battle and personal adornment during ceremonious
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   A bow and arrow case excavated from one kurhan is enveloped in
gold with Greek-like figures in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''They borrow elements from other traditions to tell their
stories,'' said Dr. Ellen Reeder, deputy director for art at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York, who curated the exhibit with
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Although the figures are influenced by Greek art and mythology,
they are adapted by the Scythians. For example, the ''prudish''
Scythians have clothed figures that would be naked in Greek art,
Reeder said. The scenes do not depict Greek stories; rather, the
Scythians have borrowed Greek figures to tell their own stories.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were cultures that were forming dialogues together,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scythian art illustrates the group's interest in movement,
evolution and the power of animals. The use of the eagle, spotted
and snow leopards, boar and the equivalent of a present-day elk
recall the animal depiction of Central Asia. A round, finial piece
depicts a leopard morphing into an elk-like animal.
</P>
<P>
   The only indication of the Scythians' love for beautiful items
during daily life were the raspberry-colored or royal blue fabrics
they wore as they roamed the plains, weighed down by 50 pounds of
equipment, including a helmet, shield and weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Reeder said Ukraine will be explored much more in the future,
and noted that many of her Ukrainian colleagues hope to embark on
partnerships with the United States. ''It has been called the
richest land on this planet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations continue on the more than 40,000 kurhans that have
remained intact.
</P>
<P>
   ''America can be part of a frontier in archaeology,'' Reeder
said.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 170 objects in the exhibition have been compiled
from the Museum of Historical Treasures of Ukraine, Kiev; The
Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine,
Kiev; and the Ukraine State Historical Archaeological Preserve.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibit marks the first time since 1975 that some of these
items have traveled to the United States. It also includes more
recently unearthed artifacts available for display in the West only
since Ukraine gained its independence from the former Soviet Union
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gold of the Nomads'' is organized by The Walters Art Gallery
and the San Antonio Museum of Art. The exhibition will remain in
Baltimore through May 28, before moving to Los Angeles; Brooklyn;
Ontario, Canada; Kansas City and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The ''Gold of the Nomads'' exhibition is open Tuesdays through
Sundays from 10 a.m.-5 p.m. at The Walters Art Gallery, at North
Charles and Centre streets. Contact the museum at 410-547-9000.

<HEADLINE> Two Movie Buffs Find Rare Antiques  </HEADLINE>
By JESSICA FARGEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- After antique hunting for eight hours, Deb
Ginsberg promised her weary friend Marilyn Wagner that a stop at
Franx Antiques and Art would be the day's last.
</P>
<P>
   Wading through the vintage pictures and dusty vases, the two
women asked to browse through a back storage room of the Old Market
store, where a sliver of Hollywood's storied past had sat for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   The movie buffs stumbled upon 50,000 authentic print blocks and
8,000 press plates used to print movie handbills from eras when
Marilyn Monroe liked it hot and The Mummy first made theatergoers
squirm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deb said, 'What do you think of these?''' Wagner recalls about
their find in November 1998. ''I picked one up and I just went
nuts. I said, 'This is it. You've found the perfect thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   An appraiser from Christie's Auction House in New York agrees.
He calls the uncovered collection the ''holy grail'' of movie
memorabilia, valued at $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just floored,'' says Rudy Franchi, a movie poster
consultant for Christie's who came to Omaha in disbelief after
hearing about the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured they had all been melted down for something because
nobody would think they had any value,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg and Wagner, who own a screen printing business, paid
less than $10,000 for the metal plates and small wooden blocks --
remnants of a time when Omaha's bustling printing houses made movie
advertisements for theaters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes plates and blocks dating from the 1930s
to the 1970s for 10,000 movies, including ''The Wizard of Oz,''
''The Godfather,'' ''Jailhouse Rock,'' ''Star Wars,'' ''Gone With
the Wind'' and ''A Hard Days Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Other popular titles include ''Casablanca,'' ''Dracula,'' ''How
to Marry a Millionaire,'' ''The Seven Year Itch,'' ''To Catch a
Thief,'' ''East of Eden,'' and Breakfast at Tiffany's'' and
''Sabrina,'' both starring Audrey Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started going through them and started realizing what we
had here was a very extensive history of motion pictures,''
Ginsberg says. ''Very extensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The antique store's owner, Helen Novak, revealed the stash of
movie goods to Ginsberg, a regular customer.
</P>
<P>
   Novak's husband bought the plates 25 years ago for less than
$1,000 from KB Typesetting Co. in Omaha. Novak knew the plates and
blocks were valuable, but still balks at the estimated $2 million
value.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had my use out of them,'' Novak says. ''We did sell some; we
even traded some. I certainly had no intention of sorting those
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Over several months, Ginsberg and Wagner loaded 400 boxes -- all
told weighing nearly 16 tons -- into Ginsberg's 1989 4-door Corsica,
and moved them during several trips from the store's back room to
their printing business 10 miles away in South Omaha. Many of the
boxes had not been opened in 25 years, Novak said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than sit on their rare find or sell off the entire
collection, they use the metal plates to restrike movie
advertisements the same way they were printed 60 years ago -- by
hand with a 1,700-pound 1938 Vandercock letter press.
</P>
<P>
   They sell the black and white reproductions for $50 framed and
matted on the online auction site eBay. Some of the blocks, made
when drive-in movies were the lifeblood of small towns, also are
popular sellers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure I could take the whole lot to Christie's and have a
wonderful day, turn myself into a millionaire over night and forget
it,'' Ginsberg says. ''But then what did I accomplish?''
</P>
<P>
   They have sold about 2,000 of the small wooden movie blocks,
magnesium-plated on the face side, for as high as $480 apiece. They
are selling the blocks that they have duplicates of, Wagner says.
People collect the blocks, ranging in size from 1-inch to 7-inch
squares, for paperweights, knickknacks or nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to brisk sales in the United States, they have
shipped off several hundred blocks and restrikes to buyers in
Brazil, Australia, Japan, France and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wagner and Ginsberg say they have not heard of any
opposition to their enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a real purist might be a stick in the mud,'' says
Bruce Crawford, a local film historian. ''I think for some purists
it may be a problem, but for the majority of people they think it's
great.''

<HEADLINE> Allegheny health system executives charged  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Criminal charges were filed against the
director and two other former officials of the bankrupt Allegheny
health system, alleging they misused $52 million in charitable
endowments, the state Attorney General's Office announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested today were former chief executive officer Sharif
Abdelhak, former chief financial officer David McConnell and
general counsel Nancy Wynstra, said Attorney General Mike Fisher.
Each was charged with theft and other offenses, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelhak and McConnell were being arraigned today. Wynstra was
expected to surrender Monday, Fisher said. Lawyers for the three,
who once led the state's largest health system, did not immediately
return calls today for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general filed a civil lawsuit last month against
Abdelhak, McConnell, Wynstra and five former Allegheny trustees
charging that they spent $78.5 million in restricted funds,
including medical endowments, before the system's Philadelphia-area
operations filed for bankruptcy in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In that lawsuit, Fisher accused Allegheny executives of
violating state law by diverting charitable assets to pay operating
expenses. Executives also may have used restricted funds to help
repay an $89 million loan to Mellon Bank and three other lenders.
At least five executives with ties to Mellon Bank were Allegheny
trustees; They have denied wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The former executives have been under investigation for more
than a year by state and federal authorities, including the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Investors say even as Allegheny executives were skimming from
endowment funds, the executives received pay raises, bonuses and
lavish expense accounts.
</P>
<P>
   After Allegheny's collapse, eight of its Philadelphia-area
hospitals were sold to Tenet Healthcare Corp., the nation's
second-largest for-profit hospital chain. Drexel University took
over Allegheny's medical university, which includes MCP Hahnemann
School of Medicine.

<HEADLINE> Precede ALBANY, N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki called today for a ''common
sense'' series of gun control measures in New York, including
mandatory trigger locks and the taking of ballistic
''fingerprints'' by manufacturers of all firearms marketed here.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said also called for the minimum age for handgun
purchases in New York to go from 18 to 21, for a ban on assault
weapons and for instant background checks to be made of gun buyers
at flea markets and gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said at a news conference that while violent crime has
fallen in New York, more New Yorkers are still being killed by guns
than in car crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ''That must change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki called the ballistic fingerprinting of new firearms,
dubbed by the governor the ''Gun DNA'' program, a centerpiece of
his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Gun DNA plan will provide police with an important tool
that will give them a running start on their investigations,
enabling them to catch violent criminals quicker,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   The gun fingerprinting proposal calls for gun manufacturers, or
the dealers who sell guns in New York, to transmit bullets and
shell casings from every gun in their inventories to the State
Police's forensic lab. Computerized images of bullets and shell
casings would be kept on file and checked against bullets and
casing recovered at the scenes of gun violence to help authorities
track the weapons involved.
</P>
<P>
   The barrels of guns leave telltale markings on bullets and shell
casings.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal on background checks would close a loophole in
the federal Brady Law which requires that guns sold by federally
licensed firearms deals must be accompanied by a background check.
Sales at gun shows and flea markets, however, do not require such
checks unless a federally licensed gun dealer is involved.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir appeared at
Pataki's news conference this morning and endorsed the Pataki
proposals, as did Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine
Pirro. She is president of the state Association of District
Attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to deal with today's reality and that is that more
people die in the United States of gun injuries than any other
place in the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association has been opposed to the taking of
bullet samples for the government, contending that it is a
preliminary step toward national gun registration. A spokesman for
the NRA did not return repeated telephone calls seeking comment on
Pataki's legislation.
</P>
<P>
   All the provisions the Republican governor will propose have
been supported in the past in some form by the Democrat-dominated
state Assembly in New York. But the Republican state Senate,
despite proposals from some of its majority members from New York
City and its suburbs, has not approved any of the anti-gun
measures.
</P>
<P>
   John McArdle, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Joseph
Bruno, said Republicans have been ''looking'' at various gun
provisions for years. In some cases, Republicans have been trying
to determine whether federal gun legislation would supersede what
the Legislature could do on a state level, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have not been given details of Pataki's
impending legislation, McArdle said, but would review whatever the
governor sent them.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he knows his legislation would put him out of step
with Republicans nationally, who generally oppose too-stringent
anti-gun measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately if you think it's the right thing you have to
pursue it,'' he told ABC News Tuesday night. ''I'm hoping we can
get this through the Legislature.''

   ''Sex and the City'' star Sarah Jessica Parker won best comic
actress at this year's Golden Globe Awards. ''I've never won
anything in my life,'' exclaimed Parker after winning the award.
''I had money on all the nominees in my category because they're

   Comedian Louie Anderson says a grand gesture when he was
starting out 10 years ago got him his big break in show business.
He said it all began when actor-comedian Eddie Murphy walked into
an expensive Los Angeles restaurant. Anderson called the waiter
over and told him, ''Take Eddie Murphy's check and put it on my
credit card, but don't tell him until after I leave.'' The bill
came to $600, but the gesture paid off. Murphy phoned Anderson the
next day and said, ''Louie, no one ever did that for me.'' He then
told Anderson that he was going to write a part for him in the
movie ''Coming to America.'' Anderson was born on March 24, 1953.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Devon Sawa  </HEADLINE>
By CAROL DEEGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Devon Sawa is running late.
</P>
<P>
   He took a quick break from a daylong schedule of media
interviews at a Park Avenue hotel to look for wrestling action
figures at nearby FAO Schwarz toy store. But he's about to enter
the hotel when he gets a cell phone call from a publicist who is
trying to keep him on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Sawa, who lives in Los Angeles, is promoting his new film,
''Final Destination.'' This is film No. 13 for the 21-year-old
actor (''Idle Hands,'' ''SLC Punk,'' ''Wild America''), who isn't
the least bit superstitious.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't believe in premonitions, either, unlike the character
he portrays in James Wong's feature directorial debut, which also
stars Ali Larter and Kerr Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''Final Destination'' is the story of a group of suburban high
school teens who are flying to Paris on a school trip. Alex
Browning (Sawa) gets a powerful premonition that their flight is
doomed. He rushes off the plane, followed by several classmates and
a teacher. The plane departs without them. Minutes later, it
explodes in midair.
</P>
<P>
   Alex and his friends have cheated death.
</P>
<P>
   But death isn't easily discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ''Final Destination'' was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia,
where Sawa grew up. He became interested in acting at 11 and did
theater, commercials and TV shows before getting his ''first
break'' in the 1995 film ''Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   1. What attracted you to the role of Alex Browning?
</P>
<P>
   Sawa: This is my first adult lead. .. first young man lead. They
sent me the script, and actually I was getting on a plane. So I
read the script on the plane and went to meet James Wong, who I
thought had very interesting ideas of shooting this movie. And then
I auditioned for him up in Vancouver and got the part, and that's
basically how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   2. There are some spectacular scenes in ''Final Destination.''
Were there a lot of special effects?
</P>
<P>
   Sawa: It was very draining emotionally and physically because of
the many special effects that we had. But it was fun, it was lot of
fun to do. We had everything from houses exploding to cars
exploding to people being hit by buses. ... You know that someone's
going to die right now, but it's very interesting to see how they
do it, and that's what makes it so suspenseful. I think James Wong
did an amazing job capturing the suspense of this movie.
</P>
<P>
   3. Did you ever imagine in your wildest dreams that you would be
in a film like this?
</P>
<P>
   Sawa: No. Never. But I love this film. I just saw it a couple of
days ago for the first time and I really enjoyed it. I really
enjoyed the final product. I think audiences will enjoy it, too.
</P>
<P>
   4. Is Devon anything like Alex or vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   Sawa: Alex and Devon are completely different people. The whole
premonition thing is something that I do not believe in. I don't. I
try to live life day by day. And take it with a grain of salt and
not think about what my destiny is or what I do right now is going
to affect something that will happen in five years. Or 10 years.
It's just something I don't like to think about. I like to just
take everything day by day.
</P>
<P>
   5. But if you had experienced a premonition like the one Alex
had, would you have gotten off the plane?
</P>
<P>
   Sawa: If it was as powerful as the dream that Alex had, yeah, I
suppose I would freak out, too. He really felt the plane go down.
He really lived it.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Pat Metheny  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES J. GANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Pat Metheny describes his music as
''polystylistic'' -- rooted in jazz but using different
vocabularies, including rock, orchestral and world music. The Pat
Metheny Group's ''Imaginary Day'' album garnered Grammys in 1998
for best rock instrumental and contemporary jazz performance.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the 45-year-old guitarist has taken a vacation from
his larger ensemble to devote himself to other projects.
</P>
<P>
   Metheny realized a personal dream by recording an album of
guitar duets with his mentor Jim Hall. He composed a poignant score
for ''A Map of the World,'' the film based on Jane Hamilton's novel
and starring Sigourney Weaver. And ''Trio 99-00'' (Warner Bros.)
with bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Bill Stewart mixes old and
new Metheny compositions with fresh rearrangements of John
Coltrane's classic ''Giant Steps'' and the Broadway tune ''A Lot of
Livin' to Do.''
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of Metheny's musical vision is evident in the new
400-page, 167-tune ''Pat Metheny Songbook,'' which documents his
career dating back to his debut 1975 trio album ''Bright Size
Life.'' Metheny is now touring with his trio and expects to
reassemble the Pat Metheny Group later this year for a new
recording.
</P>
<P>
   1. How did director Scott Elliott choose you for the ''Map''
score?
</P>
<P>
   Metheny: Scott is a very interesting director, who has a real
vision of what he wants to accomplish in every aspect of his work.
I think he had decided pretty early on that I was his only choice
to write the music. He said he just 'heard' it in his head. ...
Scott was able to describe to me in pretty vivid detail the role he
felt the music should play in the context of the film as a whole.
So many times, music is an afterthought in films, or they could get
any of 10 people and be happy. Scott was not like that in any way.
</P>
<P>
   2. How do you feel your music matches with the film?
</P>
<P>
   Metheny: The first thing I did was to read the book. I couldn't
put it down. I could tell that there were things going on in this
story that I could 'talk' about in a musical way. The fact that the
story takes place in a small Midwestern town, not unlike the town
that I grew up in in Missouri, was also appealing. From the
beginning, I heard guitar in my head as an active voice in this
score. That is kind of a first for me. In most of the other scoring
stuff I've done, there is barely any guitar in any of it. This was
a score where I could play a big part as a guitarist, something I
really enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   3. What appeals to you about the trio as opposed to the Pat
Metheny Group?
</P>
<P>
   Metheny: One of the big attractions about trio playing is the
mobility of it. ... When I tour with my regular band, which often
has as many as seven musicians, if we want to do a new piece, it
really has to be thought about, arrangements need to be written.
... With the trio, five minutes before we go onstage, I can
describe a new tune to Larry and Bill and we can walk out there and
play it just like that. The truth is I love both things.
</P>
<P>
   4. How would you compare this trio to your earlier ones?
</P>
<P>
   Metheny: This particular trio is probably most like my original
trio with Jaco Pastorius and Bob Moses (on 'Bright Size Life') in
the sense that I consider Bill and Larry to be basically
contemporaries of mine. ... The incredible stylistic range that
they both have matches my polystylistic tendencies as a composer
and improviser really well, which was also true in that first band.
When I played with older legendary musicians like Charlie Haden and
Billy Higgins or Dave Holland and Roy Haynes, I really tailored the
music to feature the things that I loved about their music as much
or more than any efforts I made to define my own way of playing.
</P>
<P>
   5. Do you see any common link between your trio record and the
''Map'' soundtrack?
</P>
<P>
   Metheny: Both records are intensely personal to me -- albeit in
different ways. The 'Map' soundtrack, because of its acoustic
nature and the emphasis on the development of just a few themes,
allowed me to explore some of the qualities that I discovered on
the record (with bassist Charlie Haden) 'Beyond the Missouri Sky.'
That is, making the acoustic guitar a much more prominent part of
my thing than it ever had been before. Playing in a trio, because
of the reduced instrumentation ... tends to result in personal,
intimate music. Even though these records are quite different ...
they complement each other.

<HEADLINE> Is Country Music Still Country?  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The song says it all: ''The steel
guitars no longer cry, and fiddles barely play/But drums and rock
'n' roll guitars/are mixed up in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Murder on Music Row'' is a rising hit duet by country music
traditionalists George Strait and Alan Jackson. The recording
argues that the influence of pop music is killing the music of Hank
Williams and Lefty Frizzell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ol' Hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio,'' they sing
in the song written by Larry Cordle and Larry Shell.
</P>
<P>
   Music executives debated the growing pop influence in country
music in a recent panel discussion at the Country Radio Seminar
convention here. The topic was so hot that organizers had to open a
second hotel ballroom to accommodate the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists considered songs including Lonestar's ''Amazed''
and Martina McBride's ''I Love You.'' The latest albums by
Nashville stars Faith Hill and Shania Twain are pop music in
everything but name, and well-received by that audience.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama had a hit duet with pop group N' Sync. Mark Chesnutt and
Mark Wills have cut country versions of pop hits.
</P>
<P>
   Even country records that don't cross over aren't as country as
they once were.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is country music an art form or a business?'' asked singer
Kenny Rogers, who crossed over to the pop charts in the 1980s. ''If
it's an art form, get rid of pop music. But if it's a business,
you've got to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   National television exposure is hard to get for country acts,
said Joe Galante, who runs BMG in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lonestar couldn't get arrested (for TV bookings) with eight or
nine weeks at No. 1 country,'' said Galante. ''They got the Academy
of Country Music Awards and Leno when they crossed over to pop.''
</P>
<P>
   With sales of country music down about 4.5 percent in 1999, the
likelihood is that the pop trend will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''This (country) audience is shrinking,'' said Allen Butler, who
runs Sony Records in Nashville. ''Pop songs are good if they draw
in listeners.''
</P>
<P>
   Twain's success on other radio formats is an example, said Luke
Lewis, president of Mercury Nashville Records. Since she has many
more country hits than pop, fans introduced to her via pop radio
have to listen to country stations if they want more. They may hear
something else they like while they're there.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Mercury is working to develop a traditional country
artist, but is holding off for now because of the commercial
climate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not at all inclined to make a traditional-sounding album
right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What does this mean for traditional country music?
</P>
<P>
   ''It could just go away,'' Lewis said. ''It could become
unidentifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   But the old styles can still be popular. The most recent example
is Brad Paisley, a traditional-leaning artist who became a star
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think (today's country music) is pop, put it next to a
Kid Rock record and tell me what you think,'' Galante said.

<HEADLINE> Ben-Dor Plans 'Amerindia' Recording  </HEADLINE>
By LOUINN LOTA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gisele Ben-Dor is tired of reporters asking,
''Is that chiffon?''
</P>
<P>
   ''People still care about my dress, my hair, my scarf. ...
Nobody asks questions about what men wear. Ridiculous,'' said
Ben-Dor, maestra and music director for the Santa Barbara Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Dor is one of four women in the United States who conduct
symphony orchestras. But it's more than her sex that has gained
Ben-Dor prominence in her field.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ben-Dor recorded the works of Silvestre Revueltas, one
of Mexico's most prestigious composers, and in January,
orchestrated the first recording of ''Amerindia'' from Brazilian
composer Heitor Villa-Lobos. That recording, her second commercial
album with the Santa Barbara Symphony, will be released this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her accomplishments, Ben-Dor said most interviewers
focus not on her work but on how she balances career and family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to talk about so much richness and beauty created by
these relatively unknown and unrecognized composers with the
reputation of being from the so-called Third World,'' she said
after a recent TV interview. ''How I look for composers who have
created, in their musical language, the essence of their people,
but through pure historical, political, economical facts, they have
been ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Ben-Dor does manage to keep a sense of humor about the
attention she gets as a woman conductor.
</P>
<P>
   She tells a favorite story about when her oldest son was 2{ and
had traveled with her to concerts around the world. ''A reporter
asked, 'When you grow up, you're going to be a conductor, right?'
And my son says, 'No, yuck. That's for girls!'''
</P>
<P>
   Born Gisele Buka in Montevideo, Uruguay, Ben-Dor played piano as
a child and remembers bullying her friends to play arrangements her
way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them, 'You do this. You're out of tune.' Friends of
mine gave up when I showed my will and power,'' she said, laughing.
''I grew up knowing I was a conductor. If it didn't exist, I would
think I had discovered it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, an accountant, was stunned by her career choice. But
by 14, she was being paid to arrange music.
</P>
<P>
   She won a full scholarship to the Yale School of Music, where
she received a master's degree in orchestra conducting in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, when she was nine months pregnant, she made her
conducting debut with the Israel Philharmonic in Stravinsky's ''The
Rite of Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My first child and my first concert,'' said Ben-Dor, who is
married with two sons. ''The orchestra was 110 strong and probably
remembers the piece as 'The Rite of Offspring.' My son was born two
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had so much poise. I felt so strong, so secure. I still
believe it was the best performance of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has worked with the Boston Pro Arte Chamber
Orchestra, the Minnesota Orchestra and the Phoenix Symphony, among
others. She debuted with the New York Philharmonic in 1994,
stepping in for an ailing Kurt Masur. She took the podium without a
rehearsal, a score or a baton.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Dor, who speaks Spanish, English, French, Italian, German
and Hebrew, also has worked with the Bavarian Radio Orchestra and
the Ulster Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   She has recorded the works of Argentina's Alberto Ginastera with
the London Symphony Orchestra and the Israel Chamber Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying Ginastera is as good as Beethoven, but they can
share in the same company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Dor said she has the satisfaction of bringing composers like
Ginastera ''to the fore and making an impression on people that
classical music is not about old, dead white men in powdered wigs.
Their time is coming.''

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Designer Launches Line  </HEADLINE>
By CAROL DEEGAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Debra McGuire sits in the tearoom at the Henri
Bendel store on Fifth Avenue and ticks off the names of a handful
of TV shows. ''Friends,'' ''Jesse,'' ''Freaks and Geeks,''
''Judging Amy,'' ''Jack &AMP; Jill.''
</P>
<P>
   She is the costume designer for all of them.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the beginning: She has a shop in Pacific
Palisades, Calif., where she began selling her one-of-a-kind
womenswear designs in 1995. Her new line of retail clothing was
recently launched at Bendel's, an event that was marked by a window
installation that McGuire created especially for the store.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had a very organic career. It all revolved around people
I loved, people who loved me, and it had like a really wonderful
progression,'' said McGuire, dressed in one of her designs.
</P>
<P>
   Her life reads like a made-for-TV movie. It is the story of a
talented artist who moved from the world of fine art to jewelry
design, then on to costume design and her own line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a painter, I was a fine artist. And I had a gallery in
San Francisco that was doing a group show of their artists and they
wanted us to work in materials in a medium that we'd never worked
in before,'' the 47-year-old McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I decided to do Plexiglas and painted necklaces. And the
then-president of I. Magnin ... saw the pieces at the gallery and
said, 'Why don't you do some pieces for Magnin's?' -- and that was
kind of the beginning of my jewelry career and it just kind of went
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she mention the necklace she designed for pop singer Barbra
Streisand?
</P>
<P>
   ''Barbra's piece I did in graduate school in 1978, and it was
when the King Tut exhibit was here, and when I asked her what she
wanted, she said 'like Queen Tut.' So that was my motivation for
that piece, and it was cloisonne enamel in silver, and I kind of
designed it to match her deco house. I took the design off of her
etched fireplace and used wallpaper patterns and kind of went from
there. That was pretty spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years as a successful jewelry designer based in New
York City, McGuire moved to Los Angeles, where she began working in
film and television, landing a job on the NBC sitcom ''Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I found with 'Friends' the first two years, the writers used
to write scripts that had seven to 10 changes (per character) a
script. OK? You figure that's 63 costumes at a minimum per show,
per week, that's without guest stars. So we were doing 70 to 75
costumes a week, and I designed and made most of them, men's and
women's. And so I was a complete control freak, I mean, I wouldn't
let them wear a sock unless I approved it. Nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now McGuire oversees the wardrobes of five network TV shows and
has 35 people who report to her. And she's loosened up -- somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have the final say and approval on every single thing, but I
let them bring to the plate a lot of who they are. I mean, I
checked the line the other day on 'Jack &AMP; Jill,' and out of the
entire show, my only comment was 'wash the boxer shorts.'''
</P>
<P>
   Does she have a favorite TV character or celebrity she likes to
dress?
</P>
<P>
   ''I like all the characters. I love Tyne Daly's character in
'Judging Amy.' I love my 'Freaks and Geeks.'' It's period, it's
1980 high school, and I'm mad for all those kids, they kiss me
every day on the set. So that's cool.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really not celebrity motivated. I went to the Emmys this
year because I was nominated (for 'Friends'), but otherwise, I have
no interest,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her Pacific Palisades shop, Debra McGuire Couture, is located
just down the street from her home, where she lives with her
husband and children, Gavin, 11, and Lily, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her one-of-a-kind designs, her Swarthmore Avenue shop
carries her 162-piece retail collection, which she pulled together
during last summer's two-month network hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is filled with colorful separates including sari
skirts with border or fringe, a furry eyelash tank with matching
eyelash shawl, and a hot-pink faux fur jacket. Prices range from
$150 to $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very motivated by fabric. Fabric, texture, color. I love
vintage stuff,'' McGuire said. ''So occasionally, I'll pull
something out and do a piece, a dress, a skirt, and I can do that
in my shop, it's great. And Bendel's, when they ordered halters, I
said, 'I'll throw in some of my old fabulous fabrics, we'll do one
of a kind,' so I threw some of those in, and they loved that.''
</P>
<P>
   What inspires McGuire in her many artistic pursuits?
</P>
<P>
   ''My inspiration comes from life. It doesn't come from fashion.
It comes from the art world, from my spiritual practice, from my
children. I have a tremendous amount of energy, I don't know where
it comes from, but God has given me an incredible gift and I feel
like I need to give back. So this is the way that I do it, and I
will probably continue to explore new things and new mediums until
I die.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Nasdaq To Start in June  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's version of the Nasdaq Stock Market will
open June 30 with limited hours and local rules, organizers said
Wednesday, promising that a 24-hour schedule and trading of foreign
stocks will come within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though its backers have touted Nasdaq Japan as a step toward a
global trading network, Nasdaq and Japan's Osaka Stock Exchange
said Wednesday they planned to start with the same hours and
trading systems as the Osaka market.
</P>
<P>
   Shares will trade from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. in the morning and from
12:30 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. in the afternoon, said Hirotaro Higuchi,
chairman of the Nasdaq Association of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Nasdaq Japan will extend the trading schedule to
24 hours a day and introduce a system that will allow trading of
Nasdaq stocks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new market expects to obtain the government's approval for
its proposed listing standards in April, and will start taking
listing applications from companies in May, said Kyoji Kitamura,
president of the Osaka Securities Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq Japan is meant to enable fast-growing Japanese companies
to raise money while making it easier for Japanese investors to buy
and sell overseas stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-based Nasdaq established Nasdaq Europe in November.

<HEADLINE> Profile of Leading IMF Candidate  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Horst Koehler's experience with global
diplomacy and economic reforms have made the former German
government aide the top contender to head the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the discreet 57-year-old is the first German at the
helm of a major international financial institution, heading the
London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development since
1998.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of the European Union, United States and Japan,
he is now poised to extend Germany's reach in global finance as the
next managing director of the 182-nation IMF. The fund has not yet
scheduled a vote, but it is likely to come well before the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler's supporters say his background with the EBRD makes him
an economic heavyweight capable of streamlining the
Washington-based IMF, which provides emergency loans to foundering
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's first candidate, Deputy Finance Minster Caio
Koch-Weser, was rejected by the United States as too lightweight to
push through the reforms many believe the IMF needs. He had spent
most of his career at the World Bank, only joining the German
government last year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Koehler worked for more than a decade in the German
Finance Ministry under former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who once
called him ''a treasure'' and relied on him in global economic
diplomacy. He was Kohl's envoy at meetings of the Group of Seven
industrialized countries, helped draft the legal framework for
Europe's single currency and played a crucial role in German
reunification in 1990. He also negotiated Germany's financial
contribution to the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler moved to the Association of German Savings Banks in
1993, where he presided over reforms to help privatize Germany's
traditionally state-connected banks.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 1{ years, he has taken the lead in helping reform
former communist countries through the EBRD. That agency was set up
in 1991 to promote market economies in Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler was born in present-day Poland in 1943, the seventh of
eight children. His parents were ethnic German farmers from Romania
who had moved to the small town of Skierbiezow in southeastern
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler's family moved again to Leipzig in communist East
Germany after World War II, then fled to West Germany in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Known to his colleagues as an opera and theater buff who
sometimes has a short temper, Koehler is married with two children
in their 20s.

<HEADLINE> General Mills' Earnings Rise 9 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
By KARREN MILLS, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- Strong sales of yogurt and Hamburger
Helper mixes coupled with demand for Chex cereals used to make
snack mixes over the holidays helped boost General Mills'
third-quarter earnings nearly 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills said Wednesday that profits rose to $153.3
million, or 50 cents a share, in the three months ended Feb. 28,
compared with $141.1 million, or 45 cents a share, in the year-ago
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The performance matched expectations of analysts surveyed by
First Call/Thomson Financial. General Mills shares were up $1.12{
to $31.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue was up 8 percent to $1.62 billion, from $1.50 billion.
Sales were up 5 percent excluding revenue from Lloyd's refrigerated
entrees, Farmhouse Foods side dishes, Gardetto's snacks and Small
Planet organic foods, businesses acquired since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Third-quarter earnings per share growth met our
expectations,'' said Steve Sanger, chairman and chief executive.
''We remain on track to deliver double-digit earnings per share
growth for the full year.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongest volume growth -- 16 percent -- came in convenience
foods, led by Go-Gurt and Yoplait yogurts, fruit snacks, Chex Mix
and Gardetto's snack mixes. The Betty Crocker Hamburger Helper line
grew 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chex cereals led the Big G cereal line, posting double-digit
gains, while overall cereal growth was 3 percent. The volume growth
for General Mills, which also makes Cheerios, Wheaties, Lucky
Charms and Total cereals, came during a quarter when overall volume
sales in the industry declined slightly.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of fiscal 2000, earnings rose 9
percent to $505.5 million, or $1.62 per share, compared with $462.0
million before $32.3 million in restructuring charges in the
year-ago period. Sales rose to $5.01 billion, from $4.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   General Mills, based in Golden Valley, last year bypassed
Kellogg Co. to claim the largest dollar market share in the U.S.
cereal market for the first time in decades. For the year ended
Jan. 2, Chicago-based Information Resources Inc. reported Kellogg's
market share of cereal sales at 30.7 percent, compared with 32.2
percent for General Mills.

<HEADLINE> Here's Some Last-Minute Tax Help  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With just a few weeks left before the April 17
tax deadline, millions of Americans still face the awesome task of
filling out their returns or asking someone else to do it.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why their returns aren't done: missing
documents, not enough money to pay taxes owed, being completely
overwhelmed by the whole thing. Accountants and other tax preparers
have advice to help taxpayers through the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The solution for many people may be to file for an extension of
the filing deadline (which is two days later than usual this year
because April 15 falls on a Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   An extension means making an estimate of the tax you owe and
mailing a check for that amount to the Internal Revenue Service
along with Form 4868. Do that, and you won't find yourself paying 5
percent a month in late filing penalties (you will, however, have a
0.5 percent per month late payment penalty on any tax you still
owe).
</P>
<P>
   Accountants, who expect as a matter of course that many of their
clients will need extensions, say the IRS won't be prejudiced
against the millions of people who ask for more time to get their
returns in.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't care when you file; they just want your money,''
said Doug Stives, a certified public accountant with the firm Wiss
&AMP; Co. in Red Bank, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Here are solutions to some of the specific problems taxpayers
face:
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Problem: I haven't done my return because I'm going to owe
money, and I don't have the cash.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Finish your return and file it on time. You have
several options for paying your taxes.
</P>
<P>
   When you file, you can ask the IRS to allow you to pay in
monthly installments. You'll need to include Form 9465, Installment
Agreement Request, or your own written request with your return.
</P>
<P>
   Paying by installments means incurring interest charges,
currently 9 percent. You'll also be charged the late payment
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS advises taxpayers to consider less expensive ways of
coming up with the money, such as a bank loan. Along that line, you
might want to consider paying your taxes by credit cards, provided
you can get a better deal than the IRS gives.
</P>
<P>
   If you're filing online, the software you use can handle your
credit card payment. If you're filing a paper return, you can call
(888) 2PAY-TAX to pay. However, be aware that you'll have to pay a
fee ranging from about 2.5 percent to 3 percent to the company that
processes your payment, Official Payments Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Stives advises taxpayers to ''write a check for what you can
pay'' when they file their returns -- even if it's only $100 on a
tax bill that runs into the thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Problem: I don't have all my papers together.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: If you're missing a 1099 form issued by a bank or
brokerage, you should be able to call a customer service number and
get the information you need over the phone or by fax or e-mail. As
long as you had no tax withheld from the interest, dividends or
other income reported on the 1099, you don't need to attach the
paper itself to your return -- you just need the numbers from it,
Stives said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if you need to find out how much mortgage interest
you paid because you can't find your 1098 form, call your lender.
</P>
<P>
   It gets more difficult when what you need is the information
from Schedule K-1, which reports income from partnerships, estates,
trusts and what are called S corporations. K-1s tend to be mailed
much closer to the filing deadline than W-2s and 1099s. Not only do
they report various kinds of income (for example, ordinary income,
capital gains, rental income), they also detail for the taxpayer
which income needs to be reported on which tax schedules and forms.
</P>
<P>
   You can't put together an accurate return without the numbers
from a K-1 form. ''If you don't have it, don't file,'' said Robert
K. Doyle, a CPA with Spoor, Doyle &AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg,
Fla., advising taxpayers in this situation to file for an
extension.
</P>
<P>
   You might also find you're missing canceled checks; call your
bank and ask for copies. If you're missing receipts from charitable
contributions, ask the organization to send you one.
</P>
<P>
   If it looks like you won't be able to get all the information
together before the deadline, consider an extension.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have all the tax forms you need and have access to
the Internet, you can download forms from the IRS Web site
(http://www.irs.gov). If you're not online, phone the IRS now,
before the end-of-the-season crunch; the toll-free number is (800)
TAX-FORM.
</P>
<P>
   Libraries may have forms you can photocopy, and post offices and
banks may also have them (but don't count on finding all the forms
you need at the last minute).
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Problem: I'm just overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: It depends on whether you're going to do your taxes
yourself, or have them done by a preparer.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning on doing your own taxes, Doyle suggests
sitting down first with your 1998 return, and review what's in it.
This will help you focus on what information you need to find. Do
this whether you did your return by hand or on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to organize your return to make it more
manageable: ''Break it into bite-sized pieces,'' Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   That means gathering papers that document your income, such as
W-2 and 1099 forms, into one pile. Gather papers for your itemized
deductions into piles such as: taxes, charitable contributions,
employee expenses. If you have a business, keep those documents
separate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do your organizing before you get ready to prepare the
return,'' Doyle said, advising that if you try to work with ''a
pile of paper in a paper bag, forget it -- it's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If you feel like you really can't get it all done on time, file
for an extension rather than rushing and making mistakes that will
have to be amended in the future, Stives said.
</P>
<P>
   ''An extension is infinitely better than an amended return,
which is always manually reviewed by the IRS,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle suggested taxpayers set their own earlier deadline -- such
as April 10 or 11 for a fairly simple return -- and to file for an
extension if they can't complete it by that date.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a preparer such as an accountant to do your return,
and you haven't made an appointment, you might want to think now
about getting an extension, Stives said. At this point in the tax
season, it might be hard for a preparer to fit you into an already
crowded schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Stives said, if your return is complicated, it might
be better to wait to file for the extension and get your return
done in late April or May, simply because your preparer will be
less pressed and will be able to do a better job.
</P>
<P>
   Stives said he's learned from experience that once the rush is
over, ''my head will be clear and you'll have my undivided
attention.''

<HEADLINE> Chavez Under Fire for Oil Changes  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN GUTKIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Even though he helped engineer a huge
increase in world oil prices, President Hugo Chavez is being
criticized at home for policies that some say could undermine the
long-term health of the world's second-largest state-owned
petroleum company.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2,000 executives of Petroleos de Venezuela, known as
PdVSA, have resigned since Chavez took office more than a year ago
promising to do away with what he called the oil firm's ''gold card
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has scaled back plans to expand Venezuela's oil
production capacity, slowed a policy to open the oil sector to
private investment and filled the upper ranks of the
45,000-employee company with political loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's detractors say he's endangering the financial autonomy
of a company long considered an oasis of efficiency and good
management in a country notoriously lacking in both. His
appointment of Hector Ciavaldini, a former executive fired from
PdVSA in 1995, as the company's president has ''created confusion
and low morale,'' said Andres Sosa Pietri, a former PdVSA
president.
</P>
<P>
   To counter such criticism, Chavez often points to his role in
raising oil prices, largely by reversing Venezuela's long-standing
position as a ''quota buster'' in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of the Chavez administration, Mexico and Saudi
Arabia agreed to join Venezuela in a March 1998 production cut to
boost oil prices that had reached 12-year lows.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world oil industry was teetering on the verge of
insolvency. World producers should give thanks to Mexico, Saudi
Arabia and Venezuela for rescuing them,'' said Antonio Szabo, an
oil consultant based in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The oil price increase has been a lifesaver for oil-dependent
nations that had been reeling from the effects of sagging prices.
The price of a barrel of Venezuelan oil is now at a nine-year high
of $28.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the first time in memory, an oil-price boom has not
translated into an economic recovery in Venezuela, where the
economy shrank by 7 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   To Sosa Pietri, the price increase has been too high and too
fast, contributing to an overvalued currency that discourages other
exports and harms local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has a perverse effect on the economy,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Oil Minister Alvaro Silva told The Associated Press last
week that the Chavez government agrees the soaring prices are not
healthy. He said he was sure OPEC nations would agree on production
increases at a March 27 meeting in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wants to return to abrupt price changes, we all agree
on that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has pledged to put oil to work for the poor in this South
American nation of 23 million people. A PdVSA tanker provided
drinking water and a company airplane brought medicine to survivors
of recent flooding that killed thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also insist they remain committed to oil expansion,
albeit at a slower pace, and will capitalize on Venezuela's
comparative advantages: the largest oil reserves in the Western
Hemisphere, relatively low extraction costs and proximity to the
United States, which purchases most of Venezuela's oil.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge will be to attract oil investment in a politically
charged atmosphere characterized by Chavez's constant verbal
attacks on the private sector and a legal framework put into flux
by a new constitution pushed through by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Viergutz, an oil industry executive bidding to participate
in a pipeline project in Venezuela, said he's optimistic about
opportunities in the oil sector because of current prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Venezuelan oil industry, regardless of who is in the
government, is an extremely important provider of foreign reserves
and income,'' he said. ''No government is going to allow the oil
industry to decay.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Holds Gun Control Rally  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton accused the National Rifle
Association of political skullduggery today as he welcomed fellow
Democrats and an improbable Republican to a White House pep rally
on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which has been in a war of words with the NRA
for several days, said the gun group was threatening to retaliate
against members of Congress who voted against it on a gun measure
today.
</P>
<P>
   The House planned to vote on a bill urging members of a
House-Senate conference committee to begin reconciling two versions
of gun control measures passed last year.
</P>
<P>
   If passed, the bill would be only a recommendation to the
negotiators trying to write the compromise. The conference
committee has been idle since its inaugural meeting in August,
which Clinton said today is no accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want this conference committee to meet,'' Clinton
said of the gun lobby. ''Why is that? They know the people aren't
with them, that's why,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the few Republicans who joined him today want the
committee to begin work because they, like the White House, want
some kind of action this year. Clinton said he did not ask the
Republicans, who included one of the leaders of the House
impeachment of the president, whether they support his gun-control
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The former impeachment manager, Rep. Jim Rogan, R-Calif., did
not speak at the East Room event. Rogan faces a tough re-election
fight in a changing district, and is considered the most vulnerable
of the 13 House members who outlined the case against Clinton to
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the NRA was
''harassing'' House members over today's planned vote, threatening
to count it as part of the NRA's rating system for lawmakers. Many
lawmakers prize their favorable ratings from the NRA, which is one
of Washington's richest and most powerful lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know how the NRA works. There's no denying the tactics
they use,'' Lockhart said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know how this White House works,'' NRA Executive Vice
President Wayne LaPierre said later. ''They try to demonize, they
attack those challenging them and they try to focus on anything
except what they are vulnerable on, and what they are vulnerable on
here is the complete collapse of enforcement of existing federal
gun laws.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, the NRA accuses the Clinton administration of
pressing for unnecessary gun control while failing to enforce laws
already on the books.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does a criminal have to fear from these guys?'' LaPierre
asked today. ''Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has challenged Congress to pass what he calls
''commonsense gun control'' before the April 20 anniversary of the
Columbine High School shootings in Colorado, although his plan
languished in Congress last year.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to impose background checks on sales at gun shows that
could take as long as 72 hours. Many congressional Republicans, and
the NRA, want any such checks to be instant or at least require no
longer than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''In all candor, I think taking a little time and a little
inconvenience to save a lot of lives is a good deal for America,''
Clinton said today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants trigger locks to be required on new guns and
a ban on the import of large-capacity ammunition clips.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Looks At Russia Policies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accusing the Clinton administration of failed
policies towards Russia, House Republicans organized a task force
Wednesday aimed at solving security, law-enforcement and economic
problems with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the all-GOP group is Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who
once ran a company that translated Pravda into English and in 1991
gave a speech in Russian to several hundred Soviet sailors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Cold War might be over, but Russia is still up to its old
tricks,'' Cox said at a news conference at which House Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., announced the task force. Cox chairs the
House GOP Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the continuing importance of Russia and U.S.-Russian
relations, the situation in Russia continues to deteriorate,''
Hastert said, ''even as Russia's proliferation efforts increase,
particularly to Iran, and its bloody war in Chechnya continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., who was in Moscow last month, said
Russians appear willing to give up some of their freedoms to
maintain order, and acting president Vladimir Putin ''is probably
the perfect candidate'' to rule with an iron fist.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot we don't know about Mr. Putin,'' said Goss,
House intelligence committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The task force includes Republican committee and subcommittee
chairmen who deal with economic, military and social issues
affecting U.S. relations with Russia.

<HEADLINE> Judge faults inmate's lengthy solitary confinement, but reducesaward  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A drug-gang gunman who killed a New York
City policeman in 1988 had a $660,000 jury award reduced to
$237,500 for being locked up in solitary confinement for more than
four years.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Jonathan Feldman upheld a federal jury's finding
in February 1999 that inmate David McClary's civil rights were
violated by prison officials who kept him confined to a bare cell
for 23 hours a day from Nov. 20, 1989, to March 11, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   McClary, 34, is serving 25 years to life in prison for executing
a rookie police officer in the New York borough of Queens in
February 1988. Officer Edward Byrne was shot as he sat in a patrol
car guarding the home of a witness in a drug case.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling that the jury's damages for mental anguish were
excessive, the judge reduced them to the amount McClary originally
sought in a lawsuit against four prison officials. That translates
to nearly $120 for each of the 1,573 days he spent in solitary
confinement, plus $50,000 for emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Evaluating excessiveness in the context of an individual
spending four uninterrupted years in solitary confinement is no
easy task,'' Feldman said in a 36-page decision this week. Being
sentenced to isolation, he added, ''was potentially limitless, a
fact that exacerbated the damages he suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No punishment would be too great for him, therefore he doesn't
deserve any kind of judgment,'' Patrick J. Lynch, president of the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said through an aide Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials claimed that the notoriety of his crime made it
too risky to put McClary in the general prison population.
</P>
<P>
   McClary had refused to testify against Howard ''Pappy'' Mason, a
suspected drug kingpin charged with ordering the execution. Mason
was convicted in 1989 of racketeering charges for his role in the
officer's slaying, which set in motion a decade-long war on crack
cocaine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   McClary's time in solitary -- known as administrative segregation
-- was split between Attica, Southport prison in Elmira and Wende
prison in Alden, near Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The jury had found a prison official at Attica liable for
$10,000 in damages. But for the three years McClary spent in
solitary in Wende, $650,000 in damages were awarded against former
state prisons Commissioner Thomas A. Coughlin III and two officials
who worked at Wende.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said McClary has until March 24 to accept the new
amount of damages awarded or seek a new trial. McClary is
imprisoned at Shawangunk prison near New York, and his first parole
hearing is 13 years away.

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Aluminum Faces Fines  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN SAYRE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A federal safety agency on Wednesday proposed
that Kaiser Aluminum Corp. pay fines of $533,000 for an explosion
last year at its Gramercy, La., plant that injured 29 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration cited
Kaiser for 23 violations of safety regulations. The agency said the
explosion resulted from a faulty pressure relief system in several
large tanks and blamed on the plant's management.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also accused Kaiser of interfering with its
investigation into the July 5 explosion, which largely destroyed
the plant and also damaged homes and cars in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, which earlier denied all of the allegations and appealed
the citations, said Wednesday it will appeal the proposed fines as
well to the Federal Safety and Health Review Commission. If the
company loses on the administrative level, it can appeal to federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in a statement that although the fines were
only half of the maximum amount, the proposal was ''nonetheless
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The plant refined bauxite ore using a caustic solution to
produce alumina, which is the principal ingredient in aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, Kaiser announced it would spend $198 million to
rebuild and upgrade the plant, which is expected to be in full
operation during the first quarter of 2001. Kaiser said the rebuilt
plant would produce alumina more efficiently and cut air pollution
by 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The citations will have no bearing on the company's plan to
rebuild the plant, Kaiser said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the explosion, temporary workers were staffing
the plant. The United Steelworkers of America has been on strike
against Kaiser since Sept. 30, 1998. The company locked out union
members in January 1999.

<HEADLINE> Disney Plans Offices in Glendale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE, Calif. (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. plans to spend up to $2
billion on a sprawling complex of offices, sound stages and other
production facilities here.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Central Creative Campus eventually will house 10,000
employees on 3.6 million square feet of building space, according
to documents filed with the city of Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the company's operations at Glendale's Grand
Central Business Park will be anchored by the firm's Imagineering
division, which designs Disney's theme parks, but there also will
be new facilities for film, television and new media.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Moreland, vice president of development for Imagineering,
said the project eventually would double the company's existing
work force at the 125-acre site, which borders the DreamWorks SKG
animation campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are top-quality, high-income jobs,'' said David Fleming,
chairman of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley.
''This is one of the largest redevelopment projects in the entire
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Imagineering is scattered among dozens of older, unmarked
office buildings in Glendale's Grand Central Business Park.
Disney's plan calls for demolishing most of those buildings and
creating a new office campus.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the project is starting to worry some residents who
live between the Disney property and the Golden State Freeway.
Disney officials are meeting with residents to address their
concerns, Moreland said.

<HEADLINE> Federal-Mogul To Close Warehouses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- Federal-Mogul Corp. said Wednesday it
will close 25 North American facilities and cut 1,500 jobs in an
effort to improve the auto parts company's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to shutting 23 warehouses and two factories, the
company plans to make changes at 19 other facilities in North and
South America and consolidate 18 manufacturing and distribution
operations in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Federal-Mogul has not yet decided whether those changes would
involve closing or downsizing plants or moving product lines,
spokeswoman Kimberly A. Welch said Wednesday. The company has 170
plants worldwide, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will cut Federal-Mogul's global workforce of 50,400
employees by about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Federal-Mogul said costs related to the restructuring will
require about $100 million in charges against earnings over the
next two years, as well as an additional $100 million in
incremental expenses and capital expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization will begin this year and will be completed by
the end of 2002, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chip Stocks Rise Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue chip stocks rose sharply today as investors
moved some of the money that has streamed out of the technology
sector this week back into long-forgotten industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 250.75 at 10,061.99.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 70.37 at 4,636.26, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was
up 26.39 at 1,385.54.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip Dow, which has dramatically underperformed the
Nasdaq so far this year, rose today on the strength of old-line
industrial companies like DuPont, up 3 3/16 to 51, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, up 4\ to 76 13/16 and 3M, up 3[ to 82\.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much damage has already been done in these old economy
stocks,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP;
Co. ''We're finally seeing money coming into some of the bargain
stocks that have been created by the selling pressure of the past
few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip technology shares were mixed. Intel rose 4 15/16 to
122 13/16, but Hewlett-Packard fell 7 11/16 to 132 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech companies that dominate the Nasdaq were mostly
lower today, compounding the index's 341-point loss in the past two
sessions. Yahoo! was off 7 3/16 to 161 9/16 today and PMC-Sierra
fell 21| to 196].
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in those shares, which have been among the market's top
performers in 2000, suggested investors are taking profits from
their sharp gains this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has been on a rocket ship, and I think investors
will work a bit harder to bring it down before it can start moving
higher again,'' Hogan said. ''The Nasdaq is in the midst of a
corrective process, which is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies, which led the market's decline on
Tuesday after the United States and Britain agreed to share data on
genetics, regained some ground today. Human Genome Sciences rose 2
31/64 to 126.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle rose 3[ to 80[. The company, a leading maker of business
software, said after the close of trading Tuesday that
third-quarter profits soared 160 percent, easily surpassing
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the market's continued volatility suggested that
investors were reluctant to take major new positions in the days
ahead of the government's reports on the Producer Price Index and
the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The PPI, due for release Thursday, and the CPI, due out Friday,
are closely watched gauges of inflationary pressures. The Federal
Reserve is expected to take both reports under consideration when
it meets next Tuesday to discuss interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street expect the Fed to raise rates. An increase
would be the fifth since last June, when the Fed began trying to
engineer a gradual slowdown in the economy to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Keller, chairman of the investment policy committee at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis, said he expects rising interest rates
to eventually take a toll on technology stocks, which have held up
far better than the broad market in the months since the Fed began
raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns prompted Keller to cut back on the firm's
exposure to stocks. Today, A.G. Edwards shifted its asset
allocation model to include 55 percent stocks, 35 percent bonds and
10 percent cash. Previously, the firm recommended 60 percent
stocks, 35 percent bonds and 5 percent cash.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 814.71 million
shares, ahead of Tuesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 10.53 to
562.46.

<HEADLINE> Regis Seeking First Daytime Emmy  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that Susan Lucci has won, Regis Philbin is
the new lovable loser searching for his first Daytime Emmy award.
Strangely enough, he can win this year with a show that airs in
prime-time.
</P>
<P>
   The host of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' earned Daytime
Emmy nominations on Wednesday for best game show host and best talk
show host.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin has been nominated seven times before for his role on
''Live with Regis and Kathie Lee,'' but has never won an Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   Caught flat-footed by the success of ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' Emmy administrators shunted the show off to the
Daytime Emmys, even though it is routinely the top-rated show in
prime-time. They said it's because there's no game show category in
the prime-time Emmys, but there is in daytime.
</P>
<P>
   The decision aggravated ABC, the show's producer and Philbin,
who called it ''silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These things have aggravated me for years,'' Philbin said on
Wednesday. ''Who cares?''
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences won't
decide until October whether ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' will
be eligible for prime-time awards in the future, a spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' was nominated for best game
show, along with ''Hollywood Squares,'' ''Jeopardy,'' ''The Price
is Right'' and ''Win Ben Stein's Money.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin was nominated for best talk show host with partner
Kathie Lee Gifford, who recently announced she was quitting this
summer. They'll compete against Donny and Marie Osmond, Rosie
O'Donnell, Martin Short and ''The View'' crew: Barbara Walters,
Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Lisa Ling.
</P>
<P>
   After winning 15 Daytime Emmys, Oprah Winfrey took herself out
of the running for best talk show host and best talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Lucci won her first Daytime Emmy as best soap opera actress last
year after losing in the category 18 straight times. This year, she
wasn't nominated for her role as Erica Kane on ''All My Children.''
</P>
<P>
   The soap opera ''The Young and the Restless'' earned a
staggering 28 nominations, more than twice its closest competitor,
''Sesame Street,'' which had 13. ''All My Children'' and ''The
View'' each had 12.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees for best actress on a daytime soap opera were Finola
Hughes of ''All My Children''; Susan Flannery of ''The Bold and the
Beautiful''; Hillary B. Smith of ''One Life to Live''; Jeanne
Cooper of ''The Young and the Restless''; and Jess Walton of ''The
Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   Best actor nominees for soap operas were David Canary of ''All
My Children''; Anthony Geary of ''General Hospital''; Robert Woods
of ''One Life to Live''; Peter Bergman of ''The Young and the
Restless''; and Eric Braeden of ''The Young and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be given out May 19 in a ceremony at Radio City
Music Hall in New York, televised by ABC.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Soldiers Fire At U.S. Agents  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- Mexican soldiers strayed into U.S.
territory and fired two shots at uniformed Border Patrol agents
during an anti-drug mission, the agency said Wednesday. Nine
Mexican soldiers were briefly detained.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in the shooting late Tuesday in a remote area
south of Santa Teresa, N.M., just west of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's National Defense Secretariat said today it had no
information on the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Antonio Fraire, spokesman for the Mexican Consulate in El
Paso, said the soldiers accidentally crossed the international
line, but he had no information about a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Border Patrol said two Humvees carrying Mexican
soldiers on an anti-drug mission crossed the border at about 10:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A wire cattle fence runs along the border in the area, and
markers at each mile would be difficult to see at night, Border
Patrol spokesman Doug Mosier said.
</P>
<P>
   The uniformed Border Patrol agents approached, identified
themselves in Spanish and explained that the soldiers were in U.S.
territory, Mosier said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, two shots were fired from one of the Humvees,
which then returned to Mexico. It's unclear who fired the shots,
Mosier said. No one was hit, and Border Patrol agents did not
return fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The nine occupants of the second Humvee surrendered and were
taken to the Santa Teresa Border Patrol station. They were released
within a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Border Patrol and its parent agency, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, will discuss the incident
with Mexican government officials, the Border Patrol said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Want Colleagues' Votes  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reps. Billy Tauzin and Mike Oxley each have
organized seven-figure fund-raising dinners, but the proceeds won't
be going to their re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the two Republicans are collecting money for colleagues
in hopes of retaining GOP control of Congress and solidifying
friendships in their quest to succeed retiring Rep. Thomas Bliley,
R-Va., as chairman of the powerful House Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to self-imposed six-year term limits for committee
chairmen, GOP lawmakers are jockeying to position themselves for
plum assignments that would become available next year if the GOP
remains in charge of the House.
</P>
<P>
   It's a race nearly as intense as the fight between Republicans
and Democrats for control of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like the bidding war is off and running,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics,
a nonpartisan research group that studies money and campaigns.
''Their dollars are probably the things that will propel one of
these two guys into the chairmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin, a Democratic convert from Louisiana, and Ohio's Oxley
are sharing funds from their campaign bank accounts, raising money
for others through leadership political action committees they
formed and hosting dinners for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, the House GOP's fund-raising arm.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley chaired a first-ever $10,000-a-plate event in New York
City last January that brought in $1.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin takes his turn Thursday as organizer of the House GOP's
annual dinner in Washington, which is expected to raise a record
$5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of the drill,'' Oxley said of the fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce post is one of Congress' plum assignments. The
committee handles legislation for industries that touch ever facet
of Americans' lives from telephones, cable TV and the Internet to
airlines and drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other soon-to-be vacant chairmanships also have spawned hot
races. Rep. Philip Crane of Illinois is battling House
Administration Committee chairman Bill Thomas of California to head
the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. The current chairman,
Bill Archer of Texas, is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Other battles are likely for control of the International
Relations, Armed Services, and Banking and Financial Services
committees, whose chairmen must leave their positions in 2001
because of term limits imposed by House Republicans in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley and Tauzin provide a glimpse into how the battles are
waged.
</P>
<P>
   Through Dec. 31, Oxley had doled out $107,887 from his campaign
committee and leadership PAC to colleagues, while Tauzin
contributed $79,889.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Oxley was the featured guest at a
$1,000-per-person dinner for Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. And next
month, he headlines a fund-raiser for Rep. Greg Walden of Oregon at
the Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young concert in downtown Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Tauzin is cooking up a ''cajun luncheon''
next week for Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan and staging a ''cajun
cookout'' for Rep. Anne Northup of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Oxley, chairman of the Commerce Committee's finance and
hazardous materials subcommittee, played a key role in passing
legislation that broke down the Depression-era barriers against
banks, insurance companies and investment firms competing against
each other.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted one of the leading industry advocates of the bill,

   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A federal safety agency today proposed that
Kaiser Aluminum Corp. pay fines of $533,000 for an explosion last
year at its Gramercy, La., plant that injured 29 workers. Earlier,
the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration cited Kaiser for 23
violations of safety regulations. The agency said the explosion
resulted from a faulty pressure relief system in several large
tanks and blamed on the plant's management. The agency also accused
Kaiser of interfering with its investigation into the July 5
explosion. Kaiser said it will appeal the proposed fines.

   GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- Strong sales of yogurt and Hamburger

that profits rose to $153.3 million, or 50 cents a share, in the
three months ended Feb. 28, compared with $141.1 million, or 45
cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. The performance matched

would involve closing or downsizing plants or moving product lines.

   U.S. Trade Deficit at All-Time High
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's deficit in the broadest measure of
trade surged to an all-time high of $338.9 billion last year, more
than $100 billion higher than the deficit for 1998. The Commerce
Department said today that the deficit in the current account,
which measures not only trade in goods and services but also
investment flows and foreign aid payments, was up 53.7 percent from
the previous record, a $220.6 billion imbalance in 1998. The huge,
$118.4 billion deterioration in the current-account deficit
demonstrates dramatically that the one blot on an otherwise

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Industrial production at the nation's
factories, utilities and mines rose at a slower-than-expected pace

after posting strong gains the month before. The Federal Reserve
reported today that production increased by 0.3 percent last month,
weaker than the 0.5 percent gain many analysts were forecasting.
That followed a big 1.1 percent leap in production in January.
Operating capacity was 81.7 percent in February, the same as the
month before and slightly less than some analysts expected.

reporters today that recent gloomy economic data concealed several

He insisted that Japan's economy will grow in the fiscal year

<HEADLINE> France To Crack Down on Laundering  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- France's ministers pledged Wednesday to crack down
on international money laundering as they adopted a sweeping new
bill aimed at tightening economic regulation.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill is passed in parliament, the government would win
new powers to oversee, and in some circumstances block, financial
transactions between France and problematic offshore tax havens.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also outlines tougher punishments for money
launderers, and would allow the government to shut down
unregistered shell companies in France.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou told reporters the government
should ''show an example'' in fighting money laundering. France is
currently seeking support among fellow members of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations for tougher steps to curb
international money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The measures are part of broader legislation also designed to
tighten stock market rules, improve corporate governance and stamp
out unfair pricing in France's retail sector.
</P>
<P>
   Government ministers said the bill draws on lessons learned
during the often bitter hostile takeover battles that shook
France's banking, energy and retail sectors last year. It also
endeavors to strengthen the powers of ordinary consumers and
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The bill includes measures designed to keep employees better
informed of takeover bids, to speed up the processing of hostile
takeover bids and to curb belligerent advertising campaigns mounted
by companies involved in stock market takeover battles.
</P>
<P>
   France's business leaders have criticized the bill, saying extra
legislation would stifle small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Christian Sautter said, ''We want to set out
the economic rules of the game, not to hold back small companies,
but to make sure there is space for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, if passed, also would oblige companies to make public
previously secret shareholder pacts and would strengthen the
regulatory powers of the stock market watchdog.

<HEADLINE> Critic of Census Angers Government  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Postal Service wants one of the Census
Bureau's biggest critics to stop sending out its latest series of
fund-raising letters, claiming it violates federal law covering
deceptive mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Postal Service Inspector Attorney Thomas Sottile, in a letter to
the Southeastern Legal Foundation, said the mailings had to stop
because the envelopes implied a connection to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   The words ''IMPORTANT 2000 CENSUS MATERIALS ENCLOSED'' and ''BUY
U.S. SAVINGS BONDS'' appear in bold letters above the address label
on the group's mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Atlanta-based nonprofit foundation asks recipients
to sign a petition requesting the Census Bureau not to use a
statistical method known as sampling when compiling data from the
upcoming count. It also asks for a donation.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Glavin, president of the foundation, said Wednesday that
he had not received Sottile's letter, but called it ''moot'' since
the 250,000 mailings are already out to households.
</P>
<P>
   The mailings were first criticized last month by Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking member of the House Government Reform
Committee's census panel, for looking too much like a real
government mailing at a time when census forms were arriving in
mailboxes. Maloney supports sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service said it had not received any consumer
complaints about the letter. Glavin said the foundation usually
does not send out the same type of fund-raising mailings twice
anyway, and called Maloney's opposition a partisan attack.

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- House Bill 1737 calls for the creation

   If enacted, the governor's appointee would be charged with

</P>
<P>
   It's also big business to Albright, co-owner of two barbecue
restaurants.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Withholds Ecuadorian Funds  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key congressman has ordered a suspension of
almost $20 million in U.S. assistance to Ecuador to protest what he
considers unjust treatment of a Florida man serving an eight-year
prison term there on a 1998 money laundering conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves James Williams of Jacksonville, who waited
more than two years for his trial and now has waited more than a
year for his appeal to be heard by the Ecuadorian Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign Operations, ordered the aid
suspension. As the lawmaker who oversees House foreign aid
appropriations, he has the authority to discontinue assistance
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some time, I have been very concerned about the slow pace
with which Ecuador has afforded an American citizen due process in
its judicial system,'' Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope would be that this matter can be resolved sooner
rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadorian Embassy officials did not respond to a request for
comment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials have raised the Williams case
repeatedly with high-level Ecuadorian officials to protest the
delays. The department describes Ecuador's judicial system as
''slow, inefficient and cumbersome.''
</P>
<P>
   According to department officials, the major impact of the aid
suspension will be on programs that directly support the poorest
Ecuadorians, including family planning and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years after his arrest in Ecuador, Williams was
indicted in Tampa on grounds that he was involved in a drug
trafficking and money laundering scheme run by Jose Castrillon, a
Colombian who has been convicted on drug charges in a U.S. court.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Mitrani, Williams' lawyer, expressed hope that Ecuador
will release him shortly so he will have the chance ''to have all
of the facts presented to an unbiased tribunal in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other flaws in Williams' December 1998 trial, he was not
allowed to confront his accusers, Mitrani said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Corrine Brown, a Democrat who represents Williams in
Congress, said his case has been one of the most frustrating she
has encountered as an elected official.
</P>
<P>
   ''For three years I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to
seek a fair judicial proceeding for Mr. Williams, both in Ecuador
and in the United States.... I am hopeful that some day, Mr.
Williams will receive the due process he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has visited Ecuador three times to assist Williams. Five
other lawmakers and former President Carter have gone to Ecuador
and raised the issue with government officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest in September 1996, Williams ran
Caribbean Fisheries. He bought fish from small packing houses in
Latin America and sold them to restaurant wholesalers in the
southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wife, Robin, said Wednesday in a telephone interview
from Jacksonville that Castrillon was one of his 22 suppliers. She
maintains that Castrillon's fishing business activities, in
contrast to his drug dealing, were legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   She has maintained for years that her husband's arrest in
Ecuador was sought by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, an
allegation denied by DEA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Williams, who returned this week from her 15th visit to
Ecuador, said her husband's 3{-year incarceration has been a
''frightful situation'' that has led to their financial
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   She said she and other family members have to provide him with
clothing, money, food and toiletries because the prison ''provides
nothing for inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This prison is a death sentence,'' she said. ''Jim has watched
people die because they can't get out for treatment.''

Rep. Vento Returns From Cancer   
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Bruce Vento returned to Congress only a
month after having a lung removed because of cancer and said
Wednesday the welcome he received from colleagues was gratifying
but painful.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have had a badge that said, 'No hugs, just kisses,'''
Vento joked, still smarting from a sore back after surgery. ''But
getting around that minor inconvenience of pain, it was good.''
</P>
<P>
   Vento, 59, announced earlier this year that he had malignant
mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer usually linked to asbestos
exposure. The Democrat from St. Paul, Minn., said he would not seek
re-election after 24 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Looking fit, Vento met with reporters in his office, which is
adorned with photos of national parks -- one of his passions -- and a
pennant of the 1987 World Series champion Minnesota Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Vento said sharing the illness with the public has its
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts sometimes to be so transparent,'' he said. ''Most of
us, when you have a serious illness, you don't necessarily want to
lay it all out in front of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But the public outpouring -- Vento has received thousands of
cards, letters and phone calls of support -- has been encouraging.
''On balance, it's very helpful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vento said one of his remaining priorities is passage of
legislation that would make it easier for certain Hmong immigrants
-- a Laotian ethnic group -- to become U.S. citizens. The bill, which
Vento first introduced 10 years ago, would waive the English
language requirement for Hmong who were recruited by the CIA to
fight during the Vietnam War. Minnesota is home to an estimated
60,000 Hmong, about one-fifth of the 300,000 living in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for passage improved last month when Minnesota Gov.
Jesse Ventura lobbied House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., who promised his support. On Tuesday, Hyde said he
would name the bill after Vento.
</P>
<P>
   Vento, the father of three adult sons, said he would like to
continue public service after Congress and would prefer to work on
national park issues.
</P>
<P>
   He walks each day and plans to start biking again soon. Next
month, he will start chemotherapy and possibly radiation. He said
doctors have told him he has a 50 percent chance of living five or
more years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a pretty pragmatic sort of guy, a realist, I guess,'' he
said. ''We all know we're going to die, we just don't what's going
to get us. ... I've got parents that are in their 80s, and I
figured I've got 20 more years. But whether or not I get that now,
I don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Spielberg To Take On Kubrick Film  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steven Spielberg plans to pick up where the
late director Stanley Kubrick left off.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. announced Tuesday that Spielberg will write and
direct ''A.I.,'' an epic science fiction tale that Kubrick had been
planning before his death last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stanley had a vision for this project that was evolving over
18 years,'' Spielberg said in a written statement. ''I am intent on
bringing to the screen as much of that vision as possible, along
with elements of my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg released no details about the plot. He and Kubrick had
been friends and Spielberg discussed the project extensively with
Kubrick, whose final film was last summer's ''Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A.I.,'' which is an acronym for ''artificial intelligence,''
is scheduled to start production in July. It wasn't clear how much
of the story Kubrick had assembled before he died on March 7, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Blood Test Confirm Jagger Paternity  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blood tests confirm that Mick Jagger is the
father of a Brazilian lingerie model's baby.
</P>
<P>
   Jagger was sworn in Wednesday by telephone from London for a
Manhattan Family Court proceeding over child support. He had
already acknowledged paternity informally.
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stone said he had no objection to being listed as
the father on the birth certificate of Lucas Maurice Morad Jagger,
born May 18, in New York to Luciana Morad.
</P>
<P>
   Morad is asking Jagger for $35,000 a month in support. He now
pays her $5,500 a month. Hearing Examiner David Kirshblum said he
would order temporary support of $10,000 a month and hold a hearing
May 9 on a possible adjustment after Jagger, who has six other
children, produces financial documents.

<HEADLINE> Jane Fonda To Keep Awards Dress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jane Fonda can't bear to part with a designer
dress she promised to auction after wearing it to the March 26
Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've fallen in love with it,'' she said of the strapless satin
dress, designed by Vera Wang.
</P>
<P>
   Fonda announced earlier this month the dress would go to the
highest bidder at a June 27 movie premiere at the Fox Theatre. She
said the proceeds would go to Georgia Campaign for Adolescent
Pregnancy Prevention, which Fonda founded in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've changed my mind. I'm not auctioning it off after all,''
Fonda said. ''Seriously, I can't just wear this dress for 10
minutes on Oscar night and then turn it over to someone else yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda, scheduled to be a presenter at the Oscars, said she may
be willing to auction the dress in 2001. Premiere-goers will still
be able bid on a vacation with Fonda to her and estranged husband
Ted Turner's Montana ranch. Turner won't be there.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Clamps Down on Radio  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- The government closed Liberia's two
leading independent radio stations Wednesday, saying they posed a
security threat to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss-funded Star Radio was shut down and its Internet service
disbanded, while broadcasts by Roman Catholic-run Radio Veritas
were suspended until its management agrees in writing to limit
itself to religious broadcasts, the government announced in a radio
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The government denied the move amounted to an attack on press
freedom, saying it took the action to prevent the country from
being destabilized by ''agents.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This trend is a design by detractors to open old wounds by
raising issues which threaten to reverse progress made in the
reconciliation efforts and to plunge the country back into civil
war,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia had a brutal civil war from 1989-1996, and President
Charles Taylor headed one of the most powerful factions. Since
being elected president in 1997, Taylor has frequently come under
fire from pro-democracy and human rights groups, which charge him
with heavy-handed tactics against his critics.
</P>
<P>
   Star Radio and Veritas, considered the country's most credible
and independent radio stations, frequently host phone-in shows
where callers sometimes express views critical of Taylor and his
government.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Veritas program, Catholic Archbishop Michael Francis
described Taylor as a demigod who could be criticized only at the
risk of being charged with sedition.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time Star Radio has had a run-in with the
Taylor regime. In 1998, Taylor temporarily banned it from
operation, saying it had been assigned its frequencies without
authorization. The government has also refused to grant it a
short-wave frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The stations' directors did not comment Wednesday, a public
holiday. But the main journalist association, the Press Union of
Liberia, denounced the move.
</P>
<P>
   ''Press freedom has come under vehement attack. The government's
action is outrageous, most unfortunate and disturbing,'' the union
said in a statement. Officials said they had called an urgent
meeting to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heavily armed police troops surrounded Star Radio's
offices and were preventing journalists from entering.

<HEADLINE> 20,000 Demonstrate Against Belarus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- Thousands of opponents of authoritarian
President Alexander Lukashenko marched through the Belarusian
capital Wednesday night, calling for his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The march, which attracted an estimated 20,000 people, ended
peacefully. A similar protest in October ended in a bloody clash
between police and stone-throwing demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the marchers carried huge caricature masks of
Lukashenko, Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler. Others bore the
red-and-white opposition flags banned by Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came here to protest against the state we live in. We are
sick and tired of empty promises of a man who was elected president
by mistake. Belarus needs changes and it will have a happy
future,'' said Yuri Khadyka, one of the leaders of the opposition
Belarus People's Front.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Statkevich, a leader of the social-democratic party
Narodnaya Kramada, said: ''The present power hates its people and
tradespeople, but we'll make it respect us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko, an open admirer of the Soviet Union, has led a
systematic crackdown on political opponents and the independent
media that has made him a pariah in the West, but he maintains
solid support at home with his firebrand populism.

<HEADLINE> USAID To Fly Aid to Ethiopia  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GODE, Ethiopia (AP) -- The U.S. Agency for International
Development plans to fly tons of emergency food aid into
southeastern Ethiopia after learning that 53 children under the age
of 5 died in this town last week, a senior agency official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths were just one symptom of a growing food shortage in
this region where drought has created a near-desert, killed
thousands of the livestock that people rely on for food and income
and left millions of people at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a crisis, and we have got to act fast to make sure more
people don't die,'' said Hugh Parmer, the agency's assistant
administrator. ''What really moved me to take action is hearing of
all those children dying. We have got to do something about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Parmer is on a two-week tour of Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia,
Djibouti and Kenya to assess the needs of some 15 million people
threatened by food shortages. He told The Associated Press that
conditions are critical in the region. He said he wanted an air
drop of food to take place in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Parmer visited a feeding center in Gode, 360 miles
southeast of the capital, Addis Ababa. There, 90 severely
malnourished children under age 5 are being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Regional authorities told him eight children had died in the
center since it opened two weeks ago. Another 45 died in camps set
up for the growing number of hungry, desperate people streaming
into town.
</P>
<P>
   Adan Mohammed said she spent 10 days walking 60 miles to the
center with her three children in hopes of receiving food. The
family's 200 cattle and sheep died in the drought.
</P>
<P>
   But the trek proved too much for her four-year-old daughter and
one-year-old son. Both died shortly after reaching Gode four months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Protectively cradling the tiny twin of the dead one-year-old in
her arms, Adan she said she had not seen rain for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know anything any more,'' she said. ''I just have to
wait for something from God.''
</P>
<P>
   According to local officials, the twice-yearly seasonal rains
have failed for the last three years in the Gode area, turning the
land into a near-desert.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 460,000 people in the area, where
temperatures regularly soar above 105 degrees, are nomadic herders.
Ibrahim Haji Abdi, chairman of the regional emergency task force,
said drought had killed more than 50 percent of their sheep and
cattle and 20 percent of their camels, leaving them starving and
helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's never been this bad, not since 1984,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A catastrophic drought in Ethiopia in 1984-85 resulted in a
major famine, the first one whose effects were seen around the
world on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are two months from serious crisis if considerably more aid
doesn't arrive,'' said David Eckerson, USAID's director for
Ethiopia. The agency estimates that 7.7 million people have been
effected.

<HEADLINE> Angola Rebel Helpers in UN's Sights  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council should impose
sanctions on countries that have helped Angola rebels evade a U.N.
ban on weapons and fuel sales and diamond exports, the chairman of
the U.N. sanctions committee said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Ambassador Robert Fowler made the recommendation in
presenting a report by an independent panel that visited 30
countries over six months to determine how UNITA rebels were able
to circumvent the sanctions and restart their war.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the Security Council to adopt the panel's 39
recommendations to beef up implementation of the sanctions and
punish those who have violated them. Among the recommendations was
a call for a three-year arms embargo against countries that have
supplied UNITA with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report details how rebels bought weapons from
Eastern Europe, primarily Bulgaria, and had them shipped via
African countries in exchange for gems.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA rebels said the report was based on ''speculations and
falsehoods,'' according to a statement faxed to The Associated
Press in Lisbon, Portugal, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government and UNITA -- a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- have been fighting
since Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on UNITA
in 1993, a year before the United Nations brokered a peace
agreement between the rebels and Angola's government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, six months before the peace agreement collapsed, the
council expanded the measures to include a ban on rebel diamond
exports, which are estimated to have supplied UNITA with up to $4
billion since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso and
President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo of having helped UNITA leader
Jonas Savimbi with arms and fuel shipments.
</P>
<P>
   It says Rwanda allowed UNITA officials to operate in the
capital, Kigali, and to conduct guns-for-gems transactions with
arms dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The report also accuses Belgium of having such lax standards at
its Antwerp diamond market that rogue dealers were able to trade
UNITA gems with virtually no obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Angola, Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel
said Wednesday that the report failed to include new measures
announced by the government March 4 to tighten controls at the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The panel chairman, Anders Mollander, however, said Belgium
failed to submit the information in time to be included.
</P>
<P>
   France's deputy U.N. ambassador, Yves Doutriaux, welcomed the
report but said it deserved ''careful scrutiny'' because of the
seriousness of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Togo, Burkina Faso, Rwanda and Bulgaria have denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Office minister Peter Hain praised the report's
willingness to expose violators ''who should be ashamed of the way
they are inflicting catastrophe on their fellow Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel called for those countries deemed to be in breach of
the sanctions to be barred from holding senior positions within the
United Nations or other international or regional organizations --
and from playing host to U.N. or international conferences.
</P>
<P>
   That recommendation could have implications for Togo, which is
scheduled to take up the chairmanship of the Organization of
African Unity and be the site of this summer's OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler acknowledged that the report's direct implication of
heads of state, highly unusual in a U.N. report, ''makes everyone
nervous because, frankly, 'it's not done.'''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that the OAU had already set a new standard for
''acceptable behavior'' by declaring in July that coup leaders
would not be welcome in its ranks.

<HEADLINE> Study Focuses on Gender, Speed  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KINNEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Curious how their own running and swimming times stacked up
against the world records, a couple of physicists waded into the
long debate over whether women's bodies are better suited to long
distance competitions than men's.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper appearing in this week's science journal Nature, they
plot the world-record times in running and swimming for racers of
both genders and conclude that women are slower than men by the
same proportion in both distance races and sprints.
</P>
<P>
   But outside physiologists and exercise researchers said the
finding is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The physicists, Sandra Savaglio of the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore and Vincenzo Carbone of the University of
Calabria in Italy, said in races shorter than two minutes, runners
and swimmers use more anaerobic energy, which doesn't require
oxygen. In races longer than that, they use more aerobic energy,
requiring a lot of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how long the race, men and women burn energy at
the same rate, they report.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any physiologist would tell you this,'' said Carl Foster, a
professor of exercise and sports science at the University of
Wisconsin-Lacrosse. ''This isn't groundbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Savaglio, an astronomer, had her interest in athletic
performance piqued a few years ago at a swimming competition among
high-energy physicists in Europe -- not exactly in the same league
as world-class athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The physicists said the results challenge the notion that
women's bodies may be better suited to long races. One theory was
that women have a higher fat content that can be converted to
energy during exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But some exercise experts say that is an outdated assumption
about gender differences and athletics. For women, any athletic
benefits gained by tapping into their supplemental energy supply
would be outweighed by the struggle of carrying the extra fat in a
race, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Jay T. Carney, a senior sports physiologist at the United
States Olympic Committee, criticized what he considers the paper's
oversimplification of the relationship between aerobic and
anaerobic energy. The body's use of each type shifts over the
course of a race, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A 'transition time' is an absolute, total misconception,''
Carney said. ''It's one of the biggest misconceptions in the world
of sports. It's just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, a look at world records suggested that women
marathoners might catch up with men around 2055, because their
times have been improving faster than men's times. Critics bashed
the foundation of that paper as a statistical quirk, saying the
biological limits would be too much to overcome.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Soar; Dow Rises 300  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared more
than 300 points today as investors moved money that has streamed
out of the technology sector this week into long-forgotten
industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow rose 320.17, or
by 3.3 percent, to close at 10,131.41. It was the fourth biggest
point gain ever for the Dow, but wasn't close to a record in
percentage terms. The blue-chip index rose as much as 368.41 points
before slipping back a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors continued shedding technology shares. The
Nasdaq composite index fell 123.94 to close at 4,582.64, bringing
its loss for the past three days to 465 points, or 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a rare day,'' said Vernon Winters, chief investment
officer at Mellon Private Asset Management. ''A lot of money
managers have been forced to sell blue-chips to buy technology
stocks, and today, they're reversing course.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip Dow, which has dramatically underperformed the
Nasdaq so far this year, rose today on the strength of old-line
industrial companies like DuPont, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, and 3M.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much damage has already been done in these old economy
stocks,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP;
Co. ''We're finally seeing money coming into some of the bargain
stocks that have been created by the selling pressure of the past
few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip technology shares were mixed. Intel rose, but
Hewlett-Packard fell steeply.
</P>
<P>
   Even with today's dramatic gains, the Dow remains down about 13
percent in the year to date, while the Nasdaq is up about 13
percent. Weakness in some of the Nasdaq's top performers suggested
that investors are taking profits from their sharp gains this year,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has been on a rocket ship, and I think investors
will work a bit harder to bring it down before it can start moving
higher again,'' Hogan said. ''The Nasdaq is in the midst of a
corrective process, which is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   PMC-Sierra, which had risen 143 percent in the year to date,
fell steeply. Veritas, a developer of storage-management software
that was up about 75 percent this year, also dropped back.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies, which led the market's decline on
Tuesday after the United States and Britain agreed to share data on
genetics, regained some ground today. Human Genome Sciences rose.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle rose. The company, a leading maker of business software,
said after the close of trading Tuesday that third-quarter profits
soared 160 percent, easily surpassing analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the market's continued volatility suggested that
investors were nervous in the days ahead of the government's
reports on the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The PPI, due for release Thursday, and the CPI, due out Friday,
are closely watched gauges of inflationary pressures. The Federal
Reserve is expected to take both reports under consideration when
it meets Tuesday to discuss interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street expect the Fed to raise rates. An increase
would be the fifth since June, when the Fed began trying to
engineer a gradual slowdown in the economy to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Keller, chairman of the investment policy committee at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis, said he expects rising interest rates
to eventually take a toll on technology stocks, which have held up
far better than the broad market in the months since the Fed began
raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns prompted Keller to cut back on the firm's
exposure to stocks. Today, A.G. Edwards shifted its asset
allocation model to include 55 percent stocks, 35 percent bonds and
10 percent cash. Previously, the firm recommended 60 percent
stocks, 35 percent bonds and 5 percent cash.

<HEADLINE> State senator announces his candidacy for U.S. Senate  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ARLINGTON, N.J. (AP) -- State Sen. William Gormley made his
long-anticipated U.S. Senate campaign official Wednesday with a bus
tour across the state and promises to cut taxes and protect Social
Security and retirement funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic County Republican, the fifth to enter the primary
and the only one from southern New Jersey, started his campaign at
a senior citizens' center in Margate. He then swung north to Bergen
County, where he appeared with county Executive William ''Pat''
Schuber, five local veterans and Nicholas Mazzolla.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, he's a breath of fresh air,'' said Mazzolla, a
Republican who offered his front lawn for Gormley's announcement.
He said he favored Gormley's proposal to cut taxes for middle-class
households with incomes of $125,000 or less and to eliminate the
marriage penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzolla, a 45-year-old physical education teacher with three
teen-agers, called Gormley's ideas ''common sense,'' a theme echoed
in the senator's own speech.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley said the Mazzollas represent many middle-class families
who can be forced to choose between caring for aging parents,
putting their children through college and enjoying themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''They hope to be able to pay the bills, put away some savings
and, yes, have some money left over for two weeks at the Shore,''
Gormley said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he would vote to dedicate one-third of the
federal surplus to protect Social Security and Medicare and another
third of the surplus to paying off the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will vote for tax cuts. I will vote to ensure that your
medical decisions are made by you and your doctor and not a
bureaucrat at an HMO. I'll see to it, as best I can, that your
retirement will be secure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley is the best-funded GOP contender for the seat to be
vacated by Democrat Frank Lautenberg, with more than $1.5 million
raised by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   His closest competitor, U.S. Rep. Bob Franks, had raised half of
that amount. Essex County Executive James Treffinger had less than
$600,000.
</P>
<P>
   The other Republican candidates for the Senate seat being
vacated by Democrat Frank Lautenberg are former state Sen. Brian T.
Kennedy and Ramapo College professor Murray Sabrin.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidates are Jon S. Corzine and former Gov. Jim
Florio. The primary is June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley had been preparing his campaign for months, but said he
waited to officially announce until the presidential primaries were
decided, saying that contest was taking much of the state's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley is in his sixth term in the Senate representing most of
Atlantic County, including Atlantic City. In Trenton he is a
champion of the casino industry, which has given generously to his
Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Gormley also
wields influence over the selection of judges, prosecutors and
other state jobs.

<HEADLINE> Aid to Ecuador Withheld in Protest  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key congressman has ordered a suspension of
almost $20 million in U.S. assistance to Ecuador to protest what he
considers unjust treatment of a Florida man serving an eight-year
prison term there on a 1998 money laundering conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves James Williams of Jacksonville, who waited
more than two years for his trial and now has waited more than a
year for his appeal to be heard by the Ecuadorean Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on Foreign Operations, ordered the aid
suspension. As the lawmaker who oversees House foreign aid
appropriations, he has the authority to discontinue assistance
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some time, I have been very concerned about the slow pace
with which Ecuador has afforded an American citizen due process in
its judicial system,'' Callahan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My hope would be that this matter can be resolved sooner
rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadorean Embassy officials did not respond to a request for
comment on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials have raised the Williams case
repeatedly with high-level Ecuadorean officials to protest the
delays. The department describes Ecuador's judicial system as
''slow, inefficient and cumbersome.''
</P>
<P>
   According to department officials, the major impact of the aid
suspension will be on programs that directly support the poorest
Ecuadorians, including family planning and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years after his arrest in Ecuador, Williams was
indicted in Tampa on grounds that he was involved in a drug
trafficking and money laundering scheme allegedly run by Jose
Castrillon, a Colombian who is awaiting trial in Florida on drug
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Mitrani, Williams' lawyer, expressed hope that Ecuador
will release him shortly so he will have the chance ''to have all
of the facts presented to an unbiased tribunal in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other flaws in Williams' December 1998 trial, he was not
allowed to confront his accusers, Mitrani said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Corrine Brown, a Democrat who represents Williams in
Congress, said his case has been one of the most frustrating she
has encountered as an elected official.
</P>
<P>
   ''For three years I have been unsuccessful in my attempts to
seek a fair judicial proceeding for Mr. Williams, both in Ecuador
and in the United States. ... I am hopeful that someday, Mr.
Williams will receive the due process he deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has visited Ecuador three times to assist Williams. Five
other lawmakers and former President Carter have gone to Ecuador
and raised the issue with government officials.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest in September 1996, Williams ran
Caribbean Fisheries. He bought fish from small packing houses in
Latin America and sold them to restaurant wholesalers in the
southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wife, Robin, said Wednesday in a telephone interview
from Jacksonville that Castrillon was one of his 22 suppliers. She
maintains that Castrillon's fishing business activities, in
contrast to his alleged drug dealing, were legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   She has maintained for years that her husband's arrest in
Ecuador was sought by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, an
allegation denied by DEA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Williams, who returned this week from her 15th visit to
Ecuador, said her husband's 3{-year incarceration has been a
''frightful situation'' that has led to their financial
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   She said she and other family members have to provide him with
clothing, money, food and toiletries because the prison ''provides
nothing for inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This prison is a death sentence,'' she said. ''Jim has watched
people die because they can't get out for treatment.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 320; Nasdaq Falls 123  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared more
than 300 points today as investors moved money that has streamed
out of the technology sector this week into long-forgotten
industrial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow rose 320.17, or
by 3.3 percent, to close at 10,131.41. It was the fourth biggest
point gain ever for the Dow, but wasn't close to a record in
percentage terms. The blue-chip index rose as much as 368.41 points
before slipping back a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors continued shedding technology shares. The
Nasdaq composite index fell 123.94 to close at 4,582.64, bringing
its loss for the past three days to 465 points, or 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a rare day,'' said Vernon Winters, chief investment
officer at Mellon Private Asset Management. ''A lot of money
managers have been forced to sell blue-chips to buy technology
stocks, and today, they're reversing course.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip Dow, which has dramatically underperformed the
Nasdaq so far this year, rose today on the strength of old-line
industrial companies like DuPont, Johnson &AMP; Johnson, and 3M.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much damage has already been done in these old economy
stocks,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP;
Co. ''We're finally seeing money coming into some of the bargain
stocks that have been created by the selling pressure of the past
few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue-chip technology shares were mixed. Intel rose, but
Hewlett-Packard fell steeply.
</P>
<P>
   Even with today's dramatic gains, the Dow remains down about 13
percent in the year to date, while the Nasdaq is up about 13
percent. Weakness in some of the Nasdaq's top performers suggested
that investors are taking profits from their sharp gains this year,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Nasdaq has been on a rocket ship, and I think investors
will work a bit harder to bring it down before it can start moving
higher again,'' Hogan said. ''The Nasdaq is in the midst of a
corrective process, which is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   PMC-Sierra, which had risen 143 percent in the year to date,
fell steeply. Veritas, a developer of storage-management software
that was up about 75 percent this year, also dropped back.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies, which led the market's decline on
Tuesday after the United States and Britain agreed to share data on
genetics, regained some ground today. Human Genome Sciences rose.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle rose. The company, a leading maker of business software,
said after the close of trading Tuesday that third-quarter profits
soared 160 percent, easily surpassing analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the market's continued volatility suggested that
investors were nervous in the days ahead of the government's
reports on the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   The PPI, due for release Thursday, and the CPI, due out Friday,
are closely watched gauges of inflationary pressures. The Federal
Reserve is expected to take both reports under consideration when
it meets Tuesday to discuss interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Many on Wall Street expect the Fed to raise rates. An increase
would be the fifth since June, when the Fed began trying to
engineer a gradual slowdown in the economy to prevent inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Keller, chairman of the investment policy committee at A.G.
Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis, said he expects rising interest rates
to eventually take a toll on technology stocks, which have held up
far better than the broad market in the months since the Fed began
raising rates.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns prompted Keller to cut back on the firm's
exposure to stocks. Today, A.G. Edwards shifted its asset
allocation model to include 55 percent stocks, 35 percent bonds and
10 percent cash. Previously, the firm recommended 60 percent
stocks, 35 percent bonds and 5 percent cash.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
rose 33.01 to 1,392.16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 12-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,920 up, 1,123 down and 441
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 1.30 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.08
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.43 to
558.56.

<HEADLINE> 3 Pa. Hospital Officials Charged  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Three top officials of the state's largest
nonprofit hospital chain illegally skimmed more than $52 million
from charitable donations in a futile effort to stave off
bankruptcy and the eventual collapse of the Allegheny Health,
Education and Research Foundation, the state attorney general said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Mike Fisher also accused former AHERF chief
executive Sherif Abdelhak with making illegal campaign
contributions to political candidates and illegally donating
$50,000 for the renovation of a locker room at his son's high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelhak, former chief financial officer David McConnell and
former general counsel Nancy Wynstra were accused of participating
in a scheme to pay AHERF's mounting debts and day-to-day
operational costs between February and July 1998 with money drawn
from funds which were to only be used for purposes such as
scholarships or medical research.
</P>
<P>
   ''They ... stole millions in charitable dollars in an effort to
save this mismanaged system,'' Fisher said. ''This money wasn't
theirs to use as they saw fit. It had been set aside for charitable
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Abdelhak, 54, and McConnell, 45, were arraigned Wednesday
and released after posting 10 percent on a $100,000 bond. Wynstra
was expected to surrender to authorities Monday, the attorney
general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing on the charges was set for May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Abdelhak was charged on six counts, including two theft charges,
misuse of entrusted property, illegal campaign contributions and
two counts of conspiracy. He could face up to 25 years in prison if
convicted on all counts.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell faces up to 24 years on charges of theft, conspiracy
and misuse of property; Wynstra would face up to 17 years on one
count of theft, two counts of conspiracy and a count of misusing
property.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the three did not return telephone calls from The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fisher initiated a civil suit against the three
defendants and five foundation trustees -- including four who are
former officials with Mellon Bank -- in an effort to get $78 million
drawn from charitable accounts for various purposes to be paid
back.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said Wednesday his office believes a total of $52 million
was illegally siphoned off and used for day-to-day operations and
other disallowed costs.
</P>
<P>
   Once the largest nonprofit health chain in Pennsylvania, AHERF
controlled 14 hospitals across the state. With its headquarters in
Pittsburgh, the foundation had 10 hospitals and a medical school in
the Philadelphia area.
</P>
<P>
   Financial difficulties arose in 1996 and 1997, the product of
high administrative costs, decreases in reimbursement rates and
falling occupancy rates.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, some 1,700 employees were laid off in the
Philadelphia market and Mount Sinai Hospital was closed. AHERF
filed for bankruptcy in the summer of 1998, selling off the nine
remaining hospitals in the Philadelphia market. Eight of the
hospitals and the medical school were sold to Tenet Healthcare
Corp., the nation's second-largest for-profit hospital chain, in
November 1998. Our Lady of Lourdes Healthcare Services purchased
Allegheny Rancocas Hospital in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Four solvent hospitals in the western part of the state --
including the former AHERF flagship Allegheny General -- entered
into a management agreement with Western Pennsylvania Healthcare
System following the collapse of AHERF and are expected to merge
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide grand jury has been investigating AHERF's financial
practices since last April.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Militants Bite Their Lips  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- U.S. officials are pressuring
Pakistan's army rulers for a crackdown on militant Islamic groups
ahead of President Clinton's visit next week, but senior Pakistani
officials have resisted, saying the militants pose no danger to the
U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Pakistani leadership has ordered the militants not
to make provocative statements or threats against the United States
or rival India, against whom the groups are waging a bitter
secessionist battle in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have told them they should behave and not make
irresponsible and baseless statements,'' Pakistan's Interior
Minister Moinuddin Haider said in an interview, adding that the
groups also were ordered not to organize rallies or weapons
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Pakistani officials say they are frustrated by what
they maintain is the obsession in the United States and the West
with the militant groups and the unfair portrayal of Pakistan as
the aggressor in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is the Western media and the West not talking about the
700,000 Indian soldiers in Kashmir and the atrocities they are
committing there? Pakistan's entire army is barely that strength,''
said Javed Jabbar, an adviser to Pakistan's military ruler, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pakistan and India claim all of Kashmir, which was divided
between the neighbors after British colonial rule of the Asian
subcontinent ended in 1947. Kashmir has been the cause of two wars
and the impetus for a costly and increasingly deadly arms race that
now includes nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the Muslim
militants who have waged a decade-long secessionist battle on its
Kashmir territory, something Pakistan hotly denies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pakistan is paying the price of being misunderstood, of being
maligned by India, a country with far greater resources, both
militarily and economically, and they are using all of it to create
a negative image of Pakistan,'' Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the West is buying it hook, line and sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Pakistan's military government has
''categorically condemned all forms of extremism,'' insisting
''religion should not be exploited for the sake of politics,''
Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the militant groups will not disband as long as
the dispute smolders over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent of the groups, Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen, changed
its name from Harakat-ul-Ansar after the United States declared it
a terrorist organization two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At its headquarters, tucked in a narrow lane in neighboring
Rawalpindi, the group's chief Fazal-ur Rehman Khalil sat
cross-legged on the floor and insisted ''we are not terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are mujahedeen (holy warriors) and we fight only in
Kashmir,'' he said. ''It is a great injustice to us that America
has declared us a terrorist organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Khalil's group gained prominence last December when an Indian
Airlines jetliner was hijacked to Afghanistan. To secure the
release of the plane and passengers, India freed three Kashmiri
militants, among them a Pakistani member of the group, Masood
Azhar.
</P>
<P>
   Azhar was taken into ''protective custody'' by the government
after returning to Pakistan and making threatening statements
against the United States, Haider said. ''We won't allow these
people threatening anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   While they may not like the United States, the militants say
Clinton has nothing to fear during his March 25 visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Islam says that we must give maximum respect to our guest,''
said Abu Abdullah of Harakat-ul-Jehadi, another militant Islamic
group fighting in Kashmir. ''Since he is coming as a guest we will
do him no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Afghanistan, the ruling Taliban have given refuge
to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi financier the United States says
masterminded deadly bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa
in 1998. Washington is offering a $10 million reward for his
capture.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pressed Pakistan to use its influence with
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers to secure bin Laden's handover. But
the Taliban say it is against Islamic tradition to turn a guest
over to his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ''To deliver Osama Bin Laden is equal to breaking one of the
fundamentals of Islam,'' the Taliban's supreme leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar wrote in a message circulated in Pakistan's deeply
conservative northwest frontier, which borders Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Osama is a Muslim, a mujahed (holy warrior) and a guest. We
will never deliver Osama, even if half of Afghanistan is
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   That same Islamic edict guarantees Clinton's safety, Pakistani
groups say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is an honorable guest. He is not coming as an enemy,''
said another spokesman for Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen who gave only one
name, Shahabuddin. ''We have been told by Pakistani security
agencies not to make any hostile statements against Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shahabuddin issued a warning of his own:
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not attach any hope to Clinton's visit. He will not
give us Kashmir on a plate. We should be realistic and our rulers
should understand that jihad is the only way to get Kashmir back.''

<HEADLINE> Fannie Mae Allots $2 Trillion  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fannie Mae is launching a 10-year, $2 trillion
campaign to finance home purchases by minorities, women, new
immigrants and other underserved segments of American society.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae Chairman Franklin D. Raines said at a news conference
Wednesday the goal of issuing $2 trillion in home loans is an
essential step to narrow the persistent gap in home ownership rates
between whites and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many Americans have enjoyed substantial financial gains in our
current era of prosperity. But in homeownership, there remains a
significant divide between the haves and the haven't yets,'' Raines
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae, formally the Federal National Mortgage Association,
is a government-chartered corporation that receives tax benefits in
return for supplying a steady stream of mortgage capital funding
for middle and low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Raines said Fannie Mae next month will meet a similar $1
trillion goal issued in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That challenge, issued by then-Fannie Mae head James Johnson, is
being achieved eight months ahead of schedule. Raines said that in
1994, 55% percent of Fannie Mae's business was with the targeted
underserved populations.
</P>
<P>
   That figure has grown to 68 percent of Fannie Mae's business
today and Raines said he expects further increases as the new goal
is pursued.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fannie Mae is a mission driven company,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae, however, is also a profits driven company that is
publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. And in the past
year, the news from Wall Street hasn't been good.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of 1999, the stock has tumbled from the mid
$70's to around $55 per share today. But Raines said he will tell
shareholders that serving minorities, women and immigrants makes
good business sense as it helps fulfill the company's social
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tremendous opportunities exist in these markets,'' Raines
said. ''This is not about charity.''
</P>
<P>
   While the targeted populations Fannie Mae is seeking out have
higher loan default rates than Americans as a whole, Raines said an
automated underwriting system that screens applicant's credit
worthiness will help ensure only those who can afford home loans
will get them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think we have to make a choice between making bad
loans and racking up numbers,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   Raines said more than 10 million families in the targeted groups
have received home loans since 1994. Fannie Mae is now serving 31
percent more black customers and 26 percent more Hispanic customers
than it did seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, just 45 percent of blacks and 44 percent of Hispanics
own their own homes compared to 75 percent of whites nationally.
</P>
<P>
   With the surging national economy and rising property values,
the issue of home ownership and how to make it easier for Americans
locked out of the home buying market has been a top issue for
government officials.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the House Banking Committee approved ''The American
Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000'' to lower the
required FHA mortgage down payment for teachers, police officers
and other uniformed municipal workers buying their first homes.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is expected to be voted on later this spring.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani, Afghan Militant Groups  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Following are some of the Islamic militant groups the
United
States is pressuring Pakistan to close down or ban:
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARAKAT-UL-MUJAHEDEEN: Previously Harakat-ul-Ansar, but changed
its name after United States declared the group a terrorist
organization. Harakat-ul-Ansar was founded by Masood Azhar, one of
three Kashmiri militants freed by India last December to end the
hijacking of an Indian Airlines jetliner. Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen's
leader is Fazal-ur-Rehman Khalil. Headquartered in Pakistan, with a
membership believed to be in the hundreds, the group is committed
to fighting Indian soldiers in Indian-ruled Kashmir. It's fighters,
trained in Afghanistan, are believed to have also fought in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, Bosnia and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   HARAKAT-UL-JEHAD-E-ISLAMI: The parent organization of
Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen, led by Qari Saifullah Akhtar, who spends
most of his time in Afghanistan. It is believed to have thousands
of fighters, who train in Afghanistan and have fought in Chechnya
and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   LASHKAR-E-TAYYABA: Led by Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, it is based in
Muridke, in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, and has a
membership in the thousands, who are trained in Afghanistan and in
Pakistan-ruled Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   AL QAIDA: Led by Osama bin Laden, Al Qaida is committed to
forcing the United States to withdraw its army from Saudi Arabia,
where two of Islam's holiest sites are located. Its membership
figure is unknown but bin Laden is believed to have thousands of
followers. His popularity soared after 1998, when the United States
fired Tomahawk cruise missiles at eastern Afghanistan where bin
Laden is believed to operate military training camps. Bin Laden, a
millionaire Saudi, also raises millions of dollars from
sympathizers throughout the Muslim world. Al Qaida members fight
alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan and reportedly train militants
to fight in Indian-held Kashmir. Al Qaida also is known to have
sent fighters to Chechnya, Bosnia and Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Legislative majorities put forward their spending plans  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The majorities in each chamber of the state
Legislature on Wednesday advanced their spending plans for the
2000-01 fiscal year as the sparring began over the competing
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who dominate the Assembly unveiled a proposal they
said would cost $78.2 billion or about $1.3 billion more than
Republican Gov. George Pataki's spending plan. The Republican-led
Senate said the budget resolution it approved Wednesday totals
about $500 million more than the governor's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Though an $800 million difference between the Assembly and
Senate sounds huge, the two sides were perhaps $3 billion or more
apart in negotiations over the current state budget at this time
last year. Silver said Wednesday the Assembly spending levels are
in the ''ballpark'' with the other proposals this time around.
</P>
<P>
   But Silver also began the rhetorical sparring that typically
accompanies the approach of negotiations over a new budget. The
state's 2000-01 fiscal year begins on April 1 and the state has not
had a new budget in place on time since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Silver questioned how Senate Republicans could propose a series
of ambitious tax cuts and spending plans, and then only figure that
their resolution would cost a half a billion dollars more than
Pataki's.
</P>
<P>
   ''They spending so much and so much and so much, but they're
only spending $400 million more (than Pataki),'' Silver said. ''Or
is it $600 million more?''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said the Senate's resolution was ''smoke and
mirrors.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bruno had suggested that Silver was the one who
favors excessive spending as another legislative election
approaches this November. Bruno also criticized Silver for not
proposing deep-enough tax cuts to spur business.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bruno and Silver have said they want the differences
between the two chambers to be resolved in public conference
committees. It was unclear Wednesday when the first conference
committee would meet to resolve the first important question facing
the lawmakers -- how much money will be available to spend in the
2000-01 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   On some matters, the Senate Republican and Assembly Democratic
resolutions are on the same page, or close to it.
</P>
<P>
   Each chamber has rejected Gov. George Pataki's proposal to
create a superagency encompassing some 40,000 employees currently
in the State Police, state Department of Correctional Services and
other law enforcement-related state agencies. Silver said the
Assembly did not ''see much'' in the way of cost-savings or
bureaucratic streamlining through the consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Each chamber also rejected a proposed increase in hunting and
fishing licenses and said the state should pay for the county
taxpayers' share -- to grow to $340 million -- of the new Family
Health Plus medical insurance program which goes into effect in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly and Senate put forward proposals on some programs
that are similar enough to suggest the two houses could fairly
easily work out differences.
</P>
<P>
   Both chambers' majorities, for instance, proposed expanding the
state's Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage program,
simplifying the rules and expanding the income eligibility
standards. Both favor raising the Earned Income Tax Credit, Tuition
Assistance Program awards and increasing revenue sharing and other
aid programs for localities.
</P>
<P>
   But the two chambers are further apart on cutting the state's
gasoline tax -- Silver wants a two-month suspension of the tax to
give motoring tourists a break this summer while Bruno wants to
rescind it permanently -- and the Senate also favors eliminating the
state's gross receipt tax on energy while the Assembly wants only
limited reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly plan does not provide for a hallmark of the
Senate's budget -- a proposed $2.5 billion road- and bridge-building
bond act -- while the Senate plan funds less than half the
Assembly's centerpiece ''LADDER'' program to pay for
pre-kindergarten programs and to reduce early grade class sizes.

<HEADLINE> Probe examining pharmacies requesting drug switches  </HEADLINE>
phqjkb1jy2
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A Philadelphia federal prosecutor is
investigating whether drug companies are illegally pressuring
pharmacists and doctors to switch drug prescriptions in favor of
medication preferred by a patient's insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, drugmaker Schering-Plough Corp., of Madison,
N.J., and the nation's two largest pharmacy-benefits managers have
acknowledged receiving subpoenas seeking information about the
complex relationship between drugmakers, insurers, pharmacists and
the companies that manage drug plans.
</P>
<P>
   No charges have been filed, and the companies involved -- which
include Merck-Medco Managed Care LLC and Rite Aid Corp.'s PCS
Health Systems -- say there have been no accusations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the practice of pharmacists recommending to doctors
that a prescription be changed to substitute a medication that is
preferred by the insurance plan. Pharmacists already regularly
suggest that doctors change prescriptions to switch to generic drug
brands.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal prosecutor in Philadelphia, Assistant U.S.
Attorney James G. Sheehan, said he was concerned with the millions
of dollars paid by drugmakers to prescription-drug plans and from
the plans to pharmacies to get preferential treatment for their
drugs. In one such program, a pharmacist gets several dollars to
ask a patient whether he is willing to switch medications and
several more dollars to seek authorization from the patient's
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you pay somebody to switch this patient this time, or to
switch everybody on this drug ... the likelihood that they will act
not in the best interest of the patient is significantly higher,''
Sheehan told The Philadelphia Inquirer in Wednesday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers and managers say drug switches, which became common in
the mid-1990s, do not compromise health and can help restrain
medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   But physicians, patients and pharmacists complain the switches
risk harm to patients, interfere with doctors' judgment and waste
time.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA reported 169 cases of ''adverse events'' in 1997 and
1998 due to drug switches. At least 10 cases resulted in
hospitalization; the remainder were substitutions to a different
medication that the doctor said did not work.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin D. Trichtinger of suburban Philadelphia said he or
his colleagues are asked at least once a day to authorize a drug
switch they believe would be harmful to a patient. He said two
recent cases involved patients with congestive heart failure who
were prescribed Coreg.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just didn't realize that there's a specific reason when
you go with Coreg,'' Trichtinger said. ''Actually, the likelihood
is that you'd probably kill them (if the drug was switched). I'm
not overstating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said some switches could amount to violations of federal
fraud or anti-kickback laws. He also is examining whether
drugmakers are complying with laws that require them to give
Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs the same discounts
they give to private insurers and pharmacy-benefits managers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that there are situations in which physicians and
patients can benefit from neutral, objective information about
therapeutic alternatives,'' Sheehan said. ''But I think it's very
hard to get objective information when a pharmaceutical
manufacturer is paying for it.''

<HEADLINE> School district, parents reach settlement in abortion lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By JOANN LOVIGLIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A settlement has been reached in a lawsuit
filed by a suburban Philadelphia couple against a public school
guidance counselor they accused of advising their 17-year-old
daughter to get a secret abortion in New Jersey, lawyers for the
parents said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement agreement, which has been signed by both parties
and was accepted late Tuesday by the U.S. District Court in
Philadelphia, requires that the Hatboro-Horsham School District
issue and enforce regulations prohibiting school personnel from
advising or assisting any student in obtaining an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the regulation must specifically ban school
employees from advising students to cross state lines to avoid
Pennsylvania's parental consent requirement.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for the American Center for Law and Justice, the Pat
Robertson-founded law firm representing plaintiffs Howard and Marie
Carter, said he was pleased with the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case was about stopping the school district from being in
the abortion referral business,'' said John Stepanovich, senior
counsel for the Virginia-based firm. ''We are confident that this
agreement will prevent future occurrences of the outrageous conduct
exhibited by school officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carters' lawsuit, filed in August, accused counselor William
Hickey of advising their daughter to get a secret abortion, telling
her it was the only option and helping her arrange and pay for the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Carter, then 16, became pregnant just before moving
from Murfreesboro, Tenn., to Hatboro, Bucks County, in January
1998. She learned of the pregnancy in April 1998, two months after
beginning classes at Hatboro-Horsham High School. She had the
abortion in May 1998 but told her parents about it a few weeks
later when confronted by Mrs. Carter, who found the teen's stained
clothing hidden in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   The Carters also accused the school district and Hickey of
violating Pennsylvania law, which requires girls under age 18 to
receive permission from a parent or guardian before having an
abortion. Hickey was accused of arranging for Stephanie to have an
abortion in Cherry Hill, N.J., where no parental consent is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing for us has always been making sure
this does not happen to another family in this district, and we
pray all school boards will adopt such a policy,'' the Carter
parents said in a joint statement. ''If even one girl is encouraged
to turn to her parents instead of a New Jersey abortion clinic --
and if even one baby lives because of this policy -- then it was
worth the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement agreement, the school district and
Hickey admitted no wrongdoing and the district will pay the Carters
$20,000 in damages. The court dismissed the lawsuit but will
continue to oversee the case to ensure that the terms of the
agreement are enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement may stifle the ability of counselors to counsel,
said Lisa Shelby, vice president for education and professional
development of Planned Parenthood Southern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ''It limits the ability of the child to get good, accurate info
that she or he may need in a crisis situation,'' she said. ''It's
one less trusted adult they can go to with knowledge and
information that may be critical to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hickey nor Hatboro-Horsham School District solicitor
Jack Duly returned calls seeking comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Human Rights Grim in Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- More than 1,000 women were killed
last year in the name of honor in Pakistan, even if the
justification was as flimsy as a woman sitting next to a man who
was not a relative, a human rights report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of street children and child prostitutes has
increased in the last decade. Pakistanis grew poorer, and most
people remain illiterate. Half of all children didn't attend
school.
</P>
<P>
   The picture given by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan was
one in which women, children, and religious and ethnic minorities
lived in dire circumstances through the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 people died each year in violence motivated by
religion or ethnicity, the report aid. Often the victims were women
suspected of breaking Islam's code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most frequent killers by far were brothers, followed by
husbands,'' the commission said in its annual report for 1999.
''More than 15 percent of the victims in (the eastern state of)
Punjab were minors.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent rights organization sharply criticized the
elected governments of the 1990s, and assailed the military
takeover last year.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Chairman Afrasiab Khattak said the panel had just one
message for the military government that seized power in October:
''Please restore democracy at the earliest.''
</P>
<P>
   The military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has rebuffed
international pressure to set a timeframe for a return to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the decade's end the fourth direct assumption of power by
the military looks resolved, like two of its predecessors, to stay
on until it has done its self-appointed cleansing tasks,'' the
report said. The army has ruled Pakistan for 25 years of its
52-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The rights commission criticized a new law giving the government
sweeping powers to detain corruption suspects for 90 days without
charging them or allowing them see a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf's adviser, Javed Jabbar, said the law was needed in a
country devastated by political corruption and a court system
unable to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately you have to weigh the human rights of 139.99
million people against the human rights of 50, 100 or 200 people
who are suspected to have misused their access to power or
credit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Pakistan ended the 1990s worse off than when the decade
began, the report said. Pakistanis are poorer, most people are
illiterate and half of all school-age children don't attend class.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamentalist activism targeted liberalism of all kinds,''
the report said. ''It rose in hateful denunciation of campaigners
for peace, for policies opposed to militarism and nuclearization
and for a more open and democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   This made women more vulnerable by opposing ''any assertion of
women's rights,'' the report said. ''It sanctified women's
subordination and battled in courts and legislatures -- often
successfully -- in support of customs like honor killing and the
parents' coercion of their daughters in the choice of their
spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   In at least two cases last year, the Lahore High Court ruled
that killing for ''honor'' was not an offense. The military
government, however, has said it is.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't accept this concept of honor killings at all,''
Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider said recently. ''We won't have
it.''

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Settles Brain Cancer Suit  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The families of five former employees of BP Amoco
PLC who died of brain cancer after years working at one of its
research centers have moved to drop their lawsuits following
out-of-court settlements with the company.
</P>
<P>
   One case was dismissed Wednesday in Cook County Circuit Court
and four others are expected to be withdrawn next Tuesday after
being held over on procedural delays, attorneys for the families
said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements enable BP Amoco, which acknowledged last July
that the employees likely got brain cancer from their work at its
Naperville, Ill., research center, to avoid years of legal battles.
The company has now settled five of the six employee lawsuits
involving the most serious cases and is in negotiations to try to
settle the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But its legal problems from the mysterious ailments are far from
over. Company spokeswoman Vicki Kastory said there are still 16
lawsuits pending involving a total of 22 people affected by various
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just think it's the right thing to do to resolve these
issues so these families can begin to move forward,'' she said of
the settlements. The amounts were kept confidential under the
settlement agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The six Amoco employees in Naperville all developed glioma, a
rare malignant tumor. They worked during the same period in the
late 1970s and early 1980s at the center's Building 503. Five of
the six men worked on the third floor, which has since been closed
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Only one survives.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco has since been acquired by British Petroleum and is now
part of London-based BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlements were fair amounts for all concerned,
considering all the circumstances,'' attorney Marios Karayannis
said Wednesday. His father, Nicholas Karayannis, died of a glioma.
''They provide an opportunity for closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Karayannis and other attorneys sought to have the five lawsuits
dismissed Wednesday. But while Circuit Judge Judith Cohen dismissed
the case involving the only living plaintiff -- Glen Hoff, now
seriously ill and living in Utah -- she held over the others because
of requirements under wrongful death lawsuits that would have
entailed the families learning of the other settlement amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on keeping the figures confidential, lawyers said they
will file new motions Tuesday to enable the cases to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   California attorney Amanda Hess, who represents three of the
families, called the settlements ''bittersweet.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If something good can come from this, it's much closer
scrutiny of the mixtures of chemicals that are used industrially,
which helps us understand the contributions to human cancer coming
from the workplace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, Amoco announced the results of a three-year study
conducted by researchers from Johns Hopkins University and the
University of Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did find a consistent pattern that indicated the glioma
may be work-related,'' said Kastory.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we still don't have specific, conclusive answers about
what specifically caused the cancer, there is a consistent
pattern,'' she said. ''Our philosophy from the beginning has been
to address these concerns, and it's only the right thing to resolve
these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a special task force set up at the Naperville center
remains intact and the company continues to monitor the health of
people who work there.

<HEADLINE> State Dept. Warns Ethnic Albanians  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a stark reversal, the Clinton
administration has sternly warned ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo
that U.S. and other NATO peacekeepers are determined to defend the
border against their crossover attacks on police in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The message was delivered this week by James P. Rubin, the State
Department spokesman, in meetings with Ibrahim Rugova, the
president of Kosovo's largest political party; Hashim Thaci, the
former political leader of Kosovo's rebels; and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we are concerned about this, we do not believe we are
drifting toward a conflict with Kosovar Albanian insurgents,''
Rubin said. ''And we are working to limit the influence of
extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press that
U.S. forces raided five sites in eastern Kosovo and recovered
weapons held there by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they understand the seriousness of the situation and
that we are coming at them as a friend,'' Rubin said in an
interview Wednesday on his return from what is likely to be his
last diplomatic mission. ''I hope they will do more to prevent
these things from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 ethnic Albanian guerrillas are believed to be poised to
cross the border into Serbia to bolster the guerrillas in attacks
on Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, similar attacks on police and other Serbs
in Kosovo prompted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to drive
hundreds of thousands of Albanians from the province.
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, triggered a NATO bombardment of the Serbs,
expelling the Serbian troops and special police.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ethnic Albanians took control of Kosovo from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While the current forays against Serbs in the Presevo Valley is
on a smaller scale than the earlier Albanian provocation in Kosovo,
the violence worries the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are determined to police the border and not allow this kind
of cross-border activity,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which spearheaded the rebellion
against Belgrade, ''doesn't want a confrontation'' with the
peacekeeping troops, Rubin said. ''They are very careful of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies intervened against Milosevic's
troops as part of a bargain with the ethnic Albanians, Rubin said:
''We made a commitment: If they demilitarized and chose peace we
would use force'' against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have turned in their heavy weapons, but ''there
are more weapons out there that we are still looking for,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   A close adviser to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as well
as her spokesman, Rubin is to quit his post in late April, move to
London and help his wife, CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour,
take care of their first child, due in about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day mission to Kosovo was Rubin's second unusual
assignment for a spokesman. Last June, he met with Thachi in
Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania and helped work out an agreement in
which the ethnic Albanians drew back from their demand for a
postwar army.
</P>
<P>
   His regular appearances on television, briefing reporters at the
State Department, made him well-known to the Albanians and he
apparently has built up their trust in him.
</P>
<P>
   On this week's trip, he made stops in Pristina, the provincial
capital; Kosovoska Mitrovica, where violence flared again
Wednesday; and several villages.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were very warm and emotional moments, with people
thanking America for saving them,'' Rubin said. ''It's very
touching when elderly men kiss your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rubin said he told Albanian leaders they were not doing
enough to promote democracy in Kosovo. They understood that the
message -- and ''a stern message to avoid provocation of the Serbs''
-- came from a friend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, an Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Vic Warzinski,
said, ''What we are trying to do now is defuse the situation before
it gets out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander in Kosovo, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, and the top
U.S. military official in Kosovo, Brig. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, also
''expressed their displeasure'' with recent violence in a meeting
Friday in Gnjilane with local leaders, Warzinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials are particularly worried about the gathering
of ethnic Albanian guerrillas in the rugged no-man's region of the
Presevo Valley. For several weeks, the military has been tracking
six to eight armed groups, ranging in number for a two dozen to 200
each, some of whom have connections to the former Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, took a dark view of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the situation is deteriorating,'' he said in an
interview. ''We entered Kosovo under the guise of peacemaking, and
that context no longer exists. Increasingly, we have to face the
challenge of peacemaking, not peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Haass said ''Jamie Rubin's visit is not going to stop''
cross-border attacks. ''It's going to require beefing up the U.S.
presence along the border and giving U.S. troops a more aggressive
role to go after the guerrillas, if need be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Max Singer, a foreign policy analyst
and author, said threatening the Albanians was useless ''unless you
disarm them so that the Albanian society can exercise its choice
for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer said the Albanian fighters have rifles and machine guns
''and the ability to operate as a bunch of tough guys around
there.''

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Peace Accord Shaky  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's feared former rebel
leader refused on Wednesday to recommit to the provisions of a
shaky peace accord that officially ended eight years of bloody
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament summoned Foday Sankoh to request that his rebel
Revolutionary United Front would rapidly disarm and demobilize, as
well as open up rebel-held territory to civilian government and
U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ''No action is being taken by your fighters to disarm,'' said
Elizabeth Lavali, a representative of the majority Sierra Leone
People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh declined to commit to the seven-point resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am committed to the disarmament process, which I agree is
slow. But Foday Sankoh alone is not responsible for its slowness,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside parliament about 500 front supporters sang, danced and
beat drums throughout the three-hour session.
</P>
<P>
   The front, which was brought into a power-sharing government
last year after signing the peace deal, controls much of Sierra
Leone's eastern region.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh has promised to give the U.N.'s 6,000 peacekeepers
freedom of movement in the West African nation, but his soldiers
have continued to block their advance into rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   Few rebels have handed in their weapons, as required by the July
accord. Cease-fire violations remain commonplace, and U.N.
officials have reported rebels looting villages, burning houses,
raping women and mutilating civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The front's rebels killed tens of thousands and cut off the
arms, legs, ears and lips of many more in a bid to gain power

<HEADLINE> McCain Looks To Political Future  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain's advisers are preparing to
establish a political action committee that would allow the failed
Republican presidential contender to campaign for other candidates
this year and lay the groundwork for his own future, which could
include another White House race.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is expected to give the final go-ahead on the project
when he returns to work next week, the advisers said Wednesday,
speaking only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the Arizona senator is still in no hurry to
endorse George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The two-term Texas governor, who has clinched the GOP
nomination, is eager to mend fences with McCain and forge an
alliance that could help attract independents and Democrats to the
GOP ticket in the fall. The Arizonan had enormous success with
voters who normally don't vote in GOP primaries, but he couldn't
overcome Bush's stranglehold over party regulars and social
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is now mulling his next step, as he prepares to return to
the Senate on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers say the most likely option is the formation of a
political action committee that would accept limited, regulated
''hard money'' donations -- as opposed to the more freewheeling
''soft money'' contributions that McCain is trying to ban.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, already dubbed ''Straight Talk America,'' would
pay for McCain's expenses, which aides expect to include:
</P>
<P>
   -- A speaking tour that would take him to college campuses and
other sites to promote campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   -- Campaign stops for Republican candidates in congressional and
statewide races. McCain has received dozens of requests from
candidates since he abandoned the presidential race last week,
aides say.
</P>
<P>
   -- Political activities at the Republican National Convention
this summer. Advisers are recommending that McCain fight any
attempt by Bush to strip him of his delegates, and that he use his
influence to shape the GOP platform. They realize that Bush's
political base won't allow any extensive overhaul, but they are
hoping an accommodation on McCain's signature campaign-finance
issue will be part of any reconciliation between the two rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken purpose of the PAC-financed activities is to retain
McCain's political viability in case Bush loses in 2000 and McCain,
63, is positioned as the early front-runner for 2004, advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's advisers are modeling the effort after Ronald Reagan,
who lost the Republican nomination to President Ford in 1976 and
immediately set up a political operation to establish himself as
the front-runner in 1980. Ford lost to Jimmy Carter, and Reagan
beat Carter in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining his visibility also might pave the way for McCain to
join Bush's ticket, but the senator and his staff insist he would
not be a vice presidential candidate. There is a long history of
politicians changing their minds on that subject.
</P>
<P>
   Forming a PAC ''is a very smart idea,'' said GOP consultant
Scott Reed, who ran Dole's 1996 campaign. ''John McCain clearly is
a national figure with tens of thousands of supporters and it would
be a disappointment for him not to continue his dialogue with
reform-minded backers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't look at it as positioning for four years from now.
I look at it as the next step, for him to stay active in 2000,''
Reed said. ''I don't think you can look at 2004 right now. I think
it's a stretch to say he's laying the groundwork.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is said to still be angry at Bush for questioning his
commitment to breast cancer research in campaign ads -- and at the
governor's organization for spreading highly personal rumors and
charges during the South Carolina campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But advisers say McCain would eventually be willing to help
Bush's presidential campaign if the nominee and his staff show
respect for McCain and his campaign-finance cause. ''We want some
movement on the issue, though we know there can't be a lot, and we
want some sincerity behind it,'' said one senior adviser.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's political team was incensed by a quote attributed to
Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes, who dismissed suggestions that Bush
had negotiated with McCain. ''Negotiations? Governor Bush won,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked briefly by telephone with McCain shortly after the
senator left the race, but only to congratulate the senator on a
well-run campaign. McCain's top political aide, John Weaver, talked
with Bush campaign manager Joe Allbaugh on Monday to open up a line
of communications.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's staff says an endorsement, if it comes, would be made
after a long process in which the two rivals bury their personal
animosities and the two staffs determine how best to reach McCain's
voters. A quick endorsement would be viewed as a sham by McCain's
voters, one adviser said, while an alliance announced during the
convention season would maximize exposure for both Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign ended with just enough money in the bank to
cover the cost of shutting the operation down, aides said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agent Orange Study Said Slow  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Air Force has been too slow and too
secretive in studying whether the herbicide Agent Orange sickened
Vietnam veterans, failing to get them timely compensation, critics
told a congressional committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior investigator of the military's study, Joe
Michalck, called it ''one of the best epidemiological studies ever
conducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it inception in 1981, controversy has surrounded the Ranch
Hand study, an estimated $140 million project to determine whether
exposure to defoliants in Vietnam caused the health problems of
veterans who served there.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy surfaced again Wednesday as a House Government
Reform Committee panel reviewed a separate report by the General
Accounting Office which said that veterans needing health
compensation have benefitted little from the study named after the
herbicide spraying operation in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Ranch Hand study has had limited impact on decisions
affecting veterans' compensation,'' Kwai-Cheung Chan of the GAO,
Congress' investigative arm, said in prepared testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Chan said the GAO report found the Air Force has only made a
small portion of its findings available to scientists and veterans,
though it was mandated to release information periodically over the
course of the 25-year study.	   In one instance, officials delayed for eight
years, until 1992,
to publish findings related to birth defects -- information that
might have helped veterans decide whether to have children or how
to handle prenatal care.
</P>
<P>
   Chan noted that congressional critics and news reports have
previously touched on some of the study's problems, adding that
some have been corrected while others persist.
</P>
<P>
   The Ranch Hand study will follow until 2006 the health of 1300
Air Force personnel who sprayed Agent Orange in Vietnam. The
purpose of the nine-year Agent Orange operation, which ended in
1970, was to defoliate swaths of Vietnam's jungles and deprive
North Vietnamese troops of cover.
</P>
<P>
   The study contrasts the health of U.S. troops involved in the
spraying to a group not involved but matched by age, race and
military occupation.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3.4 million U.S. men and women served in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have long complained the size of the study group is too
small, that it should have been done by an independent group
instead of the Air Force, and that its methodology is flawed.
Critics also contend it has mislead the public about what the study
can and can't determine.
</P>
<P>
   ''The failure to communicate an honest scientific appraisal of
its own work is, in part, responsible for the fact that Vietnam
veterans are being compensated for so few diseases they or their
offspring may have developed as a result of their exposure to
herbicides during the Vietnam War,'' John F. Sommer, Jr., executive
director of the American Legion, said in a statement prepared for
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Veterans' Affairs says it provides
compensation for 8,000 veterans with some dozen diseases believed
associated with Agent Orange, including chloracne skin disorder,
some nerve disorders and several types of cancer in addition to
providing benefits for children with the birth defect spina bifida.
</P>
<P>
   ''Believe me, we will leave no stone unturned to find any
connection between exposure to Agent Orange and adverse health
effects,'' Michalck testified.
</P>
<P>
   He said the study has made ''every effort'' to adhere to rules
set out for it, collect complete and accurate data, and get
unbiased interpretations of the data.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: He's the True Reformer  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and Al Gore can't fix the
political system because their parties are in ''unholy matrimony
with special interests,'' according to Pat Buchanan, the latest
presidential candidate to claim he is the race's true reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither Beltway party is going to drain this swamp, because to
them it is not a swamp at all, but a protected wetland and their
natural habitat. They swim in it, feed in it, spawn in it,''
Buchanan says in remarks prepared for delivery Thursday in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time Republican presidential candidate is seeking the
Reform Party nomination. Buchanan, a former aide to President
Nixon, ranks well behind the presumptive major-party nominees --
Democrat Gore and Republican Bush -- in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   His speech comes amid a frenzy of activity by both Gore and Bush
to portray themselves as political reformers; the
nominees-in-waiting hope to attract voters who flocked to GOP
primaries in support of failed Republican candidate John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the fray, Buchanan said as president he would seek to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ban unlimited, unregulated donations from corporations or
unions. Bush has made a similar proposal. Gore, like McCain, says
he would extend the ban to individual ''soft money'' contributions.
</P>
<P>
   -- Require congressmen to raise half of their donations from
their home states or districts.
</P>
<P>
   -- Increase the limit on individual contributions to candidates
from $1,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   -- Pass a law giving states the power to impose congressional
term limits and restrict the Supreme Court's right to reverse the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   -- End the congressional pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make it easier for third-party candidates to get on ballots.
</P>
<P>
   -- Allow people to register and vote on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush, Gore, McCain and failed Democratic candidate Bill
Bradley are all guilty of fund-raising excesses.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to fund-raising calls Gore made from the White House
in 1996, Buchanan said, ''Where was his conscience? Where was his
sense of respect for the White House?''
</P>
<P>
   He accused Bush of shying away from campaign finance reform out
of fear that changes would hurt the GOP. ''The true test of who is
a reformer is results,'' Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. On
education and health care, ''Governor Bush has taken on the special
interests'' in Texas, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said that if Gore is part of a
Washington swamp Buchanan ''is the candidate of the dark lagoon:
Anti-choice, anti-gun reform, anti-mainstream.''

<HEADLINE> NY's GOP governor makes major gun control proposals  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Amid congratulations for taking a stand that
puts him at odds with some members of his party, Republican Gov.
George Pataki said Wednesday he wants New York to lead the way in
creating the equivalent of a DNA database for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's ballistics fingerprinting proposal would require
dealers and gun manufacturers to send to a state lab a test bullet
and shell casing from every handgun they sell within the state.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also proposed requiring safety locks to be sold with
every gun; raising the age for handgun ownership from 18 to 21;
banning the sale of assault weapons, and requiring instant
background checks to be made of gun buyers at flea markets and gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ''These proposals are just a common-sense approach,'' Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I greatly applaud the governor's courage in reaching out
across the divide in his own party and in saying to them, 'We need
support for gun control effort,'' said Richard Aborn, a member of
New Yorkers Against Gun Violence. ''This takes New York a major
step forward and thrusts it clearly in the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Police Commissioner Howard Safir said he was
endorsing the proposals on behalf of the NYPD and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. ''The federal government has to step up to the plate and
follow the governor's courage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed ballistic fingerprinting in his State
of the Union message.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for U.S. Senate in New
York against Giuliani, said Wednesday that Pataki's proposals sound
''like a good step forward'' but added: ''I would like to see the
Republicans in Washington have the same openness towards gun safety
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Republican majority in the state Senate, led by
Joseph Bruno, has refused to approve bans on assault weapons and
mandating trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno sounded peeved Wednesday that Pataki had not given him a
head's up on the proposals when they spoke the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm disappointed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki expects an uphill fight to get the legislation passed.
''I don't believe this is going to sail through. None of them do.
It's a dramatic change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor shrugged off the political fallout from other
Republicans. ''I'm not concerned about the politics here, I'm
concerned about the policies,'' he said. ''And the policies are
going to make our streets safer.''
</P>
<P>
   He also defended the GOP's record on crime, saying ''the root
cause of violent crime is the violent criminal. That's been the
philosophy of my party.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki noted that many of his proposals are supported by GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush, including raising the age
for handgun ownership and banning assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether more than a small fraction of gun crimes in
New York could be solved with ballistics fingerprinting of weapons
sold here. In New York City, 94 percent of the guns used in youth
crimes and 85 percent of the guns used in adult crimes come from
out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki acknowledged that other states would have to create
similar legislation to maximize the effectiveness of ballistics
fingerprinting but said he was certain an in-state measure would
''have a very positive impact'' anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's Democratic Gov. Parris Glendening has also proposed
ballistic fingerprinting in that state.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Calls placed to New York State's three gun manufacturers,
Remington in Illion, Dan Wesson in Norwich and Kimber in Yonkers,
were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman from Remington's North Carolina headquarters,
Abe Deffenbaugh, called Pataki's proposals ''hollow rhetoric. ...
It's certainly not going to deter criminal misuse. The trigger
locks can be removed with a simple key. The ballistics
fingerprinting is not a sure-fire method. The criminal only has to
alter the inside of the barrel to put a new fingerprint in.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that although Pataki's proposals are directed at
handguns, ''I believe that this is an attempt at precedent-setting
type legislation'' for other types of weapons sold elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Gore Campaign Eyes Fla.  </HEADLINE>
By BRENT KALLESTAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With political problems of his own, Florida Gov.
Jeb Bush has been distracted from helping his older brother become
president. Democrat Al Gore sees it as an opportunity to swoop in
and win the delegate-rich state that's suddenly in play.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush's top two priorities have been sidetracked -- one on
public school vouchers, the other on redoing affirmative action.
And dealing with those issues could limit his ability to campaign
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republicans' presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and their traditional constituencies, tired of being
bystanders in the state's new GOP majority, have initiated lawsuits
to thwart the Florida governor's pet programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they can stop the Republicans here, they figure there is no
way the Republicans can win the White House,'' said Lance
deHaven-Smith, a political science professor at Florida State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush presidential campaign has been counting on Jeb Bush to
deliver Florida's 25 electoral votes in November. And the governor
is still popular, communicating daily with scores of citizens via
e-mail and using his Spanish fluency to reach thousands of Hispanic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are an awful lot of true and hard supporters of Jeb
Bush,'' acknowledges state Democratic Chairman Charles Whitehead.
''And I'm sure they're energized to go to the polls and vote for
his brother.''
</P>
<P>
   But Whitehead said the decision was made a couple of weeks ago
that Vice President Gore would go after Florida in the general
election regardless. Gore came to Tallahassee as vote results came
in Tuesday to let Democrats know he wasn't conceding Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Gore doesn't have much choice, said Al Cardenas,
chairman of Florida Republican Party. ''If you're in Gore's shoes
and know you have to win two of the four big states to win the
election, you have to take a look at Florida,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore isn't wasting any time trying to take advantage of what
could be the opening he needs to compete in the Sunshine State -- a
state he and President Clinton carried in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One possible tactic this year: pick Florida's senior senator,
Bob Graham, as a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to pick up part of the South to win,'' deHaven-Smith
said. ''Who else are they going to get?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Democrats have plenty of concerns in Florida. Despite
their registration advantage of about 500,000 voters, far more
Republicans went to the polls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only 586,404 Democrats showed up despite a controversial ballot
issue in heavily Democratic Broward County, compared with 715,627
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''You absolutely cannot have that happen in the fall,''
Whitehead said. ''We need to take a hard look at that
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are hopeful of regaining the U.S. Senate seat being
vacated by retiring Republican Connie Mack, but it won't happen if
Bush ignites the Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   So the best strategy could be keeping Florida's governor off the
campaign trail. He was taking a personal day Wednesday and
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   When his older brother was nailing down the GOP presidential
nomination Tuesday with a sweep of six Southern states, including
Florida, a state judge was ruling Florida's school vouchers program
unconstitutional. Vouchers allow parents of students at poorly
performing public schools to attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was the centerpiece of Jeb Bush's successful 1998
gubernatorial campaign and his first legislative session a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, during the opening of the Florida Legislature last week,
about 10,000 protesters marched on the Capitol against Bush's plan
to eliminate racial and gender preferences in university admissions
and state contracting. The demonstration overshadowed Bush's State
of the State speech in which he outlined his administration's
successes and goals.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials also have tried to link Bush's
so-called ''One Florida'' with George W. Bush's defense of the
Confederate flag during the South Carolina primary fight last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're trying to take the negatives from both so it looks
more damning,'' deHaven-Smith said. ''There is a real strong effort
to link Jeb and George.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Bank Profited From Medicare  </HEADLINE>
By ALICE ANN LOVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Chicago bank found a creative way to make
$12.5 million handling Medicare money, but regulators have put a
stop to it.
</P>
<P>
   Highland Community Bank is one of 20 banks across the country
that act as intermediaries between the government and contractors
who process Medicare bills from doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1999, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. noticed that
Highland was withdrawing Medicare money from the U.S. Treasury
sooner than necessary to pay claims.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent investigation by the Health and Human Services
Department Inspector General found that since 1993, the bank had
been routinely withdrawing Medicare dollars a day earlier than
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Highland was able to earn $12.5 million in interest on the money
by lending it out to other banks overnight, HHS Inspector General
June Gibbs Brown told lawmakers on a House Government Reform
Committee panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, during one 11-day period, the bank withdrew
hundreds of millions of dollars in excess of Medicare's immediate
billing obligations, earning over $700,000 in interest on it,
auditors found.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that when ordered to stop, the bank's officers
complied, saying they had ''believed that withdrawing funds a day
early was a 'perk' of maintaining Medicare accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Highland officials could not be immediately reached for comment
Wednesday. No charges have so far been filed against the bank, but
the government is seeking return of interest that would otherwise
have accrued to Medicare's trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are continuing to review the situation. We are looking at
whether similar types of activities have occurred with other banks,
and once we have completed our review, we will determine how to
proceed,'' said IG's office spokeswoman Alwyn Cassil.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hearing in the Government Management subcommittee
scrutinized Medicare's $13.5 billion in overpayments last year
because of errors and fraud, which Brown's office reported last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Medicare administrator Michael Hash said Medicare is
currently taking steps toward better oversight of financial
operations, including hiring private experts to monitor billing.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 320; Nasdaq Falls 124  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average soared more
than 300 points Wednesday as investors who sold off technology
stocks this week put their money back into the long-forgotten
industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 320.17, or by 3.3 percent, to close at 10,131.41.
It was the fourth-biggest point gain ever for the Dow, but wasn't
close to a record in percentage terms. The blue chip index rose as
much as 368.41 points before slipping back a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors continued shedding technology shares. The
Nasdaq composite index fell 124.01 to close at 4,582.62, bringing
its loss for the past three days to 465 points, or 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 32.99 to 1,392.14 and the Russell
2000 index of smaller companies fell 14.12 to 558.87.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a rare day,'' said Vernon Winters, chief investment
officer at Mellon Private Asset Management. ''A lot of money
managers have been forced to sell blue chips to buy technology
stocks, and today, they're reversing course.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue chip Dow, which has dramatically underperformed the
Nasdaq so far this year, rose on the strength of old-line
industrial companies including DuPont, up 2 15/16 to 50}, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, up 4 3/16 to 76 15/16 and 3M, up 3] to 82{.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan rose 6 7/16 to 117{ and United Technologies rose 3
15/16 to 53~.
</P>
<P>
   ''So much damage has already been done in these old economy
stocks,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &AMP;
Co. ''We're finally seeing money coming into some of the bargain
stocks that have been created by the selling pressure of the past
few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue chip technology shares were mixed. Intel rose 2 5/16 to 120
3/16, but Hewlett-Packard fell 8~ to 130~.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Wednesday's dramatic gains, the Dow remains down about
12 percent in the year to date, while the Nasdaq is up nearly 13
percent. Weakness in some of the Nasdaq's top performers suggested
that investors are taking profits from their sharp gains this year,
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Moguls Eye Putin With Worry  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The moguls who amassed so much influence under
Boris Yeltsin that they called themselves Russia's ''oligarchs'' --
and earned the hatred of most Russians -- are now anxious about
hanging on to their power.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is holding a presidential election March 26 that will
usher in a new political era. The oligarchs, a few tycoons who
control huge swathes of the economy, stand to lose the key leverage
they have enjoyed over the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   The tycoons bankrolled Yeltsin's 1996 re-election campaign, but
acting President Vladimir Putin is so popular that he doesn't need
their millions and has not accepted offers of help. Instead, Putin,
considered a shoo-in, says the Kremlin should distance itself from
the oligarchs and others who have ''sucked up to the authorities''
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Russians see the oligarchs as synonymous with corruption, one of
the country's deepest problems. A crackdown on these men would
thrill voters, and Putin says tackling corruption is one of his top
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Russians revile the oligarchs for gobbling up state assets at
giveaway prices in shady privatization deals while millions of
people struggled to buy necessities. Most of the moguls invested
little in their companies or in Russia's ailing economy, instead
siphoning off resources to buy luxury cars and overseas villas.
</P>
<P>
   Their political power has been so immense that reformers call
them an obstacle to democracy and an open market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Berezovsky, Russia's most notorious oligarch, claimed to
have orchestrated Yeltsin's Cabinet shakeups and boasted publicly
of his ''enormous influence on the government.'' These days, the
oligarchs prefer to stay in the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Putin may not be able to risk totally alienating these men,
analysts say. They control Russia's richest banks, media empires,
its oil and gas giants, its lucrative aluminum industry. Some
reportedly helped bring Putin into the Kremlin fold.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't make them disappear. They will still have their
fortunes and their important companies. But they won't be able to
call themselves oligarchs anymore,'' said Georgy Pavlov of the
Russian-European Center for Economic Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Putin) will put them in their place. He will say: 'You guys
have your factories, you stay there and do your jobs and I won't
bother you,''' Pavlov said.
</P>
<P>
   Reformers are hoping Putin will do more, cracking down on the
oligarchs to end their stranglehold on the economy, a grip seen as
hindering the development of a free market.
</P>
<P>
   ''The concept of oligarchs should disappear, and the concept of
competitive big business should appear,'' lawmaker Irina Khakamada
said. ''If Putin makes this reality, it will be a revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   But she warned that Putin could ''replace one set of oligarchs
with another one that is more loyal to him.'' He has already
replaced some Yeltsin allies in his administration with friends
from the business community in his native St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Russia's biggest businesses reportedly fund the
think-tank Putin set up to craft his policies: natural gas giant
Gazprom, electricity monopoly United Energy Systems and Transneft,
the state oil pipeline company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yeltsin-era magnates are preparing for the worst.
Looking toward a Putin presidency, they are trying to expand and
diversify their business empires, and courting likely future
Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent moguls, Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, even took
the unusual step of winning parliament seats in elections last
December.
</P>
<P>
   The seats secured them the immunity from criminal prosecution
that all lawmakers enjoy. Both men have been accused of corruption,
but escaped serious investigation while Yeltsin was president. Yet
Putin has questioned how far lawmakers' immunity should extend.
</P>
<P>
   The oligarchs political might was cemented in the 1996
presidential campaign. Just a few months before the elections, the
front-runner was Communist chief Gennady Zyuganov, an outspoken
critic of Russia's new rich who had threatened to reverse
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of Russia's wealthiest businessmen poured money into
Yeltsin's campaign. It worked, and the seven -- plus some other
favored moguls -- influenced major policy decisions during Yeltsin's
second term.
</P>
<P>
   Some have dropped out of the spotlight since Russia's financial
markets collapsed in August 1998. But other influential businessmen
are still on the scene.

<HEADLINE> The Nation's Weather  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Violent thunderstorms spread across the lower
Mississippi Valley
on Wednesday, causing damage in Louisiana, and sunnyow blew through
the central Rockies and across the Great Lakes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Large amounts of moist air flowing northward out of the Gulf of
Mexico fueled the storm system over the lower Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms and wide areas of rainfall spread across the
easterain edge of Texas, most of Louisiana and Mississippi and
southerain Arkansas, and moved into westerain Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A torainado struck Houma, La., during the afterainoon, damaging
homes and businesses, and knocking out power. More than two dozen
people were injured, the most serious a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   Since forming Tuesday over southerain Texas, the storms had
produced moderate to heavy rainfall, with 24-hour totals by early
Wednesday afterainoon including 4.34 inches at Rockport, Texas; 3.40
at Corpus Christi, Texas; 2.64 at Brownsville, Texas, and 0.70 of
an inch at Lake Charles, La.
</P>
<P>
   A separate storm system gathering strength over Colorado
produced widespread sunnyow in the northerain half of the state, with
locally heavy sunnyow in the north-central area.
</P>
<P>
   Gould, Colo., had collected 4 inches of sunnyow in 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Winter storm watches and warainings were issued for most of
central and easterain Colorado. Up to a foot of sunnyow was possible in
some Colorado mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Showers streamed eastward ahead of that system across parts of
Nebraska and Kansas into sections of Missouri and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service posted a severe thunderstorm watch
for southerain Kansas and northerain Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Winter storm watches were issued for westerain Kansas and the
Oklahoma and Texas panhandles.
</P>
<P>
   Over the upper Midwest, a low pressure system spread sunnyow
showers across Michigan's Upper Peninsula and the northerain edge of
Wisconsin. sunnyow fell heavily in some areas from late Tuesday into
Wednesday moraining, with 9 inches at Ironwood, Mich., and 6 at Land
O'Lakes Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Showers were scattered over southerain sections of Wisconsin and
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   As that weather system stretched eastward, clouds and a few
light showers spread along the Lower Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   During the night into Thursday, widespread rain and
thunderstorms were forecast over the Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's temperatures around the Lower 48 states ranged from
a moraining low of 1 above zero at Minot, N.D., to a midday reading
of 82 at Fort Myers, Fla. The lowest wind chill was 28 below zero
at Minot.

<HEADLINE> Crude Crumbles on OPEC Output Talk  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Crude oil prices plummeted 3 percent Wednesday, taking gasoline
futures with them, on growing rumblings from within OPEC that the
producing nations will substantially raise output in two weeks to
feed an oil-starved world market.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, soybeans retreated after two days of
strong gains and cocoa rose.
</P>
<P>
   Oil's latest tumble means it has fallen 11 percent since topping
out at $34.37 in after-hours trading March 8 -- the latest and
perhaps last in a series of nine-year highs on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. West Texas Intermediate crude for April
delivery fell 97 cents to $30.72 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Leading producers Venezuela and Saudi Arabia touched off the
decline, dropping hints that the widely expected production boost
to be decided on at OPEC's March 27 meeting could top a combined 2
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   That may not immediately meet growing world demand, but it
should be enough to reverse the alarming decline in dwindling oil
stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   In data that contributed to the price slippage Wednesday, the
Department of Energy reported that U.S. crude stocks rose last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market is just feeling that the rally of last week was
overdone, and they feel pretty confident that OPEC is going to
raise production,'' said Phil Flynn, energy analyst for
Chicago-based Alaron Trading Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''Next week they could still worry that the amount is not
enough. But right now the bears really seem to have the momentum,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's trading will provide a key test, he said, as
investors determine whether the price holds or crashes below the
$30 barrier it just hurdled Feb. 14 for the first time since the
Persian Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Among other energy commodities, April unleaded gasoline fell
3.51 cents to 93.28 cents a gallon, April heating oil fell 1.97
cent to 71.71 cents a gallon and April natural gas rose 5.7 cents
to $2.866 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, April Brent crude from the North Sea fell 81 cents to
$27.53 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans paused from a rally on the Chicago Board of Trade as
investors took profits. Drought concerns, however, continued to
hang over the market and the correction was only a mild one.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans gave back a quarter of their 20-cent gains of the
previous two days. Market-watchers said forecasts for light showers
across the Midwest on Thursday supported the price rise.
</P>
<P>
   May soybeans fell 5 cents to $5.25 a bushel. Grains retreated
similarly, also falling nearly 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cocoa prices pushed as high as $900 a ton, up some 19 percent
from last month's 24-year lows, in the continuation of a seasonal
rally that comes after the big West African harvests are done.
</P>
<P>
   May cocoa settled up $15 to $898 a ton, the highest closing
price in two months on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange.

<HEADLINE> EPA Seeks Cleaner Diesel Fuel  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A draft government proposal to require much
cleaner diesel fuel has unleashed an intense lobbying campaign,
pitting the oil industry -- which calls it too costly -- against
state environmental officials who argue it will prevent thousands
of cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency proposal, which is being
reviewed at the White House, would require a 97 percent reduction
in the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel as well as improved
pollution controls on diesel engines and large trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements, which would not take effect until 2006,
are expected to be proposed formally in about a month. EPA
Administrator Carol Browner, who has called diesel emission
reductions essential for cleaner and healthier air, will likely
want a final rule before she leaves office early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the particulates associated with diesel do
represent a threat to public health and the environment,'' EPA
spokesman David Cohen said Wednesday. He emphasized that the
proposal is in its early stages and the agency will ''work
collaboratively with all the parties'' in developing a regulation.
</P>
<P>
   He provided no details of the preliminary EPA proposal being
reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget. Other
government and industry sources said it would cut sulfur emissions
from 500 parts per million to 15 parts per million and require new
pollution trapping devices and other technology in diesel engines.
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing refiners, oil companies, trucking companies
and other parties affected by diesel supply and costs have asked
Browner to withdraw the rule, arguing it will be costly and require
technology that may not be available.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody really knows for the most part how we would achieve
this. It would get extremely expensive to get down to those cost
levels,'' said Urvan Sternfels, president of the National
Petrochemical and Refiners Association.
</P>
<P>
   And because heating and diesel fuel come from the same refinery
stream, the extremely low sulfur requirement also will cause
problems in distribution, raising the prospects of supply problems
for both types fuels, maintained Sternfels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, state pollution control officials, along with the
American Lung Association and several environmental groups,
countered Wednesday by asserting that the stringent diesel emission
rules are long overdue and necessary to protect public health.
</P>
<P>
   The state officials produced a study that maintains that toxic
chemicals in diesel exhaust from trucks and buses over a lifetime
cause at least 125,000 people to get lung cancer, and that health
costs far outweigh any additional fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''These (diesel) fumes are putting us at risk of cancer, a risk
that can be almost completely eliminated with modern pollution
controls,'' said William Becker, executive director of the State
and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the rule stepped up their lobbying on the issue
this week, taking advantage of the uproar over soaring diesel
prices and gasoline prices and concern about future diesel supplies
because of low oil inventories. Diesel prices have jumped from a
nationwide average of 96 cents a gallon a year ago to more than
$1.50 a gallon, according to the Energy Department, with prices in
some areas as high as $1.86 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Browner, nine groups including representatives of
the oil industry, refiners and trucking industry, urged that the
proposal be withdrawn, calling it ''a blueprint for future
shortages of diesel and home heating oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Schaeffer, vice president at the American Trucking
Associations, said the regulation would require fundamentally new
diesel engine technologies that could double the price of an engine
on top of booting diesel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies said they agreed that diesel emissions should
be reduced, but only to 50 parts per million. ''We're suggesting a
reduction of 90 percents instead of 97 percent to go into effect in
2010,'' said Sternfels.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials declined to discuss the proposal in detail, nor to
give any cost estimates.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Panther Faces Tough Re-Election  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Black Panther Bobby Rush's 1992 election
to Congress from Chicago's South Side crowned his evolution from
gun-toting urban guerrilla to graying, soft-spoken mainstream
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a year after suffering overwhelming defeat in a run for
mayor, the four-term congressman faces the fight of his political
life in Illinois' March 21 primary -- a challenge from fellow
Democrats who say he has squandered the legacy of a seat that
symbolizes black political achievement in America.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st District, home to the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Louis
Farrakhan, encompasses stately mansions near the University of
Chicago, crumbling high-rise public-housing slums and tracts of
middle-class bungalows.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the district has been a springboard for black
leaders onto the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   The first black congressman of the 20th century -- Republican
Oscar DePriest -- was elected here in 1928. Later came Rep. William
Dawson, the first black chairman of a major House committee. And
another 1st District congressman, Harold Washington, went on to
become Chicago's first black mayor in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Rush wanted to follow his hero's path from Congress to City
Hall. But Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley trounced him last February
with 72 percent of the vote, even winning some predominantly black
wards.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Rush is facing a contest in which there is little
disagreement on top issues: bringing economic prosperity to the
South Side, lowering prescription drug costs and addressing racial
profiling and police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Rush's opponents -- state Sens. Barack Obama and Donne
Trotter and retired police officer George Roby -- are assailing the
incumbent on leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''His vote can always be counted on,'' said Trotter, a 12-year
state legislator and health care administrator. ''But where is his
initiative?''
</P>
<P>
   Rush, 53, angrily disputes that charge, citing accomplishments
such as ensuring minorities get half the contracts in a plan to
tear down public housing and securing funds to connect inner-city
schools to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He also touts his seniority -- he's poised to chair a powerful
subcommittee if Democrats regain control of the House, and is quick
to note that President Clinton and GOP House Speaker Dennis Hastert
visited the impoverished, crime-ridden Englewood neighborhood at
his request.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been a workaholic on behalf of my constituents,'' Rush
said. ''The fact is, I've been a leader, an effective leader, for
the past 35 years in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a journey of twists and turns. Rush went from the Army
to the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee to founding the
Illinois Black Panthers. He led the Panthers' sickle-cell anemia
testing program but also encouraged blacks to take up arms,
spending six months in jail on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rush went mainstream in the 1970s and '80s, rising through
Democratic Party ranks to become a Chicago alderman. In 1992, he
ousted incumbent Democratic Rep. Charles Hayes and was seen as a
rising star in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the current battle to unseat Rush, the congressman could
prevail if his challengers split the anti-incumbent vote. The
tragic shooting death of his son last fall -- and his father's death
last month -- also have generated sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Obama's resume is impressive: three-term state senator, civil
rights lawyer, first black president of the Harvard Law Review,
head of a successful 1992 voter-registration drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're only interested in votes, or for that matter
bringing money back to the district, stick with the status quo,''
Obama, 37, said during a candidate forum at Trinity United Church
of Christ. ''But if you're concerned about long-term leadership for
our community, I think I'm you're guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotter, 49, is a product of old-fashioned Democratic ward
politics who took Carol Moseley-Braun's state House seat after she
left in 1988 and was elected to the state Senate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not just going to be a freshman in the Congress,'' Trotter
told a neighborhood association meeting. ''I'll be a transfer
student.''
</P>
<P>
   Roby, 53, the fourth candidate in the race, has spent less than
$1,000 on his campaign and is not expected to be a factor.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Mayor To Support Putin  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Moscow's powerful mayor said Wednesday that his
political alliance, the Fatherland movement, was ready to endorse
acting President Vladimir Putin in next week's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, leader of the moderate Fatherland, said that
despite harshly criticizing Putin in the past, his group sees its
views and those of Putin growing increasingly close.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not push this extended hand away and we are prepared to
shake it as a sign of our partnership,'' he said, according to the
news agency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Fatherland and Putin's Unity grouping were on opposite sides of
a harsh dispute this year over allocation of leadership positions
in the newly elected Russian parliament. Luzhkov earlier this year
characterized Putin as ''a blank piece of paper,'' over his lack of
a detailed program for addressing Russia's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   His statement Wednesday stopped short of outright endorsement.
He said Fatherland's support depends on Putin taking a strong
position on fighting corruption and the influence of Russia's
powerful ''oligarch'' business tycoons. Putin must also commit to
mobilizing resources for social services, Luzhkov said.
</P>
<P>
   But the conditional approval was another sign of the heavy
support Putin enjoys. A day earlier, the liberal Union of Right
Forces announced it would back Putin in the March 26 ballot, even
though one of its own leaders is also a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Putin consistently commanding 60 percent support,
against 20 percent for his nearest challenger, Communist Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's popularity apparently stems from wide approval of his
tough pursuit of the Chechen war and his image as a firm leader
determined to restore state authority.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Putin met with Muslim leaders to assuage concerns
that Russia was becoming unfriendly toward Islam as a result of the
war in Chechnya, which started after Islamic militants invaded the
Russian republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Russia would remain a home for both Muslims and Christians,
Russian news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is how it has been for centuries and I have no doubt that
this is how it always will be,'' Putin said told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also sent a letter to members of the U.S. Congress who
questioned whether Russian authorities are firmly committed to
battling anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any signs of anti-Semitism are considered an inadmissible
display of aggressive nationalism incompatible with civilized
society in Russia,'' the presidential press service on Wednesday
quoted Putin as saying.

<HEADLINE> U.S., North Korea Plan More Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a week of talks in New York, U.S. and
North Korean officials agreed that another round of discussions
will be needed to complete arrangements for a visit to Washington
by a high-level North Korean official, the State Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman James P. Rubin said the atmosphere at the talks was
constructive and businesslike. The two sides also agreed to
schedule talks on American concerns over North Korea's missile
program and on implementation of the U.S.-North Korean 1994
agreement governing Pyongyang's nuclear activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the respective delegations were Ambassador Charles
Kartman for the United States and Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye
Gwan of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials had indicated before the New York talks that a
senior North Korean official would visit Washington around the end
of March as part of a process leading to a more productive
relationship. Officials said Wednesday it was not clear whether
that timetable still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said North Korea also reconfirmed at the New York talks
that American inspectors will be allowed to make a followup visit
to Kumchang-ni, the North Korean site that some U.S. officials
believed was a nuclear weapons production site.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. inspectors toured the site last May and found no evidence
of any such activity but requested permission for a return visit.

<HEADLINE> Internet provided fresh breeding ground for illegal stock tips  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- John J. Freeman found anonymity and eager
listeners when he entered an Internet chat room as ''TheBren,''
offering an inside edge in the stock market with secrets stolen
from desks and garbage cans at two brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   But around the corner in cyberspace lurked the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the FBI and federal prosecutors, all ready to
pounce on what they would call the first insider trading case ever
to be born on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by unusual trading activity just prior to the
announcement of some mergers and acquisitions, the cybersleuths at
the SEC went to work to see how many people Freeman had enticed to
trade on his secrets.
</P>
<P>
   What they found led Tuesday to the unveiling of insider trading
charges against 19 people and guilty pleas by two of them,
including Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   William Baker, SEC associate enforcement director, said
Wednesday it was not surprising that insider trading had reached
the Internet, in this case an America Online chat room where
Freeman and two co-defendants met as they all complained about an
investment which was going poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a group here at the commission devoted exclusively
to surveilling the Internet for fraud,'' Baker said. ''It's clearly
one of the top priorities for the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to see an increase in the number of cases
involving fraud on the Internet. Whether we'll see a lot of insider
trading cases involving the Internet remains to be seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At any time, more than 100 employees of the SEC trained as part
of a special cyberforce nationwide are assigned to sporadically
check the Internet for possible violations of securities laws.
</P>
<P>
   They visit chat rooms. They read message boards. They watch what
companies say.
</P>
<P>
   When they find something interesting, it is forwarded to the
Office of Internet Enforcement, a unit of 11 employees, mostly
lawyers, who help build cases to pursue with civil lawsuits,
criminal charges, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman's scheme was found when the Innermarket Surveillance
Group at the American Stock Exchange noticed unusual trading
involving the companies prior to their public announcements and
notified the SEC, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   The case unveiled Tuesday actually involved only three people on
the Internet. But as it often does, the inside information was
passed along to friends, family and even stockbrokers, who in turn
told others.
</P>
<P>
   The scam was made possible by Freeman, a 34-year-old Brooklyn
man who was a graphic artist by day and did temporary word
processing services for companies at night.
</P>
<P>
   From May 1997 to June 1998, Freeman worked at Goldman Sachs &AMP;
Co. Inc. and from October 1998 to January 2000 at Credit Suisse
First Boston Corp., where he learned secrets because he had to
create documents reflecting mergers.
</P>
<P>
   During the temporary jobs, Freeman learned of 23 different
merger and acquisition transactions but did not know the names of
the companies involved because they were referred to in code.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman used information which was not coded such as market
sector, historical stock prices, names of officers and geographic
location to figure out the names of the companies, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also examined documents from printers, the desks of coworkers
and the garbage to learn what he needed, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with the inside information, he directly tipped off at
least 10 people, allowing them to make trades and profit just
before announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Among those told was a waiter at a New York restaurant where
Freeman had once waited tables. The waiter, authorities said,
earned at least $285,000 on the information.
</P>
<P>
   Also told was a retired New York City school teacher who used to
be a frequent patron of the restaurant. He earned more than
$445,000 with the illegal information, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Freeman continued feeding the tips through
instant chats with his Internet friends -- a Bowling Green, Ky.,
insurance agent and the Charleston, W.V., vice president of a laser
printing company.
</P>
<P>
   But as his friends and acquaintances made millions of dollars,
Freeman made only between $70,000 and $110,000 in kickbacks from
those he tipped because he worried that the markets were too risky,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The money was often sent to him inside birthday cards. But cash
was not always the reward. Authorities said one man, who earned
illegal profits of more than $445,000, rewarded Freeman with three
to four cases of wine.

<HEADLINE> FTC Chair Victim of Credit Fraud  </HEADLINE>
By TED BRIDIS, AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Of all the credit card numbers in all the
world, a thief stole one belonging to a top federal regulator of
the credit card industry.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission disclosed Wednesday
that someone stole his official government credit card number in
1998 and ran up charges buying items from catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pitofsky recounted the experience at a national
conference on identity theft, which are white-collar crimes
involving thieves who pilfer personal details about victims to gain
access to their bank and credit accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky, who said he ''felt violated,'' caught the disputed
charges after reviewing the billing statement from his FTC-issued
credit card. He called the appropriate officials and filed an
affidavit, and the bill was expunged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky acknowledged that his case was handled quickly and
easily, unlike some victims who fight for years to contest disputed
charges and repair damage to their credit reports.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he was chairman of the trade commission, which
regulates part of the credit card industry, ''may have had
something to do with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the charges eventually were traced to the northeastern
United States but wasn't sure whether criminal charges ever were
filed. He said it wasn't clear how his FTC credit-card number had
been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, Pitofsky urged the credit industry to improve
its high-tech efforts to detect patterns of fraudulent purchases
and to allow consumers to report cases of identity theft to all the
appropriate companies and agencies with a single telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky also acknowledged Wednesday that the FTC may be unable
to regulate the compliance of U.S. companies exchanging personal
information about European citizens under an agreement with the
European Union announced this week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, American companies that agree to ''safe
harbor'' guidelines would be allowed to exchange data with the 15
EU member countries, which have strict controls over how personal
information about their citizens is handled.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitofsky said the FTC ''may need additional resources''
before it can begin its watchdog role of ensuring that U.S.
companies comply with the safe harbor guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a question whether we have the resources to take that
on,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Youth Rally Against Haider  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- About 3,000 Israeli teen-agers rallied against
the inclusion of Joerg Haider's far-right party in Austria's
government and warned that it could encourage racism and hate in
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's anti-foreigner Freedom party won 27 percent of the vote
in Austria's Oct. 3 election. The party joined the government Feb.
4, though Haider himself remained outside and later announced his
resignation as party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to kill Jewish people everywhere,'' said Erez Dahan,
17, from the Tel Aviv suburb of Givatayim. Haider denies any
anti-Jewish intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The program looked more like a rock concert or football rally
than a political gathering. Teen-agers, their shirts plastered with
''No to Haider'' stickers and carrying anti-racism signs, chanted
off-color slogans combining Haider's name with a selection of
unprintables.
</P>
<P>
   Rock singers and dance troupes alternated with officials
speaking from a podium at the convention center. All had the same
message -- though Haider himself is not a part of the Austrian
government, his ideology is a threat to minorities all over.
</P>
<P>
   A film showed grisly scenes from Nazi concentration camps as the
announcer described the upsurge of extremist, racist and neo-Nazi
movements in the United States, France, Russia, Yugoslavia and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at the rally and at a smaller, more solemn ceremony
earlier at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial warned that Haider's
ideology, springing from the home of the founder of Nazism, Adolf
Hitler, could lead to similar results if it is not stopped.

<HEADLINE> Retailers Warn Parents on Quilts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven major retailers agreed Wednesday to join
a federal government effort to educate parents about the risks of
using fluffy pillows, quilts, comforters and other soft bedding
materials with younger babies.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 900 baby deaths each year attributed to Sudden Infant
Death Syndrome may actually be caused by suffocation from soft
bedding, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the federal government has issued warnings about the
dangers of soft bedding. But in-store displays and advertising
campaigns featuring plush comforters or fluffy pillows have been
standard in the industry. That may confuse parents who then use a
similar set-up at home, not realizing it can be deadly, said Ann
Brown, CPSC chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents and caregivers will no longer get a mixed message on
how to create a safe sleeping environment for their baby,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Babies ''R'' Us, IKEA, JC Penney, Kmart, Lands' End, Sears and
Target have agreed to change crib displays in their retail stores,
catalogues, commercial advertising and websites.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this spring, cribs in those stores will no longer be
made up with pillows, quilts and comforters. Instead they'll
feature tight fitting bedclothes and thin blankets. Retailers also
will include soft bedding warnings in their catalogues, store
displays, and inserts that accompany baby blankets and quilts.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, babies featured in crib ads will be pictured
sleeping on their backs with their heads uncovered, a position
which has been shown to reduce the incidence of SIDS.

<HEADLINE> FBI on hunt for freed rapist, Corrections head to testify athearing  </HEADLINE>
By JOY RUSSELL PEREZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal authorities on Wednesday obtained an
arrest warrant for freed rapist Raymond Alves, allowing FBI
officials across the country to assist in the manhunt.
</P>
<P>
   Alves, now a federal fugitive, became the focus of a nationwide
manhunt since his release last Thursday from the Southern State
Correctional Center in Cumberland County after serving less than
half of his 47-year sentence for rape and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Alves told various prison officials before his
release that he was heading to Florida or Arizona and intended to
obtain a handgun, according to the federal warrant filed Wednesday
in U.S. District Court in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have demanded to know why they weren't
notified of his release beforehand, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Alves, 58, is wanted on charges of giving a false address to
corrections officials upon his release from prison and for failing
to notify authorities of his whereabouts, which is required because
he is a sex offender. Authorities said he had given them a false
address in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Alves had served 23 years of a 47-year prison term for raping a
teenager in Fair Lawn and throwing a second teen off a Clifton
bridge in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Alves was last seen checking into the Capri Inn motel in Little
Ferry on Thursday evening and checked out early Friday morning,
said Bergen County Prosecutor William H. Schmidt on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to caution the public that Alves could return back
to Camden, Bergen, Atlantic or Passaic counties,'' Schmidt said.
''He should be considered armed and dangerous. He's had a certain
(sexual) deprivation for a number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman and state lawmakers have called for a
review of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee in Trenton will meet Thursday for
a hearing to discuss Alves and his unexpected release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Corrections Department Corrections Commissioner Jack
Terhune is expected to testify at the hearing, according to a
department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County prosecutors have also launched an investigation
into six unsolved murders to search for evidence linking them to
Alves. Schmidt declined to discuss the investigation or evidence
linking Alves to the unsolved murders.
</P>
<P>
   The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in Wednesday's editions that
a confidential memo sent by Bergen County officials to the state
Parole Board in 1995 detailed evidence linking Alves to three
Bergen County teens who were killed between April 1969 and June
1970.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also said that Alves bragged that he had raped and
killed more than a dozen women.
</P>
<P>
   According to the memo, written by Capt. Robert Scanlon, an
investigator with the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, the teens
had worked with Alves at Executive Cleaning Service of Hackensack.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Blase, 18, was last seen at the Hackensack bus station. A
law enforcement official told the newspaper that Alves was driving
a taxi in the area that night.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Blase and Denise Falasca, 15, were found in Saddle
Brook the day after they were strangled.
</P>
<P>
   The remains of Donna Albright, 13, who vanished in June 1970,
were found under a Camden Street building when it was demolished in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon's memo also named Alves as a suspect in the 1967 death
of Darlene Polizzi, 20, who was friends with both Alves and his
former wife. Polizzi, who lived across the street from Alves,
disappeared from her home and has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also cited the 1967 murder of Mary Ann Della Salla, 17,
who disappeared while walking home from work past Alves' home, and
the 1966 death of Janet Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, 19, was found strangled and stabbed to death in the
bathroom of her home the day after her wedding, which Alves and his
wife attended.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologist who approved Alves' release concluded that he
had no violent past and was unlikely to commit another crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen and Passaic authorities have said had they known about
his impending release, they would have sought to have Alves civilly
committed as a violent sexual predator under Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Terhune, Schmidt said, ''I've known Jack for a long
time. He's a professional law enforcement official and I know he's
probably upset that a criminal is free.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needs to look at what's going on and it appears that it's
obvious to us that there's something that needs to be fixed,''
Schmidt said. ''I'm critical because I'm spending countless
man-hours and woman-hours for something that we shouldn't be
doing.''

<HEADLINE> Presidential Campaign Ads on Hold  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The political airwaves may be a little
quieter, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has pledged to hold back Democratic Party
ads until the Republican Party fires the first shot. Meanwhile, the
Republican National Committee has yet to even select an admaker,
and RNC officials say they'd prefer that the Democrats went first
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Since last week, Gore has been challenging Texas Gov. George W.
Bush to forgo the unregulated soft money that the political parties
use to run ads promoting their candidates and knocking down the
opposition. These ''issue ads,'' which stop short of telling people
who to vote for but leave no doubt, can be paid for with unlimited
donations from wealthy donors, corporations and unions.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Gore made his cease-fire proposal to Bush. In
an e-mail, he promised the Democratic National Committee would
refrain from running ads as long as the RNC and other outside
groups did so.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's up to you and your party whether you want to start the ad
war arms race,'' Gore typed. ''If you are willing to do the right
thing, we can change politics forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied with an e-mail of his own Wednesday. He did not
respond to Gore's challenge on soft money, taking the opportunity
to instead slam Gore for his 1996 campaign fund-raising excesses.
As for campaign finance reform, he wrote: ''I'm afraid your own
record does not inspire confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp continued to push its case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush is ... stalling the American people on what
should be a slam dunk answer to Gore's challenge to ban soft
money,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   Gimmicks aside, strategists in both parties say that Democrats
have a financial interest in postponing the party ad wars. The
Republicans are expected to have considerably more money to spend
on ads, so a cease-fire works in the Democrats' favor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Bush campaign and the RNC are in a much healthier
financial shape and so Gore is trying to limit everybody's free
speech,'' said Mark Miller, executive director of the Republican
Leadership Council, a moderate GOP group that has been supportive
of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Still, RNC officials say they have always planned to wait for
the Democrats to hit the airwaves first. And with McCain still
battling little more than a week ago, the party was waiting to see
who its nominee would be before choosing a firm to produce the ads,
said one official.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring and summer of 1996, the Democratic National
Committee ran a barrage of ads criticizing GOP nominee Bob Dole
that wounded him as the campaign moved into the fall season.
Observers have been waiting to see what the parties will do this
year and if their ads will be as effective.
</P>
<P>
   Ads are also expected from the candidates themselves. And
outside groups across the political spectrum are planning campaigns
for their issues.
</P>
<P>
   In his e-mail, Gore asked that Bush persuade supportive groups
to hold their ads, and he told reporters that he would do the same
among Democratic-leaning groups.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to control the individual plans of a myriad
political groups, even if the candidates wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Leadership Council has ads already made and is
ready to air them, though it has not said when they will begin.
Miller noted that in August each candidate will get about $70
million for the fall campaign, meaning there will be lots of
candidate ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most opportune time to run commercials on our issues that
we care about would be from now until the convention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bush camp says it won't call off RNC ads as long as the
AFL-CIO labor organization plans to run pro-Democrat ads.
</P>
<P>
   ''The DNC is small potatoes compared to Washington labor
bosses,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer. ''They're the backbone
of Al Gore's campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Fire Rockets at Israelis  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas on Wednesday fired
rockets at Israeli posts in southern Lebanon, the last active
Arab-Israeli war front. Some of the missiles reportedly hit
northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel retaliated with airstrikes at the source of the attack,
and the Lebanese government condemned the bombing raids and
rejected the possibility of Israel keeping some posts in southern
Lebanon even after a planned July withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian-backed guerrillas said in a statement that their
Islamic Resistance military wing launched the morning attack in
response to Israel's recent air raids and shelling of civilians in
the south.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Israeli-backed militiamen shelled the village of
Mansouri on the edge of an Israeli-held border strip south of Tyre,
killing a Lebanese army soldier at a checkpoint and a Lebanese
civilian.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's fighting started when guerrillas fired about 30
rockets from hills southeast of the port city of Tyre. They hit
about 10 miles east of the border town of Naqoura, said Timur
Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping force in southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether any Israeli position was hit, but an
Israeli security official said the guerrillas fired mortars as well
as rockets, and that some of the mortars fell just inside Israel,
near the coastal village of Zarit.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries or damage, but residents of Zarit went
into shelters, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours after the Hezbollah rocket attack, Israeli
warplanes twice struck the hills, Goksel said. The Israeli jets
returned in the early afternoon to strike at suspected guerrilla
positions in the highlands of Iqlim al-Tuffah, a guerrilla
stronghold facing the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate information on any casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss condemned the Israeli attacks
and said ''Israel wants to carry out a redeployment of its forces,
rather than a withdrawal from Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoss also warned that the anti-Israel ''resistance will continue
as long as there is an inch of Lebanon's land under occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We say again that Israel cannot intimidate or terrorize us
with its vicious attacks. Rather, these attacks will only
strengthen adherence to our right and our position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has promised harsh retaliation if guerrillas attack its
northern towns. On Feb. 8, in retaliation for military casualties
from Hezbollah attacks, Israeli warplanes destroyed three power
stations in Lebanon, causing widespread electricity outages.

   Harrison Township, a suburban Gloucester County town, spends
about $5,300 a year on each student, the third lowest in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Saddle River, a wealthy Bergen County town, is the top spender,
dedicating more than $17,000 to each pupil.
</P>
<P>
   But, if state tests are any indication, Harrison parents are
getting a big bang for their buck. Harrison fourth-graders posted
better scores than the highest spender in the state.
</P>
<P>
   These are just two of New Jersey's 581 school districts covered
in the state's massive comparative spending guide, an 883-page
report that compares everything from teacher salaries to how much
districts spend on administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Education released the guide on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Saddle River spends more than three times
as much as Harrison, more Harrison kids passed the state's new
fourth grade test.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the district's fourth-graders passed the
language arts portion of the test -- a section that most
fourth-graders found troublesome, regardless of how much their
districts spend. About 58 percent of Saddle River students passed
that section.
</P>
<P>
   Students in both towns posted nearly identical scores on the
math and science portions of the test.
</P>
<P>
   Saddle River and Harrison have some things in common -- and some
significant differences -- offering lessons in why some districts
spend more and others get by on less.
</P>
<P>
   Both Saddle River and Harrison have one elementary school. They
are both mostly white, English-speaking communities. They both have
committed parents who are involved with the school.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some major differences. Saddle River is a tiny
district, with about 150 students, compared to Harrison's 1,100.
Saddle River is located in one of the nation's most expensive
areas, while Harrison is in affordable southern New Jersey. And
Saddle River is an old, established town. Harrison is a growing
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Geography and demographics both play a role in the most obvious
cost difference between the two districts -- salaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Saddle River, the average teacher earns $61,500, compared to
just $35,168 in Harrison. Saddle River administrators pull in
$98,000, while Harrison administrators make $66,500.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about one of the highest cost-of-living
counties in the nation,'' said Ed Richardson, a spokesman for the
New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers
union. ''Gloucester County, and most of South Jersey, does not even
approach that.''
</P>
<P>
   Older communities, like Saddle River, also tend to have teachers
who've been around awhile. And so they earn more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a growing situation,'' said Patricia Hoey,
superintendent in Harrison. ''Our percentage of newer teachers may
be higher.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant difference that fuels the spending
disparity is the size of the districts, said Dennis Murphy, the
Saddle River superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason our cost per pupil is so high is because we have a
small population,'' said Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   So why not merge with a neighboring district?
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a very proud community and they like their children to
attend a neighborhood school,'' said Murphy. ''And Saddle River is
a wealthy community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saddle River also spends a higher percentage of its total
spending on administration, 16 percent compared to Harrison's 9
percent. Harrison spends a larger percentage of its total dollars
in the classroom -- 56 percent compared to Saddle River's 52
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy again blames that disparity on the size of the district.
Just because a district has less students, doesn't mean there is
less administrative work, Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoey said her district has learned to be more efficient,
knowing it cannot raise more tax dollars to fund programs.
</P>
<P>
   She said the district stresses teacher training and taps into
foundation grants to fund it. And that pays off in higher student
scores, she said.
</P>
<P>
   'We're running an efficient system,'' said Hoey. ''People are
doing their job here.''
</P>
<P>
   The spending guide also shows that teacher salaries are, on
average, declining slightly around the Garden State. From the
current year to the 1998-99 school year, they have dipped about 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The median teacher salary in districts that serve students in
kindergarten through eighth grade is roughly $45,000 this school
year, compared to $45,600 last year. The median salary for high
school teachers is about $54,400, down from last year's $55,000
annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a whole lot of people retiring out of the ranks of
veterans,'' explained Richardson. ''They are being replaced by
people on the lower end of the salary guide.''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher salaries ranged from $80,410 in Pascack Valley Regional
in Bergen County to about $34,000 a year in Swedesboro-Woolwich in
Gloucester County.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Flap Leads to IMF Concerns  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund faced new
calls for reform on Wednesday following its announcement that
Ukraine, a top recipient of IMF loans, had given the agency false
reports concerning the state of the country's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin M. Truman, assistant Treasury secretary for international
affairs, said the Clinton administration wanted investigations into
the matter to continue while a leading congressional critic said
the new revelations would spur his effort to enact reform
legislation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF reported late Tuesday night that Ukraine's central bank
had engaged in a number of transactions worth almost $1 billion to
generate a falsely optimistic picture of its foreign currency
reserves between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on that information, the IMF said it had approved three
loans to Ukraine in late 1997 and early 1998 that it would have
decided against ''if the true state of Ukraine's reserves had been
known at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Truman said in a statement Wednesday that the United States was
''deeply concerned'' by the IMF revelations and said the agency
should proceed quickly with an investigation to determine what
changes are needed in its loan practices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will review the results of this investigation in order to
determine what additional controls are needed to prevent future
inappropriate reserve management practices and to ensure that
future IMF resources made available to Ukraine are used for their
intended purposes,'' Truman said.
</P>
<P>
   The new revelations come at a time when the 182-nation lending
agency is coming under heavy criticism. An 11-member advisory panel
appointed by Congress released a report last week calling for a
major overhaul of how the IMF and its sister lending institution,
the World Bank, operate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., called the new allegations ''very
disturbing'' and said they would be examined by Congress in
upcoming hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again an IMF borrower has supplied false or misleading
information to the IMF and to date has suffered no visible negative
consequences,'' Saxton said. ''The IMF's traditional 'see no evil,
hear no evil' approach to corruption has got to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Saxton is sponsoring legislation which would link future U.S.
support to the IMF to an agreement by the agency to halt loan
operations for five years to any country found supplying the agency
with false information.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the Ukraine investigation was similar to the
IMF's response to allegations last year concerning Russia, Saxton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The IMF's admission last summer that it had been lied to by
the Russian central bank at the same time a new loan was approved
(by the IMF) does not show strong IMF concern about public
integrity standards in borrowing countries,'' Saxton said.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine has been a regular borrower from the IMF since the
Soviet Union broke up in 1991. It has received loans totaling
nearly $6 billion since 1995. The IMF has put pending loans of $2.5
billion on hold pending negotiations with the country over the
adoption of economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> Bush Retorts on Campaign Finance  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore rallied union backers
Wednesday with a warning that their Republican foes would ''stop at
nothing'' to win in November. George W. Bush sent him a cyberspace
retort to the campaign finance challenge Gore e-mailed the previous
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important for Americans to know whether the current
campaign finance laws have been obeyed and enforced. So I challenge
you to clear the air on some serious charges,'' Bush wrote in his
own e-mail to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he asked the vice president to press the White
House to release ''all records and photographs'' relating to
now-closed investigations of Gore's 1996 fund-raiser at a Buddhist
temple and his fund-raising phone calls from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm afraid your own record does not inspire confidence,'' Bush
chided.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor added that if Gore is so keen on banning
''soft money'' donations to political campaigns, his speech to the
union group would have been a perfect place to urge the banning of
labor contributions not specifically approved by union members.
Bush has said it would be ''unilateral disarmament'' for the
Republicans to agree to ban soft money from corporations while
similar donations flowed to the Democrats from big labor.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, addressing the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO convention, looked
ahead with a devilish tone to Bush's nomination at the Republican
National Convention this summer in Philadelphia, where Mayor, John
F. Street is a Gore supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I know the city is going to do the superb job it always
does for any group, but I just want you to make sure that's as
close as (Bush) gets to the White House,'' Gore instructed some
1,000 cheering union workers and leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's going to fight for the working people?'' Gore called.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are!'' was the crowd's reply.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized his support for organized labor's agenda,
including a $1 increase in the minimum wage and tougher enforcement
of laws against union busting. He made just one passing reference
to campaign finance reform, the issue he has trumpeted with great
fanfare since Bill Bradley, a Democrat, and John McCain, a
Republican, dropped from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, not quite taking a day off at the Texas Governor's
Mansion, took note of the omission from afar. In his e-mail, Bush
said the AFL-CIO meeting ''would have been an ideal setting to
display your sudden interest in campaign finance reform and to
demonstrate your own seriousness on the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Signaling that he will match Gore stunt for stunt in this
campaign, Bush closed his electronic message with this zinger:
''Thank you for your e-mail. This Internet of yours is a wonderful
invention.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been a subject of jokes -- some gentle, some not -- for
his claim to have been instrumental in inventing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He zoomed to Philadelphia from Tallahassee, Fla., where he had
celebrated the Tuesday primaries that clinched the Democratic
presidential nomination. While Bush stayed in Texas, Gore made good
on his promise to have ''no letup'' in the intensity of his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After the labor convention, a $75,000 campaign fund-raising
lunch, a school-safety forum and a Pittsburgh rally packed Gore's
schedule. At the Philadelphia-area vocational school, he argued for
stronger gun-control measures, including mandatory trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said school violence ''is actually going down but the
horrific examples of violence are getting worse.'' Help for
''stressed-out'' parents could help, he said, including raising the
minimum wage, expanding the Family Medical Leave Act and demanding
equal pay for women.
</P>
<P>
   To increase school safety, he recommended more school counselors
and psychologists, metal detectors in schools that want them,
reduced class sizes and renovated school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He also had critical remarks for the head of the National Rifle
Association, who has been trading harsh words with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore planned another full day of campaign events in Washington
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to win, we have got to understand the other side is
going to throw everything they've got plus the kitchen sink.
They're manning the barricades they're trying to funnel
unprecedented money into the campaign. They're going to stop at
nothing,'' Gore told the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The labor federation -- with its leafleting, canvassing and
get-out-the-vote push -- was instrumental in carrying Gore to
victory over Bradley in the Democratic primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore asked union supporters to keep fighting, dangling the
prospect of Democrats not only keeping the White House but
reclaiming control of Congress from the Republicans, including
House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very close to getting the Gingrich group -- Armey and
Delay, all that crowd -- out of the leadership of the Congress,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker from Georgia,
left Congress in 1998 but the Gore campaign aims to keep him as its
symbol of the GOP.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Launches Budget Fight  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans moved Wednesday toward pushing a
2001 budget through the House Budget Committee that envisions a far
smaller tax cut than George W. Bush wants, exposing the conflicting
political needs of Bush and GOP lawmakers in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has made a
five-year, $483 billion tax cut a defining issue of his campaign in
a bid to rally conservatives to his cause.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional Republicans would limit their cuts to between
$150 billion and about $240 billion. That reflects a desire to
avoid another veto fight over taxes with President Clinton and to
satisfy internal demands for more spending for defense and some
domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the differences between the two sides, Republicans
on the budget panel sidestepped an effort by Democrats to force
them to vote on putting Bush's tax cuts into the budget. And from
campaign headquarters in Austin, the Texas governor's spokeswoman,
Mindy Tucker, distanced Bush from the House GOP package.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it's possible to meet basic needs, fund priorities
and return money to the taxpayers without increasing spending as
rapidly as this proposal contemplates,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   But she also said Bush ''does recognize the pressure Congress
currently has with a Democrat president who is pressuring them to
spend money on bigger government. That will not be a problem with a
President Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has contrasted himself with the GOP-run Congress before.
Last year, he accused Republicans of trying to ''balance their
budget on the backs of the poor'' with a plan to squeeze savings
from working families collecting the earned income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the Bush campaign ''has not directed Hill activities
in any way'' while Republicans were writing their budget.
</P>
<P>
   But one top House GOP official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said of the Bush campaign, ''They wanted as big a tax
cut as they could get.'' This official said that given Clinton's
demands for a smaller tax cut, ''We've stretched it as far as we
could stretch it.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich,
R-Ohio, fought and lost a battle with House GOP leaders to make
room in the budget for Bush's tax proposal. Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, is currently waging that same fight in the Senate Budget
Committee, where Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., plans votes on a
budget like Kasich's next week.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to spotlight the divergence between Bush and
congressional Republicans, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., tried
forcing the budget committee to vote on whether to accept Bush's
tax cuts in full.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott said Bush's tax cut would not fit into the GOP budget
because it is so big that it would eat into Social Security
surpluses, something both parties have vowed to avoid. Bush's
proposal, which wouldn't begin until 2002, would consume $73
billion in Social Security funds through 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush tax plan is ''being put out there in the presidential
campaign as a piece of high fluff,'' said McDermott.
</P>
<P>
   But he was outmaneuvered when by voice vote, Republicans amended
McDermott's amendment to instead call for unearthing federal waste,
fraud and abuse and using the money for tax cuts and debt
reduction. No direct vote on the Bush tax cuts was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argued that from 2001 through 2005 -- the years their
budget covers -- Bush's tax cuts total $300 billion, not far from
the maximum size of their plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not walking away from the Bush tax cut and neither are the
Republicans on this committee,'' Kasich said. ''We can't get all
the way there with this president.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's $1.82 trillion federal budget is a blueprint for
spending and tax legislation Congress will work on later this year.
</P>
<P>
   As the budget panel worked on the plan, Democrats tried
repeatedly -- and unsuccessfully -- to shrink the tax cut, beef up
the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and boost spending for
debt reduction and education. The votes were mostly party line.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts in the GOP budget are about $50 billion deeper than
Clinton has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   It would provide $307 billion for next year's defense budget, $1
billion higher than Clinton's plan. Its $290 billion for domestic
programs ranging from parkland purchases to bureaucrat's pencils is
nearly $30 billion less than Clinton prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and congressional Republicans would set aside all
$977 billion in projected Social Security surpluses through 2005
for debt reduction.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Silences Militants  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- U.S. officials are pressuring
Pakistan's army rulers for a crackdown on militant Islamic groups
ahead of President Clinton's visit next week, but senior Pakistani
officials have resisted, saying the militants pose no danger to the
U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Pakistani leadership has ordered the militants not
to make provocative statements or threats against the United States
or rival India, against whom the groups are waging a bitter
secessionist battle in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have told them they should behave and not make
irresponsible and baseless statements,'' Pakistan's Interior
Minister Moinuddin Haider said in an interview, adding that the
groups also were ordered not to organize rallies or weapons
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Pakistani officials say they are frustrated by what
they maintain is the obsession in the United States and the West
with the militant groups and the unfair portrayal of Pakistan as
the aggressor in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is the Western media and the West not talking about the
700,000 Indian soldiers in Kashmir and the atrocities they are
committing there? Pakistan's entire army is barely that strength,''
said Javed Jabbar, an adviser to Pakistan's military ruler, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
   Both Pakistan and India claim all of Kashmir, which was divided
between the neighbors after British colonial rule of the Asian
subcontinent ended in 1947. Kashmir has been the cause of two wars
and the impetus for a costly and increasingly deadly arms race that
now includes nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training the Muslim
militants who have waged a decade-long secessionist battle on its
Kashmir territory, something Pakistan hotly denies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pakistan is paying the price of being misunderstood, of being
maligned by India, a country with far greater resources, both
militarily and economically, and they are using all of it to create
a negative image of Pakistan,'' Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the West is buying it hook, line and sinker.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Pakistan's military government has
''categorically condemned all forms of extremism,'' insisting
''religion should not be exploited for the sake of politics,''
Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the militant groups will not disband as long as
the dispute smolders over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent of the groups, Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen, changed
its name from Harakat-ul-Ansar after the United States declared it
a terrorist organization two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At its headquarters, tucked in a narrow lane in neighboring
Rawalpindi, the group's chief Fazal-ur Rehman Khalil sat
cross-legged on the floor and insisted ''we are not terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are mujahedeen (holy warriors) and we fight only in
Kashmir,'' he said. ''It is a great injustice to us that America
has declared us a terrorist organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Khalil's group gained prominence last December when an Indian
Airlines jetliner was hijacked to Afghanistan. To secure the
release of the plane and passengers, India freed three Kashmiri
militants, among them a Pakistani member of the group, Masood
Azhar.
</P>
<P>
   Azhar was taken into ''protective custody'' by the government
after returning to Pakistan and making threatening statements
against the United States, Haider said. ''We won't allow these
people threatening anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   While they may not like the United States, the militants say
Clinton has nothing to fear during his March 25 visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Islam says that we must give maximum respect to our guest,''
said Abu Abdullah of Harakat-ul-Jehadi, another militant Islamic
group fighting in Kashmir. ''Since he is coming as a guest we will
do him no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Afghanistan, the ruling Taliban have given refuge
to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi financier the United States says
masterminded deadly bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa
in 1998. Washington is offering a $10 million reward for his
capture.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has pressed Pakistan to use its influence with
Afghanistan's Taliban rulers to secure bin Laden's handover. But
the Taliban say it is against Islamic tradition to turn a guest
over to his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ''To deliver Osama Bin Laden is equal to breaking one of the
fundamentals of Islam,'' the Taliban's supreme leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar wrote in a message circulated in Pakistan's deeply
conservative northwest frontier, which borders Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Osama is a Muslim, a mujahed (holy warrior) and a guest. We
will never deliver Osama, even if half of Afghanistan is
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   That same Islamic edict guarantees Clinton's safety, Pakistani
groups say.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is an honorable guest. He is not coming as an enemy,''
said another spokesman for Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen who gave only one
name, Shahabuddin. ''We have been told by Pakistani security
agencies not to make any hostile statements against Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shahabuddin issued a warning of his own:
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not attach any hope to Clinton's visit. He will not
give us Kashmir on a plate. We should be realistic and our rulers
should understand that jihad is the only way to get Kashmir back.''

<HEADLINE> Mo. Sues Kraft Foods Over Dumping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- The state of Missouri is suing Kraft Foods,
alleging a subsidiary of the consumer products giant illegally
dumped 4,600 tons of hot dog casings and endangered public
waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday by state Attorney General Jay Nixon
seeks civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each day of violations
and reimbursement of the costs to restore any damaged waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft spokeswoman Cathy Pernu has said the company offered to
remove the casings and pay a settlement, but that offer was
rejected by the state. She did not immediately return a call
seeking comment on the lawsuit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Revenue also has asked Kraft Foods to
return $1 million in tax rebates it received for recycling waste.
</P>
<P>
   ''From my perspective, they were dumping waste and taking a tax
break for recycling,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said Columbia Foods Co., which makes Oscar Mayer hot
dogs, dumped used cellulose casings on a central Missouri farm
under contract with the owners. The site southwest of Columbia
drains through a creek into the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said Tuesday his office has not found a ''significant
movement into the waters of the state at this point,'' nor has
damage to the streams or the river been detected. But filing the
lawsuit gives the state more freedom to test for damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is, I think, of paramount importance for us to move and
move quickly, not to wait until 30 tons of grease and sludge move
their way into Perche Creek or the Missouri River,'' Nixon said.

<HEADLINE> Branch Davidians: Evidence Tampered  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Contending that the government has withheld,
destroyed or tampered with important evidence related to the
federal siege of a Waco, Texas, compound in 1993, lawyers for
Branch Davidians who have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit are asking
a federal judge for help.
</P>
<P>
   In a 31-page motion being filed in federal court in Waco, the
Davidians' lead counsel asked U.S. District Judge Walter Smith to
schedule a hearing to review the complaint or to sanction the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''A disturbing pattern has emerged,'' the motion by Davidian
lawyer Michael Caddell said. ''Much of the key evidence relating to
the events of April 19, 1993, has been 'lost,' altered or tampered
with.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford of Beaumont, whose office has
coordinated the massive document production demanded by the court,
didn't immediately return a telephone call seeking comment, nor did
a Justice Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In his motion, Caddell complained of ''suspicious gaps'' in
evidence and said the government had failed to meet the judge's
September 1999 order to produce original audio and video tapes,
photographic negatives and other evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Among the originals reported lost by the government, Caddell
said, were negatives for an 11:24 a.m. photo the FBI has brandished
as proof that no gunshots were fired by federal agents into the
Branch Davidian retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, whose case goes to trial in mid-May, contend
that aerial infrared surveillance footage shot by the FBI offers
definitive proof that government agents fired their weapons as the
Davidians' building burned.
</P>
<P>
   The government, for seven years, has staunchly denied that its
agents fired any shots that day or that it bears any responsibility
for the fire that raced through the compound several hours into an
FBI tear-gassing operation designed to flush the Davidians out.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died, some
from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. The government contends
they perished by their own hand.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, who have deposed dozens of on-scene FBI
personnel, contend an FBI photographer's testimony offers proof
that several rolls of film shot in the crucial hour before the
compound burned are missing from the evidence turned over by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pattern of the photographs produced by the FBI suggests
only one thing: the FBI has turned over only those photographs to
the court (and the press) that the FBI wants the court and the
public to see,'' Caddell charged.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs accuse the government of other wrongdoing,
including:
</P>
<P>
   --Never returning a roll of film confiscated from the Texas
Rangers showing bodies and weaponry found inside the decimated
concrete bunker. ''The absence of these photographs makes it very
difficult, if not impossible, to determine if any of these persons
were shot outside of that room and moved into it prior to or after
the fire,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   --Representing as originals audio recordings made from listening
devices planted inside the compound during the 51-day siege. An
analysis commissioned by the plaintiffs suggests the tapes are
copies. The tapes -- which the government has relied on for proof
that the Davidians spread fuel and started the fire -- also bear
signs of being recorded with multiple recorders, the plaintiffs'
tape expert concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ''There existed a number of suspicious record events (i.e.
anomalies) which casts serious doubt on the tapes' originality and
authenticity,'' the plaintiffs' tape expert, Steve Cain, wrote in a
Feb. 24 report.

<HEADLINE> EU Exec Objects to Art Sale Plan  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- An EU executive threatened Wednesday to
torpedo a hard-fought plan to grant artists the right to claim
royalties on the resale of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, Ireland, Austria and the Netherlands -- all of which do
not offer royalties on the resale of artistic works -- long opposed
an EU-wide approach, but in the end said they were ready to
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, the European Commission mounted a new
threat, objecting to a 15-year transition period for the measure to
take full effect across the 15 European Union nations.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a meeting of European Union internal market
ministers, EU spokesman Jonathan Todd said the executive considered
the 15-year grace period too long. As a rule, such periods -- which
give governments time to bring their laws into compliance with EU
rules -- rarely exceed 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission's move is highly unusual and could kill a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the EU's complex voting rules, if the Commission sticks to
its objection on Thursday, EU governments must endorse the measure
unanimously rather than by a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   EU governments have been haggling among themselves for years
over the issue of granting artists royalties each time their works
are resold, with Britain putting up the fiercest resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Britain has said if the royalties become mandatory, London's art
market will flee to New York or Switzerland, where there are no
royalties in place.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal on the table, painters and sculptors would share
in the wealth their works generate long after the original sale,
similar to the way musicians and writers earn royalties from use of
their work.
</P>
<P>
   Artists would receive resale royalties based on a sliding scale
from 4 percent on sales of up to $50,000, to just 0.25 percent on
the portion of the sale price of a work that ends up being worth
more than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The royalties would keep flowing during the artist's life. Heirs
would be able to claim them for a period of 70 years after the
artist's death.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Producers To Limit Output  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALVADOR, Brazil (AP) -- The world's two largest coffee producers
plan to withhold about six million bags of their upcoming harvests
in an effort to bolster coffee prices, a top Brazilian official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and Colombia -- the world's two largest coffee growers --
are among a handful of key producing nations that want to
voluntarily limit coffee supply to reverse the trend of falling
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is, we need to support coffee prices in
order to remunerate producers' investments and guarantee future
supply,'' said Paulo Cesar Samico, of Brazil's Agriculture
Ministry's Food Supply Department.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an expected reduction in Brazil's and Colombia's
2000-2001 production, Samico said prices had fallen an average of
10 to 15 percent since January, ''mainly because of pressure from
Mexican supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffee future prices on the New York Board of Trade on Wednesday
stood at $1.03 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Brazil, Colombia, Vietnam, Indonesia,
Mexico and the Ivory Coast will work out the details of the plan in
the next few weeks, Samico said at a coffee conference in Salvador,
about 740 miles northeast of Rio.
</P>
<P>
   The plan should go into operation at the end of April or
beginning of May, with the start of Brazil's robust coffee harvest,
which could reach a record 7 million 132-pound bags, considerably
higher than the previous season's 4.4 million bags.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is the world's largest exporter and producer, harvesting
an estimated 27.2 million bags for the 1999-2000 period, down from
34.6 million in the previous year. The 2000-2001 harvest has been
estimated at nearly 29 million bags.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Soars on Buying Spree  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American consumers' buying spree of foreign
goods from TVs to cars last year led to an immense increase in the
trade deficit -- up more than 50 percent to a record high of $338.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit in the ''current account,'' which measures not only
trade in goods and service but also investment flows and foreign
aid payments, grew by 53.7 percent from the previous record, a
$220.6 billion imbalance in 1998, the Commerce Department said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, investors didn't appear to pay much attention to
this or other economic reports out Wednesday. The Dow Jones stock
average soared to its fourth-biggest point gain ever as investors
moved money that has streamed out of the technology sector this
week into long-forgotten industrial stocks. The Dow closed up
320.17 at 10,131.41. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, fell 124.01 to close at
4,582.62 as investors continued to shed technology shares. That
brought the index's loss for the past three days to 465 points, or
9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty $118.4 billion deterioration in the current account
deficit is the one bit of tarnish on an otherwise sterling,
record-breaking U.S. economy, which celebrated its ninth year of
uninterrupted growth in March.
</P>
<P>
   While all categories measured showed deterioration in 1999,
America's deficit in goods widened the most -- by $100.2 billion to
$347.1 billion -- as U.S. consumers snapped up TVs, cars and other
merchandise flowing into the U.S. from overseas' producers.
</P>
<P>
   With plentiful jobs, rising incomes, low inflation and stock
market gains, Americans feel wealthy and in the buying mood,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''U.S. consumers have a strong appetite for everything,'' said
Gerald Cohen, economist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Economists predict the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
next week for the fifth time since June to slow the red-hot economy
and keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The bloated deficit, economists said, is actually a testimony to
the robust state of the U.S. economy compared with other countries,
particularly foreign economies that are continuing to recover from
a global financial crisis that struck in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperous consumers are helping the United States rapidly
gobble up imported goods as demand from overseas' economies for
U.S. exports, while picking up, continues to lag.
</P>
<P>
   And, while America enjoyed surpluses in the services category,
which measures such things as airline travel, in 1999 the surplus
shrank to $79.6 billion from $82.7 billion the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States is the pace car in the economic race in the
global economy,'' said Tim O'Neill, chief economist for the Bank of
Montreal and Harris Bank. ''Because of that, U.S. consumers are in
a position to buy a lot from abroad and foreigners will want to
invest in the United States because the economy is so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the U.S. market's attractiveness to overseas
investors, the deficit in investment earnings widened to $24.8
billion in 1999, more than double the $12.2 billion deficit of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 deficit was the first one in investment income since
the early part of the 20th century but the sharp widening in 1999
was evidence, economists said, that it won't be the last.
</P>
<P>
   An unbroken string of current account trade deficits over the
past 24 years has transformed America from the world's largest
creditor country to the largest debtor nation and foreigners are
now earning bigger returns on the investments they have purchased
with the dollars earned in selling their goods to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy could face dangers at some point, economists
warn, if the huge increases in the trade deficit continue and
foreigners suddenly decide they no longer want to hold
dollar-denominated assets. A sudden rush for the exits could send
American stock prices and the value of the dollar plunging.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, ''over the long term the deficit could become a
serious problem, but a lot of people shrug that off because the
economy is doing so well,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, managing
director of the Economic Strategy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, the trade deficit has created headaches
for the Clinton administration and Congress, which face pressure
for new trade barriers to help domestic industries combat the flood
of cheaper-priced imports. The swollen deficit figures are also
certain to be cited by foes of Clinton's policies in the upcoming
battle in Congress to grant China permanent normal trade relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In other reports:
</P>
<P>
   -- Industrial production grew by a modest 0.3 percent in
February, after soaring the month before, as gains in the output of
semiconductors and computers were offset by declines in car and
home appliance production, the Federal Reserve said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Businesses boosted their stockpiles of goods on shelves and
backlots moderately in January, but with sales climbing at an even
faster rate, supplies fell to the leanest level on record, the
Commerce Department said.

<HEADLINE> Two Pentagon Reports Said Incomplete  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Pentagon reports on how former Soviet
states are spending some military aid have been late, incomplete
and inaccurate, fogging the question of whether the money is being
misused, the General Accounting Office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, was asked to study
Pentagon performance in 1997 and 1998 in providing an annual
accounting for money given under the Cooperative Threat Reduction
program.
</P>
<P>
   The program, for which Congress has appropriated $3.2 billion
since 1992, is to help the former Soviet Union destroy weapons on
mass destruction, safely store and transport weapons marked for
destruction and cut the risk of their proliferation. And the
Pentagon is to report each year by Jan. 31 on assistance provided,
where the assistance was given and whether the assistance had been
used for the intended purpose .
</P>
<P>
   But the 1997 report was submitted to Congress 16 months late and
the 1998 report 10 months late. This ''denied Congress timely
information'' on whether ''assistance was being diverted or
misused'' at times when lawmakers were considering whether to
approve further appropriations, GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The delays ... were primarily due to DOD's prolonged review of
the draft reports and the relatively low priority its officials
placed'' on their deadline, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   GAO also said defense officials ''did not provide complete and
fully accurate information'' in the two reports and listed the
following examples:
</P>
<P>
   -- Failed to list more than $27 million in assistance given in a
three-month period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   -- Listed only one form of assistance, representing only 19
percent of the program's expenditures, rather than all assistance
provided.
</P>
<P>
   -- Contained either ''insupportable or overstated estimates'' of
the percent of equipment the Pentagon audited.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report was released late in the day and a Pentagon
official did not immediately return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   But the GAO said that when its asked for Pentagon comment in
compiling its report, military officials generally agreed with the
report. The Pentagon acknowledged better procedures were needed to
meet the deadlines, GAO said..
</P>
<P>
   ''DOD also stated it believes our report implies DOD does not
have big confidence ... that assistance is being properly used and
that this implication is unwarranted,'' the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd D. Spence, chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said the GAO findings raised questions on the Pentagon's
ability to ensure that Russia and other former Soviet states are
using the funds as intended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The House Armed Services Committee may need to consider other
ways to ensure that we receive the information needed to perform
our oversight role,'' he said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Core Voters Turn Out for Bush, Gore  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The voters who turned out to help George W.
Bush clinch the GOP presidential nomination were mostly Protestant
or evangelicals, white, Republican and over age 50. For Democrat Al
Gore, they were more likely to be women, black, Catholic and also
middle aged.
</P>
<P>
   They are the most dependable voters, those who go the polls
under any circumstance to back their candidates even, as was the
case Tuesday, when the race has been virtually decided.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some still wanted to have their say.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's already decided so the vote doesn't really make a
difference,'' 59-year-old Kathleen Dickson of Sanford, Fla., said
at a voting precinct Tuesday. ''But I want to make sure that I get
my say for George Bush. I vote because I have that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that Republican voters in Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas overall had an
overwhelmingly favorable view of Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Those with unfavorable views of Bush, about one in 10, were not
likely to cross over and support Gore, the vice president. More
than half said they would vote for Bush or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth of voters in Democratic primaries had an unfavorable
view of Gore and a majority of them, six in 10, said they would
vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That difference is likely a reflection of Bush's overall
popularity in the conservative region.
</P>
<P>
   But Julia Abramson, a Democrat from Oklahoma City, said there
was no question about which candidate would get her vote in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Democrat and I voted for Al Gore,'' she said. ''He's for
women's rights and in favor of education, Medicare and Social
Security, and I think those things are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Bush running very strong in the Southern
primaries as well as in Utah and Colorado, which voted several days
earlier. Gore's support, meanwhile, was more spotty.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Taggert, a silver-haired man from Oklahoma City, who
breathed with the aid of an oxygen bottle, said he voted for the
governor of neighboring Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Republican and I want a change in the White House,''
Taggert said. ''I would like to have a nice, clean, honest
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   The exit polls were conducted by Voter News Service, a
consortium of The Associated Press and television networks, at
selected precincts in the states of Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. The poll of 6,297
voters in the GOP primaries and the poll of 5,312 voters in the
Democratic primaries had error margins of plus or minus 1.5
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> A Look at Core Bush, Gore Voters  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A look, based on exit poll data, at the voters who
backed George
W. Bush and Al Gore in primary elections last week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUSH VOTERS: Predominantly Protestant or evangelical, white,
Republican, conservative and age 50 or older.
</P>
<P>
   GORE VOTERS: More likely to be women, also over age 50, about
evenly split between moderates and liberals. Included a good mix of
blacks, about a fourth of the vote, and Catholics, about a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   INDEPENDENTS: This crucial bloc of votes seems up in the air for
both Gore and Bush, with about two-thirds voting for Bush in the
GOP primaries and two-thirds voting for Gore in the Democratic
primaries. Many of the remaining independent voters backed
challengers John McCain and Bill Bradley, even though they have
dropped out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   GORE vs. BUSH: Voters in the Republican primaries in the last
week were heavily for Bush, with his support ranging above eight in
10 voters in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee
and Texas, as well as the Western states of Colorado and Utah. Gore
got the support of more than eight in 10 voters in the Democratic
primaries in Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee, as well as
Colorado and Utah. In Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas, his level of
support ranged from two-thirds to three-fourths.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Pressured on Safety Spending  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- ''Appalling'' safety hazards in New York and
New Jersey train tunnels should become a top priority as Amtrak
decides how to spend limited capital improvement funds, a
government watchdog testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Mead, inspector general at the Department of
Transportation, said a train accident in tunnels connecting New
Jersey to New York City under the Hudson River, or New York City to
Long Island under the East River, could be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion before the House Appropriations subcommittee on
transportation highlighted the pressure on Amtrak to spend money on
existing problems even as it tries to grow its business to meet an
Oct. 1, 2002, deadline for financial self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are lots of competing needs, and they're all
important,'' said Amtrak President George Warrington.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the congressional hearing took place hours after
an Amtrak train derailed in Kansas, injuring 29 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mead held up a picture of a spiral staircase, 10 stories tall,
wide enough for only one person, which would have to accommodate
people fleeing a tunnel accident as well as rescuers trying to
reach it from above.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you had a serious tunnel fire, the existing systems they
have for evacuation aren't ones you or I would like to contend
with,'' Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated it will cost $654 million to address fire and
safety issues in the tunnels and in New York's Penn Station.
Amtrak, the Long Island Railroad and NJ Transit, which use the
tunnels, have spent about $150 million so far to address the
problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., the chairman of the subcommittee, was
swayed. ''This really ought to be (priority) number one,'' he said,
pointing to the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Scheinberg, associate director for transportation issues
at the General Accounting Office, said Amtrak is spending most of
its annual funding from Congress to maintain equipment rather than
to invest in new equipment or better tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This means Amtrak is not spending the federal appropriation to
make investments needed to improve its competitive position in the
market,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinberg added that two years have elapsed since Amtrak last
had a multiyear plan for how to spend its capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   Warrington defended how the railway spends its money and said
there is too little to go around.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel like dogs fighting over table scraps,'' Warrington
said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposed 2001 budget includes $521 million
for Amtrak, plus an additional $468 million to help the railway
expand passenger service. But the extra $468 million may be shot
down in Congress because it would come out of federal gas tax
money. Many members of Congress say all the gas tax money should go
to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Under legislation passed in 1997, Amtrak has until the end of
fiscal year 2002 to wean itself from federal operating subsidies or
face possible liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   In a departure from past practices, Amtrak officials have
decided to pursue expansion rather than cuts in order to reach
financial health. Last month the railway announced plans to add new
passenger routes, expand into package delivery and maintain
unprofitable routes.
</P>
<P>
   Warrington all but guaranteed that Amtrak will meet its deadline
for self-sufficiency. But Scheinberg told the subcommittee she
doubts Amtrak can meet the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said Amtrak may meet the deadline but only if there are no
further delays in the much-awaited ''Acela Express'' high-speed
service between Washington and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That service was originally scheduled to begin at the end of
1999; the consortium building the trains now promises to deliver
the first train in July.

<HEADLINE> More High-Tech Worker Visas Sought  </HEADLINE>
By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN Jr., Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from areas growing from the influx
of new high-tech companies introduced legislation Wednesday to
nearly double the number of visas issued each year for tech-savvy
foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   Their bill would raise from 115,000 to 200,000 the ceiling on
the six-year, H-1B visas the Immigration and Naturalization
Services now issues annually to ''professional'' workers from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming there are now 364,000 more high-tech jobs than workers
to fill them, Rep. David Drier, R-Calif., said the present ceiling
doesn't meet the needs of an increasingly digitalized economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can't bring these people to the U.S., these companies
are global, they'll do it somewhere else,'' said Rep. Tom Davis
R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills raising the ceiling for professional visas to
195,000 and 160,000 have been been introduced by other lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   To gain the H-1B visa, a foreign-born worker needs the support
of an American company willing to pay the price of the visa and the
legal expenses involved in getting it.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent companies from using immigrants to depress U.S. wage
rates, the bill would require companies to pay H-1B workers the
prevailing wages for specific jobs, as determined by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The measure introduced Wednesday also would raise the price of
the visa from $500 to $1,000 with the proceeds to go toward paying
the cost of training U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   And it also would require the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to move to a web-based tracking system to speed approval of
green cards that allow immigrants to work in the United States.
Critics said the agency now takes one to two years to process some
admission applications.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about time the INS moved into this century and used the
technology that the rest of us use,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren D-Cal.

<HEADLINE> Iridium Gets Bankruptcy Extension  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Iridium LLC clung to its tenuous orbit on
Wednesday as a bankruptcy court extended the deadline for the
satellite-based mobile phone company to find a new backer.
</P>
<P>
   The latest last-minute lease on life came with only hours to go
before Iridium would have been forced to begin closing down its
pioneering service and literally go down in flames -- by yanking its
satellites from orbit to burn up in the earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear whether the extension had been
granted because a new potential bidder had stepped forward to
provide a temporary infusion of operating funds. Calls to Iridium's
office and its lawyers weren't immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   The company had been facing a Wednesday deadline to find a
qualified buyer willing to provide interim operating funds. Without
the emergency extension granted Wednesday, the company would have
ceased doing business after a hearing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium now has at least until the next hearing date, scheduled
for March 27, at which time the company's request for an additional
45-day extension will be considered.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling on that request, made in a filing last week, was
expected on Wednesday, but had been postponed due to a personal
emergency for the judge in the case, Cornelius Blackshear.
</P>
<P>
   The extension, requested with the consent of Iridium's
creditors, came less than two weeks after wireless magnate Craig
McCaw abandoned plans to invest in the debt-plagued company.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium, which has mustered only 50,000 subscribers since
launching service in the fall of 1998, has debts of about $4.4
billion.

<HEADLINE> Albright Warns Ethnic Albanians  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a stark reversal, the Clinton
administration has sternly warned ethnic Albanian leaders in Kosovo
that U.S. and other NATO peacekeepers are determined to defend the
border against crossover attacks on police in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians ''are in danger of losing our support'' if
provocations continue, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a
Congressional panel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But she said extremists were persecuting Serbs while ''the large
majority of Kosovar Albanians are trying to put their life
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright sent her spokesman, James P. Rubin, to Kosovo this week
to deliver the warning directly in meetings with Ibrahim Rugova,
the president of Kosovo's largest political party; Hashim Thaci,
the former political leader of Kosovo's rebels; and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although we are concerned about this, we do not believe we are
drifting toward a conflict with Kosovar Albanian insurgents,''
Rubin said Wednesday as he returned. ''And we are working to limit
the influence of extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press that
U.S. forces raided five sites in eastern Kosovo and recovered
weapons held there by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe they understand the seriousness of the situation and
that we are coming at them as a friend,'' Rubin said. ''I hope they
will do more to prevent these things from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 ethnic Albanian guerrillas are believed to be poised to
cross the border into Serbia to bolster the guerrillas in attacks
on Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, similar attacks on police and other Serbs
in Kosovo prompted Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to drive
hundreds of thousands of Albanians from the province.
</P>
<P>
   This, in turn, triggered a NATO bombardment of the Serbs,
expelling the Serbian troops and special police.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ethnic Albanians took control of Kosovo from
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While the current forays against Serbs in the Presevo Valley is
on a smaller scale than the earlier Albanian provocation in Kosovo,
the violence worries the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are determined to police the border and not allow this kind
of cross-border activity,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army, which spearheaded the rebellion
against Belgrade, ''doesn't want a confrontation'' with the
peacekeeping troops, Rubin said. ''They are very careful of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies intervened against Milosevic's
troops as part of a bargain with the ethnic Albanians, Rubin said:
''We made a commitment: If they demilitarized and chose peace we
would use force'' against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians have turned in their heavy weapons, but ''there
are more weapons out there that we are still looking for,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day mission to Kosovo was Rubin's second unusual
assignment for a spokesman. Last June, he met with Thachi in
Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania and helped work out an agreement in
which the ethnic Albanians drew back from their demand for a
postwar army.
</P>
<P>
   His regular appearances on television, briefing reporters at the
State Department, made him well-known to the Albanians and he
apparently has built up their trust in him.
</P>
<P>
   On this week's trip, he made stops in Pristina, the provincial
capital; Kosovoska Mitrovica, where violence flared again
Wednesday; and several villages.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were very warm and emotional moments, with people
thanking America for saving them,'' Rubin said. ''It's very
touching when elderly men kiss your hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rubin said he told Albanian leaders they were not doing
enough to promote democracy in Kosovo. They understood that the
message -- and ''a stern message to avoid provocation of the Serbs''
-- came from a friend, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, an Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Vic Warzinski,
said, ''What we are trying to do now is defuse the situation before
it gets out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander in Kosovo, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, and the top
U.S. military official in Kosovo, Brig. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, also
''expressed their displeasure'' with recent violence in a meeting
Friday in Gnjilane with local leaders, Warzinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials are particularly worried about the gathering
of ethnic Albanian guerrillas in the rugged no-man's region of the
Presevo Valley. For several weeks, the military has been tracking
six to eight armed groups, ranging in number for a two dozen to 200
each, some of whom have connections to the former Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Richard N. Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the
Brookings Institution, took a dark view of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the situation is deteriorating,'' he said in an
interview. ''We entered Kosovo under the guise of peacemaking, and
that context no longer exists. Increasingly, we have to face the
challenge of peacemaking, not peacekeeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Haass said ''Jamie Rubin's visit is not going to stop''
cross-border attacks. ''It's going to require beefing up the U.S.
presence along the border and giving U.S. troops a more aggressive
role to go after the guerrillas, if need be.''

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Drop Out Rate Rising  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hispanic students are twice as likely as
blacks and three times as likely as whites to drop out of high
school, the Education Department said Wednesday in a study
suggesting that the nation's education system is ill-equipped to
deal with the fastest-growing group of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to paint a different picture for these children,
Education Secretary Richard Riley called for public school
districts to create in the next five years 1,000 new dual-language
schools -- which instruct children in English and in a native
language such as Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we see to it that immigrants and their children can speak
only English and nothing more, then we will have missed one of the
greatest opportunities of this new century,'' Riley said. ''It is
high time we begin to treat language skills as the asset they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 25.3 percent of Hispanics age 16 to 24 dropped out of
high school, compared with 13.4 percent of blacks and 7.6 percent
of whites.
</P>
<P>
   The study also said that 11 percent of Hispanics age 25 to 29
possessed at least a bachelor's degree, compared with 14.2 percent
of blacks and 32.6 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said dual language instruction has proven to help Hispanic
children do better academically as well as preserve children's
heritage and promote the bilingualism all students will need in a
global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, too many teachers and administrators today
treat a child's native language as a weakness if it is not
English,'' Riley said, speaking at Bell Multicultural High School,
which is not one of the nation's 260 dual-language schools. ''In
some places, even the idea of bilingual education is controversial.
It shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Dual-language instruction is one of three main, often hotly
debated approaches to teaching the nation's 3 million limited
English proficient students, of which nearly 75 percent are
Hispanic. These students, designated by school tests and other
measures as non-English speakers, also are taught in English-only
classes or completely in their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative critics of dual-language schools said Wednesday
that such instruction doesn't necessarily give non-English speakers
the language immersion necessary to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are basically using Hispanic kids to help teach
English-speaking kids Spanish,'' said Jorge Amselle of the Center
for Equal Opportunity, a Washington-based group critical of current
bilingual education programs and policies based on the premise that
non-English speaking children should be immersed in the language as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   While Hispanic children are more likely than other kids to come
from poor families where they don't have good access to health care
and preschool classes that would make them better students --
statistics recounted by Riley indicated that language is the chief
barrier to learning.
</P>
<P>
   The dropout rates for Hispanics -- a third of whom leave school
overall -- are linked to a student's language difficulties. Nearly
half of foreign-born Hispanic students drop out, while just 16
percent of Hispanic students born in the United States leave
school, Riley said. And among U.S. born students who had at least
one parent who was foreign-born, the dropout rate was higher at 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   And there are fewer teachers who can teach bilingual students.
While 54 percent of the nation's classrooms have students in need
of English instruction, just 20 percent of teachers say they feel
prepared to teach them, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents and educators want all children to learn English
because it is essential for success,'' Riley said, disclosing the
latest research on Hispanic students. ''But, whatever the approach
to teaching English, it cannot be simply a defensive or reactive
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with dual-language schools, said Amselle, is that
nearly half of them have a 9-to-1 ratio of non-English students.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is Spanish immersion and that's great for English
speakers, but not so great for the Spanish speakers,'' Amselle
said, adding that many parents have opposed such schools.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington at Oyster Elementary, a 325-student school
where every child learns everything equally in Spanish and in
English, children are successful, said Principal Paquita Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Each classroom has two teachers, who divide the children into
two groups. While one group is solving math problems in English;
the other is doing the same math lesson in Spanish. At the end of
the semester or quarter, the groups switch languages.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the children there are poor and 56 percent are
Hispanic, yet seven in 10 have scored at or above grade level on
recent standardized reading and math tests, Holland said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Appointees Win in GOP Primary  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Two minority appointees of Gov. George W.
Bush won Republican primaries, assuring them of taking office in
November and bolstering Bush's effort to broaden his party's
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Railroad Commission chairman Michael Williams would be the
first black elected in a statewide, non-judicial race in Texas.
State Supreme Court Justice Al Gonzales was Bush's general counsel
and secretary of state before Bush appointed him to a Supreme Court
vacancy last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared in television commercials for both men before
Tuesday's primary. Both often appeared on stage with Bush during
speeches televised in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Recent national polls show Bush and Vice President Al Gore
virtually even in the presidential race. Each is trying to expand
his party's traditional base of support and win over independent
voters. For Bush, that includes attracting blacks and Hispanics who
traditionally vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes it is important to broaden the base of the
Republican Party by reaching out to new faces and new voices,''
said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a longtime ally of the Bush family. The governor's
wife, Laura, and his father, former President Bush, were keynote
speakers at Williams' fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you're seeing the party that does welcome the variety
that we have in Texas, the diversity,'' said a Bush supporter, Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ''That's what Texas is, and Governor
Bush helped make this possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was appointed assistant U.S. education secretary
for civil rights by President Bush in 1990, said he would
enthusiastically work on the younger Bush's presidential campaign
if asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said electing a Hispanic to the Texas Supreme Court was
politically important to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he understood that there would be a message sent by my
election,'' Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who speaks Spanish, won nearly half of the Hispanic vote
during his successful 1998 re-election campaign -- a rare level of
support for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hailey, spokesman for the Texas Democratic Party, said
regardless of the victories of Williams and Gonzales, blacks and
Hispanics in Texas are not turning Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in predominately Hispanic counties voted in far greater
numbers-- sometimes more than 20-to-1 -- in the Democratic primary
than the GOP primary, Hailey said.

<HEADLINE> Church Aid Group's Future Debated  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Delegates from the National Council of Churches
are meeting to debate whether the organization's international
welfare agency -- the Church World Service -- should take control of
its own finances.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for the troubled church council. The World
Service, a major aid group, accounts for 88 percent of the
council's projected $71.3 million income this year.
</P>
<P>
   The council is a federation of 33 Protestant and Orthodox
denominations representing 100,000 local congregations. Delegates
are to meet Thursday and Friday in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Patrick Mauney, an Episcopal Church executive who
chairs the Church World Service governing committee, said one
source of friction is that some donations intended for the aid
group ''have been used for purposes other than what was designated,
to cover other costs in the National Council of Churches.''
</P>
<P>
   The aid group also recently agreed to pay a special assessment
of $1,453,000 to help the council meet its estimated deficit of $4
million for 1999. And the council raised its fee for administrative
services this year from 6.3 percent of the aid group's income to
8.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Page, director of the Church World Service, complained
that council officials unilaterally hiked the fee.

<P>
   ''The process was not followed. There was a feeling that trust
was broken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Page who proposed last year that the group take charge of
its own finances, and the governing committee unanimously approved
the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland meeting is the first for Rev. Robert Edgar, who
took over as general secretary of the National Council of Churches
on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar, a former Democratic congressman, argues against changing
control of the Church World Service, saying the council is
improving its administration and that it would be wasteful to have
two finance offices.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, we are one institution,'' he said. ''The issue is
fixing what was broken, not artificially pulling things apart.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Appointees Win GOP Primaries  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Two minority appointees of Gov. George W.
Bush won Republican primaries, assuring them of taking office in
November and bolstering Bush's effort to broaden his party's
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Railroad Commission chairman Michael Williams would be the
first black elected in a statewide, non-judicial race in Texas.
State Supreme Court Justice Al Gonzales was Bush's general counsel
and secretary of state before Bush appointed him to a Supreme Court
vacancy last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared in television commercials for both men before
Tuesday's primary. Both often appeared on stage with Bush during
speeches televised in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Recent national polls show Bush and Vice President Al Gore
virtually even in the presidential race. Each is trying to expand
his party's traditional base of support and win over independent
voters. For Bush, that includes attracting blacks and Hispanics who
traditionally vote for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believes it is important to broaden the base of the
Republican Party by reaching out to new faces and new voices,''
said Bush spokesman Scott McClellan.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a longtime ally of the Bush family. The governor's
wife, Laura, and his father, former President Bush, were keynote
speakers at Williams' fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you're seeing the party that does welcome the variety
that we have in Texas, the diversity,'' said a Bush supporter, Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ''That's what Texas is, and Governor
Bush helped make this possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was appointed assistant U.S. education secretary
for civil rights by President Bush in 1990, said he would
enthusiastically work on the younger Bush's presidential campaign
if asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said electing a Hispanic to the Texas Supreme Court was
politically important to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he understood that there would be a message sent by my
election,'' Gonzales said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who speaks Spanish, won nearly half of the Hispanic vote
during his successful 1998 re-election campaign -- a rare level of
support for a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hailey, spokesman for the Texas Democratic Party, said
regardless of the victories of Williams and Gonzales, blacks and
Hispanics in Texas are not turning Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in predominately Hispanic counties voted in far greater
numbers-- sometimes more than 20-to-1 -- in the Democratic primary
than the GOP primary, Hailey said.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Executes Killer  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER BERRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- A man who killed two armored-van guards
during a robbery that netted almost $300,000 was executed by
injection Wednesday, less than a year after his brother was also
put to death for the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Poland, 50, was pronounced dead at 3:07 p.m., minutes
after he told relatives of his two victims he was ''sorry for the
pain and suffering I have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked his girlfriend, who witnessed his death, ''to remember
I will always love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland and his brother, Michael, disguised themselves as highway
patrolmen and rented a car that resembled a police cruiser in 1977
before performing a traffic stop on the van.
</P>
<P>
   The van was ransacked of $288,000. The next day, prosecutors
said, the brothers placed guards Cecil Newkirk and Russell Dempsey
in canvas bags before dumping them into Lake Mead, 250 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the guards may have been alive at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were arrested in May 1978 after leaving a trail of
clues, including their spending $127,000 of the money in their
hometown of Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Poland was executed in June. He was 59. His brother's
execution on Wednesday was Arizona's 21st since the state resumed
capital punishment in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His execution was one of two scheduled in the nation on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas prepared to execute Timothy Lane Gribble, 36, for the
September 1987 abduction, rape and strangling of Donna Weis, a
Clear Lake Shores, Texas, city council member.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Peace at Critical Stage  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Colombia's second-largest guerrilla
group said that it could quickly reach an agreement with that
country's government over an army withdrawal from a northern
enclave to allow peace talks to be held there.
</P>
<P>
   But Pablo Beltran of the National Liberation Army, or ELN, said
his organization was losing patience and faith in discussions with
envoys of President Andres Pastrana that have dragged on for more
than year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've reached the point at which the government has to either
take it or leave it,'' Beltran, a member of the group's 5-man
command council, said Tuesday of the proposed troop pullout from a
northern ELN stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no intermediate solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   More meetings with government delegates were expected this
weekend in the Venezuelan capital, where left-leaning president
Hugo Chavez has given safe haven and presidential bodyguards to the
rebels, who are inspired by Fidel Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But Beltran said he saw only a ''50-50 chance'' that Pastrana
would agree to grant the ELN a demilitarized zone similar to one in
southern Colombia established to allow peace talks with a larger
rebel faction, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to maintain pressure for such a zone, the group has
stepped up bombings of electrical energy towers -- causing
electricity rationing for millions of people -- and staged
disruptive highway blockades.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it hijacked an Avianca airliner, abducting its
passengers and crew and kidnapping hundreds of worshippers from a
Catholic mass -- raising money and grabbing attention at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   He hinted that hostage releases or other humanitarian
concessions could be part of a deal to create a
troop-and-police-free zone in three rural towns in the northern
state of Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN wants to use the region to hold parallel talks -- one set
with the government and another with labor, peasant and human
rights groups aimed at generating an agenda for social change.

<HEADLINE> 29 Hurt in Kansas Amtrak Derailment  </HEADLINE>
By CARL MANNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARBONDALE, Kan. (AP) -- An Amtrak train heading for Los Angeles
derailed before dawn Wednesday alongside a cornfield, injuring 29
passengers -- one critically.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard a loud noise, we started rocking and went over,''
said Richard Gray, 51, of Aurora, N.Y., who was in a sleeper car
that overturned. ''It was kind of eerie when the bottom is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen cars of the Chicago-to-Los Angeles train carrying 140
passengers and 15 crew members went off the track shortly after 2
a.m. near Carbondale, about 15 miles south of Topeka in eastern
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger remained hospitalized Wednesday afternoon in
critical condition. The others were treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Hare said five passenger cars,
including two sleeper cars, were lying on their sides. Another
passenger car remained upright. Ten cars carrying mail and other
light freight also derailed.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the derailment was not immediately known, and
personnel from the National Transportation Safety Board were at the
scene within five hours.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-car Southwest Chief had left Chicago at 3:20 p.m.
Tuesday. The cars derailed early Wednesday as the train was coming
out of a gentle curve, Hare said. She said she did not know how
fast the train was traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was scared. I was afraid we weren't going to make it,''
recalled 13-year-old Jerilyn Kemmerer of Overland Park, Kan., who
was in a sleeper car with her family. ''The window was broken and I
could feel the gravel coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   At first light, work crews began clearing the tracks during
sporadic rainfall but had no estimate about how long it would take.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Wednesday, Amtrak's City of New Orleans train slammed
into a truck loaded with steel at a crossing in Bourbonnais, Ill.,
killing 11 people and injuring more than 100. The truck driver, who
received a 60-day license suspension after the crash, claimed the
crossing's warning bells, lights and gates activated after he was
on the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Texas, 11 people were injured Wednesday when a
vintage excursion train collided head-on with another train just
south of downtown Forth Worth. The injuries appeared to be minor.
The Tarantula Train was carrying 148 passengers and a crew of seven
when it was partially knocked off the track.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident remained under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Dogs Kill 17-Year-Old Brazilian Boy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- A 17-year-old-boy died Wednesday after
he was attacked by two Rottweiller dogs guarding a construction
site, according to media reports, marking the second fatal attack
by dogs this week.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Goncalves Dias was attacked on Monday when he and a friend
entered the site in Curitiba, 220 miles southwest of Sao Paulo, the
Agencia Folha news service reported.
</P>
<P>
   After the dogs attacked, area residents tried to save Dias by
throwing rocks. Police said officers responding to the call shot
and killed the animals.
</P>
<P>
   Dias' friend escaped unhurt, but Dias was severely bitten and
died of his wounds Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, six Rottweillers killed a 4-year-old girl and injured
her sister and their mother as they returned home from church in
Carapicuiba, a rural district on the outskirts of Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs were apparently set loose earlier in the day to guard a
farm where the mother and the children's father live and work as
caretakers, police said.

<HEADLINE> FTC Halts BP Amoco-Arco Merger Suit  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A merger of BP Amoco PLC and Atlantic
Richfield Co. was back on track Wednesday as the Federal Trade
Commission and the companies agreed to examine a revised proposal
aimed at easing the government's concerns about competition.
</P>
<P>
   The government put on hold indefinitely a lawsuit that had
challenged the $30 billion deal that would create the world's
second largest nongovernment oil company.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC said it would soon resume talks with the two companies
on whether the new proposal resolved fears that the new company
would have too much control over Alaska oil production.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came after Arco, agreed to sell all of its
holdings in Alaska, where the two companies currently control about
70 percent of the North Slope oil assets and operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of the substantial and constructive proposals made by
the defendants, all parties have agreed to seek adjournment of the
federal court proceedings,'' Richard Parker, director of the
agency's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. announced late Wednesday it has agreed to
buy all of Arco's Alaskan assets for $7 billion. The sale, which
was expected to close this spring, must be approved by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC had filed a lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco,
challenging the merger. The agency argued that the combined BP
Amoco and Arco would have such market power in Alaska so as to
unfairly influence retail competition on the West Coast, and
especially California, gasoline markets.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers involved with the talks said that the proposed sale
to Phillips, would likely resolve the most substantial FTC concerns
about competition in the Alaska operations.
</P>
<P>
   FTC lawyers must still determine, however, whether Phillips can
provide the competition the agency considers necessary. After the
Arco sale, the combined BP Amoco and Arco would control about half
of the North Slope oil assets and operations, according to sources
familiar with the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge was expected later in the day to approve the
indefinite postponement of the case, which was scheduled to go on
trial March 20 in San Francisco, pending the outcome of the new
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference was scheduled for later Wednesday in Alaska by
the state's governor and officials of Arco and Phillips, presumably
to make an announcement about the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC rejected the BP Amoco acquisition of Arco on Feb. 2 and
asked the court to put the deal on hold. The agency argued the
merger would harm competition on the West Coast and violate
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC argued that London-based BP Amoco and Arco, which is
headquartered in Los Angeles, would have too much power over West
Coast oil markets, especially retail gasoline sales in California.
The West coast relies heavily on Alaska oil.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco initially agreed to reduce its Alaska holdings to about
55 percent, but that was not sufficient to sway FTC antitrust
lawyers. BP Amoco argued that oil prices are set in a world market
and that its Alaska holdings pose no threat to West Coast
competition.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, private negotiations have been under way to
jettison all of Arco's holdings in Alaska, but FTC lawyers were
said to be concerned about the buyer's ability to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The sale to Phillips appeared to resolve many of the FTC's
concerns, although lawyers familiar with the deal said it unclear
when new negotiations would resume -- and how long they might take.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., has agreed to pay $6.5
billion to $7 billion for the Arco assets in Alaska, according to
Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Arco shares were up $4.25 to $83.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange while U.S. shares of BP Amoco gained $1.62{ to $52.75.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gives Missile Frigate to Poland  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- America's flag came down and the Polish flag
was hoisted aboard the USS Clark on Wednesday as the ship embarked
on a second career in the Polish navy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being turned into scrap, the 20-year-old
guided-missile frigate was transferred to the fledgling NATO member
as part of an effort to upgrade Poland's fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Sailors hauled down the Clark's commissioning pennant and the
American flag and the Clark's American crew walked off the ship
during a ceremony at the Norfolk Naval Station. The Clark's
American skipper, Cmdr. Albert F. Lord Jr., then turned the ship
over to its Polish commanding officer, Cmdr. Marian Ambroziak.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's red-over-white striped flag was hoisted and the Polish
crew came aboard the ship, re-christened FRR 272.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark is the first of two U.S. Navy ships scheduled to be
transferred to Poland, which joined the NATO a year ago. At 445
feet long, it becomes the second-largest ship in the country's
navy.
</P>
<P>
   With a primarily Baltic fleet, Poland now needs bigger ships
that can handle operations in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The ship's American sailors and its new Polish crew have sailed
together three times since early January in preparation for the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark became the second U.S. ship given to Poland. The
country received a U.S. submarine during World War II, Ambroziak
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considers More Mozambique Aid  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Criticizing congressional cuts in foreign aid,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appealed Wednesday for money
to help get U.S. forces out of Kosovo and said the administration
may ask for emergency funds to assist flood victims in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time after time, we have gone to the cupboard, but the
cupboard has been bare,'' Albright said, decrying Republican plans
to cut 13 percent from what she said already is a lean foreign
affairs budget.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations Committee last week slashed civilian
assistance for Kosovo and debt relief for Mozambique, Bolivia and
other poor countries from an emergency budget request expected to
reach the House floor as early as next week. The bill also includes
money for U.S. forces in Kosovo, for fighting drugs in Colombia and
for domestic disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's foreign affairs budget is expected to be cut from
the $15 billion Clinton requested to about $13 billion, Rep. Sonny
Callahan, subcommittee chairman, told Albright.
</P>
<P>
   However, Callahan, R-Ala., said that while he would not support
debt relief unless it requires countries to stay out of debt in the
future, he believes the U.S. government should do more for
Mozambique, where flooding has killed nearly 500 people and left
330,000 homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan urged Albright to use emergency money available now to
immediately step up assistance to the African country.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the U.S. Agency for International Development
already has provided $7 million in emergency food aid and $5.7
million in disaster assistance, and officials are assessing other
needs. U.S. civilian and military disaster teams also have been
dispatched, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Treasury Department is moving to forgive the $4.9
million debt owed by Mozambique to the U.S. government, and
assistance is going to Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa, which
also were hit by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hope to have an assessment of additional funds that
may be needed for the region by the time the supplemental
appropriations bill comes up next week, she said.
</P>
<P>
   On money for Kosovo, Albright said, ''We strongly oppose the
elimination of funds to revitalize Kosovo's economy and civil
society.''
</P>
<P>
   The money funds what amounts to ''an exit strategy'' for U.S.
troops, she said, because without the rebuilding of Kosovo society,
foreign troops will have to stay longer.
</P>
<P>
   On debt relief, she said, ''It is in our own interest to help
these countries stay on the course to self-sufficiency, and that
means helping to ease their international debt burdens.''

<HEADLINE> Manhunt Frightens Md. Community  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOWLEYS QUARTERS, Md. (AP) -- The supermarket and video store
close early these days. Parents are hesitant to let their children
ride bicycles and few people go out at night.
</P>
<P>
   Police cars, helicopters and bloodhounds have become part of an
ominous landscape as authorities search for Joseph Palczynski,
accused of killing four people after kidnapping his girlfriend last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings and subsequent manhunt have made this waterfront
suburb of Baltimore a virtual ghost town at night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Around our neighborhood we have a lot young kids, and you
don't see anyone out at night,'' Yvonne Alberts said. ''Usually,
they're out on their bikes until 7:30, 8 at night, but it's quiet
as a mouse. Spooky in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have tracked the 31-year-old electrician from the
scene of the killings, about 15 miles northeast of Baltimore, to
Virginia and back. There hasn't been a confirmed sighting since
Saturday, when a man abducted in Virginia said he drove Palczynski
back to Bowleys Quarters. But the suspect's return has residents on
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Police have responded to more than 1,000 calls from residents
reporting everything from open shed doors to suspected sightings.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Lambo said one neighbor apparently called police after
seeing her daughter's boyfriend playing in the woods with a
paintball gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police told him to lie down on the ground, and it had just
rained,'' Lambo said. ''He came in and he was covered with mud. He
was really upset. Everybody's on edge. I wish they would just catch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The local supermarket now closes at 6 p.m. instead of 11 p.m.,
as does the video store, which normally shuts down at midnight.
Police urge residents to stay out of the woods and lock their homes
and cars.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 officers have been assigned to the manhunt, including
FBI agents, state police and officers from surrounding counties.
</P>
<P>
   The search has been hampered by Palczynski's outdoor skills and
the landscape surrounding the residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a great deal of territory down there to cover ...
It's marshy, heavily wooded in some areas,'' Baltimore County
police spokesman Bill Toohey said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police tried to persuade Palczynski to turn himself
in, releasing a handwritten statement by his girlfriend, Tracy
Whitehead. She escaped the day after her abduction by running to a
police officer who happened to be at a motel where Palczynski took
her.
</P>
<P>
   A videotaped plea by Palczynski's mother and statement from his
attorney have also been aired. Police hope Palczynski will hear the
pleas via a battery-operated television investigators said he
bought along with outdoor gear last week.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski's mother also left a message on her home answering
machine pleading with him to turn himself in, or commit suicide as
he had threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The killings began March 7, four days after Whitehead said
Palczynski beat her when she moved out of the apartment they shared
and moved in with a co-worker, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Palczynski abducted Whitehead at gunpoint after
shooting to death the couple who had sheltered her, then killed a
neighbor. The next day a fourth victim was killed by a stray bullet
as Palczynski carjacked another vehicle, according to police.

<HEADLINE> Calif. OKs Temporary Timber Limits  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HOWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Forestry officials seeking compromise
unanimously approved six-month rules Wednesday to limit tree
cutting near Northern California's rivers and streams.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Forestry's action drew mixed reviews from
loggers and a quick hit from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   The board said it will develop permanent rules to take effect in
2001 and will base those rules on an exhaustive examination of
logging's impact on fish and wildlife in fragile watersheds --
something loggers, fishing interests, scientists and
environmentalists urge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the last word in deciding this issue,'' said Louis
Blumberg, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are part of the elaborate system of regulations,
enforced by the state Department of Forestry, governing
tree-cutting on millions of acres of private forests. Their most
significant provisions appeared weaker than the proposal that had
been before the board for weeks, and which resulted in protests by
loggers and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the rules sought logging limits near virtually all
types of streams -- those with fish, those with aquatic life other
than fish and those that are seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules focus only on the fish-bearing streams, the
so-called Class I streams. The rules require loggers to leave at
least 85 percent of the forest canopy within 75 feet of a Class I
stream, and at least two-thirds of the canopy within the next 75
feet.
</P>
<P>
   California's top forestry official said the new regulations were
not weaker than the original proposal. The latest rules offer major
environmental safeguards, such as new restrictions on cutting trees
on steep slopes and limits on winter road building and timber
operations, said Andrea Tuttle, director of the Department of
Forestry and Fire Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The rules also set requirements to leave certain large trees
standing, and limit the amount of water than can be removed from
streams during timber operations.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to provide shade and cool water for the streams and
rivers to protect coho salmon and steelhead trout habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the canopy protection is not consistent,
requiring only a fourth of the cover to come from tall pines and
other conifers -- which provide more shade over a longer reach than
smaller trees.
</P>
<P>
   And loggers contend the limits represent a severe financial
hardship on tree cutters. The canopy zones are measured from the
water's edge, but that edge changes regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's still a huge impact on private landowners, especially
those who own river bottoms and valleys. The problem is in the
stream migration zone, the natural widening and narrowing of the
stream. That can be from a quarter-mile to two miles,'' said Dave
Bischel, president of the California Forestry Association.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Speedy Haiti Elections  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. Security Council called for
speedy elections in Haiti as it ended a three-year mission to train
the country's national police Wednesday and handed over
responsibility for helping restore democracy to a new U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Security Council considers that timely, free and fair
elections are crucial to democracy and all aspects of Haiti's
development,'' council president Anwarul Chowdhury said in a
statement read at an open meeting of the 15-member body.
</P>
<P>
   President Rene Preval had called legislative and municipal
elections after dissolving Parliament in January 1999 to end a
political impasse that had paralyzed Haiti's government since
disputed elections in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Two rounds of voting were originally set for November and
December, then delayed to March 19 and April 30 -- and then delayed
again. Last week Haiti's electoral council rescheduled the vote for
April 9 and May 21 -- but Preval has challenged the council's
authority to set new dates.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council strongly urged Haitian authorities to
cooperate in finalizing arrangements for credible elections to
restore both the lapsed Parliament and local governments as quickly
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted in December to end its mission to train the
Haitian police force March 15, which then was expected to be just a
few days before elections.
</P>
<P>
   The police force was established in 1995 to replace a corrupt
army that killed as many as 4,000 civilians. The U.N. mission
arrived in 1997, replacing a 1,300-member U.N. peacekeeping force,
which had taken over for American troops.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. troops entered the country in September 1994, removing
a military junta and reinstalling Jean-Bertrand Aristide as
president.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. police training force is being replaced by a new
mission created by the General Assembly in December to try to help
strengthen Haiti's fragile democracy and encourage long-term
international support.
</P>
<P>
   The International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti, which will
start operating on Thursday, is to help reform Haiti's justice
system, professionalize the police, support human rights and assist
in organizing elections. It is also mandated to coordinate
international aid.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong mission has a $24 million budget and is expected to
have 150 international staff. U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst said
$9.7 million will come from the U.N. budget and the rest from
voluntary contributions. He said Canada has already chipped in $3.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the Clinton administration is working with
Congress on a U.S. contribution.

<HEADLINE> NATO Takes Control of Serb Bridge  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Seizing control of a key
bridge in a first step to reunite this ethnically divided city,
NATO peacekeepers clashed Wednesday with angry Serbs in a
confrontation during which two people lost limbs to stun grenades.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs responded with a call for a campaign of civil disobedience
against the embattled U.N. and NATO administration, which vowed not
to back down from their pledge to reassert international control.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's operation quickly turned into a confrontation as
crowds of angry Serbs surged into a ''security zone'' at the
bridgehead.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't accept people on the northern side creating trouble
and so they have to get out,'' NATO's commander in Kosovo, Gen.
Klaus Reinhardt, told reporters. ''They didn't want to get out, so
we had to apply a little more power.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 15 Serbs and an undetermined number of peacekeepers and
journalists were injured. Nine of the injured Serbs were
hospitalized, said Dr. Radomir Jankovic, chief surgeon at the
Serb-controlled hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A mother of three and a diabetic man each had one foot amputated
because of injuries suffered when stun grenades fired by French
peacekeepers exploded near them, Jankovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Serb leaders threatened to break off all cooperation with the
peacekeepers in retaliation for the eviction of Serb residents and
''bridge guards'' from the security zone in the Little Bosnia
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't expel the troublemakers, they expelled the
victims,'' community leader Oliver Ivanovic said. ''If they insist
on implementing the decision about the safety zone in Little
Bosnia, they will face a complete civilian disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not cooperate, we will not respect the curfew and
everything else that goes with it,'' Ivanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ivanovic said NATO officials had promised him they would
stop their attempts to remove the Serb scouts from the bridge,
essentially allowing things to return to status quo. There was no
NATO confirmation of that report.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs say their guards are necessary to protect them from
ethnic Albanians on the south bank, but Albanians who fled their
homes on the north side said they were afraid to return as long as
the Serb guards were there.
</P>
<P>
   NATO will effectively ban the bridge guards, and plans to mount
a similar operation across a second Ibar River bridge which has
been the scene of frequent clashes.
</P>
<P>
   The increased tensions overshadowed a reaffirmation of the
importance of the U.N. mission in Kosovo by President Clinton and
French President Jacques Chirac during a phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents ''reaffirmed ... the vigilance and firmness
which will be that of the United States and France and the
solidarity of allies in the face of extremists from all sides,''
Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Chirac also called for a meeting of ministers from
the five nations that have lead peace efforts in Kosovo to address
the situation there.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the rising tensions, NATO's supreme commander in Europe,
Gen. Wesley Clark, is seeking an additional 2,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   France is sending an extra 150-man unit to reinforce the
peacekeepers in the northern city, the French Defense Ministry said
Wednesday. That will bring the French contribution to the NATO-led
Kosovo Force to 5,200.
</P>
<P>
   France has offered 600 to 700 more and Italy said Wednesday it
would provide another 350.

<HEADLINE> Utica, N.Y. Co. Recalls Hot Dogs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New York food company is recalling more than
400 pounds of hot dogs because they may be contaminated with a
bacteria that can cause an uncommon but potentially fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Packing Co. of Utica recalled the franks after tests
revealed they may contain Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause
listeriosis, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported, but the disease can cause high
fever, severe headaches, neck stiffness and nausea. While healthy
people rarely contract listeriosis, it can be potentially fatal to
people with weak immune systems -- infants, the elderly,
chemotherapy patients and people with HIV infections or other
chronic diseases. Listeriosis can also cause miscarriages and
stillbirths.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled product is Honest John's brand hot dogs distributed
in Oneida County, N.Y., and packaged in two sizes. The 16-ounce
packages bear ''EST. 4578'' inside the USDA seal of inspection and
the sell by date ''Apr 11'' on the label. On the outside of the 12
pound boxes, which contain two six-pound packages, is the sell by
date ''Apr 11'' and the plant number ''EST. 4578'' inside the USDA
seal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, any six-pound packages -- which have no identifying
marks -- that have been removed from any 12 pound box of Honest
John's hot dogs, should be returned to the company.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA said anyone concerned about illness should contact a
doctor immediately.
</P>
<P>
   For more information consumers can call USDA's meat and poultry
hot line at 1-800-535-4555. The hot line is staffed from 10 a.m. to
4 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.

<HEADLINE> Beaned College Baseball Player Sues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- Attorneys for Anthony Molina, a
University of Evansville baseball player, filed a lawsuit Wednesday
against a Chicago Cubs minor league pitcher who beaned him before a
college baseball game last year.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed on behalf of Molina, the starting second
baseman for the Purple Aces, in Sedgwick County District Court in
Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   The suit lists Ben Christensen, a former Wichita State pitcher
who was a first-round draft pick of the Cubs in June, and Wichita
State University as defendants. It says Christensen committed
battery and was negligent, and that the university was also
negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Molina seeks more than $75,000 in damages from each defendant.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, Christensen was warming up on the
mound before an April 23 home game against the Purple Aces when he
turned toward Molina, Evansville's leadoff batter. Christensen
threw a warmup pitch at Molina, who was loosening up near the
on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   Molina was not looking toward the pitcher and couldn't avoid the
ball, which struck him in the left eye. It caused fractures around
the eye, retinal damage, glaucoma, reduced vision and blind spots
in his field of vision, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen, who said he was trying to keep Molina from timing
his pitches but never meant to hit him, was ejected. He later was
suspended by both the NCAA and the Missouri Valley Conference for
the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was announced during a news conference at the Davenport
office of one of Molina's attorneys, Rand Wonio.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me it is clear-cut and to the people who have seen it, and
my family, it is clear cut, but I've never been on a jury, so I
don't know,'' Molina said.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen was with the Cubs at spring training in Mesa, Ariz.,
on Wednesday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wichita State spokesman Bruce Erickson said the university had
not been served with a copy of the lawsuit, though he said it was
not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that Wichita State made a good-faith effort to
resolve the matter without litigation and should a suit be filed,
it wouldn't be a surprise,'' Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   The university will mount ''a vigorous defense'' against the
legal action, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen, a right-hander, was 21-1 in three seasons for the
Shockers before the suspension. Through Sunday, Molina was batting
.353 (12-for-34) as Evansville's leading hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Wichita State pitching coach Brent Kemnitz was suspended for the
rest of last regular season. The lawsuit says he instructed
Christensen and his other pitchers to brush back batters who stand
too close to the plate.

<HEADLINE> Jagr Welcomes Penguins' Changes  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANONSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Three new players were on the ice, three
more were on the way. Still, the player everyone was watching as
the Pittsburgh Penguins worked out Wednesday was the one they
almost always watch: Jaromir Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr practiced for the first time since getting hurt Feb. 21,
even if it was a shortened session that left him less than
confident he will be close to 100 percent any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr realizes that no matter how many players the slumping
Penguins add or subtract, he is the one most likely to decide if
they make the playoffs or miss them for the first time in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr's main problem is that his leg muscles atrophied during a
three-week layoff caused by a right hamstring injury and surgery to
remove a blood clot from his left thigh. Getting back into game
shape quickly is difficult, especially when there are only 13 games
to go, and every one he misses could be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm skating, but I still don't feel so good,'' said Jagr,
still the NHL's leading scorer despite not scoring in a month.
''There's still some pain. It's going to be a long time, but maybe
I can come back soon and play maybe 10 minutes a game, play on the
power play.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be as soon as Sunday night's home game against the
New York Rangers, he said, although that might be an overly
optimistic projection.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, it sounded better to the Penguins than the earlier
predictions he might be out for another two weeks. They are in a
six-team race for the final two Eastern Conference playoff spots,
an unenviable situation for a team on a 2-7-2 slide.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the season began, I thought we would get into the
playoffs with the guys we had, easy,'' Jagr said. ''But me,
personally, I think we're better now.''
</P>
<P>
   Jagr likes that the Penguins have added muscle and toughness
along the blue line with Bob Boughner, formerly of Nashville and
Buffalo, and Janne Laukkanen, acquired from Ottawa with goaltender
Ron Tugnutt for goalie Tom Barrasso.
</P>
<P>
   They also added a hardworking forward in Rene Corbet and another
forward, Josef Beranek, who played with Jagr on the Czech
Republic's Olympic championship team in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we needed a change. I thought we needed some new
guys,'' Jagr said.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso has played in only 18 games this season due to family
emergencies and minor injuries, and many in the Penguins'
organization questioned whether his heart was still in playing,
especially in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt he needed a change,'' Jagr said. ''A change every once
in a while is good for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, general manager Craig Patrick felt the same, as
evidenced by the abundance of handwritten name tags above the
Penguins' dressing room lockers. One-quarter of the stalls are
occupied by players who were elsewhere two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt, an All-Star goalie a year ago, will relieve some of the
pressure on rookie Jean-Sebastien Aubin, who has played 15
consecutive games. Some of that pressure was applied by Barrasso,
who offered Aubin little support and considerable criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Barrasso has spent so little time in the locker room
this season, his conversations with Aubin were infrequent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't that difficult,'' said Aubin, who probably will
start Thursday against Florida. ''It wasn't as bad as people made
it out to be. It was no big deal. I haven't talked to anybody yet,
but I think it's going to be great now. It doesn't matter how much
I play, I'm just worried about making the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Boughner was immediately paired with Kasparaitis, by far the
Penguins' most physical defenseman this season. Beranek played on a
line with Straka and Alexei Kovalev, two of the Penguins' top four
scorers.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Nashville, we felt if we shut down Jagr and Kovalev and a
couple of guys, we had a good chance to win,'' Boughner said. ''Now
we have guys here who can stand up and have a presence, some guys
with an edge.''

   Commons Passes Clarity Bill
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The Commons voted overwhelmingly Wednesday for
legislation to clarify the rules if Quebec, or any other province,
holds a referendum on secession.
</P>
<P>
   After months of acrimonious debate and political maneuvering
aimed at scuttling the bill, the Bloc Quebecois failed to
neutralize Ottawa's clarity bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bill C-20 passed 208-55. It must still win the approval of
Senate before it becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   Passage came hours after the House ended 36 hours of recorded
votes on almost 400 Bloc Quebecois amendments, which were defeated.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloc says the bill, which among other things allows the
Commons to pass judgment on the clarity of a referendum question,
is undemocratic.

   Acadia Chief Submits Salary Info
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX (AP) -- A Nova Scotia native chief has handed over
sensitive financial documents to the federal government under
threats of losing millions in funding to her band.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Robinson, chief of the Acadia band in Yarmouth, Nova
Scotia, surrendered statements that list her salary, expenses and
honorariums, as well as those of her councilors.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Indian Affairs had asked the band to release
the information by Wednesday after reports indicated the Acadia
band spent $640,248 in 1999 on salaries for the chief, six band
councilors and administrative staff.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa set the March 15 deadline last month and threatened to
withhold millions in funding it gives the band every year.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline also applied to the chief of Cape Breton's Eskasoni
band. Allison Bernard earned about $416,000 in tax-free advances,
salary, bonuses and expenses in the last 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Indian Affairs met with Bernard on Wednesday in
Amherst, Nova Scotia, to discuss the expenditures, as well as the
financial state of the reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial Aboriginal Affairs Department is auditing the
band to determine whether revenues from video lottery terminals and
tobacco sales are spent properly. Bands councils are allowed to
spend the money as they see fit, as long as it relates to economic
development on the reserve.

   Canada Alliance Race Buoys Reformers
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Reform MPs say they're buoyed by the leadership
race for the Canadian Alliance, a political coalition that a
Liberal party pollster acknowledges could be a problem for the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership race between Alberta Finance Minister Stockwell
Day and Reform Leader Preston Manning has fractured the Reform
caucus into different camps.
</P>
<P>
   But all that headline-grabbing competition is actually
stimulating, members say, not like the bad blood that seems to be
running through Liberal ranks over party leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal pollster Michael Marzolini, of Toronto-based Pollara
Research, says he plans to tell this weekend's biennial Liberal
convention that party members shouldn't become complacent about the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Marzolini calls Reform an ''iceberg party'' that is
underestimated between elections but can sneak up during campaigns
to sweep votes.

   Black's Lawsuit Struck Down
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- An Ontario court struck down media baron Conrad
Black's lawsuit against Prime Minister Jean Chretien on Wednesday,
saying his decision to block Black's appointment to the British
House of Lords is beyond judicial review.
</P>
<P>
   Ontario Superior Court Judge Patrick LeSage dismissed Black's
key claims that Chretien and the federal government abused their
power and were negligent when he was denied a British peerage last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling means Black can no longer direct his $25,000 lawsuit
against the prime minister, although Black can still pursue the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   LeSage did not dismiss Black's claim that federal officials
misled him by suggesting he could be eligible to become a British
lord if he obtained dual Canadian-British citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Atkinson, vice president of Black's media company
Hollinger Inc. which owns the Southam Inc. newspaper chain, said
his client is disappointed with the ruling and might appeal.

<HEADLINE> Ariz., Texas Execute Inmates  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER BERRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Ariz. (AP) -- A man who killed two armored-van guards
during a robbery that netted almost $300,000 was executed by
injection Wednesday, less than a year after his brother was also
put to death for the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The execution of Patrick Poland was the first of two death
sentences carried out Wednesday. Texas executed confessed killer
Timothy Lane Gribble Wednesday evening, a day after the state held
another execution.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Poland, 50, was pronounced dead at 3:07 p.m.,
minutes after he told relatives of his two victims he was ''sorry
for the pain and suffering I have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked his girlfriend, who witnessed his death, ''to remember
I will always love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Poland and his brother, Michael, disguised themselves as highway
patrolmen and rented a car that resembled a police cruiser in 1977
before performing a traffic stop on the van.
</P>
<P>
   The van was ransacked of $288,000. The next day, prosecutors
said, the brothers placed guards Cecil Newkirk and Russell Dempsey
in canvas bags before dumping them into Lake Mead, 250 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the guards may have been alive at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were arrested in May 1978 after leaving a trail of
clues, including their spending $127,000 of the money in their
hometown of Prescott.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Poland was executed in June. He was 59. His brother's
execution on Wednesday was Arizona's 21st since the state resumed
capital punishment in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Gribble, 36, was put to death by injection shortly
after 6 p.m. for the 1987 abduction, rape and strangling of Donna
Weis, a Clear Lake Shores, Texas, city council member.
</P>
<P>
   Gribble led a lengthy final statement from the death chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want you to know from the bottom of my heart that I am
truly sorry,'' he said, looking toward witnesses. ''I mean it. I'm
not just saying it.''

<HEADLINE> Kitna Re-Signs With Seahawks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Quarterback Jon Kitna has signed a one-year
contract with the Seattle Seahawks, the team said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna, 27, who passed for 3,346 yards and 23 touchdowns during
the 1999 season, is entering his fourth NFL season. He was a
restricted free agent, meaning the Seahawks were entitled to
compensation if Kitna signed elsewhere. That compensation would
have been a first-round and third-round draft choice.
</P>
<P>
   After the 2000 season, he is eligible for unrestricted free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   An undrafted free agent and a former NFL Europe player, Kitna
was a backup in his first two NFL seasons. He was elevated to first
string when Mike Holmgren became Seattle's coach a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season as a starter, Kitna played well for 10 games
as the team went 8-2. But he struggled down the stretch as the
Seahawks lost five of their final six games and barely made the
playoffs as the AFC West champion.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna threw seven interceptions and lost a fumble in the final
two games.
</P>
<P>
   He also played poorly in a playoff loss to Miami, going
14-for-30 for 162 yards and throwing two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   On the season, Kitna was 270-for-495 for 3,346 yards, 23
touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He had a 77.7 rating, eighth in
the AFC, although he was second through 14 weeks.

<HEADLINE> Knight Can't Recall Choking Player  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Indiana coach Bob Knight said Wednesday
he might have grabbed former player Neil Reed around the neck, but
didn't recall choking him.
</P>
<P>
   He also denied Reed's claim that he had ordered the university's
president out of a basketball practice.
</P>
<P>
   Reed accused Knight of choking him during practice three years
ago. Reed transferred from Indiana at the end of that season,
contending he was physically and mentally abused by Knight.
</P>
<P>
   An interview with CNN/Sports Illustrated in which Reed repeated
his charges was broadcast Tuesday night, and a longer version was
part of a CNN program Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I grabbed Neil Reed by the shoulder, maybe I took him by
the back of the neck, I don't know. I don't remember everything
I've done in practice,'' Knight told Indianapolis television
station WTHR.
</P>
<P>
   The university investigated and rejected Reed's claims three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have used a lot of different things for motivational
purposes. I've always tried to act that part of my coaching is to
move you where you're supposed to be,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not learning to play bridge. We're learning to play
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was an underachiever who was unanimously voted off the team
by his teammates, Knight said. ''Who's heard about Neil Reed in the
past three years?''
</P>
<P>
   Knight called Reed's claim that Indiana president Myles Brand
had been dismissed from a practice by him ''the most absurd comment
of all. ... That absolutely, positively in totality never
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Indiana players also denied Reed's charges during a news
conference Tuesday night. Also, basketball media relations director
Todd Starowitz read a statement from former assistant coach Dan
Dakich.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who has seen coach at practice knows that he will
physically move a player by the waist or shoulders from one spot on
the floor to another to make a coaching point, but for Reed to say
that I ever had to separate him from coach is false,'' Dakich said.
''I did see coach take a kid by the shoulder or elbow and say 'Get
over here,' but choking a player? No. Never, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Guyton, the team's scoring leader and first-team
All-American, said he was disappointed to come to practice Tuesday
and hear about comments he called ''outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers (20-8), seeded sixth in the NCAA East, plan to
leave on Thursday for Buffalo, N.Y., where they will face
11th-seeded Pepperdine (24-8) on Friday. It's the first appearance
in the tournament for Pepperdine since 1994, while the Hoosiers are
in for the 15th straight year.

<HEADLINE> Young Mich. Shooter's Fate Halted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Parents of a 6-year-old boy
accused of killing a classmate in school have a right to a hearing
before he is expelled, school officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Beecher School Board had planned to vote at its meeting
Wednesday on Superintendent Ira Rutherford's recommendation to
expel the boy. But that vote was pushed back because the parents
have not yet met school officials, Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   Rutherford has recommended that the boy be expelled for three
months, in accordance with Michigan's school anti-weapons law.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the boy shot and killed Kayla Rolland, 6, on
Feb. 29 after he brought a stolen .32-caliber handgun into class.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, his 5-year-old sister and 8-year-old brother are
getting educational services at home. They are in the temporary
custody of their maternal aunt.
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan law passed in 1995 requires expulsion for 180 days
for any student in grade six or above who carries a weapon to
school. Students in grades five or below are expelled for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges are expected against the boy, who
authorities have said is too young to understand what happened. A
19-year-old man living at the house where the boy had been staying
has been charged with involuntary manslaughter for allegedly
leaving the gun around.

<HEADLINE> Corzine claims on 700,000 new jobs could bring mixed result  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Jon Corzine, who has applied the ''bold
ideas'' slogan to his campaign for the Democratic nomination for
U.S. Senate, has now made a bold claim: He is responsible for
700,000 New Jersey jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine made the claim at a luncheon for union leaders in East
Brunswick Tuesday, the same day he provided reporters advance
copies of his new, one-minute commercial that repeats the claim:
</P>
<P>
   ''He's helped create and keep 700,000 New Jersey company jobs
alone. Now he's running for the United States Senate with a bold
plan for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, the union leaders at one table who heard the
claim, and others who have seen the commercial, drew the same
conclusion: He was taking credit for 700,000 jobs in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting literature for the ad, provided to news
reporters, explains the fine-line difference between ''New Jersey
jobs'' and ''New Jersey company jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The claim actually concerns the fact the Goldman Sachs
investment banking firm during Corzine's five-year reign as
chairman worked with 40 giant corporations headquartered in New
Jersey that in that time increased their global payrolls by 700,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Lucent Technologies, all of the large ones
were already here. And Lucent was a spinoff from other
telecommunications firms already in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have been happily reporting to legislative committees
that the state's economic expansion, which began in May 1992, added
453,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration at all opportunities discusses the
390,000 new jobs created since she took office.
</P>
<P>
   But these happy statistics pale against the number of new jobs
with which Corzine wishes to be associated for his work leading
some 5,000 investment bankers at Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Goldman Sachs who was willing to comment could be
reached Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With a TV commercial buy of between $500,000 and $1 million
through next Tuesday, millions of New Jersey TV viewers will get to
decide on their own what he may have meant.
</P>
<P>
   What they may think of it could be crucial.
</P>
<P>
   It is already plain what the aides for his opponent, former Gov.
Jim Florio, think about it.
</P>
<P>
   For months they have been anxiously awaiting the launch of the
TV ''air war'' from Corzine, who is investing a piece of his
considerable personal fortune in this, his first-ever run for
elected office.
</P>
<P>
   They have anticipated a ''carpet bombing'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have seen the first launch, and they are pleased,
regarding it as a boomerang bomb that will bounce up and hit the
plane that dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an outrageous lie, a blatant lie,'' said Walter Fields,
a media aide for Florio.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is that he is taking credit for jobs that are already
in existence. I believe he takes credit for just about every job
created at Public Service Electric and Gas because people paid
their electric bill,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed the mood at Florio headquarters as joyful.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great example of the public contradiction of Jon
Corzine,'' Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine campaign co-manager Steve Goldstein hammers at the
clarification that Corzine meant jobs across the whole country.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the record, the ad is accurate and it is clear. It means
in New Jersey and across the nation,'' he said, dismissing other
interpretations as ''ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields said this is an effort to split hairs on sentence
structure and it will not protect them from the backlash they
deserve.
</P>
<P>
   Rider University political analyst David Rebovich said the tall
boast illustrates a misjudgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has to be more careful in how he words things, in how he
draws connections with average citizens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Corzine and his advisers have the correct early goal of
connecting with ordinary voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess he wants us to see his economic success (at Goldman
Sachs) has had a positive spillover for working Americans,''
Rebovich said. However, he added, ''The claim is just too
exaggerated, and it may hurt him with ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Corzine has kept his promises general and his
proposals broad: universal access to education, health insurance
coverage, long-term care for seniors. He has detailed them in
speeches, handouts and on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot go on for long, Rebovich said, because special
interest groups like unions want details.
</P>
<P>
   ''Credibility for the newcomer is achieved by his attention to
detail,'' Rebovich said. ''If he is willing to make these sorts of
preposterous-sounding statements, what does it say about him?''

<HEADLINE> African Nations Criticize UN Report  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Several African nations accused of
violating sanctions against Angola's rebels criticized the
explosive U.N. report containing the charges Wednesday as a biased
piece of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Other diplomats called into question the evidence supporting the
accusations, which included charges that the presidents of Burkino
Faso and Togo helped arm the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But the chairman of the U.N. sanctions committee on Angola,
Ambassador Robert Fowler of Canada, defended the report as solid
and meticulous. He urged the council adopt its recommendations,
including an arms embargo against countries that violated
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on UNITA
rebels in 1993, a year before the United Nations brokered a peace
agreement between the rebels and the government.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, six months before the peace agreement collapsed, the
council expanded the measures to include a ban on rebel diamond
exports, which are estimated to have supplied the group with up to
$4 billion since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Most ambassadors were cautious over the independent panel's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   France's deputy U.N. ambassador, Yves Doutriaux, said the report
deserved ''detailed scrutiny'' because of the seriousness of the
accusations and the lack of specific dates of alleged violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all due respect, this report seems instead to be built on
illusions rather than on certainties,'' Burkina Faso's U.N.
ambassador, Michel Kafando, told the council.
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses Presidents Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso
and Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo of having helped UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi with arms and fuel shipments in exchange for diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   And it accuses Belgium of having such lax standards at its
Antwerp diamond market that rogue dealers were able to trade UNITA
gems with virtually no obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's U.N. Ambassador, Andre Adam, sharply criticized the
report's failure to include recent improvements enacted by Belgium
to crack down on the illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman, Anders Mollander of Sweden, said the
information wasn't turned over in time.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassadors of Burkina Faso and Togo condemned what they
called the ''frivolity'' and ''selective nature'' of the findings
and challenged the panel to produce solid evidence to substantiate
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the person bringing the charge that must provide the
evidence, not the contrary,'' said Togolese Ambassador Roland
Kpotsra.
</P>
<P>
   He and others questioned the report's extensive use of testimony
from rebel defectors, suggesting the panel used a
less-than-meticulous standard when accusing Africans.
</P>
<P>
   But Fowler defended the panel's methods, saying the evidence
collected, particularly against the presidents, was of a higher
legal standard than would have been necessary in a court of law.
UNITA defectors were only used to corroborate information the panel
had independently obtained, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every member of this organization knows that the sanctions are
being violated and it can't really be a surprise to learn how,''
Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's report, released this week, details how rebels
bought weapons from Eastern Europe, primarily Bulgaria, and had
them shipped via African countries in exchange for gems.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria's deputy U.N. ambassador, Vladimir Sotirov, denied any
government wrongdoing and decried how Bulgaria was widely cited in
the report based on information it provided about its arms
shipments. Other countries that didn't turn over such information
were let off the hook, Sotirov said.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda's U.N. ambassador, Joseph Mutaboba, said the accusations
that Rwanda allowed diamond-for-gun transactions in its territory
''have no foundation,'' and were merely hearsay from biased
sources.
</P>
<P>
   But British Foreign Office minister Peter Hain praised the
report's willingness to expose violators ''who should be ashamed of
the way they are inflicting catastrophe on their fellow Africans.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.-China Relations Said 'Mending'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Military relations are ''slowly mending''
between the United States and China, the commander of U.S. Pacific
forces told Congress on Wednesday, but he warned that China's
military balance with Taiwan could be thrown ''out of whack'' by a
Chinese buildup.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Dennis C. Blair said that while Taiwan has a better quality
military and the People's Liberation Army lacks the capability to
''invade and control'' Taiwan, which China claims, China does
''have the ability to inflict significant damage to Taiwan'' with
its much larger force.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying with other regional commanders before the House Armed
Services Committee, Blair said he expects China's military budget
to increase somewhat over the next several years but not the point
where it will significantly alter the military balance across the
Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said U.S.-Chinese military relations were at a new low
last year, with the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade and other troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a settlement has been negotiated for damage and
lives lost, a U.S. battlegroup was able to visit Hong Kong without
incident, and Blair visited Beijing for talks on regional security.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to congressional questioning, Blair said he warned
Chinese leaders against ''throwing the balance out of whack'' and
told them the United States is committed to maintaining a military
balance in the region.
</P>
<P>
   He said a continued Chinese buildup could result in support for
a theater missile defense system to protect Taiwan, which the
Chinese oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, while not recognizing Taiwan diplomatically,
is required by the Taiwan Security Act to ''react to any resort to
force or other form of coercion'' against Taiwan, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our forces are ready and capable of carrying out their
responsibility toward Taiwan,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Thomas A. Schwartz, commander of U.S. forces in Korea, told
the committee North Korea remains the power ''most likely to
involve the United States in a large-scale war.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that although its economy continues to decline, it is
improving militarily.
</P>
<P>
   ''The army is much more than just a military organization; it is
North Korea's largest employer, purchaser, and consumer, the
central unifying structure in the country, and the source of power
for the regime,'' Schwartz said in his written testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The communist regime has done more to improve its military in
the last year than in the previous five years combined, he said.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Record Set in '82 Stands  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Back in the early 1980s, when her shot
was as automatic as her breathing, Lorri Bauman's jersey was a
signal to her Drake teammates.
</P>
<P>
   If they could see the front of it, they knew exactly what to do:
pass her the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs did that often against Maryland in the 1982 NCAA
tournament and Bauman responded by scoring 50 points. Though
Maryland won that West Regional game 89-78 to advance to the Final
Four, Bauman's total still stands as the most points ever scored in
an NCAA women's tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Swoopes never scored that many, nor did Cheryl Miller.
Neither did Lisa Leslie, Chamique Holdsclaw or anyone else who has
come along since.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all pretty upset about not winning, but I think all of
us realized just what kind of game she had,'' said Connie Newlin,
who was Drake's point guard at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Still to this day, Lorri Bauman from East High School in Des
Moines, Iowa, holds the NCAA scoring record. There have been a lot
of great players who had a lot more opportunities, but she still
holds it. I think that is quite a claim to fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake had reached the regional finals, played at Stanford, by
upsetting top-seeded Long Beach State 91-78. Bauman, a 6-foot-3
sophomore, scored 26 in that game and four teammates were in double
figures, including Newlin with 19.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland started out by having players slough off the person
they were guarding to help on Bauman. But the Terrapins used only
six players that season and the fouls were mounting, so coach Chris
Weller decided at halftime to use only one player on Bauman the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the double- and triple-teaming, Bauman still
scored.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was like 10 of 11 or 10 of 12 in the first half, so I was
kind of on in that game anyway,'' said Bauman, now Lorri Record.
''It was mostly turnaround jumpers and the outside shot. I loved to
shoot outside because nobody would come out and guard me. That was
my all-time favorite shot.''
</P>
<P>
   With only one defender on Bauman, and that player guarding her
from behind, Newlin and the others could see the front of Bauman's
jersey. They did not have to think about what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was automatic then to get it to Bauman because that was a
pretty easy wheel and deal,'' Newlin said. ''That whole game was
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weller said that because of the fouls, she had no choice but to
keep the other players away from Bauman, who averaged 23.5 points
that season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did it knowing she would score a lot of points, but I
thought we could probably pull away,'' Weller said. ''The biggest
thing was we were going to disrupt our offensive continuity if we
kept getting fouls and we were a pretty good offensive team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauman finished 21-of-35 from the field and made 8-of-11 free
throws while playing all 40 minutes. Carole Baumgarten, Drake's
coach from 1974-86, said she doesn't think Bauman's talents were
recognized at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think people understood how good a shooter Bauman
was,'' Baumgarten said. ''They just saw that as a fluke. Flukes
don't hold the record for that long. The truth is, she wasn't
stoppable. She stopped herself a few nights, but that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes came closer than anyone to Bauman's mark, scoring 47 in
the 1993 national championship game against Ohio State. Only four
others have scored 40 points in an NCAA tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised it's still there,'' said Bauman, who lives in
Gillette, Wyo. ''But records are made to be broken. It's kind of
nice to have them last, but it's nice to see somebody else break
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bauman, who played the 6-on-6, half-court game in high school,
left Drake in 1984 with 3,115 points. That's still second on the
NCAA's career list, only seven points behind Mississippi Valley's
Patricia Hoskins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen a lot of great players on TV and read about them,
but I've never seen anybody that was as prolific a scorer as Lorri
in the women's game,'' Newlin said. ''She wasn't the greatest
mover, but if you could get her the ball, she could score from
anywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Syracuse Knows All About NCAA Upsets  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A startling loss in the NCAA tournament is all
it takes to forever change the perception of a school or coach.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Syracuse's Jim Boeheim.
</P>
<P>
   He's got 573 career wins, 22 seasons of 20 or more wins, a
stable of All-American players, a .667 winning percentage in the
NCAAs since 1987 and two trips to the title game.
</P>
<P>
   And yet all Boeheim ever hears about are the two times (1978,
1991) his Orangemen were knocked out in the first round by a
double-digit seed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what people remember,'' Boeheim said Wednesday. ''We've
lost twice in the first round in 20 years. But every time I read an
article it's 'Well, Syracuse gets beat in the first round a lot.' I
didn't realize two was a lot, but I guess it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The days of shocking tournament upsets has faded dramatically.
In fact, a No. 12 seed has won at least one tournament game each
year since 1988, and in the past few years schools like Gonzaga,
Valparaiso and Miami of Ohio have had their moments in March.
</P>
<P>
   Boeheim is hoping No. 4 seed Syracuse (24-5) can avoid making
Samford (21-10) another surprise story on Wednesday in the first
round of the Midwest Regional. The Orangemen will face the
13th-seeded Bulldogs in the second afternoon game.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 seed Kentucky (22-9), whose seven NCAA titles are second
only to UCLA's 11, and No. 12 seed St. Bonaventure (21-9) will meet
for the first time and tip off this year's 64-team tournament at
12:20 p.m. EST in Cleveland's Convocation Center.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening session, No. 1 seed Michigan State (26-7) will
face No. 16 seed Valparaiso (19-12) at 7:40 p.m., followed by No. 8
seed Utah (22-8) and No. 9 Saint Louis (19-13) at 10:10.

   Boeheim isn't sure which Syracuse team will show up on Thursday.
The Orangemen who opened the season 19-0, or the ones who went 5-5
down the stretch and looked awful in a loss to Georgetown in the
Big East tournament's first round last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just didn't come out and play, and I don't know why,''
Boeheim said. ''If I did, I would have stopped it. It caught me by
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Now is not the time for another surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Jason Hart, one of three senior starters for
Syracuse, dismisses the notion the Orangemen are under any more
pressure because they're the higher seed and expected to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter what number is next to your team right
now,'' Hart said. ''Everybody in the country is on eggshells
throughout the country. The conference, the ranking and all that
has no effect on anything right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse knows better than to look past Samford, which copies
Princeton's offense right down to the backdoor cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs lead the nation in field-goal percentage, are third
on 3-pointers and opened the season by beating St. John's, the same
team that trounced them in last year's NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Samford was overwhelmed by the TV lights and crowds in the first
round last year in Orlando, Fla., and fell behind 15-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went to a party and an NCAA game broke out,'' Samford coach
Jimmy Tillette said. ''We were embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky, normally one of the country's deepest teams, arrives
at this year's tournament undermanned.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats are down to nine players following the suspension
of starting forward Desmond Allison, arrested last weekend on a
drunken driving charge. He has been indefinitely suspended and is
not expected to play again this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a real blow to our team,'' Wildcats coach Tubby Smith
said. ''But I think our team has overcome it. Even with Desmond
out, we have a lot of talented players.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said reserves J.P. Blevins and Marvin Stone will get more
playing time, and Saul Smith will play some at shooting guard as
well as point guard.
</P>
<P>
   While a trip to the NCAA tournament is almost a birth rite at
Kentucky, St. Bonaventure is making its first appearance in the
field since 1978. But although they've never played the Wildcats,
the Bonnies won't be awed by their storied opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my first time in the tournament and that's history,
too,'' said Bonnies guard Tim Winn, who was 9 months old the last
time St. Bonaventure made an NCAA trip. ''I don't really worry
about the seedings. We're here and a lot of strange things can
happen in this tournament.''

<HEADLINE> Indiana St. Players Defend Knight  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Indiana State guard Nate Green arrived in
the Hoosier State well aware of the huge shadow cast by Indiana
coach Bob Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had heard all the misconceptions and how big of a jerk he
was,'' Green, a senior from Des Moines, Iowa, said.
</P>
<P>
   Green and the Sycamores saw another side of the caustic coach
after Indiana State upset then-No. 14 Indiana 63-60 in Bloomington
in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''That must have been one of the toughest losses for him ever to
get through. He came in the locker room 10 minutes after that game
and said, 'You guys really played well, you really just kicked our
butts out there,''' Green said. ''My opinion of Bobby Knight has
drastically changed from when I first got to Indiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight has been under fire after former player Neil Reed, in an
interview broadcast Tuesday, accused Knight of physically and
mentally abusing him three years ago. Indiana officials
investigated and denied Reed's charges.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State coach Royce Waltman spent five seasons as an
assistant to Knight, capped by the Hoosiers' NCAA championship in
1987. Waltman calls that ''the biggest thrill I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Green recalled that when Waltman got the Indiana State job three
years ago, the coach said he would just as soon keep his friendship
with Knight than coach the Sycamores.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that speaks volumes about not only their relationship
but what kind of guy coach Knight is,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing Knight told the Sycamores stuck in the mind of guard
Michael Menser, who grew up a Hoosiers fan in Batesville, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said we could either take the win two ways: it could be our
season or we could go on to bigger and better things,'' he said.
''We did do that, we went on to bigger and better things.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State is in the NCAA tournament for the first time since
1979, when Larry Bird led the Sycamores to a loss in the title game
against Magic Johnson and Michigan State.

   ARIZONA OUT OF WOODS: Arizona found out Wednesday what had
been suspected: center Loren Woods will miss the tournament with a
back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona team physicians reviewed tests done Tuesday on Woods and
decided the compression injury to a disc in his back has not
healed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll continue to miss him as we have the last month, but
these guys have played awfully well without him,'' coach Lute Olson
said. ''It doesn't do you any good to talk about the people that
aren't there. No way can you make a big issue of that because then
you get into excuses and we're not into excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods hurt his back against Washington State on Feb. 12 and
missed the final six games of the regular season. He will make a
full recovery, school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-1 center averaged 15.6 points and 7.5 rebounds, and
led the Pac-10 Conference in blocked shots with 3.9 a game. He
blocked a school-record 102 shots, including an NCAA record-tying
14 against Oregon last month.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Thompson, chairman of the NCAA selection committee, said
Sunday that the committee was told that Woods would not play in the
tournament. However, the committee still made Arizona the top seed
in the West.
</P>

   TRIANGLE OFFENSE: If Los Angeles Lakers assistant Tex Winter
watches Thursday's first-round game between Southeast Missouri and
LSU, he'll see something very familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, in the NCAA tournament for the first time ever, run
the triangle offense that Winter developed years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same offense Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls used
to win six NBA championships, and one the Lakers employ under
Winter and coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of cutting action and a lot of moving,'' said
Southeast Missouri coach Gary Garner, who learned the triangle
under his high school coach and as an assistant to Missouri's Norm
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Missouri forward Mike Branson said it's a difficult
offense to guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''You get a lot of shots coming off screens if you're able to
read the screens correctly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   GLAD TO BE OUT OF THE CAPE: One of the biggest cliches heard
during the NCAA tournament is how glad coaches and teams are to be
here.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Southeast Missouri, the Indians are happier about
being away from Cape Girardeau, a town of 32,000. The school, known
locally as Se Mo, has 8,863 students.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was tremendous fanfare in Cape Girardeau before we left.
Everywhere our players were going, they were patting them on the
back,'' coach Gary Garner said of the locals. ''Since we've gotten
here, they've become much more focused. We're ready to play and put
all that stuff behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Garner has new worries in Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't played in as many big arenas as most of the teams
here have,'' he said. ''They've never had the news media attention
that they're getting now and all the distractions.''
</P>
<P>

   UTAH RERUN FOR TEXAS: Texas has been here before and is hoping
for a better outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns lost to Utah 79-73 on Dec. 22 at the Huntsman
Center, where they'll face Indiana State on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rick Barnes had his team eat at the same restaurant as it
did in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't seem like too new of a place and everyone's real
comfortable here,'' said Chris Mihm, who had 19 points in the loss.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Peruvian Underdog Surges  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A one-time shoeshine boy turned economist has
made a surprising surge into second place in the election race
against President Alberto Fujimori, a poll showed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, trailing in third place with 14 percent
support just a month ago, had improved to 25 percent in a national
poll conducted by the private firm Datum International.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori still maintained a solid lead with 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But with only 25 days before the April 9 vote, Toledo's sudden
showing evokes memories of Fujimori's meteoric rise a decade ago,
when the then-university rector surged from 3 percent a month
before the election and staged an upset victory over novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa in a second round of voting.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, who finished fourth in Fujimori's 1995 landslide
re-election victory, has emphasized his humble beginnings as a
farmer's son who shined shoes to help make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to hold three graduate degrees, including a doctorate
in economics from Stanford University, and was an adviser to the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Datum poll also showed that 54 percent of Peruvians believe
allegations that Fujimori's re-election campaign used at least 1
million forged signatures to register his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Two witnesses to the alleged fraud told reporters Wednesday that
they were prepared to offer testimony to a special prosecutor
investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who has denied any involvement in the scandal, said
Wednesday that he welcomed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's National Elections Board, dominated by Fujimori's
appointees, last week rejected calls to nullify Fujimori's bid for
an unprecedented -- and many say unconstitutional -- third term.
</P>
<P>
   Support for two other candidates -- Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade
former social security director Luis Castaneda -- who had earlier
staged strong challenges to Fujimori slipped in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Datum poll surveyed 1,505 people between March 10 and March
13 has a margin of error of 2.6 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Nursing Board Closes Chemo Cases  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN FINUCANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The state nursing board reprimanded a nurse
Wednesday and dismissed complaints against two others, closing the
last cases that arose from chemotherapy overdoses at the Dana
Farber Cancer Institute in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Globe health columnist Betsy Lehman died in September
1994 and another woman's heart was damaged after receiving the
overdoses at the prestigious cancer center. A total of 18 nurses
faced complaints; all cases have now been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The cases against nurses Susan Aikey and Ilene Galinsky were
dismissed Wednesday with an advisory letter. Maura Murray agreed to
a formal reprimand. The other 15 nurses agreed to either a one-year
license probation or a formal reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and North Andover teacher Maureen Bateman, who later died
of cancer, were given four times the appropriate dosages of radical
chemotherapy treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses delivered dosages prescribed by a doctor, so the
disciplinary actions angered many.
</P>
<P>
   But Marie McCarthy, chairwoman of the state nursing board, said
they were still responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''A nurse has independent responsibility for knowing that the
dose of a drug being administered to a patient is the correct
dose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Nathan, the Dana-Farber president, and Susan Grant, chief
of nursing, issued a statement saying they believed the actions
against the nurses were ''inappropriate and unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor who wrote the erroneous chemotherapy order, James
Foran, did not reapply for his license, heading to London to do
cancer research.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Gain in Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALKHAZUROVO, Russia (AP) -- After 10 days of intense fighting,
Russia claimed to control the Chechen village of Komsomolskoye on
Wednesday and said it had a firm hold on the rebel republic's
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But warplanes and artillery continued to batter a half-dozen
other communities in Chechnya and military officials admitted
Russian forces still didn't have command of many villages.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Komsomolskoye -- seized by rebels earlier this month in
an assault that undermined Russian claims that the rebels faced
imminent defeat -- several small militant groups remained, said
Konstantin Makeyev, a spokesman at the Russian regional military
command in Mozdok.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the area the rebels occupy
in the town ''is shrinking steadily'' and the Russian forces were
performing a ''mopping-up'' operation. No fighting in Komsomolskoye
could be seen Wednesday from the adjacent village of Alkhazurovo.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the Russian general staff, said
Wednesday that the rebels' hold on specific regions and villages
had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ''We control all Chechen territory,'' he said, according to the
Interfax news agency. ''We are of course unable to control all of
the 400-some villages, but we can enter them at any moment if an
armed confrontation breaks out.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia on Wednesday bombed and shelled rebel groupings in a
half-dozen towns and villages, Makeyev said. All are in the
republic's rugged mountains, where rebels have been able to
capitalize on their guerrilla skills to mount quick attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' capture of Komsomolskoye was a striking example of
their ability to penetrate Russian lines and bloody the federal
forces with sniper fire. After the surprise takeover, the rebels
held out despite fierce shelling and air barrages that left the
town in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Reclaiming control of Komsomolskoye would be an image boost for
Russian acting President Vladimir Putin just 11 days before the
presidential election. Much of Putin's strong popularity stems from
his tough conduct of the six-month Chechnya conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has previously defined its goal in Chechnya as wiping out
the rebels. ''This will take a long time,'' said Kvashnin, the
military chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   He said federal forces are moving into a new phase of fighting
aimed at the elimination of the rebel leadership. Leaders will be
arrested -- like Chechen commander Salman Raduyev, who was seized
this week and charged with murder -- ''or they will be killed,''
Kvashnin said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground troops entered Chechnya in late September, weeks
after Chechen rebels invaded the Russian republic of Dagestan. The
government said it was time to restore order in Chechnya, which had
sunk into lawlessness after rebel fighters drove out Russian troops
at the end of the 1994-96 Chechen war.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops took most of Chechnya's northern flatlands with
dispatch. Rebels fled the capital, Grozny, in early February. Since
then, the fighting has focused on the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels have occasionally shocked Russia with deadly
ambushes, including one in Grozny that killed 20 troops and another
in the mountains that killed 84. Funerals for victims of both
attacks received wide coverage in Russian media, but support for
Putin does not appear to have been undermined by the images of
thousands of weeping mourners.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United Nations launched a $19.2 million appeal
Wednesday to meet the emergency needs of thousands of people
displaced by fighting.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the appeal is initially aimed
at people who fled to the northern Caucuses region and host
families who have taken many of them in but could be redirected to
Chechnya itself if security conditions improve.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan remains ''very concerned about the
fate of civilians inside Chechnya and the U.N. is exploring the
possibility of working inside Chechnya,'' Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> Bible-Quoting Judge's Ruling Upheld  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The Ohio Supreme Court on Wednesday
unanimously upheld a 51-year prison sentence imposed by a judge who
quoted a Bible verse while deciding a man's punishment for raping a
young girl.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court last year overturned the sentence, saying the
judge acted outside Ohio's sentencing guidelines. The state Supreme
Court disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled 7-0 that Hamilton County Judge Melba Marsh
did not violate the due process rights of James Arnett, who pleaded
guilty in 1997 to repeatedly raping an 8-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   In sentencing Arnett in 1988, the judge quoted a Bible verse
that says anyone who offends a child would be better off if ''a
millstone were hanged around his neck, and that he were drowned in
the depth of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bible was one factor in many that supported Marsh's
''legally unremarkable decision'' to assign significant weight to
one statutory factor -- the victim's age, Justice Deborah Cook
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A message left for Arnett's lawyer, Charles Bartlett, at his
Cincinnati office was not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Manhunt On in Costa Rica Slayings  </HEADLINE>
By ERIC NUNEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO VIEJO, Costa Rica (AP) -- Police investigating the
slayings of two Americans were hunting Wednesday for a man who was
seen with the women shortly before they vanished near a Caribbean
beach town.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Emily Howell of Lexington, Ky., and Emily Eagen of
Ann Arbor, Mich., were found Monday along a highway near the town
of Cahuita, 90 miles east of San Jose, the capital. Both were 19
years old.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Ruiz of the Judicial Investigation Organization told a
news conference that the two women were seen with a man shortly
before they vanished late Sunday and police were hunting for that
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   He gave no details, but said the number of footprints at the
scene raised the possibility of two attackers.
</P>
<P>
   In the area near where he bodies were found, police have
circulated leaflets with photos of the victims, seeking information
from anyone who had seen the man with the women on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Howell, a student at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio,
was in Costa Rica on a photography project, according to the
school's dean of students, Scott Warren.
</P>
<P>
   Eagen and another Antioch student, Shauna Sellers, had come down
to visit her and the three were spending a weekend in a tourist
cabin at this Caribbean beach town.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the cabin, Charlie Wanger of Boston, said Howell
and Eagen left at about 10:30 Sunday night, heading to the El
Dorado restaurant in the town's center.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a sad thing. They were two very good kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said Eagen had been shot twice in the head and once in the
shoulder. Howell had been shot in the head and back. He said the
murders occurred between 10:30 p.m. and 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   While he said the women were killed where they were found, local
residents said they did not hear any gunshots and the site is only
about 200 yards from a police checkpoint along the highway.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who gave her name only as Joanna, who lives in a house
about 60 yards from where the bodies were found, said she heard the
noises of somebody unloading something from a car very late Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe there was a sexual attack, Ruiz said, noting that
valuable goods were not taken. Credit cards, clothing and other
belongings were found near the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   A sport utility vehicle the women had used was found burned
Monday on a major highway just outside San Jose, said judicial
police spokeswoman Margarita Morales. The car had been rented by
Sellers, a 20-year-old Canadian, the newspaper La Nacion reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't speak. I feel very bad, very confused, very
stricken,'' Sellers was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz said the FBI office in Miami had offered help in the
inquiry, but said, ''for now, it is better to wait'' and perform
the investigation with Costa Rican agents.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Dodd expressed confidence in the police
investigation but declined to make other comments.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican President Miguel Angel Rodriguez said he did not
believe the incident would affect relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the obligation to give guarantees of the security for
those who visit us just as we have for our own citizens,'' he said.
''The life of every human being has equal worth.''
</P>
<P>
   The area is part of Limon province, where five slayings have
occurred so far this month. The region contains a depressed banana
industry and has beaches popular with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers reported that hotels in the region reported
that some tourists had already canceled reservations.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Won't Endorse Bush, Gore  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINONA, Minn. (AP) -- Neither Al Gore nor George W. Bush should
expect Jesse Ventura's endorsement without paying a price, the
Minnesota governor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   To win him over, a candidate would ''have to sever from being a
Republican or Democrat,'' Ventura said during a forum on MSNBC's
''Hardball With Chris Matthews.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura predicted that Sen. John McCain, who dropped from the
Republican race last week, would be elected president if he ran as
an independent. McCain has said he plans to stick with the GOP.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bougainville Peace Talks Resume  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) -- Peace talks between the
Papua New Guinea government and secessionists on Bougainville
island resumed Thursday after stalling earlier on the key issue of
an independence referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Progress towards lasting peace on Bougainville has been slow
since a cease-fire agreement was signed in April 1998, ending a
10-year war by secessionists to gain independence from Papua New
Guinea. It was the longest conflict in the Pacific region since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Bougainville People's Congress demands a referendum so
Bougainvilleans can choose whether to break away. The group's armed
wing, the Bougainville Revolutionary Army, has refused to disarm
until the referendum is agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The Papua New Guinea government has refused to consider a
referendum, and has offered a plan for greater political autonomy
for the province instead.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 40,000 islanders have become displaced and 20,000 people
are thought to have died, mostly through malnutrition and disease,
since fighting began in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The island, the largest of the Solomon Islands but a part of
Papua New Guinea, is 800 miles northeast of the Papua New Guinea
capital, Port Moresby, and is rich in copper resources.
</P>
<P>
   Australia and New Zealand, which have peace monitors deployed on
the island, are growing impatient and are pressuring both sides to
find a lasting political settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The latest talks, led by Papua New Guinea's Minister for
Bougainville Affairs Michael Somare, are being held for four days
on the island of Lolata, near Port Moresby.

<HEADLINE> Reynolds Seeking Millions Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is seeking
millions of dollars from five wholesalers and retailers Reynolds
claims defrauded it of promotional money designed to lower store
prices for cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said it had filed the lawsuit Wednesday in North
Carolina federal court. The lawsuit seeks $5 million in
compensatory damages. Under state and federal unfair trade
practices laws, the damages could be tripled. The nation's
second-largest tobacco company behind Philip Morris Co., claims the
defendants created fraudulent cigarette orders and sales invoices
to steal millions of dollars related to Reynolds ''buy down''
promotional program.
</P>
<P>
   Under ''buy down,'' Reynolds makes direct payments to retailers
to discount the retail price of cigarettes by passing the discounts
on to customers. Instead, the lawsuit alleges the defendants
pocketed the money, Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names as defendants wholesaler Southern Sales &AMP;
Import and retailers S K Everhart Inc., Southland Trade Corp.,
Great Steaks, and Kingsway Enterprises Inc. All of the companies
are based in North Carolina, said John Singleton, a Reynolds
spokesman based at the company's Winston-Salem headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals associated with these organizations also are named
as defendants. Reynolds did not name the individuals in a news
release announcing the lawsuit. Singleton did not have the names
Wednesday night; the federal court was closed Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Everhart, owner of S K Everhart Inc., based in Trinity,
said Wednesday night he was unaware of the lawsuit but denied the
allegations. A message left at Southland Trade Corp. offices in
Moyock was not returned Wednesday night. Calls rang unanswered at
Great Steaks, Kingsway Enterprises and Southern Sales &AMP; Import.
</P>
<P>
   Another wholesaler, Central Wholesalers Inc. has admitted its
involvement in the scheme and provided information to help Reynolds
in the lawsuit, Reynolds said. Central Wholesalers has paid
restitution to Reynolds Tobacco.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Antoine Walker scored 25 points and Paul Pierce
added 19 as the Boston Celtics kept their playoff hopes alive by
sending the Golden State Warriors to their eighth straight loss,
121-104 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which has won five of six, began the night three games
behind Orlando for the final playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics led by two points at halftime, then outscored the
Warriors 41-24 in the third quarter. Reserve guard Doug Overton had
nine points in the quarter while Walker had eight.
</P>
<P>
   Donyell Marshall put Golden State ahead 55-52 before Boston went
on a 15-5 run that started with Overton's 3-pointer and was capped
by a pair of Tony Battie free throws. Boston connected on all 15 of
its free throws shots in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Williams made a pair of free throws and a long jumper for a
89-69 lead with 1:02 remaining in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has won five straight at home since coach Rick Pitino
lashed out at reporters and fans for ''negativity''.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team led by more than three points in the first quarter.
Golden State took a 35-27 lead with 9:14 left in the second quarter
on an Adonal Foyle layup. But the Celtics went into halftime with a
51-49 advantage after a Danny Fortson layup with 20 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hughes led the Warriors with 32 points. Vonteego Cummings
tied his career-high with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Fortson finished with 12 points and a game-high 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Golden State swingman Chris Mills (right ankle) and forward
Terry Cummings (rotator cuff) will miss the rest of the season. ...
Fortson rejoined the team after missing Sunday's loss at Detroit to
attend a funeral. ... Warriors center Erick Dampier and Celtics
center Vitaly Potapenko exchanged words early after Dampier was
holding Potapenko's arm. ... Boston has won seven of the last eight
games against Golden State. ... The 41-point second quarter for the
Celtics was their second-highest output in any quarter this season
behind a 42-point quarter against Milwaukee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chris Simon scored late in the second period
to complete Washington's rally from a two-goal deficit Wednesday
night and give the Capitals a 4-3 victory over the New York
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, with 86 points, hold a four-point lead over the
Florida Panthers atop the Southeast Division. It is Washington's
biggest advantage this season.
</P>
<P>
   Washington improved to 15-1-3 in its last 19 home games. The
Capitals are 24-6-5 since Jan. 1, the NHL's best record.
</P>
<P>
   Simon broke a 3-3 tie when he beat Kevin Weekes from the left
circle for a power-play goal with 2:45 left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals controlled play against an inept Islanders
penalty-killing unit and scored two man-advantage goals in three
chances, sparking their comeback from a 3-1 first-period deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Washington rebounded after a shaky opening period that saw New
York hold a 17-7 edge in shots. However, the Capitals outshot the
Islanders 31-9 after that, dominating the second and third.
</P>
<P>
   After Washington's Ken Klee scored 4:50 into the game, Josh
Green, Brad Isbister and Johan Davidsson registered three goals
within 10:59 for a 3-1 New York lead. Davidsson also added two
assists.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals made it 3-2 with 21.8 seconds left in the period
when Terry Yake knocked in a Jim McKenzie pass from in front. Yake
also had an assist.
</P>
<P>
   Washington missed on numerous good scoring chances before Peter
Bondra tied the game at 3 with a power-play goal with 9:42
remaining in the second.

<HEADLINE> Stars 3, Devils 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Mike Modano snapped a tie early in
the third period with a goal off the skate of a Devils player and
the Dallas Stars won their third straight with a 3-2 win over New
Jersey on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner and Richard Matvichuk also scored as the
defending Stanley Cup champions welcomed back goalie Ed Belfour to
the team after a week's absence and spoiled the debut of Alexander
Mogilny with the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars won their 32nd straight road game when scoring at
least three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Patrik Elias, who became the Devils' first 30-goal scorer since
1993-94, and Jason Arnott scored for New Jersey, which was
returning after a seven-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who missed the last four games after being arrested
last week for assaulting a hotel security guard, didn't play.
Wearing a baseball cap, he watched Manny Fernandez make 22 saves,
including two on Mogilny early in the third period with the score
tied.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez also withstood a flurry in the closing seconds with
the Devils on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   Modano broke a 2-2 tie at 5:50 of the period after taking a pass
from Jon Sim. He couldn't handle the pass right away and he was
forced to take a bad angle shot that banked off the skate of
defenseman Scott Stevens for his 33rd goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas dominated the first period, outshooting New Jersey 15-6
and taking a 2-0 lead on goals 35 seconds apart by Langenbrunner
and Matvichuk. Both scores came with each team playing with a man
in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner extended his goal-scoring streak to four games
with a shot in close over Brodeur's glove at 2:40. Matvichuk, who
had to leave the game early in the third period after being struck
in the helmet and forehead by a deflected shot, scored on a 2-on-1
break, taking a nice setup from Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Elias got the Devils back in the game at 15:24 of the first
period, scoring in close four seconds after Dallas defenseman Brad
Lukowich was penalized for interference.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott tied the game at 5:51, putting a rebound past Fernandez
after he made nice stops on Petr Sykora and Elias.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 16-6-2 in their last 24 road games.

<HEADLINE> Dim Prospects for Guatemala Holiday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Guatemala's president wants to create a
holiday recognizing the victims of the country's civil war and to
have schoolchildren study the conflict's bloody history.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal seems to have little chance of being approved
because of strong congressional opposition from President Alfonso
Portillo's own party and little sympathy from human rights groups
who were expected to applaud the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Portillo asked the Senate on Tuesday to declare April 26 ''The
National Day of Dignity for Victims of Violence.'' That is the date
of the 1998 assassination of human rights leader Bishop Juan
Gerardi.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday had been one of the recommendations of the country's
truth commission, which investigated abuses committed during the
country's 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued last year, the commission blamed government
security forces for most of the 200,000 killings during the war. It
had recommended that the memorial holiday be held every Feb. 25,
the anniversary of the report's release.
</P>
<P>
   Portillo's proposal would require Guatemala's children to be
taught about the commission's report, as well as a similar report
by the Catholic church's Human Rights Office.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal appears to have little support in the Senate, which
is led by former dictator Efrain Rios Montt. Some of the worst
state-sponsored massacres of the war occurred under Rios Montt's
rule in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rios Montt is the founder and head of Portillo's party,
the Guatemalan Revolutionary Front, the two have continuously
failed to agree on policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rights groups, including the Rigoberta Menchu Foundation --
founded by the 1992 Nobel Laureate -- have dismissed Portillo's
proposal as a political ploy.

<HEADLINE> 14 Die in Ecuador Malaria Outbreak  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- An outbreak of malaria and dengue fever
has killed at least 14 people and has infected more than 14,000
others in Ecuador, health officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry called for a medical state of emergency in
17 of Ecuador's 23 provinces, along the Pacific coast and in
interior jungle regions bordering Peru and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   So far 14,192 cases of malaria have been confirmed, and six
people have died, said Jorge Zambrano, National Health Center
director.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria, which kills about 3 million people worldwide, is spread
by mosquito bite and is marked by fever, chills, joint pain and
vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials also detected 220 cases of dengue, known to
many as break-bone fever because of the excruciating muscle and
joint pains it causes. Zambrano said eight have died.
</P>
<P>
   Dengue, also often carried by mosquitos, attacks the digestive
system and can cause extreme dehydration and hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   The last outbreak in Ecuador occurred in 1997 and 1998 during
the El Nino weather phenomenon, which ravaged this small Andean
nation of 12 million people with heavy flooding -- creating a
perfect environment for mosquitos.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troop Withdrawal Approved  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A land transfer that had threatened to scuttle
Israeli-Palestinian peace just weeks ago won approval on Wednesday
from both sides, a sign of the new seriousness the leaders attach
to meeting a September peace deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak persuaded key ministers to approve the
transfer of 6.1 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, even
though areas near Jerusalem are included. The Palestinians accepted
the offer, even though a suburb that abuts the bitterly disputed
city was removed from the map at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, 11th-hour changes and the mere mention of
''Jerusalem'' were a sure recipe for crisis. But Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are feeling the pressure to make
good on September promises: Barak to produce a permanent peace with
the Palestinians, Arafat to declare the state that he says peace
will bring.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's security Cabinet -- nine ministers who vote on peace
issues -- approved the maps 5-3, with one abstention. Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said Arafat is aware of the revised
withdrawal maps and ''they were granted his approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Agreement on the interim withdrawal clears the way for the
resumption of permanent status peace talks in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
   Barak won election last year on a campaign of reviving talks
with the Palestinians, and he made good on his promise partly by
luring Arafat with hints of land transfers adjacent to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The talk was that Arafat would get Abu Dis, a bustling suburb
abutting Jerusalem's municipal boundaries. Arafat has built what is
widely believed to be the Palestinian parliament in the suburb, now
jointly controlled by Israel and the Palestinians. Total
Palestinian control would bring Arafat closer to the Jerusalem
capital he has promised for the Palestinian state he says he will
declare in September.
</P>
<P>
   As the February withdrawal date drew near, Barak's aides
strongly hinted that Abu Dis would be handed back, prompting an
uproar among his hawkish Cabinet ministers. Barak withdrew the
offer, instead offering tracts of uninhabited land. A furious
Arafat refused and suspended talks, saying that if he could not
trust Barak on the interim issues, he could not trust him on the
major ones.
</P>
<P>
   The final status talks are addressing the future of Jerusalem,
final borders, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent envoys to urge the sides back to the
table. Last week, the leaders shook hands again -- each under new
pressures to show results.
</P>
<P>
   Barak promised clean government, a turnaround in the economy,
and total peace process by the end of 2000. Instead, he has
presided over campaign finance scandals and unabating unemployment,
and peace talks with Syria have deteriorated into saber-rattling in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat promised and delayed statehood once, in May 1999; to do
so again in September could cripple his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   This week, it seemed another Abu Dis-style fiasco loomed.
Barak's office leaked maps that included Anata, another suburb that
abuts Jerusalem, but is not as close to the ultrasensitive holy
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from hawkish ministers in his Cabinet, Barak
backed down. Instead of crying 'crisis,' the Palestinians quietly
accepted the maps, which outline a withdrawal from 136 square
miles, and is likely to take place Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was not just the renewed goodwill that lured the Palestinians
back. The new maps include three crowded villages -- Ubeidiya,
Beituniya and Zatara -- close to, but not abutting Jerusalem. Israel
will also withdraw from near the towns of Jericho, Jenin, Bethlehem
and Hebron, pullbacks that bring Arafat closer to the territorial
continuity he needs to create a state.
</P>
<P>
   In another gesture, Israel said Wednesday it would release about
50 Palestinian prisoners on the occasion of a Muslim holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials also announced the release of 105
prisoners to mark the holiday.

<HEADLINE> Xavier 67, Marquette 63  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Maurice McAfee hit a 3-pointer and a free
throw in the final two minutes Wednesday night as Xavier switched
roles on Marquette, overcoming the big second-half deficit for a
67-63 victory in the first round of the National Invitation
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier (21-11) trailed by 10 with 15:25 left before rallying
behind the front-line play of Kevin Frey and David West and
McAfee's clutch 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   McAffee's basket beat the shot clock and put Xavier ahead 63-60
with 1:45 left, the Musketeers' first lead since the opening three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Marquette (15-14) had a shot to tie it at 66 with 5 seconds
left, but Brian Wardle's 3-point attempt went off the side of the
rim. Aaron Turner got the rebound, was fouled and hit one free
throw to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
   Frey led Xavier with 21 points, and West added 16 points and 11
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cordell Henry matched his career high with 17 points in the
first half as Marquette got up by double-digits, but drew heavy
coverage in the second half and finished with 29. John Cliff added
19 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bookend game to their meeting Jan. 2 at Milwaukee,
where Xavier blew an 18-point lead in the second half for one of
its most crushing losses.
</P>
<P>
   The Musketeers had won five in a row, including their upset of
No. 1 Cincinnati, and were getting national attention when the
Golden Eagles pulled off their big comeback.
</P>
<P>
   From that game on, Xavier made a habit of blowing leads and
losing close games.
</P>
<P>
   Henry hit the big shots in that first game, including a
3-pointer that tied it and a basket that put Marquette ahead to
stay. He pushed Xavier to the verge of its first first-round loss
in seven NIT appearances Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, who averages 8.5 points, hit 8-of-10 from the field in
the first half as he tied a career high reached only two other
times.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Price, Xavier's second-leading rebounder and third-leading
scorer at 13.1 points, didn't play because he missed two practices
over the weekend. Price said he needed time to clear his head after
his poor play in the Atlantic 10 tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- Marcus Hicks scored 14 points as
Mississippi held North Carolina Charlotte without a field goal for
seven minutes in the first half of its 62-45 victory in the first
round of the National Invitation Tournament on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lataryl Williams had 13 points for Ole Miss, Rahim Lockhart 12,
Jason Harrison 10 and Jason Flanigan 13. They were the only five
players to score for Mississippi (18-12).
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels, making their first NIT appearance since 1989, may
have played their best game of the season. Mississippi ran its
offense to near perfection, shot well from the perimeter, dominated
on the glass and played sound defense.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina Charlotte (17-16), with its poor shooting and the
fact it was without its best inside player, Tremaine Gardiner, was
never in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers made the first basket, then the shots wouldn't fall
from anywhere. North Carolina Charlotte went over seven minutes
without scoring and missed 19 straight field-goal attempts during a
12-minute span.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss, however, seemed to not be able to miss a shot, jumping
out to a 22-4 lead. The Rebels led 34-17 at half after shooting 58
percent (14-of-24), compared to the 49ers' 19 percent (6-of-31).
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi's lead grew to as much as 22 in the second half and
never went below 13. The Rebels shot 49 percent from the floor and
had 16 assists. The 49ers made just 27 percent of their shots.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Tolliver had nine points to lead the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss extended its home non-conference winning streak to 34
games, third-longest in the country behind Maryland (70) and Penn
State (46).

<HEADLINE> Pacers 113, Hawks 107  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Jalen Rose tied his career high with 32 points,
Reggie Miller had 28 and the Indiana Pacers took control with a
25-3 spurt, beating the Atlanta Hawks 113-107 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers increased their lead in the Eastern Conference to
three games over idle Miami and pushed six games ahead of Toronto,
also off, in the Central.
</P>
<P>
   The hapless Hawks, with the third-worst record in the East, led
55-45 after Isaiah Rider dunked off a fast break with 3:13 left in
the second quarter. But the Pacers scored the final 10 points of
the half, including six by Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana kept up the pace to start the third period, taking
command with a 15-3 run. Rik Smits scored six points, Miller added
four and Mark Jackson hit a 3-pointer for a 70-58 lead with 7:13
remaining for a 70-58 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks committed six turnovers during that eight-minute
stretch. To make matters worse, they hit only 3 of 17 shots in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta closed to 100-96 on Alan Henderson's dunk with 3:39
remaining, then forced a miss by Rose on Indiana's next trip down
the court. Dikembe Mutombo fought with Smits for the rebound, came
up with the loose ball as he stumbled toward the end line and tried
to call timeout.
</P>
<P>
   But official Don Vaden ruled Mutombo already had gone out of
bounds, giving the ball back to the Pacers. Miller took advantage
by hitting a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta made one more run, scoring four straight points to make
it 103-100 before Rose hit a couple of free throws, Jim Jackson
missed for the Hawks and Indiana's Austin Croshere dunked off a
pass from Mark Jackson to make it 107-100 with a minute to go.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Both teams played the previous night in Texas. The Hawks
lost in San Antonio, while the Pacers were beaten by the Mavericks
in Dallas. ... Indiana's Dale Davis didn't make the two-game road
trip because of leg cramps. ... Rider, who has played sparingly
since he showed up late for a March 9 game against San Antonio,
scored three points in seven minutes. Early in the fourth quarter,
several fans behind the bench began chanting, ''We want Rider.'' He
acknowledged their pleas by clapping his hands above his head. ...
Mutombo, Atlanta's Bimbo Coles and Indiana's Travis Best all picked
up technicals.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 32 points and
Christian Laettner added 22 points and a season-best 17 rebounds as
the Detroit Pistons defeated the Orlando Magic 113-91 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit solidified its hold on seventh place in the Eastern
Conference to two games over Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse is averaging 31.4 points in Detroit's last five
games, helping the Pistons to a 4-1 record since George Irvine
replaced Alvin Gentry as coach. Grant Hill added 24 for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   John Amaechi led the Magic with 27, hitting a career-best 13
free throws in 18 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit pulled away in the second quarter to lead 59-51 at the
half. Stackhouse had 19 in the half and Amaechi had 22, including
10-of-14 from the free throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse also had four in a 6-0 run that put Detroit ahead
69-55. The Pistons led by as many as 15 before Chucky Atkins'
buzzer-beater pulled the Magic within 81-69 at quarter's end.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando got to 83-73 with 9:49 left, but Hill hit a jumper in
traffic and then a fast-break dunk.
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse put the game away with a 3-pointer and followed with
a layup that made it 95-77 with 4:56 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Grant Hill became the eighth player in Pistons history
to score 9,000 points, passing the milestone in the second quarter.
... Tipoff was delayed for 10 minutes due to a serious traffic
accident outside the Palace. ... Detroit has won two straight
against Orlando after dropping 10 of the previous 11. ... Orlando's
starting forwards, Ben Wallace and Bo Outlaw, didn't take a single
shot in 32 combined first-half minutes.

<P>
   VILLANOVA, Pa. (AP) -- Malik Allen scored 16 points and grabbed
16 rebounds, and Gary Buchanan scored 18 as Villanova fought off
Delaware for a 72-63 victory Wednesday night in the first round of
the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Villanova (20-12), unbeaten in seven games against Delaware
(24-8), ended the first half with a 13-0 run and took its biggest
lead at 54-29 early in the second half after a 14-2 run that
included eight points by Sales.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware then launched a 16-3 run fueled by a Pegues' 3-pointer
at 13:25, closing to 57-45. Villanova was held without a field goal
for more than seven minutes in the middle of the half and two in
the final 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Hens closed within four on 12 straight points,
including two Pegues jumpers with 3:52 left. Villanova missed four
field goals, as Wells hit a 3-pointer to cut the advantage to 63-59
with 2:07 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware never got closer. Buchanan and Lynch scored seven

</P>
<P>
   Villanova, which advanced to a second-round matchup against the
winner of Thursday's game between Rutgers and Kent State,
outrebounded Delaware 54-37 and got 11 blocks to the Blue Hens'
three. The Wildcats held on to the lead by making 7 of 10 free
throws in the final 1:14.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> HMO Cost-Cutting Criticized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- In a move aimed at offsetting rising drug
prices, one of the nation's leading HMOs is requiring members who
use some anti-depressant medications to buy larger pills that they
have to split in half to get their daily dose.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including some doctors, say the action by
UnitedHealthcare takes penny-pinching by health maintenance
organizations to new extremes and say it could be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes across as very cheap on the part of the health
plan,'' said Dr. Ian Bushell of Family Medicine Associates of Cary.
''It's not so much a hassle for me. The patients are the ones who
have to break a pill in half.''
</P>
<P>
   United says it will pass along its savings by keeping premiums
low.
</P>
<P>
   United recently sent letters to doctors, members and pharmacies
outlining the new nationwide policy.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO now says it won't pay for certain dosages of Zoloft,
Paxil and Celexa, three popular anti-depressants. For example, it
no longer will cover 50-milligram tablets of Zoloft, a commonly
prescribed daily dosage. Instead, the HMO will cover 100 mg tablets
and order doctors to prescribe half a pill per day.
</P>
<P>
   A 100 mg pill of Zoloft costs 7 cents more than a 50 mg pill,
according to Dr. Lee Newcomer, senior vice president for health
policy with United.
</P>
<P>
   Covering only 100 mg tablets and having patients split them will
lower the cost for the same amount of medicine significantly, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-day supply of the equivalent of 50 mg per day, under the
new policy, will cost United $36.15, down from the $70.20 it pays
now.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed to be a painless way to keep drug costs down,''
Newcomer said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Garrett, executive director of the N.C. Association of
Pharmacists, said smaller HMOs have tried similar policies, but
this is the first time he has heard of a national HMO requiring it.
</P>
<P>
   ''For some patients, you could end up with dosing errors,''
Garrett said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes 2, Oilers 2, Tie  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Glen Wesley scored on a rebound with 13:46
left as the Carolina Hurricanes rallied from a two-goal deficit to
tie the Edmonton Oilers 2-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, with 70 points, moved into a tie with
Pittsburgh, Montreal and the New York Rangers for the final two
playoff spots in the tight Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (4-0-10) and St. Louis are the only teams this season
not to lose in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes had to kill a high-sticking penalty at the tail
end of the extra session to Rod Brind'Amour, but got a short-handed
breakaway attempt by Robert Kron that was stopped by Tommy Salo.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton is 2-8-16 in an NHL-high 26 overtime games.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley's seventh goal came from the slot after Salo stopped a
shot from the point from Sami Kapanen.
</P>
<P>
   Rem Murray and Doug Weight each scored less than a minute after
a Carolina power play to put the Oilers up 2-0 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Arturs Irbe tried to dive and stick-poke the puck away from
Murray in close on the game's first goal, but missed and Murray had
a open net for his sixth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Weight scored his 16th from an impossible angle less than five
minutes later. After a scramble in front of the net, Weight
collected the puck behind the goal line to the right of Irbe and
bounced it off the inside of his pads as he was sliding across the
goal mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes finally cashed in on their sixth power play as
Ethan Moreau was called for a four-minute high sticking penalty.
Gary Roberts netted his 17th on a rebound shot from Ron Francis,
who extended his point streak to a season-high eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The power-play goal gave the Hurricanes at least one
man-advantage score in each of their last seven games, extending
their season-high streak.

<HEADLINE> Supposed Kidnap Vehicle Seized  </HEADLINE>
By RON WORD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A green Jeep possibly used in last
week's abduction of a 10-year-old girl was seized Wednesday and
authorities said they have identified an individual who might be
linked to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had over 500 leads and this is definitely the hottest
one,'' said Linda White, Alachua County sheriff's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep Cherokee was hauled to the sheriff's office so
crime-lab technicians could go over it. Also brought in was a metal
shed, apparently seized from one of two residences searched
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the homes was in a neighborhood north of the University
of Florida, where investigators removed mattresses, sheets, several
boxes and some pictures. Police did not say if the vehicle or the
shed were seized from that house.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators ''have identified an individual, but we aren't
calling him a suspect,'' said White. No arrests were announced and
few other details were released, including whether authorities had
talked to the man and whether he owned the Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   Young Jessica Rodriguez was released unharmed in Gainesville
last Thursday, three days after she was snatched outside her home
in neighboring Gilchrist County after getting off her school bus.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had said Jessica was abducted by a man driving a
green suburban sport utility vehicle, most likely a Jeep Cherokee.
They appealed to the public for tips.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-year-old girl in Putnam County, east of Gainesville, said a
man approached her March 1 who resembled the composite drawing of
the kidnapper of Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   That man also was reported to be driving a green Jeep Cherokee.
The 9-year-old girl ran away as another car approached.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said after Jessica turned up safe that they believed
her abductor kept her in a house with an in-ground swimming pool, a
privacy fence, a shed and a barking dog.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors of the home searched near the University of Florida
said the family has a dog and a backyard pool.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks 5, Maple Leafs 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- While the Maple Leafs worried whether Bryan
Berard would lose vision in his right eye, the surging Chicago
Blackhawks beat Toronto 5-2 Wednesday night behind a pair of goals
from Steve Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Berard, a Toronto defenseman, struck in the face Saturday night
by the stick of Ottawa's Marian Hossa, needs exploratory surgery to
determine the extent of the injury. Dr. Rob Devenyi, who examined
Berard, said ''chances are slim, but not impossible'' that sight in
the eye can be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Berard, who is resting at home, was recognized during a break
midway through the first period. A video replay of a recent goal
flashed across the scoreboard along with a get-well wish. The fans
responded with a 1-minute ovation.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Maple Leafs added protective visors to their helmets
for the game, even though some said they were considering it.
Forwards Alyn McCauley, Yanic Perreault and Nik Antropov were the
only players with half-shields.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the salute to Berard, Chicago center Mark Janssens
was hit in the face by a high stick in the face. He was assisted
off the ice by trainer Mike Gapski, but was not seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Zhamnov, Michael Nylander and Josef Marha also scored for
Chicago, which won its third straight road game and for the seventh
time in 10 games. The Blackhawks trailing San Jose by 11 points for
the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference with 12
games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Kevyn Adams and Steve Thomas scored for Toronto, which had won
five straight.
</P>
<P>
   Zhamnov opened the scoring at 6:27 of the first period, snapping
the puck from the faceoff circle over the glove of Glenn Healy.
Tony Amonte recorded his 300th assist on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Nylander made it 2-0 at 14:54 and Sullivan scored at 2:10 of the
second off passes from Nylander and Blair Atcheynum.
</P>
<P>
   Adams ended Jocelyn Thibault's shutout bid when he scored on a
second effort from his stomach at 11:59 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   Healy stopped 21 of 26 shots, while Thibault made 30 saves.

<HEADLINE> Cop Brutality Protested in Montreal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Hundreds of people protesting against alleged
police brutality broke windows at a police station and damaged
shops and cars in downtown Montreal Wednesday. Riot squads broke up
the demonstration and arrested about 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest erupted two days shy of the 45th anniversary of
another Montreal riot, when hockey fans enraged by the suspension
of Montreal Canadians star Maurice Richard went on a rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Targets of the estimated 400 protesters, some wearing masks, on
Wednesday night included McDonald's restaurants, a bank, a police
station, and vehicles parked along downtown streets. No injuries
were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Vadier, 62, said he was drinking coffee at a McDonald's
restaurant when the windows were smashed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like a bomb,'' he said. ''The windows shattered but
there was no glass flying. Everyone was shocked. We all left the
restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   The protest came a few hours after prosecutors said a hearing
would be required to determine if charges would be filed against
two Montreal policemen who allegedly took part in the beating of a
homeless man. The victim died weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Breton, a chief prosecutor, said serious charges against
the policemen could result from the special hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But Yves Manseau, a spokesman for the protesters, said the
special hearing was extremely unusual and showed that policemen in
Montreal were getting preferential treatment.

   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Seizing control of a key bridge in a
first step to reunite this ethnically divided city, NATO peacekeepers clashed
Wednesday with angry Serbs in a confrontation during which two people lost limbs

disobedience against the embattled U.N. and NATO administration, which vowed not
to back down from their pledge to reassert international control. Wednesday's
operation quickly turned into a confrontation as crowds of angry Serbs surged

the country. Backers said they believed they had enough votes to approve the
bill. The Democratic-controlled House voted 79-68 today to advance the bill for

to control the Chechen village of Komsomolskoye on Wednesday and said it had a

Even in Komsomolskoye -- seized by rebels earlier this month in an assault that

militant groups remained, said Konstantin Makeyev, a spokesman at the Russian

also off, in the Central. The hapless Hawks, with the third-worst record in the
East, led 55-45 after Isaiah Rider dunked off a fast break with 3:13 left in the
second quarter. But the Pacers scored the final 10 points of the half, including
six by Miller.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Exec Criticizes Strikers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. MARTINEZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A top Boeing Co. executive has accused striking
engineers of trying to destroy the company's reputation by telling
airlines and government officials that new aircraft are unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Mulally, president of the commercial airplanes unit, said
in a letter dated Monday there were ''a few'' employees who were
maligning the company.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally also said in the letter mailed to 91,000 employees in
the commercial airplanes division that universities were being told
that Boeing ''is a terrible place to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You and I know that these statements are not true,'' Mulally
wrote, adding that striking engineers must stop ''maliciously
attacking our company and deliberately trying to destroy our
reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bofferding, executive director of the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, said Wednesday the
union has not been in contact with airlines, and that any letters
to Boeing customers were likely the actions of individuals not
supported by the union.
</P>
<P>
   Bofferding and union members have met with members of Congress
and FAA officials to talk about safety issues. But he said they
have not characterized Boeing's planes as unsafe, mostly because so
few of them have been delivered since the strike began Feb. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not delivering planes because the SPEEA workers who
ensure those planes are safe are not on the job,'' Bofferding said.
''If Boeing were to start delivering a lot of planes, we would then
have cause to speak out more forcefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The union said there are more than 17,000 engineers and
technical workers still on strike. They have turned down three
offers by Boeing, saying the offers did not include guaranteed
bonuses or sufficient health benefits.

professional touring companies.
</P>
<P>
   Young actors he reviewed included Eric Stoltz and Anthony

Richard Charnock:
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Richard Charnock, a veteran reporter and editor
for United Press International who covered such events as Ernest
Hemingway's death, died Tuesday after a brief illness. He was 69.
</P>
<P>

Tommy Collins:
</P>
<P>
   ASHLAND CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- Tommy Collins, who wrote country
music hits for Merle Haggard, George Strait and other singers, died
Tuesday of complications from emphysema. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   His hits included ''If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin')'' by
both Strait and Ferlin Huskey, and Haggard's ''Carolyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Haggard wrote his 1981 hit ''Leonard'' in tribute to Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Born Leonard Sipes in Oklahoma City, he was renamed Tommy
Collins by Huskey after the Tom Collins cocktail.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in
September.
Andrew Ghareeb:
</P>
<P>
   CHICOPEE, Mass. (AP) -- Andrew E. Ghareeb, who translated the
works of the Lebanese poet Kahlil Gibran into English, died Sunday.
He was 101.
</P>
<P>
   Ghareeb came to Springfield in 1913 from his native Lebanon and
discovered Gibran's writing in a Lebanese magazine in 1918. His
first translation of the poem ''My Soul Counseled Me'' was
published in the Springfield Republican newspaper in 1926.
</P>
<P>
   Ghareeb sent the translation to Gibran, who was living in New
York City. It was the start of a friendship that lasted until
Gibran's death, and the poet gave Ghareeb permission to translate
all of his Arabic writings into English.
</P>
<P>
   Ghareeb's translation of ''The Prophet'' sold more than 8
million copies. The most famous of his translations, ''Prose
Poems'' was published in 1934 and is in its 31st printing.
Joseph Goldstein:
</P>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Joseph Goldstein, a longtime Yale Law
School professor who introduced the best interests of children into
the canon of family law, died Sunday from a heart attack. He was
76.
</P>
<P>
   His work introduced the idea that courts should handle child
custody disputes according to the child's best interest and should
consider the child's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who also was a psychoanalyst, helped write three
books on the subject: ''Beyond the Best Interests of the Child'' in
1973, ''Before the Best Interests of the Child'' in 1979, and ''In
the Best Interests of the Child'' in 1986.
</P>

He helped write books on other topics, including volumes on
constitutional and criminal law and ''The My Lai Massacre and Its
Cover Up: Beyond the Reach of Law?'' in 1976.
Bobb McKittrick:
</P>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Bobb McKittrick, a gritty offensive line
coach for the San Francisco 49ers who worked with five Super
Bowl-winning teams, died Wednesday of cancer. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Baker, Ore., McKittrick started his coaching career
in 1961 as an assistant with his alma mater, Oregon State. He also
coached for UCLA and the Los Angeles Rams before returning to
Oregon State for graduate work in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the NFL as an assistant with the San Diego
Chargers the next year and joined Bill Walsh's staff with the 49ers
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick was scheduled for a liver transplant last April, but
it was canceled when doctors determined the cancer had spread. He
responded by returning to work, prowling the sidelines at training
camp in a golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers honored McKittrick with a special halftime tribute
during a home game against the Tennessee Titans last season.

<HEADLINE> Lindros May Play Thursday Night  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros, who missed the Philadelphia
Flyers' last game because of a migraine headache, might return to
the lineup as early as Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The captain, who sat out the Flyers' game Monday night at
Phoenix, underwent further tests on Wednesday and did not practice.
However, he could see action when the Flyers play at home Thursday
night against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrery Hartzell, the Flyers' team physician, said the
concussion-like symptoms Lindros had been experiencing were not a
concussion but a variation of a migraine.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has had three concussions in his career, the last one on
Jan. 14 that caused him to miss four games. Late in the 1997-98
season, Lindros received a concussion that kept him out of the last
18 games of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was complaining about headaches all week and not being able
to see things right,'' Flyers forward John LeClair said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartzell said Lindros was playing through the pain for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not until the game in Colorado (Sunday night) did it happen to
affect his performance,'' Hartzell said. ''He began to have some
difficulty concentrating, and because of that latter aspect, we
thought it was best that he not play in Phoenix.''

<HEADLINE> LAPD Scandal Erupts in Infighting  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The probe of one of the worst scandals in the
history of this city's police department degenerated into a
free-for-all Wednesday, with the district attorney accusing the
chief of not cooperating, and the chief implying the D.A. may not
be up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Bernard C. Parks, who has repeatedly criticized local
prosecutors for moving too slowly in bringing charges against
corrupt officers, said his department is continuing to cooperate
with Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti, although he
has serious reservations about Garcetti's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not pleased with the slowness of what has been done,''
Parks told reporters during a news conference Wednesday night
outside the Rampart police station, which sits at the center of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We certainly have some lack of confidence with their ability
to deal with this case, but we certainly have not let that stop us
from cooperating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At another news conference earlier in the day, Garcetti said the
Police Department had stopped cooperating with his investigators,
adding that if necessary he will subpoena department officials to
obtain access to documents and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between Garcetti and Parks, rumored for weeks, brought
expressions of outrage from other city officials, the 9,500-member
police union, and the American Civil Liberties Union when it moved
fully into the open this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it sounds absolutely insane,'' Councilwoman Laura
Chick said.
</P>
<P>
   The corruption scandal centers on a group of rogue anti-gang
officers in the department's Rampart division who framed, bullied
and sometimes shot innocent people. At least 29 officers have been
relieved of duty, and dozens of criminal convictions have been
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the investigation is veteran undercover officer Rafael
Perez, who was convicted of stealing cocaine from a police evidence
locker. In exchange for a five-year prison sentence, he identified
dozens of fellow cops who he claimed abused their power and
maintained a code of silence between 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office has yet to file charges against
any officer implicated in the corruption, fearing that moving too
swiftly could jeopardize cases.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of criminal action against officers has angered Parks,
who invited the FBI to join the investigation several weeks ago
without informing Garcetti.
</P>
<P>
   A March 8 letter Parks wrote to the district attorney's office
notes the Police Department's desire to bring swift prosecution of
officers accused of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''Continued delay endangers criminal prosecutions and our
department's administrative disciplinary procedures,'' Parks wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also outlined a new approach to the department's role
in the investigation, saying its top priority will be to give
material to the U.S. Attorney's office, which also recently entered
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti contends his office is the lead agency in the case.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Bill Lockyer and City Attorney Jim Hahn
issued separate statements Wednesday saying Parks has no legal
grounds to withhold material related to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer said the department's actions were ''unwarranted,
illegal and not in keeping with the collaborative spirit under
which this matter should proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Parks and the city Police Commission, Hahn said
he found no authority for the chief to refuse to cooperate with the
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn said Wednesday, however, that Parks told him he was
cooperating and that the district attorney overreacted.
</P>
<P>
   That was essentially what he said at his news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always been cooperative. It's our department that
brought the information to the district attorney,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   But he complained that Garcetti was taking too long with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have presented cases that we have documented that have been
in his offices for several months,'' he said, adding three cases in
which police asked Garcetti to bring criminal charges have
languished so long that the department now plans to reinvestigate
them and turn the findings over to both the U.S. attorney and the
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, who supported Parks' request to bring in
the FBI, said Wednesday he would try to mediate the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not going to pass judgment,'' he said. ''My job as chief
executive of this city is to get the parties together, to get them
to work together, to get Rampart behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   The finger-pointing is likely to increase public skepticism that
the investigating agencies can adequately root out the corruption,
said Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is really like a school-yard brawl where the adult
authorities have to come in and get everybody to cooperate,'' she
said.

<HEADLINE> Lightning 4, Rangers 4, Tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Brian Leetch's goal early in the third period
gave the New York Rangers a 4-4 tie Wednesday night against the
Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch fired a high 35-foot slap shot from the left side that
beat Rich Parent, who was down on the play.
</P>
<P>
   The point puts the Rangers in a tie with Montreal, Pittsburgh
and Carolina for seventh place in the Eastern Division. New York
has just 10 games remaining, while Montreal and Carolina have 12
and Pittsburgh 13.
</P>
<P>
   Theoren Fleury, Eric Lacroix and Valeri Kamensky also scored for
New York, which got 26 saves from back-up goalie Kirk McLean,
including a dynamite glove save on Pavel Kubina with 1:28 left in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Lecavalier and Paul Mara each had a goal and assist for
the Lightning, which earned consecutive points on the road for the
first time since Dec. 4 and 6. Dwayne Hay and Stan Drulia also
scored for Tampa Bay. Parent made 36 saves.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers continued a season long streak of not losing when
they've scored at least four goals, but the tie was the first after
21 straight wins. But earning only one point against Tampa Bay,
which has the second-fewest points in the NHL, hurts New York's
playoff chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning, who won at Montreal on Tuesday night, haven't won
consecutive road games since Feb. 7 and 25, 1998, both at
Washington. Tampa Bay hasn't beaten the Rangers in five games
(0-4-1).
</P>
<P>
   McLean started in place of Mike Richter, whose left knee swelled
up during Monday night's loss to Dallas. The Rangers recalled
Jean-Francois Labbe to serve as the backup.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning grabbed a 1-0 lead 68 seconds into the game when
Lecavalier scored his team leading 21st goal.
</P>
<P>
   Hay scored his first NHL goal at 5:40 off a backhanded
wraparound between McLean's pads for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers coach John Muckler called a time-out to yell at his
players. They responded 1:06 later when Fleury deflected in Mike
York's cross-ice pass.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix tied it at 12:06 when he tucked a loose puck behind
Parent for his third goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kamensky gave the Rangers the lead at 2:27 of the second,
tipping Stephane Quintal's right-point slap shot past Parent.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of power-play goals put Tampa back ahead. Drulia tied it
at 13:33 and then Mara put the Lightning up 4-3 at 16:37.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the Rangers best offensive line, the Czech line,
were injured during the game. Jan Hlavac strained his left hip
flexor late in the first period. Petr Nedved sustained bruised ribs
midway in the second. Neither player returned to the game.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Blast Kills 4 in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Sparks from a fireworks display apparently
fell on other fireworks, setting off an explosion that killed four
people, injured 15 and badly damaged a church on Wednesday,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's Notimex news agency quoted the Mexico State
attorney general's office as saying more than 1,700 fireworks blew
up in Santa Ana Jilotzingo during a religious festival celebrating
the end of a pilgrimage to a nearby shrine.
</P>
<P>
   It said eight of the injuries were serious, Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City television stations broadcast images of the badly
damaged church against which the fireworks had been kept -- two of
its walls blown out and an interior scarred by flying debris.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Ana Jilotzingo is about 15 miles west of Mexico City.

BYU 81, Bowling Green 54   
By TIM KORTE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVO, Utah (AP) -- Terrell Lyday scored 15 points, hitting
5-of-6 from 3-point range, and Michael Vranes added 14 points as
BYU beat Bowling Green 81-54 in the first round of the NIT on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars (21-10) won for the fifth time in their last six
games and will play next week against the winner of Thursday
night's game between Colorado and Southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling Green (22-8) came in as the nation's No. 3 shooting team
(49.8 percent), but BYU held the Falcons to 34 percent (9-of-26) in
building a 38-28 halftime lead. Bowling Green finished 32 percent
(17-of-52) from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Esterkamp led the Falcons with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Dakich wanted to see his team run after the Falcons
were lulled into a halfcourt game by Miami, Ohio, during a
first-round upset at the Mid-American Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But BYU showed it can run, too. The Cougars averaged 70.4 points
this season and, after the teams banged inside through the first
half, BYU took control with a 10-3 run over the last 3:48 before
the break.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, regular season champions in the MAC, grew
increasingly frustrated from the opening tip.
</P>
<P>
   Lyday heated up early in the second half, connecting three times
from 3-point range in the first 5:30 as BYU stretched the lead to
51-39. It was 55-40 with 11:33 left after an inside basket by Eric
Nielsen, who scored 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons gave up too many easy baskets and couldn't get much
going offensively, either.
</P>
<P>
   MAC player of the year Anthony Stacey, Bowling Green's leading
scorer at 17 points a game, was held to three first-half points and
finished with 11. The Falcons also had 17 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed nothing would go right for the Falcons. Vranes scored
on a putback with 6:16 to play, giving the Cougars a 62-46 lead,
after the ball went off the hands of three Bowling Green players.
</P>
<P>
   Mekeli Wesley added 13 points for BYU.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame 75, Michigan 65  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Troy Murphy scored 32 points -- 12 of
them at the free-throw line -- as Notre Dame beat Michigan 75-65
Wednesday night in the first round of the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Matt Doherty had worried earlier this week that
the Irish (19-14) would be sluggish after they were left out of the
NCAA tournament and were forced to accept an invitation to the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   But Notre Dame survived a physical final 49.6 seconds without
Murphy after his fifth foul and Michigan (15-14) down 69-64. Notre
Dame made it through a flurry of fouls by hitting 6-of-8 from the
foul line to secure the win.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame went up 60-51 with 9:37 left in the game after Jere
Macura hit a pair of free throws. But Michigan answered with a 9-2
run -- with Notre Dame's only points coming from Murphy, who pushed
the lead back to 66-60 on four straight free throws.
</P>
<P>
   A David Graves 3-pointer upped the lead to 69-61 before Michigan
pulled within 69-64 when Kevin Gaines hit one of two free throws
after Murphy's fifth foul. But the Wolverines couldn't get any
closer as the Irish hit their foul shots down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish finished 24-of-30 from the foul line, while the
Wolverines were 10-of-14.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, which lost 11 of its final 14 games, was led by LaVell
Blanchard with 14 points. Peter Vignier and Josh Asselin scored 12
points apiece for the Wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 33 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish will host Xavier (21-11) on Monday in the second
round.

By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday he
will press Japanese defense officials not to cut the $5 billion a
year the government pays to keep 47,000 American troops in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to us,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also demanded that the Japanese government take action to
stop what the U.S. Navy contends are dangerous levels of air
pollution spewing from a private incinerator located just outside
the gates of Atsugi Naval Air Facility, west of Tokyo, where about
3,000 U.S. sailors and their families live.
</P>
<P>
   ''It either has to be cleaned up or shut down,'' Cohen told
reporters after visiting Atsugi and looking at the puffs of smoke
rising from the incinerator Thursday. ''This is a serious matter
for the United States,'' he said because it poses a continuing risk
to the health of American servicemen and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to have action taken,'' he said, adding that he would
discuss the matter with senior Japanese government officials later
Thursday and hope to announce that a permanent solution has been
found.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters on Cohen's flight here from Ho Chi Minh
City, Vietnam, a senior aide told reporters on Wednesday that
Washington and Tokyo were on the verge of an agreement to address
the pollution problem.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Japan's Environment Agency said the levels of
carcinogenic dioxin were dangerously high near the Atsugi naval
facility, which is home to the air wing assigned to the USS Kitty
Hawk carrier battle group.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted last summer by the Japanese government and the
U.S. Navy found dioxin in concentrations 10 times the level deemed
acceptable by the Japanese government, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr.
James Graybeal said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said before Cohen's arrival in Japan that they
expected a ''comprehensive agreement'' to be announced Thursday
when Cohen meets with Tsutomu Kawara, chief of the Japanese Defense
Agency. The official declined to provide any details but said the
solution would be ''very expensive'' for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo newspaper The Daily Yomiuri reported in Thursday's
editions that Kawara said on a visit to the incinerator on
Wednesday, before Cohen arrived in Japan, that something must be
done to address the Americans' concerns, including the possibility
of the government taking over the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there may be a need to employ special measures to
solve the problem,'' the newspaper quoted Kawara as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said that the Pentagon is hopeful of reaching a new
five-year ''host nation support'' agreement by this summer, when
President Clinton will travel to Japan for an international summit
conference in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current deal, which expires in 2001, Japan pays about
$100,000 a year for every U.S. soldier, sailor, airman and Marine
based in Japan. That amounts to about $5 billion a year -- by far
the most generous financial support by any ally with American
forces on its soil.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also expects to discuss with Japanese officials his
three-day visit to Vietnam, which was the first by an American
defense secretary since before the Vietnam War ended 25 years ago.
Cohen flew here Wednesday from Ho Chi Minh City, known as Saigon
before the communist defeat of U.S.-backed South Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Symbolic Gun Control Victory  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On a day that both a Democratic president and
a Republican governor pushed for broad new gun controls,
long-stalled legislation won a symbolic victory in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 218-205 to urge House-Senate negotiators to meet
within two weeks. If they did, it would be their first session
since August.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Senate voted to institute 72-hour background
checks on gun show sales, but the House rejected that provision and
gun control has been stalled since then. The negotiators are to
resolve differences between the two bills.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the vote, 12 female members of Congress made an
emotional appeal at the White House for their colleagues to ignore
the National Rifle Association's opposition to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The moms of this country have had it,'' said Rep. Carolyn
McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was shot to death -- and her son
badly wounded -- on a commuter train six years ago. ''I'm tired of
the lies. ... We represent the people of the United States. The NRA
does not.''
</P>
<P>
   It is up to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the
House-Senate committee, to call a meeting. In a statement
Wednesday, Hatch did not address the two-week deadline but said he
was disappointed that President Clinton has ignored his suggestions
for bolstering enforcement of existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''To my knowledge, he has acted on none of these overdue
reforms,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, where Clinton spoke at a $550,000 fund-raising
dinner for the Democratic National Committee, White House aides
released a letter in which Clinton endorsed a bill in the Maryland
Legislature, which he said would ''make guns safer, and keep them
out of the hands of children and felons.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to events on Capitol Hill, he said: ''At last, earlier
today, the Republican leadership heeded my call to convene a
conference to come to agreement on common-sense gun legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends it increased federal gun
prosecutions by 25.3 percent -- up to 5,500 cases -- from 1998 to
1999, and that combined federal and state prosecutions of gun
charges led to 22 percent more criminals being imprisoned in 1996
than in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Still, approval of the House resolution constituted a rare
victory for gun control. The White House cheered the vote, saying
it revealed a crack in the NRA's armor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The NRA's influence on Republicans may be beginning to
break,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. In all, 46
Republicans supported the measure; 32 Democrats opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, New York Gov. George Pataki, ignoring the sentiment
of many fellow Republicans, called for a series of stiff gun
control measures in his state. They include making trigger locks
mandatory; taking ballistic ''fingerprints'' of guns, requiring
dealers and manufacturers to send to a state lab a test bullet and
shell casing from every handgun they sell in the state; raising the
age for handgun ownership from 18 to 21 and requiring instant
background checks of gun buyers at flea markets and gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, 100 religious leaders sent a letter to Congress
supporting Clinton's efforts to reduce gun violence, and the
National Opinion Research Center issued a study that said the 25
percent of Americans who own handguns are far outnumbered by the 37
percent who favor a handgun ban for all except ''police and other
authorized persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the House vote, Clinton was joined by 33 House
members -- including several Republicans -- in an East Room ceremony
where he released the first annual FBI report on the effectiveness
of instant background checks for gun purchases that began Nov. 30,
1998. The report found that the instant background checks had
stopped 179,000 prohibited gun sales through Dec. 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen female House members identified themselves as mothers
and grandmothers summoned women from around the nation to a
''Million Moms March'' against gun violence in Washington on
Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton repeated his complaint that the NRA has
stalled his gun bill with pressure tactics and an argument against
lengthier background checks that he said seemed as senseless as
opposing metal detectors and seat belts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taking a little time and a little inconvenience to save a lot
of lives is a good deal for America,'' Clinton said. ''Why should
this be the only area of our national life where we say no
prevention, only punishment?''
</P>
<P>
   In response, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said
the White House was trying to ''demonize'' the NRA to distract
attention from ''the complete collapse of enforcement'' of existing
gun laws by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''They try to focus on anything except what they are vulnerable
on,'' LaPierre said. ''What does a criminal have to fear from these
guys? Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends the NRA attack on gun
prosecutions misses the point. Federal policy is to keep the
biggest gun cases and refer lesser ones to state authorities, and
even so, the federal prosecutions rose 25.3 percent in one year, it
says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the administration says the Brady Act was designed
primarily to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, and more than
500,000 people have been denied guns under Brady since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Congress never provided the agents, prosecutors, judges or
prisons to prosecute everyone who tried to get a gun and was barred
from doing so because of Brady checks, and Attorney General Janet
Reno has said that prosecuting all of them would have swamped the
federal criminal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued Wednesday with House Democrats that a
compromise on gun safety issues was best worked out without the
political rhetoric of an open meeting. ''It is not a simple issue
that you can politicize,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans stood with Clinton, including the former
impeachment manager, Rep. Jim Rogan of California, who faces a
tough re-election fight.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco To Sell Alaska Assets  </HEADLINE>
By T.A. BADGER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC has revived its purchase
of Atlantic Richfield Co. by agreeing to sell off all of Arco's
assets in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. has agreed to buy the Alaska properties,
which include nearly 2 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, for
$7 billion, the companies said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission rejected the $27 billion BP
Amoco-Arco deal last month, saying it would give the combined
company too much clout in Alaska's oil fields and West Coast
gasoline markets heavily dependent on Alaska oil.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday the agency said it had shelved a lawsuit
challenging the BP Amoco-Arco deal, which would create the world's
second largest nongovernment oil company. The lawsuit had been
scheduled for trial Monday in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long and hectic road,'' Rodney Chase, BP Amoco's
deputy chief executive, said while announcing the Phillips deal in
Anchorage. ''Today it seems to me that the destination is clear and
in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the talks said Phillips' purchase would
likely resolve the most substantial FTC concerns about competition
in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of the substantial and constructive proposals made by
the defendants, all parties have agreed to seek adjournment of the
federal court proceedings,'' Richard Parker, director of the
agency's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   FTC lawyers must still determine whether Phillips can provide
the competition the agency considers necessary. BP Amoco produces
more than 400,000 barrels of oil in Alaska each day, roughly 40
percent of the state's output.
</P>
<P>
   Arco now produces about 325,000 barrels of oil a day in Alaska,
most of it from the huge Prudhoe Bay field.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., would get that
production, along with the lion's share of a 425-million-barrel
field due to start flowing later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska assets also include a 22 percent interest in the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline, nine oil tankers, a huge reservoir of
natural gas and more than 1 million acres of land for exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ''In looking at Arco's Alaska business, we see unlimited
potential,'' said Jim Mulva, Phillips chief executive. ''We intend
to be a very strong, independent competitor in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal is to combine Phillips' and Arco's plans to grow
production by aggressively pursuing exploration and development
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulva said Phillips would hire all of Arco's Alaska work force.
The original BP Amoco-Arco deal called for roughly 400 layoffs as
the combined company consolidated its Alaska operations.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, the nation's sixth-largest oil company, has been long
been active in Alaska. The company owns 70 percent of a liquefied
natural gas plant south of Anchorage that exports to Asia. The
company also owns a small piece of the Prudhoe Bay field.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips had 15,900 employees and $15 billion of assets at the
end of 1999.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hispanic students are twice as likely as blacks and three

ill-equipped to deal with the fastest-growing group of schoolchildren. Education
Secretary Richard Riley called for public school districts to create in the next

militants pose no danger to the U.S. president. Instead, the Pakistani
leadership has ordered the militants not to make provocative statements or
threats against the United States or rival India, against whom the groups are

   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Citing decades of ''mistreatment, discrimination and
prejudice,'' the state Legislature's only gay member pleaded today for support
of a bill allowing gays the equivalent of marriage. Spectators, some wearing
pink badges for the bill and others wearing white badges against it, packed the
state House as debate began. Both supporters and opponents say the bill would
provide more rights and benefits for same-sex couples than any other state in
the country. Backers said they believed they had enough votes to approve the
bill. The Democratic-controlled House voted 79-68 today to advance the bill for

the indictment filed today names ''John Doe,'' a man believed to be the East
Side rapist of Manhattan, and it was filed four days before the five-year
