PHILANTROPIC RED SOX GIVE AWAY LEAD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Carl Everett may play at one speed, but he loses
at another, which accounts for the long, measured walk he made from
center field after Sunday's 6-5, 12-inning loss to the Philadelphia
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Jordan's winning ground-rule double off reliever Rheal
Cormier long since had sailed over Everett's head and cleared the
fence on one carom off the Veterans Stadium carpet when the
outfielder finally made it to the visitor's dugout, with only
pigeons for company.
</P>
<P>
   He ate slowly, he showered slowly, he dressed slowly. And by the
time he finished writing out a check for the clubhouse attendant
and turned away from his cubicle, he was facing an
all-but-abandoned clubhouse. Lose five games in a row, as the Red
Sox have, including three straight here to a team whose record
suggests it's the worst in the National League, and no one is
inclined to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   Except for those charged with asking where it all went wrong.
They already had an inkling, of course. Try the eighth inning, when
Everett fell down on a line drive by Phillies rookie Pat Burrell,
who was credited with a double on the play and came around to score
the tying run on Desi Relaford's smash off the glove of second
baseman Jeff Frye.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be only one question you're waiting around to ask
me,'' said Everett. ``I just missed the ball. Game over.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, of course, had not yet lurched to its conclusion, 4
hours 3 minutes after it began. That wouldn't come until the 12th,
when Ron Gant led off by blooping a single off the end of his bat,
took second on a wild pitch by Cormier, and came across with the
winning run when Jordan launched his hit over Everett's head.
</P>
<P>
   But what had been a 5-0 Red Sox lead after their third at-bat,
one in which Everett climaxed a five-run uprising off Phillies ace
Curt Schilling with a three-run home run, his 19th of the season
and fifth in six games, disappeared with Everett face-down on the
rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I froze on it,'' Everett said of Burrell's line drive,
neglecting to add that when he finally did react, he turned the
wrong way at first. ``My feet got tangled up, and I missed it. I
should have made that play.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lowe was on the mound when Everett took his tumble. He was
the third of five Sox pitchers on an afternoon in which the
Phillies used seven and held the Sox scoreless on three singles
over the last nine innings. Lowe retired the next two batters,
Everett's strong arm keeping Burrell on third after Mickey
Morandini's flyout, but he wound up with a blown save when Frye's
dive wasn't enough to come up cleanly with Relaford's smash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been crazy,'' said Lowe, who has blown just two saves in
12 chances. ``I was one pitch away from getting out of that inning,
but I threw a 1-and-2 curveball to Relaford that didn't do much. It
hung over the middle of the plate, he hits it, and they score a
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team in general, we're obviously struggling. A team funk.
We've just got to go out there and get one win, but obviously one
win has been hard to come by lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefthander Jeff Fassero thought he'd be claiming one, after the
Sox staked him to that five-run lead. Instead, the Sox, who blew an
8-2 lead to Kansas City on Wednesday, failed to protect another big
edge while losing for the 10th time in their last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping to put an end to it today,'' Fassero said.
``We're not playing good baseball right now. It keeps going, and
we've got to get a win here somewhere. We've just got to get all
the bad stuff out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero, who had given up just three home runs in his first 10
starts, gave up three in three innings Sunday. Gant and Mike
Lieberthal, who hit two home runs on Saturday, hit solo homers in
the third. Burrell, a player Phillies fans view with the same
expectations of greatness they once had for a young Mike Schmidt,
made it a 5-4 game with a two-run homer in the fifth, his first in
front of the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero didn't beat himself up over the homers by Gant and
Burrell. Both hit pitches that were down and away. ``National
League baseball,'' Fassero said. ``I don't think they try to pull
balls as much in this league. I can live with those pitches. They
try to pull, and I've got two ground balls to short. Give them
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal hit what Fassero called a ``get-it-over slider'' on a
3-and-2 count, not a good pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies were back in it. The Sox, who hit just .175 over
the weekend while losing twice in extra innings sandwiched around a
9-3 blowout, never got another runner to third base. Phillies
center fielder Doug Glanville ran down six line drives, and made a
difficult backhand catch of Brian Daubach's deep slice with Frye
aboard on a walk in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Sox' last three hits were pinch singles by Nomar
Garciaparra and Mike Stanley. Garciaparra, after playing seven
games in a row after coming off the DL, was given the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't matter,'' Garciaparra said about sitting out. ``We
should have won, regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   So now it's on to Florida, and a three-night set with the
Marlins, another supposed NL bottom-feeder. The Phillies had been
swept five times this spring. They hadn't swept anyone until this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to win every game,'' Everett said. ``But they have a
team over there that can hit. A lot of people underestimate those
guys because of their record. But I played against them. Those guys
can hit. They're never out of a game.''

TO PREVAIL, BRIGHTEST STARS MUST COME OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars are old, and they're beginning to look it,
and in lieu of a plastic surgeon nipping here and tucking there,
Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock has little left in his makeover kit but
to hurry a hobbled Jamie Langenbrunner into the lineup Monday night
for Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Finals at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' said the affable Hitchcock, ``things change
significantly now.''
</P>
<P>
   The unstated qualifier there is that Hitchcock hopes things
change significantly now.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have his Stars on the run. Perhaps better stated, the
Devils have the defending Cup champs too often standing still and
looking to score from the outside. New Jersey moved to a 2-1 lead
in the best-of-seven series Saturday night with a 2-1 win because,
for the most part, too many of the Stars' big players looked like
they wanted to score with their reputations rather than their hard
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``For offensive chances,'' Hitchcock bluntly added, ``(the
Devils) make you pay a healthy price to get in those areas to
score. At the end of the day, you are going to have to decide
whether the Cup and the accolades that go with it (are) worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Late-night hockey fans might remember where Brett Hull was when
he scored the triple-overtime Cup winner against the Sabres last
spring. Buffalo fans still tiptoe through insomnia each night with
Hull's image flashing in a haunting red scroll across their bedroom
ceilings. One of the game's great snipers, known for his blistering
slappers, Hull knocked in the winner with one of his toes in the
crease. He sensed the moment, risked getting clobbered, and
delivered the biggest goal of his life with one of his smallest
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time for Hull and Cup brothers Joe Nieuwendyk and Mike
Modano to get reacquainted with the ugly, sometimes grotesque art
of the inside game. If they don't, they'll be headed outside
following Game 4. They now know for certain that they're not going
to will their way to a win.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the front of the net isn't any fun against the Devils,
but frankly, it's easier than fighting through the Stars' back
line. Devils defensemen Scott Stevens and Ken Daneyko like to
bounce bodies _ you might remember Stevens's smackdown on Eric
Lindros a little over a week ago _ but the likes of Richard
Matvichuk, Darryl Sydor, Derian Hatcher, and Dave Manson deliver
even more of a wallop.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Arnott snaked his way through on a defensive lapse to
score first for the Devils in Game 1, but for the most part, the
Stars don't allow much inside heat on goalie Eddie Belfour. The
Stars were able to gain the zone with offensive rushes, but too
often didn't land a shot on net, or muscled up some weak imitation
of a scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent some good time in the offensive zone,'' said
Stars forward Scott Thornton, cousin of Bruin Joe Thornton. ``We
just really haven't created a lot of good scoring chances in front
of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   The key player to change that approach is Nieuwendyk, last
year's Conn Smythe winner as the postseason MVP. Modano and Hull
always will be considered skill players, able to change a game's
momentum with their crafty touch and clever shots. But the
33-year-old Nieuwendyk essentially is the fullback in the Stars'
attack, the guy who relies on creating havoc down low with his
speed and size, crashing and banging.
</P>
<P>
   The Modano-Hull-Jere Lehtinen combination often ignites the
Dallas offense, but a truly effective Stars attack has Nieuwendyk's
line (likely with Langenbrunner and Thornton Monday night)
continuing the first-line momentum and following up with good
scoring chances. For the first three games of this series, it just
hasn't been there. And for the record, the Stars didn't make any of
their big-name players, including Hull, Modano, and Nieuwendyk,
available Sunday to the media. It gave the appearance that they
were being shielded from the media's scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, meanwhile, deftly worked the room. He was asked how
he felt about suggestions in the press that his team is worn out.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Hitchcock, whose appearance and delivery make him a
modern-day Captain Kangaroo, ``(the local media) are probably tired
of covering us. They want to get on with the Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   A noted Civil War buff, Hitchcock was asked if he felt he was
now defending Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, is it burning?'' he said with a chuckle. ``I prefer
to think we are on the march to Savannah.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they march? Do they run? Do they stand resolute? To think
that they could lose Monday night and still recover to win three
straight is virtually unimaginable. If the Stars have a last stand,
they have to make it Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body becomes irrelevant,'' said Hitchcock, talking of the
sacrifice he now must see from his tired, aging bunch of champions.
``Our players know that feeling and we feel like we can go to that
(mind-set). It is an awful hard way to have to play. But there
isn't much time left in the season . . . this opposition is as
strong as anybody we have ever seen in our lives _ and we are going
to have to go there now.''

STUCK ON STORIES OF RUBIN, DE LOS RIOS 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Rossana De Los Rios's wonderful ride melted away
drearily Sunday as she came unstuck in the grayness of a twilight
drizzle. Chanda Rubin wonders if she can find ``the glue'' to hold
her in the saddle and keep riding.
</P>
<P>
   A few more points would have done it for De Los Rios, the
racket-packin' mama who has seemed to materialize from some
mysterious kingdom (hello, Paraguay) as the unlikeliest of French
Open combatants. A few more points would have made a minimum
$40,000 difference for this young matron whose husband is out of
work, and whose cramping legs would not work in the closing minutes
of her gutsy bid for the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   She would have been only the second qualifier to go so far.
Instead, a strong 17-year-old Spaniard, Marta Marrero, gained that
honor by cutting through De Los Rios's serve in the concluding game
to win, 4-6, 6-0, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dream to be back here,'' said De Los Rios in Spanish.
Shrugging, she shook her head, wiggling the bleached ponytail that
stretches down her back. ``I tried everything to win. I broke her
in the next-to-last game, but I did not have enough. But I was back
here. I can still play. I will play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, the lone Paraguayan female tennis player ever
to appear on the international scene, De Los Rios won the French
junior title. ``Then I got tired of it. I married, had the child,
didn't play for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, at 24, she chipped away the deep layoff rust,
polished the weaponry, and beat the bushes for enough computer
points to pry her way into the qualifying tourney. Then came seven
matches in 10 days. The last one was too much.
</P>
<P>
   Plugging away in a white dress and with the soulful face of a
madonna, De Los Rios fought every inch of the way, fending off the
inevitable with a sturdy forehand _ and, most of all, corrazon.
``Si,'' she said as she tapped her chest and smiled, ``Si.
Corrazon.'' Heart.
</P>
<P>
   While she played, her 3-year-old daughter, Anna Paola, armed
with an ample supply of lollipops, played with daddy in the damp,
chilly grandstand of Court 1. Sometimes Anna Paola watched working
mama at toil she did not understand. Baby, of course, would need
new pairs of shoes, and mama's $40,000 check would help for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   Another 24-year-old, Rubin, out of Carencro, La., also knows
what it's like to be away from the game, and worry that she never
would regain her touch. She is better known, and far more affluent
than De Los Rios, having won more than $2 million in her career to
De Los Rios's $145,000. Rubin made the semis of the Australian Open
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Low woman in the US triumvirate taking up space in the
quarterfinals, No. 25 Rubin beat Natasha Zvereva, 6-4, 7-5. That
was a follow-up on her elimination of No. 7 Nathalie Tauziat. Her
compatriots: No. 3 Monica Seles, 7-5, 6-3, over Amelie Mauresmo;
No. 4 Venus Williams, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, over Anke Huber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chanda's finding the glue,'' said her easygoing coach,
Benny Sims. Under his guidance for the last two years, she appears
to be divining the path back to the Top 10, where she resided (No.
6) for a while four years ago. ``What I mean by glue is structure,
discipline on big points, knowing how to construct the points. It's
what everybody else calls focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurrah, a word to replace tired, overworked ``focus.'' A welcome
contribution from Sims, who did a decade as teaching pro at the
Sportsmen's Tennis Club in Dorchester and Longwood Cricket Club in
Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chanda needs to have that glue all the time. She's coming
close, but she's also found out about fear. You see, here is a
woman who had been No. 1 in her age groups since she was 11, when I
first saw her in a kids tournament. She did nothing wrong. When I
saw her I was excited. Right away I phoned my friend, Arthur Ashe,
and said, `You won't believe it but I've seen a little black girl
from Louisiana who can do it all.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur was very encouraging. He followed her career from afar.
So did Venus and Serena (Williams). They were kids watching her on
TV. When they moved up there were three blacks in the top 20. Never
happened before.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then the fear came in, Chanda's first injury. A sort of
loss of innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said, ``I was misdiagnosed as having tendinitis of my
right wrist. It was eventually found to be a broken bone in the
hand, a small stress fracture that required surgery. That removed
me from the Olympic team. When I thought I was recovered, I wasn't
hitting my forehand _ my best shot _ the same way. I was
frustrated, lost my confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad that she went down to the bush league to try to
straighten herself out, get a few wins. She couldn't hit a ball
over the net. ``I was seeded No. 1 at Midland (Mich.), and lost in
the first round, 6-0, 6-3, to somebody I can't even remember
(Alexandra Olsza).
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   She was so pitiful that a local sportswriter accused her of
tanking the match.
</P>
<P>
   She got a break when she and her family, who had known Sims for
a long time, phoned for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been with me since Berlin in the spring of '98,'' Rubin
said. ``Benny's a walking encyclopedia. He knows everything about
the game. I've learned so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims said, ``I think I provide a comfort zone. I knew how she
had played and I think I've helped restore her concepts of the
game. She reminds me so much of Arthur, very placid and controlled
outwardly, but a fiery competitor within. You never forget the
fear, the worry that your game has gone. But you do learn to deal
with it. Glue helps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' said Rubin, ``I've got the chance I've wanted. It's
been four years since I've gotten this far in a major, and I get to
play Martina Hingis. That's opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   De Los Rios found hers again in Paris. Even greater opportunity
beckons Rubin _ if she sticks to Hingis with the glue.

BRISBY HOPES IT'S CATCHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Time has passed quickly for Patriots wide
receiver Vincent Brisby, who is entering his eighth year in the
National Football League. He's ninth all-time on the team's
receptions list with 217 _ for 3,142 yards (a 14.5 average) _ and
he has 14 touchdown catches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy, I feel fortunate, and I look forward to doing
it again,'' said the 6-foot-3-inch, 193-pounder who had 18 catches
for 266 yards last season after being inactive four of the first
five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't seem like seven years, going on eight,
though,'' he said. ``I'm a tough competitor and I'll continue to do
the thing that got me here. It's still amazing, I could have had a
lot more catches with all the injuries I've had. Hopefully, my
number of catches will move higher in the next couple of seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby, who earns approximately $2 million a year in a contract
that concludes after the 2001 season, wasn't happy with his playing
time last season. One of his best games came against Buffalo (4
catches for 45 yards).
</P>
<P>
   He also hopes the fact that he had no touchdown grabs last
season was an aberration. ``I don't think about it. Last year is
over as far as I'm concerned,'' he said. ``I'm just concerned about
this season.''
</P>
<P>
   So, with the team now coached by Bill Belichick, Brisby is
working as hard as he can, including at this week's minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get in the best shape of my career and trying to
help us win games,'' said Brisby, who attended Northeast Louisiana.
``We have a whole different coaching staff and the opportunities
are going to be a lot better for me this year. I'm going to try to
capitalize on them and get back to playing the way I can and
contribute at the level I should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby likes what Belichick brings. ``He's a great guy; he's
definitely the type of coach we need around here,'' the receiver
said. ``He's a straight-up guy. There's no guesswork concerning
him; you pretty much know where you are. He gives you an
opportunity, telling you where you are, and he lets you go from
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The double sessions we're going through are always tough. He's
trying to get us better each day and I'm trying to separate myself
from the other guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby tries to catch every ball thrown to him, in games and
practices. ``I get upset anytime, even if I don't get open,'' he
said. ``Anytime something goes wrong with me doing something, I get
upset. I'm a competitor in all phases.''
</P>
<P>
   Concentration is the key, said Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just need to concentrate on it, by doing a lot of drills,
by catching a lot of balls, but the main thing is to watch the ball
come in and not look up,'' he said. ``You have to keep your eyes on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The salary cap is a factor for the Patriots, and Brisby's $2
million could solve some problems if he is jettisoned. But the
receiver doesn't think in those terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get ready to play, that's the only thing I can
do,'' he said. ``All the other stuff is going to take care of
itself. That's not what I'm here for.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly being cut ``is just part of the game,'' he said. ``If
that's the problem, it's not in my control. The only thing I can do
is what I do on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby has made it a point to attend most of the offseason
workouts. ``I've been here 95 percent of the time, just getting
ready and looking to be a vital part of the starting lineup and
playing very well on any given Sunday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brisby believes his nagging injuries haven't allowed him to be
more of a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say what I have to say when I have to,'' he said. ``My role
is more on the field, though. I've never really been a vocal guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as Brisby keeps catching passes, that will do the job.

PATRIOTS NOT YEST IN EXCELLENT POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ ``Look around, position by position,'' a pro
scout said early last week. ``Is there excellence at every
position? If there is, the team has a great chance of going deep
into the playoffs. If not, it's likely to be a mediocre year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' the scout added, ``there's always the St. Louis
Rams. At this time last year, if you went around their team you
wouldn't have seen too many areas of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Excellence is a subjective term.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who recently completed a mandatory minicamp, do
have excellence at some positions _ quarterback and linebacker _
and are good at some positions, such as wide receiver and defensive
back. But there are positions riddled with questions, mainly the
offensive and defensive lines, where games are won and lost.
</P>
<P>
   As new coach Bill Belichick often says in the days before
training camp, ``If we had to line up and play, we could.'' Those
aren't exactly reassuring words. And Belichick said Saturday it was
too early to tell whether his offensive line has made any progress.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is hard to tell whether Max Lane, Adrian Klemm, or
Grant Williams can replace Bruce Armstrong, who played very well
the first half of last season before his knee problems became a
factor. A strong left tackle is crucial to the health and
well-being of franchise quarterback Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots still have Lane and Todd Rucci (right guard), who
played in the Super Bowl, and a potential building block in Damien
Woody, who had a strong rookie season at center.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there's Williams, who had problems handling the
rush in Seattle last year; guard-center Lance Scott, a free agent
from the New York Giants who is recovering from knee surgery;
Derrick Fletcher, a 6-foot-6-inch 350-pounder who is being tested
at left guard but is unproven; backup center/guard Jason Andersen;
and right tackle Ed Ellis, who must prove he's serious about
football after his NFL Europe debacle. There's also Greg
Robinson-Randall, a fourth-round pick out of Michigan State who may
become a factor as a tackle and push Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   The line is unsettled except for Woody and Rucci. Rucci could be
a salary cap dump, but that is unlikely. Lane could wind up at left
tackle or back at guard.
</P>
<P>
   Could it all come together? Certainly more far-fetched things
have happened. Could it also be uglier than last year, when the
team allowed 58 sacks? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Belichick is switching to a 3-4 alignment.
</P>
<P>
   Willie McGinest has played all over the field, from a
pass-rushing defensive end to a cover linebacker, and he will run
the gamut in Belichick's schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The linemen are Chad Eaton, Brandon Mitchell, Henry Thomas, Jeff
Marriott, Jon Harris, Dave Nugent, and Greg Spires.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is firmly entrenched in Belichick's doghouse for skipping
the voluntary portion of minicamp. As it turned out, Belichick had
only a two-day mandatory camp, canceling Sunday's activity because
of personal business.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas never has played Belichick's two-gap style and has said
he doesn't care for it. Eaton has been all business and has been
challenged by the coach to return to his form of two years ago. He
has gotten into tremendous shape.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, at 6-7, is a physical specimen who was slowed during
minicamp by a hamstring problem. A former No. 1 pick of the
Philadelphia Eagles out of Virginia, he never has lived up to that
promise. But he is a strong man who has refocused on conditioning
and this will be a make-or-break season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have patiently waited for great things from
Mitchell, who likely will line up on the outside. So far, he's
shown flashes of brilliance, but has been more inconsistent than
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Spires always has had to prove his size (6-1, 260) does not hurt
his effectiveness in the NFL. For him to stick, he'll have to be an
exceptional pass rusher and improve in stopping the run.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick rarely answers a question directly, even one as simple
as whether he believes there are specific areas on the field he
thinks need improvement.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious the lines are such places, and as the free agency
period continues, the Patriots may seek help.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, there is no telling what type of a team Belichick
will have in September. But it appears there will be an exhaustive
search for ``excellence.''

WRIGHT DOES NOT WRONG IN REVOLUTION DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ After four-plus years of searching for a
viable identity, the Revolution appear to be finally making
progress. The debut of Mauricio Wright during a 2-0 victory over
Miami Saturday displayed the possibilities of a team that could,
for the first time, have an effective blend of style and substance,
experience and youth.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution games will feature fighting spirit and hard tackles,
but also backheels and fantasy, a composed passing game, plus
athleticism and speed. The game should become less chaotic, appear
more effortless. And the Revolution should be versatile enough to
survive a kick-fest, which could occur as early as Saturday, when
they host San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the first half against Miami, Wright captured the
imagination of the 16,139 spectators at Foxboro Stadium with a
backheel pass to avoid the pressure of Brazilian striker Welton.
This was a rare feat for a Revolution player, especially a
defender, and it symbolized the team's renewed confidence.
</P>
<P>
   There were too many spaces in the Revolution defense in the
first half, and they will continue to appear while Wright and his
teammates become acquainted. But the Revolution seem capable of
compensating for their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wright isn't afraid to play the ball with his feet,''
goalkeeper Jeff Causey said. ``He's a playmaker on the back line,
plus he's another big guy (6 feet 2 inches), and that helps on set
pieces. He can hold the ball a little more, so we don't panic and
just boot it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our confidence is high and we are on a roll. If we do go down
a goal we don't panic and hang our heads like last year. We know we
can get a goal back.''
</P>
<P>
   Said midfielder Ted Chronopoulos, who scored the first goal in
the 72d minute: ``Wright is not afraid to come out of the back with
the ball, so you have to be ready to cover for him. This game was
more fluid than in the past because we were playing through
Mauricio Ramos and Leonel Alvarez. You know (Ramos) is going to get
you the ball, it's a matter of finishing. If we put shots on net we
are going to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright made a symbiotic link with midfielders Alvarez and Ramos,
who play a similar style and are at the heart of coach Fernando
Clavijo's transformation of the Revolution. They will have to find
a way to differentiate between the two Mauricios, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wright adds another dimension,'' striker Wolde Harris said.
``We have been working on possession a lot in practice. You have to
be able to keep the ball or guys will be on you right away. The way
we want to play, guys have to be confident on the ball and have fun
with the game. And to play that way, you have to be confident of
the people behind you and not be worried they are going to cuss you
out or not cover for you if you make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Republic of Ireland team, which tied Mexico, 2-2, in Dallas
Sunday and will play against the US at Foxboro Stadium Tuesday, is
a young group. Fulham defender Terry Phelan and Sunderland striker
Niall Quinn are the only holdovers from the starting lineup that
played to a 1-1 tie with the US before a crowd of more than 51,000
June 9, 1991, at Foxboro Stadium. ``It is a team in transition with
some very good young players,'' said Aidan Cochran, a Football
Association of Ireland executive.

BOTH TONY AWARDS FOR DIRECTING GO TO MICHAEL BLAKESMORE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a first for a director, Michael Blakemore won a
doubleheader on Sunday night, capturing Tony Awards as the best
director of both a play and a musical at the 54th annual ceremony
honoring the best of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Blakemore won for the revival of Cole Porter's musical ``Kiss
Me, Kate'' and for Michael Frayn's play ``Copenhagen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago the British director was also nominated twice,
although he won neither for the musical ``City of Angels'' nor for
the play ``Lettice and Lovage'' that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is, `Thank you, America,''' Blakemore said on
Sunday night in one of his acceptance speeches during the awards at
Radio City Music Hall. ``And of course by America I mean New York,
and by New York I mean Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the triumph of Blakemore's two productions, ``Kiss Me,
Kate'' won the Tony for best musical revival and ``Copenhagen'' won
for best play. ``Copenhagen,'' which deals with nuclear physics,
was a striking venture for a Broadway increasingly known for
playing it safe with splashy musicals.
</P>
<P>
   Also significant was the choice of ``Contact'' as best musical
of the season, marking a dramatic shift in the definition of the
American musical. A dance show performed to recorded music with no
original score or live singing and little dialogue, ``Contact'' had
generated considerable controversy in the last few weeks over
whether it should qualify as a musical.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Goldstein, the executive director of the Theater
Development Fund, which runs TKTS and theater support programs,
resigned from the Tony nominating committee to protest the show's
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians' union, Local 802, also objected on the grounds
that no music had been created for the production and no newly
created musical performance occurs in the production.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of the Lincoln Center
Theater, which produced ``Contact,'' has dismissed such critics as
``forces of darkness.'' But in his acceptance speech on Sunday
night, Gersten simply paid tribute to the cast of ``Contact,''
calling the dancers ``the true acrobats of the gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stroman won for best choreography for ``Contact.'' She
found herself competing against herself for best choreography and
best direction of a musical, since she did both for ``Contact'' and
for ``The Music Man.''
</P>
<P>
   In accepting the choreography award, she honored her husband,
the director Mike Ockrent, who died of cancer in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dance has lifts and dips and unexpected turns, just as real
life does,'' she said. ``Had I not fallen in love with Mike
Ockrent, I could not have written `Contact.'''
</P>
<P>
   The cast of ``Contact'' also fared well at the awards. Boyd
Gaines, saying that ``the Tonys have been very good to me,''
accepted the third Tony Award of his career for his performance as
a depressed ad executive who finds redemption through dance.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ziemba, competing against fellow cast member Deborah
Yates, won for her portrayal of a repressed housewife in another
segment of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stoppard's ``The Real Thing'' had a big night, beating out
``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' ``The Price'' and ``Amadeus'' for
best revival. Among the producers on stage to accept the Tony was
Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films; ``The Real Thing'' marked the
first time the movie company had helped back a Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   A star of the play, Jennifer Ehle, won for best performance by a
leading actress in a play, beating out her mother, Rosemary Harris,
who was nominated for her performance in Noel Coward's ``Waiting in
the Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehle's co-star, Stephen Dillane, also won the Tony, in a
competitive category that included Gabriel Byrne of ``Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' David Suchet of ``Amadeus'' and the two actors who
alternate roles in ``True West,'' Philip Seymour Hoffman and John
C. Reilly. The producers of ``True West'' unsuccessfully tried to
get the two actors in the Sam Shepard play to be considered jointly
so that they would not compete against each other or cancel each
other out.
</P>
<P>
   The award for best original score went to Elton John for
``Aida.'' The award was something of a consolation prize, given
that the Disney show was not nominated for best musical. In what
may have been a response to this slight, John did not attend the
awards ceremony. Nor did the lyricist, Tim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Headley, the star of ``Aida,'' won the Tony for best
performance by a leading actress in a musical. In her speech,
Headley thanked Disney, which had previously chosen her to play
Nala in ``The Lion King.'' ``I love you so much,'' she said. ``And
I'll work for you for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida,'' with its contemporary renditions of ancient Egypt,
also won for best scenic design (Bob Crowley) and for lighting
design (Natasha Katz).
</P>
<P>
   In presenting the award for best costume design, Dame Edna
Everage planted two big kisses on Martin Pakledinaz, who won for
``Kiss Me, Kate.'' Pakledinaz tried to keep a straight face _
despite its lipstick marks _ during his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me, Kate'' also won for orchestrations (Don Sebesky). And
Brian Stokes Mitchell won the Tony for his performance as the male
lead in the show.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For his performance as a curmudgeonly farmer father in the
revival of Eugene O'Neill's ``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' Roy
Dotrice won the Tony for best performance by a featured actor in a
play.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Brown won for her performance in ``Copenhagen.'' Like the
director, Blakemore, Brown thanked the producers for their bravery
in producing a play with such complex subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dead'' won the award for best book of a musical for
Richard Nelson. The award was bittersweet given that the show _
unable to survive a drop in ticket sales _ has already closed on
Broadway, although it will be produced at the Ahmanson Theater in
Los Angeles in July and then tour the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's presenters were Kelsey Grammer, Susan Lucci,
Kathie Lee Gifford, Jack Wagner and Carol Burnett, all television
stars who appeared on Broadway this season or are about to _
Grammer is to open in ``Macbeth'' on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Al Pacino, Matthew Broderick and Bebe Neuwirth also presented
awards, as did Patrick Stewart, who is currently starring in ``The
Ride Down Mount Morgan'' by Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Tony producers were clearly relieved to have Rosie O'Donnell
back as host _ along with the comedic talents of Nathan Lane as
``special guest star'' _given that ratings dropped without the
popular talk show host last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's nominees, announced on May 8, were selected by a
24-member committee. The 705 Tony voters, comprising theater
professionals and journalists, cast ballots in 21 categories.
</P>
<P>
   The Tonys are presented by the American Theater Wing, which
founded the Tonys in 1947 and runs theater education programs, and
the League of American Theaters and Producers, which represents
Broadway producers.
</P>
<P>
   The first hour of the ceremony, broadcast on PBS, included a
special Tony Award for regional theater, a grant of $25,000, which
went to the nonprofit Utah Shakespearean Festival of Cedar City.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining two hours of the presentation were shown on CBS
and featured the presentation of 12 awards.
</P>
<P>
   A special Tony Award for lifetime achievement in the theater was
given to the producer T. Edward Hambleton, founder of the Phoenix
Theater. Another special award was given to ``Dame Edna: The Royal
Tour,'' Barry Humphries's one-man/one-woman show at the Booth
Theater. After greeting the crowd with her trademark ``Hello,
Possums'' in presenting the award for best costume design, Dame
Edna said, ``I'm the only Broadway show to be closing
voluntarily.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Tony honors for excellence in the theater were
given to the actress Eileen Heckart, who has been nominated for two
Tony Awards in the past and recently starred in ``The Waverly
Gallery'' Off Broadway; Sylvia Herscher, a theatrical agent and
manager; and ``Encores!,'' the seven-year-old series at City
Center.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After winning Game 3 of what will rank as one of
the more memorable Western Conference finals, Los Angeles Lakers
coach Phil Jackson declared that with another loss the Portland
Trail Blazers would ``be at death's door.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that Jackson, along with a lot of us media hacks, was
wrong. But his forecast did bring attention to the concept of
death's door _ a place that was visited by both sides Sunday in
Game 7 at Staples Center so often that the NBA could have begun a
frequent-flier program.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half, the Lakers were mostly dead.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third, the Blazers died.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, it was the Lakers who had a big coronary.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the fourth quarter, the Blazers gave up the death
rattle _ one of the more spectacular, untimely and grievous swoons
in recent sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Squandering a 15-point fourth-quarter lead, they became the
Frail Blazers, and the Lakers came from apparently sincere deadness
to the Western championship.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Finals against Indiana won't begin until Wednesday,
which is good because after the improbable 89-84 result, it will
take a while to digest just how the Lakers are in it and the
Blazers are not.
</P>
<P>
   For seven of the final eight quarters of this stirring series,
the Blazers confounded the Lakers at every turn. They won Game 6
Friday in Portland by smothering the game's most valuable player,
Shaquille O'Neal, and Sunday were winning Game 7 in the same
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   They wiped out the Lakers' crowd with an 18-2 run in a
third-quarter burst of brilliant, balanced offense, just as they
had Friday in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Then without warning, the Blazers turned leaden as the Northwest
winter sky. Rasheed Wallace missed six shots in a row. Scottie
Pippen disappeared. Arvydas Sabonis fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if they realized they were wiping out the best team in
the NBA on national TV, and suddenly grew dizzy from the height.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have gotten better shots,'' said an aggrieved
Portland coach, Mike Dunleavy. ``Maybe they wore us down. Maybe we
were tired down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Tired? The team with the deepest bench in the league? The team
with everyone mostly healthy? The team that had already done the
heavy lifting, coming back from a 1-3 deficit to force this
decider?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, they were tired. Tempting as it is to attribute
everything to a pressure-induced choke (and there was some of
that), they were as tired as were the Lilliputians from strapping
down Gulliver.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Neal, making eye contact with Kobe Bryant driving the
lane inside the final minute, took his lob almost at the top of the
backboard and thrust it through the shivering iron, the
difference-maker delivered the explanation on the slim difference
between the Lakers and Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   As former Huskies and Cougars coach Marv Harshman used to say,
when everyone else is tired in the fourth quarter, the big fella is
still seven feet.
</P>
<P>
   And this particular big fella, thwarted though he was for the
last two games, had a passion lit in him. If it still burns in this
next fortnight, the Pacers might want to consult their insurance
brokers about paid-up premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, former Lakers great and part-owner Magic
Johnson was holding forth for a group of reporters. He works out
occasionally with O'Neal and was describing things the center would
tell only another man of his playing stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he wants it,'' Johnson said. ``He wants it bad. He
wants that loser label off his back.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, as Michael Jordan before him, was often derided as a
great scorer who couldn't deliver a championship. Despite his
immensity and skills, he had brought his team to the Finals only
once before, in 1994, when the Orlando Magic was swept by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In four years in L.A., his teams never came close. The loser
label was starting to become as permanent as his Superman tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   The brand was fairly glowing in the fourth quarter until the
Lakers clamped down on the withering Blazers and started finding
ways to beat the irritating double-teams.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a shooter, reserve Brian Shaw, stepped up to take some
pressure off by hitting three treys in the final 16 minutes. The
Blazers' strategy to slough off at power forward and shooting guard
and onto O'Neal was coming apart.
</P>
<P>
   During a timeout as the gap closed and the frenzy built, Jackson
exhorted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil said, `We've come too far to blow it. Let's fight, let's
claw, let's hit shots.' I said I'm going to kick it out so make me
look good,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   After his epic dunk for an 85-79 lead, O'Neal ran down the court
almost childlike, eyes wide and index fingers thrust toward the
vibrating masses.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't yet won his ring, but he had won a game nearly as
large as him, in a fashion almost as stupendous.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had beaten a splendid nemesis in a way almost
inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicable, except for him.

LAKERS SAVE THEIR BEST FOR LAST TO ELIMINATE TRAIL BLAZERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)  By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant were moments from
suffering the most devastating playoff loss of their careers, a
defeat so agonizing for the young stars that it would take only a
National Basketball Association title to live it down.
</P>
<P>
   But something miraculous happened at the Staples Center on
Sunday night, something neither their fed-up legions nor the
Portland Trail Blazers expected.
</P>
<P>
   In the crucible of the Western Conference finals, they grew up
and played like champions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers came back from a
16-point deficit and beat the Blazers, 89-84, before nearly 19,000
people in yellow T-shirts who watched in stunned disbelief as the
final buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The end came so suddenly for Portland, which did not score a
basket during a 7-minute-30-second stretch in the fourth quarter
and failed to become the seventh team in league history to rebound
from a 3-1 series deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you live for,'' said Bryant, whose 25 points, 11
rebounds, 7 assists and 4 blocked shots led the Lakers. ``These are
the backyard-type of situations you dream about when you're young.
Two minutes to go. Game on the line. Tie score.''
</P>
<P>
   With O'Neal unable to get free inside for most of the evening,
Bryant had the defining game of his career. With the game tied at
79-79, Bryant made two free throws with 1 minute 34 seconds left
and then sank a 16-footer from the left wing with 1:09 remaining to
push the lead to 4.
</P>
<P>
   After Rasheed Wallace missed two free throws with 1:25 left,
Bryant drove the middle of the lane and at the last possible second
lofted an alley-oop pass for his 7-foot-1-inch, 330-pound teammate.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who scored 9 of his 18 points in the final period,
caught the ball with his right hand, cocked it back and dunked it
maliciously _ a basket that made the score 85-79 with 41.3 seconds
left and turned the arena into a state of extended delirium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Shaq dropped out of the roof when he threw that
down,'' said Rick Fox, the Laker forward. ``Just devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   That dunk officially sent the Lakers into the NBA finals, where
they will play host to Indiana in Game 1 on Wednesday. But how
close they came to vacationing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw made it possible. The reserve guard hit two pivotal
3-pointers during 15-0 run in the quarter, including one from the
left wing with 4:02 remaining that severely damaged Portland's
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   That shot tied the game at 75-75 and sent the building into a
tizzy. Shaw, traded by the Blazers to Houston as a minor piece in
the deal for Scottie Pippen last summer, was picked up by the
Lakers after the Rockets released him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ironic, huh?'' he said in the post-game locker room, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   He had some inspiration. O'Neal pulled some of his teammates
aside after Coach Phil Jackson spoke to the team between the third
and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them, `We've come too far to let this thing just end
like this,''' he said. ``I said: `Let's fight, let's scratch, let's
claw and let's play. Let's play.' That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. He also mentioned that the Blazers were not going
to let him shoot, so he was going to have to rely on his teammates
more by distributing the ball to open shooters when he was double-
and triple-teamed near the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Brian Shaw looked at me and said, `Yeah, just like
Orlando.' When he said, `Just like Orlando,' I knew his shot was
going to be on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers trailed by 75-59, mostly because Wallace, who led the
Blazers with 30 points, and Steve Smith could not miss from the
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal picked up his third foul with 6:18 left in the second
quarter, swinging his elbows as he tried to create space for
himself around Arvydas Sabonis. Rather than frustrate him, though,
it made him focus and play more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant played 48 minutes on a sprained right foot in Game 6 on
Friday. If he was sore, the Lakers were hurting worse. Struggling
badly, the Lakers needed Bryant to be superhuman. He was not, but
his 12 points, defense (3 blocks) and rebounding (6) were enough to
keep the Lakers in the game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the pressure was on any one player, it was on O'Neal to
deliver in only the second Game 7 he has ever played.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson, who directed the Lakers to their last title in
1988 and now serves as a team vice president and part owner, sensed
the feeling building. ``He needs this so people don't look at him
as a loser,'' Johnson said. ``This is his time. Everyone knows
it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal came late to that realization. He finally dived for a
loose ball with less than nine minutes left in the third quarter,
tumbling into the second row as the Superman theme was played over
the public-address system.
</P>
<P>
   Among his litany of self-proclaimed nicknames _ the Big
Aristotle being the most recent _ O'Neal earlier this season called
himself Shaq Kent. But there are no phone booths inside the Staples
Center. Only fallible human beings who play basketball for a
living. And against a remarkably resilient team from Portland, they
were just enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how,'' Bryant said, ``but we just found a way to
wear them down. It's kind of wild to think we won this game, isn't
it?''
</P>

M'S DEFENSE DOES IT ALL IN 6-4 WIN OVER PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If you didn't see it, don't worry, you will. This one
will run on TV more often than Andy Griffith reruns.
</P>
<P>
   In a game loaded with fielding gems, right fielder Stan Javier
made a catch so astounding Sunday that it not only helped the
Mariners hold onto a 6-4 victory over the San Diego Padres, the
replays could account for 20 percent of ESPN's summer programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be on the highlights for about a year and a
half,'' said left fielder Rickey Henderson, who added he doesn't
remember seeing a catch like it in his 22 big-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be played (over and over), and I think it
should be,'' catcher Tom Lampkin said. ``Our defense made so many
big plays today. The catch that Mike Cameron made, the play that
Rickey Henderson made ...''
</P>
<P>
   Hold on, we'll get to those soon enough. First, Javier's catch.
Just in case it isn't being replayed on TV this very minute, here's
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   With Seattle leading 5-1 in the seventh inning, two out and a
runner on base, San Diego's Phil Nevin slammed a pitch off reliever
Arthur Rhodes that had two-run homer written on it in flashing
neon.
</P>
<P>
   Javier raced back to the warning track, leaped and reached his
glove over the fence. The ball appeared to strike the glove's
pocket about an arm-length beyond the fence but Javier couldn't
hold onto it. Yet when he pulled the glove back, he also flipped
the ball back onto the field side of the fence. As Javier fell to
the ground, he looked up, saw the ball dropping toward him, reached
out his glove and became the leading candidate for Catch of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   No, they don't practice this before games.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I got lucky,'' Javier said. ``I can't explain it
or anything. It was just a lucky catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but as Branch Rickey said, luck is the residue of
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has to be in the top five catches for me,'' said winning
pitcher Paul Abbott, who allowed one run in 51/3 innings. ``He went
back and took a home run away, and then he had the presence of mind
to look for the ball and catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime you take a home run away from anyone, you have to
smile,'' said Javier, who had a grin on his face when he saw the
ball in his glove. ``When you make a play like that, instead of
5-3, it's still 5-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier's catch was the second in a trifecta from Seattle
outfielders. You Know Who may be in Cincinnati, but the Mariners
outfielders still cover more Seattle real estate than a January
rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson made a fine running catch in left field in the first
inning and Cameron robbed Tony Gwynn of extra bases with a crucial
fence-rattling catch in center during a three-run San Diego rally
in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something you take pride in,'' Cameron said. ``Every
year, I keep saying I'll win a gold glove this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as (Gwynn) hit it, I thought I had a pretty good bead
on it. I just wanted to hold onto it, I was going full tilt. That
was a very big hit I took away from Tony Gwynn.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was just the outfield. John Olerud, Alex Rodriguez and
Jose Paniaqua turned a nifty bases-loaded 3-6-1 double play that
saved another run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good plays, bad plays, mediocre plays, they're all
contagious,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got guys who can catch the ball,'' Abbott said. ``Good
defense wins game. That, and throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego did neither.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had only five hits but squeezed out six runs thanks to
seven walks and San Diego left fielder Al Martin's error in the
third inning. Martin dropped Lampkin's two-out fly ball, allowing
two runs to score and extend Seattle's lead to five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the game got interesting at the end _ ``A little
exciting,'' manager Lou Piniella said _ when San Diego scored three
runs off Frankie Rodriguez and Kazu Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   And it could have been worse. Sasaki allowed a home run to
Martin, the first batter he faced, Gwynn's flyout to Cameron, and
then walked the next two batters before striking out Bret Boone to
end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Accurately estimating the runs saved by Seattle's defense and
the runs allowed by San Diego's would be a bit like calculating the
city's annual caffeine consumption, but it's safe to say the
Mariners would have lost the game had it not been for their gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game we won with our defense,'' Piniella said.

JOHNSON'S POWER ATTRACTS ATTENTION FROM SCOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It started with a call from interested scouts and pro
coaches: How would you, Tripper Johnson, like to work out in Safeco
Field?
</P>
<P>
   Two homers (one account says they were ``mammoth'') to left and
a dozen or so shots to all fields with Lou Piniella looking on and
suddenly the Newport High School (Bellevue) senior was on his way
to the biggest jump up the list for Monday's major league amateur
baseball draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they like that I can hit and that I play hard,'' said
the unassuming 6-foot-2, 190-pound third baseman. ``Those are the
two main reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the growing legend around Johnson, who started
the season with a homer in Yakima that broke the window of a Ford
Bronco and ended it with an inside-the-park romp against Issaquah.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, Johnson now is considered by Baseball America as one of
the top three high school power hitters this year. Team One
Baseball, part of the Rivals.com network, said Johnson ``looks to
be a sure thing to be the first prospect taken out of the region''
and is one of the ``most improved prospects in the country,
especially over the past two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's projected to be Washington's only potential
first-round pick, with a 54 score (out of a 20-80 scale) as the
highest-ranked state player by the Major League Scouting Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Other Northwest players received early attention, especially
outfielder Skyler Fulton of Capital High in Olympia, and
left-handed pitcher Fraser Dizard of Meadowdale in Lynnwood.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson quietly put together an impressive senior season for
the Knights, hitting .519 with nine homers, 37 RBIs, 14 doubles and
42 runs scored in 24 games. He also stole 16 bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the year that I thought he would have,'' said Newport
coach Brian Fischer. ``Scouts at first didn't get a chance to look
at him all that much. But when they started to come to every game,
they realized how good an athlete he really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Already committed to play baseball at the University of
Washington, Johnson is taking the draft in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything is going to fall into place. I feel
right,'' he said. ``Even if I don't want to sign, the time will
come. Whether I go to college or sign, it will work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson believes the Huskies' incoming recruiting class is
top-notch and he has a great respect for UW hitting coach Joe Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the program has really improved over the last five
years and that's why I really wanted to go there,'' he said. ``If I
feel uncomfortable signing, then I'll just go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's also long dreamed of playing pro baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a standout football player, began playing baseball in
Little League mostly because his father signed him up to play. His
devotion to the game was all his own from then on.
</P>
<P>
   ``From there, once he got me started, it was pretty much my
decision what I wanted to do,'' he said. ``I've been with it ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Fischer, Johnson has hit well since he joined the
Newport program as a freshman. The Dodgers' Todd Hollandsworth also
played at Newport, but Fischer said Johnson is as good or better at
this stage in his baseball development.
</P>
<P>
   ``His best asset has been that he can hit, and that's what's
gotten him up into the real high rounds. But he has of the other
stuff: His defense, his running speed and his sheer athletic
ability,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   To work on his pro potential, Johnson has been using a wood bat
in batting practice all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably what made him a better hitter,'' Fischer said.
``He certainly deserves it and he's worked at it over the last four
years. It's just now paying off for him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's full name is Nelson Johnson III, hence the nickname
``Tripper,'' which derives from being the third Nelson in the
family. It started out as ``Triple.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he's also had the triple-treat baseball experience of
his life, visiting not only Safeco Field but Dodger Stadium and
Coors Field in workouts for scouts and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But those two shots into the 390-foot left field power alley at
Safeco were Johnson's way of saying that he's ready for bigger
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I'll always remember because there aren't many
kids who get a chance to hit in Safeco,'' he said when asked about
the homers. ``I was just lucky to get a phone call and invited
down. ... Yeah, I got two out.''

TIME FOR MARINERS TO FASHION A HOT STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A wrist-twisting, home-run-robbing, once-in-a-lifetime
catch by Stan Javier spiced things up at the ballyard Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So did Mike Cameron's face-busting, up-against-the-wall steal of
a Tony Gwynn double.
</P>
<P>
   The late-inning defensive jewels by the right and center
fielders to preserve a 6-4 Mariners victory over San Diego were
welcome occurrences in this murky netherworld called
``interleague'' that the M's, Padres and all of baseball are
wallowing in.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that the tedious sound of the word
``interleague'' has doomed baseball's 4-year-old novelty act to
such a state of listlessness?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, which is why someone better order the Mets or the Reds
to come to Safeco Field before we have to see the Padres again.
Baseball is allegedly at work on this stagnant aspect of its
entertainment product.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, in the absence of meaningful games against
other .500 AL West opponents or more entertaining rivals such as
the Yankees, Red Sox or the fellas from Cleveland, the M's got busy
attempting to give the home crowd something to cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   The big highlight came in the top of the seventh when Javier
jumped up and deflected San Diego third baseman Phil Nevin's
almost-a-homer just as it arced over the right-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Then, falling backward to the warning track, Javier reached out
and caught the ball as it tumbled back into the not-so-comfy
confines of Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling in the dirt, Javier held on, saving two runs and ending
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a franchise that spent 11 years being treated to
spectacular, wall-climbing, pull-back homer rob jobs, this one was
for the video archives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Javier said. ``But to be honest, I just got
lucky. It was a lucky catch. It was our day. We made some good
defensive plays.''
</P>
<P>
   This is nothing new for the 2000 Mariners. In fact, with the
second-best fielding percentage in the American League, the
Mariners have unearthed more than their fair share of leathery gems
so far this season.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, even Rickey Henderson tracked down a long fly ball off the
bat of Gwynn Sunday, giving the Mariners outfield a nice little
trifecta of effort and execution.
</P>
<P>
   What has not happened for the M's, however, is a hot streak _ a
topic that seems to be catching a little fire lately. With May now
having rolled definitely into a so-far toasty June, it is time for
the M's to consider ways of heating up.
</P>
<P>
   Javier, like everyone, has hardly failed to notice that the AL
West lead continues to bob and weave among its four parity-minded
contestants.
</P>
<P>
   No team has been able to establish itself as the clear leader,
although the idea had been that the division was the M's to
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always look at the (standings) so you see what's going on.
We've just got to get hot. We need to get a streak going,'' Javier
said.
</P>
<P>
   With today's game against the Rockies, another mushy and largely
uninspiring interleague spot in the schedule, the Mariners will
have completed one-third of the season.
</P>
<P>
   They have endured the absence of No. 1 starter Jamie Moyer until
his return last Friday and they will continue to wait on Freddy
Garcia, who is on schedule to be back in about a month.
</P>
<P>
   But with Paul Abbott stepping into a starter's spot, John Halama
racing to a 6-1 start and Aaron Sele delivering workmanlike starts,
the M's have not been pinched as badly as one might have suspected.
</P>
<P>
   As for the bullpen, the M's have even endured the road disasters
by closer Kazuhiro Sasaki and the continuing bewildering inability
of Jose Mesa to use the breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   No, just when the M's look as if they are dodging bullets and
taking advantage of the versatility this revamped roster gives
them, something else goes out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   These days, what seems to be most effectively dampening the
Mariners' ability to get on a roll is the lack of rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Edgar Martinez was a one-man wrecking crew for the
Mariners in May, with a .441 batting average, 10 homers and 32
RBIs. But the promise of small-ball hit-and-runs, rallies and
manufacturing offense has failed to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 51 innings, it has been noted that the Mariners have
failed to get more than three hits in any one inning. The other
day, despite coaxing 11 walks, the Mariners still lost, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   The M's are stranding more people than the S.S. Minnow.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, defense was again the bright spot. Javier and Cameron
embraced in center field after Cameron's outstanding catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you make a good defensive play it is the most
satisfying,'' Javier said. ``He and I didn't get a hit (Sunday) but
we were glad to help out in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the defense has been a sight to behold on many occasions
during the first third of this season. Now it's time for a little
something extra.
</P>
<P>
   Does a six-game winning streak sound good? How about 8 of 10?
Or, heaven forbid, why not just go for 10 in a row?

TRAIL BLAZERS FOLLOW PLAN TO THE BITTER END 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Until the waning moments, the Portland Trail
Blazers never wavered from their plan. Intent on stopping Shaquille
O'Neal from the start of the Western Conference finals, the Trail
Blazers again stymied the National Basketball Association's most
valuable player at every important juncture of Game 7 on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Until the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 9 of his 18 points in the final period, lifting
his team into the NBA finals against the Indiana Pacers as the
Lakers defeated the Trail Blazers, 89-84, at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers had built a 13-point lead at the beginning of
the fourth quarter, and sent O'Neal and the Lakers in search of a
dramatic rally, which came as Portland went scoreless for almost
six minutes of the quarter. That allowed the Lakers to tie the
score at 75-75.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, it appeared Portland's plan would work. On
offense, the Trail Blazers spread the court and lured O'Neal away
from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy gave Rasheed Wallace more room to work in the lane
and he delivered 10 points in the third quarter. Steve Smith kept
the Lakers confused from the outside and hit 4 of 5 shots for 10
points in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, the Trail Blazers banged and flew at O'Neal from all
angles. As they fought to maintain their lead, the threat of
intentionally fouling O'Neal _Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy's
hack-a-Shaq philosophy from Game 1 _ loomed prominently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what it comes down to, that's what we'll do,''
Dunleavy said before Game 7. ``We're not going to change something
like that at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Portland tying the series at 3-3 on Friday, guard
Bonzi Wells said there was no secret to what the Trail Blazers
wanted to do against O'Neal and the Lakers' other star, Kobe
Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of different guys and matchups we can throw at
them,'' Wells said. ``We've got to key on two of their guys. With
us, they've got to try and stop five guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle in the middle became a bump-and-grind ballet as the
Trail Blazers tried to put O'Neal in foul trouble. They succeeded
to some extent, as O'Neal was whistled for his third foul with 6
minutes 18 seconds left in the second quarter and the Lakers
trailing by 35-25. At that point, he had yet to make a field goal
and was spending more time making passes to teammates than looking
for ways to crash the basket.
</P>
<P>
   That third foul seemed to awaken O'Neal like a slap in the face.
He muscled inside for two quick baskets and finished the first half
with 9 points on 2-of-4 shooting and 5-of-8 free-throw shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lakers star center had three fouls. O'Neal was also
coming off two games in which he was not much of a force in the
second half, especially the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal totaled only three shots in the fourth quarter of the
Lakers' losses in Games 5 and 6. When his team needed him most was
when the Trail Blazers' defense against him was best.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth quarter, when we're behind, we start to rush
ourselves and take quick jump shots,'' Derek Fisher said before
Game 7. ``We need to realize that we still have time to go to Shaq.
It's our responsibility to give him the opportunity to be the
bigger factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Trail Blazers led by 23-16 through the first
quarter, they fell behind early in the war of attrition against
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   He took only two shots, missing both, and made 2 of 4 free
throws, but whoever tried to guard him set off a chorus of
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   Arvydas Sabonis, who later fouled out, was called for two fouls
and went to the bench with 3:37 to play in the quarter. Brian Grant
fared worse, picking up two fouls in one minute and being replaced
by Jermaine O'Neal with 2:37 left.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine O'Neal earned his second foul with 9:15 left in the
second quarter. Still, the Trail Blazers persisted with their
strategy of attacking O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out fast and physical, a style that kept the Lakers off
balance in Portland's victories in Games 5 and 6, also helped with
the defense of O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't anticipate a fast start,'' said Trail Blazers Coach
Mike Dunleavy. ``Like the other games, we know it's going to be 48
minutes. All year long, we haven't had anything handed to us.'' &QL;

PIPPEN PARALYZED IN FOURTH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the race for the seventh ring reaches the
homestretch, Phil Jackson moves ahead of Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt Pippen wanted to prove he could win an NBA
championship without Michael Jordan or the man who coached him in
Chicago. He still might one day, but not before Jackson (and former
teammate Ron Harper) get first crack at the title.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Pippen played Sunday's Game 7 with intensity, likely
motivated by what was at stake. Still playing with two bad fingers,
he took charges in the paint, grabbed a team-high 10 rebounds,
assisted in triple-teaming Shaquille O'Neal and encouraged from the
bench when he wasn't on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   When he made a 3-pointer near the Lakers bench with 18 seconds
remaining in the third period, he glared at Jackson as if he were
Reggie Miller mocking Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   But he also disappeared in the fourth quarter, along with the
rest of his teammates. When no one could buy a basket for 7
minutes, Pippen was no different (he didn't attempt a shot and
committed a turnover).
</P>
<P>
   When he fouled out with 25.4 seconds to play, Pippen finished 3
for 10 from the field (2 of 6 from 3-point land) and scored 10
points, five below his series average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to swallow, and it will be all summer,'' he
somberly said. ``I know that as just one of the players on the
team, we are very disappointed. I realized that we sort of made
cowards of ourselves in the fourth quarter. We played like we were
fatigued, and they gained momentum that they needed to pull this
game out.''
</P>
<P>
   So that leaves one piece of unfinished business: the
Pippen-Jackson feud. Is it over? Are they friends again now that
their Western Conference Final series has been decided?
</P>
<P>
   The NBC cameras wanted to capture the moment but didn't get the
chance. As Pippen slowly walked off the court, stopping to hug
Harper and other Lakers, Jackson was seen walking into the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen never got a chance to talk to Jackson, at least not where
anyone could witness it. Jackson didn't address the issue in his
postgame media session.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen and Harper talked plenty, however. They often guarded
each other, always trying to one-up the other.
</P>
<P>
   Then came their postgame embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pip is real class,'' Harper said. ``First thing I said to him
was that he had great games. Man, he was carrying his team. He did
everything he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'I'll see you in the off-season.' I got love for him,
and he's got love for me. I'm sad to see him go, but I'm happy to
see him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen, while saying less, was complimentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished him good luck and told him to go win a
championship,'' Pippen said. ``We tried to test them and push them
to the limit, and they responded. Let's see if they can be crowned
champions.''

LAKERS WIN THE WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether the Los Angeles Lakers are adept enough to
win the NBA championship this season still is of intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Those wondering about their maturity level, however, need only
look at the accelerated course taken Sunday in Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles took the more experienced Portland Trail Blazers to
school down the stretch of the Western Conference finals and won
Game 7, 89-84, to advance to the NBA Finals for the first time
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, the culmination of a hard-fought, best-of-seven
series basically took on the equivalence of going from kindergarten
to college in a day. The same youth and raw talent that contributed
to a 15-point deficit early in the fourth quarter are what
propelled an astonishing comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It took a 31-13 run in the fourth quarter for the Lakers to
graduate to a date with the East champion Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until this point, this has been the ultimate test,'' Lakers
guard Kobe Bryant said after scoring a team-high 25 points. ``They
pushed us to the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles beat Portland, 4-3, to avoid becoming the seventh
team in NBA history to blow a 3-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers never conceded anything in this series until that
decisive final frame.
</P>
<P>
   Portland led 75-60 when the Lakers used a 15-0 run the tie the
score with 3:56 left. While the Lakers grew more and more energized
with every possession, the Blazers grew weary.
</P>
<P>
   Their shots either fell short or rattled out of the rim.
Portland was allowed just one attempt each trip down during the
stretch. The result was 13 consecutive misses that fed the Lakers'
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Tied 79-79, Bryant made two free throws to put the Lakers in
front for good. After another Bryant basket put the Lakers ahead,
83-79, he threw a lob pass to Shaquille O'Neal for a dunk that
punctuated the rally.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's basket over Rasheed Wallace's outstretched arm put the
Lakers ahead by six points with 41 seconds left in the game. Los
Angeles put on a free throw clinic in the final minute to preserve
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers missed 15 of 21 shots in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically what happened is they beat us,'' Portland coach Mike
Dunleavy said. ``They beat us. Maybe our legs. Maybe we were a
little tired. We had some wide open looks that we didn't make. But
they made some big shots with a hand in their face. They're an
excellent team. They deserve all the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland had won two consecutive games at Staples to extend the
series. In a way, the Lakers were determined not to be embarrassed
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my teammates were going to step up for me,'' said
O'Neal, who was held to 18 points and nine rebounds. ``I kept
telling them that this is do-or-die. Let's just forget about
everything, play hard and win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Blazers forward Scottie Pippen said his team showed heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't bring that (fourth) quarter back,'' Pippen said. ``We
knew we didn't complete this game. We lost this (series) in one
quarter. But we have a lot more to be proud of than to be down
about. This series could have been over a week ago if we had
believed everything that was said about us.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland nearly reversed Lakers coach Phil Jackson's comment
after Game 3 when he said the Blazers were at ``death's door.'' But
just as they did to even the series, the Blazers put up a steel
door with their defense to control the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very interesting game,'' Jackson said. ``I've never
seen one quite like that before. ... My condolences to Portland and
also my congratulations on a great season, and a very well-fought
series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers led 71-58 heading into the final frame after a
pivotal and powerful third quarter that figured to complete the
Lakers' collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy inserted a taller Bonzi Wells for 5-foot-10 Damon
Stoudamire. The move put Pippen at point guard with Arvydas
Sabonis, Rasheed Wallace and Steve Smith on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   That group, much like it did in Game 6 at Portland, dominated
the Lakers. With 6:22 left in the third, the Blazers used an 18-2
run to seize a 68-53 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch, Smith scored seven consecutive points with
shots off the dribble. Wallace's monster dunk capped the offensive
onslaught. Meanwhile, the Lakers' offense shifted into neutral with
little movement and poor shot selection.
</P>
<P>
   Containing O'Neal allowed the Blazers to manufacture a pair of
10-point leads in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we played as hard as we could play,'' Wallace said.
``We can walk around with our heads up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, though, walk on with the conference crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what Game 7 is all about,'' Lakers guard Glen Rice
said. ``You go out there and leave it all on the line and the
better team won. We were the better team today.''

BETTER MIGRANT CENSUS
 WANTED
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY PETER ORTIZ 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - Sitting at the end of a narrow dirt path that snakes
more than a mile along a Queen Creek grape field is the migrant
camp that Domingo Martinez calls home.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, the sweet scent of oranges permeates the air
as Jose Gamboa-Ayon crouches beneath a tree in the middle of the
grove where he both works and sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   These men mirror the faces of a vital but often invisible
workforce that fuels Arizona's $6.3-billion agricul tural economy.
Their lives are often hidden in the massive citrus groves and
fields where they toil, and they too often go uncounted in the U.S.
census.
</P>
<P>
   Farm workers are responsible for helping to make Arizona second
only to California in turning out lettuce, cauliflower, broccoli,
cantaloupes and lemons, yet no one knows how many live here.
</P>
<P>
   And counting them thoroughly is critical to their long-term
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is how much of the $182 billion in federal funds will
go toward health, education and hous ing services in communities
where farm workers have been under counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decadelong process,'' said Ken Evans, president of the
Arizona Farm Bureau Federation, which rep resents 9,000 farmers.
``What they miss right now will hurt us for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona officials estimate that about 65,000 seasonal and
migrant farm workers live in the state, while the 1990 census gave
a count of 30,387.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa-Ayon is among those who are easy to miss.
</P>
<P>
   His weathered face speaks of his 30 years working the field. The
59-year-old farm worker has a trailer, but spends much of his time
deep in a Queen Creek citrus grove, where he sleeps on two
mattresses propped on milk crates beneath a tree.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet from his bed, Gamboa-A yon has a metal shelf where he
stores condiments and cooking utensils. He uses cilantro and green
onions from a garden he planted to prepare meals over an open
flame.
</P>
<P>
   Gamboa-Ayon said more farm work ers live in the grove, which has
empty jugs of water and blankets scattered about.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials acknowledge that migrant and seasonal farm
workers were not properly represented during the last count a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Interagency Farm Workers Coalition was created in
1995 to make sure that doesn't happen this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to serve the farm worker, we need to know how
many we have and where they are,'' said Maria Chavez, who heads the
coali tion of 60 advocacy and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition compiled a list of places where farm workers live
or congregate, and then turned them over to local census offices.
Those offices then sought out local resi dents to be census takers
in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also hired a major advertising firm and spent
$167 million to help communities promote the census through radio,
television and print media.
</P>
<P>
   Census workers will have until Aug. 9 to finish their count.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from a faulty census is a serious concern with
Arizona's De partment of Economic Security, which turns to census
data to help plan for farm worker job opportuni ties.
</P>
<P>
   And in Queen Creek, a faulty census count has hurt farm workers
who get limited medical care from a local clinic. Local farm worker
agencies that apply for federal grants often use census numbers in
trying to show the need in their community.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census is our most important national data source, what
every body turns to first,'' said Alice Larson, a social welfare
researcher in Washington state. ``You can't advo cate funds unless
you know how many people you are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Illene J. Jacobs, who was appointed to the 2000 Census Advisory
Com mittee in 1995, hopes that this year's effort can fix the
problems of 1990. She directs the California Rural Legal Assistance
program, which found a 40 percent undercount of the farm worker
population in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that not only were they missing farm workers, but the
profile of the farm worker population was skewed,'' Jacobs said.
``The farm workers that were enumerated tended to be higher income,
and better educated than many of the migrant and seasonal farm
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1997-98 farm worker survey by the U.S. Department
of Labor, the average farm worker is a single, 31-year-old man. A
majority, 77 percent, were born in Mexico, and 60 percent lived
below the poverty line, with a median income of $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 38, like many farm work ers in Arizona, still has
family in Mexico that he gets to visit two or three months out of
the year. He spends most of the year in Arizona and plans his life
around the harvest ing schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no choice,'' said Jesse Aguilar, a farm laborer
contractor who hired Martinez and 500 other farm workers throughout
the year. ``The crop won't wait for us.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m., Martinez slings a canvas bag around his chest and
works his way up and down a 14-foot orange tree with the help of a
ladder. He speedily picks off the oranges, stop ping every four
minutes to empty his bag into a huge bin.
</P>
<P>
   It will take 16 trips before he fills an entire bin and earns
$17. By the end of his workday at 1 p.m. he will fill five to six
bins. He'll send home $200 to $300 a week to a wife and four
children, keeping the rest for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had heard about the census effort on television and
thought it was a good idea, but has yet to meet a census taker.
</P>
<P>
   Many farm workers like Martinez have only a post office box and
won't receive a form by mail because they don't have a permanent
address or they live in another household.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez understands the fear that some farm workers have about
their census forms being turned over to immigration officials. But
census commercials convinced him of the need for an accurate count.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar supports the census effort and said his farm workers are
aware of the campaign. But he is concerned that Martinez and many
of his men are being missed. He said he and other contractors he
knows were never contacted by census officials. He hopes to see
census takers during the summer, when he expects 1,500 to 2,000
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Silva saw how the last census had hurt her Queen Creek
commu nity from the farm workers who sought help at a local health
clinic. Silva is project coordinator with the Family Resource
Center, which serves migrant and seasonal farm worker families in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transportation, for one, is not here,'' Silva said.

SHAQ'S FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THIS COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You're the uniformed agent at the gate of the NBA
Finals, entrusted with rubber-stamping the Lakers' entry papers
Sunday after they unapologetically pushed ahead of Scottie Pippen
and the rest of the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal is the first to get validated. His fingerprints
were all over the late surge that moved the Lakers to the front of
the line via an 89-84 victory over Portland in the series-deciding
Game 7 of the Wes tern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot-1 center had a resplendent season, earning league MVP
honors for the first time in his eight-year NBA career. His
scoring, rebounding and shot-blocking numbers, however gaudy,
wouldn't have meant anything if he hadn't steered the Lakers into
position to win a championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   For 36 minutes Sunday, O'Neal was lending credence to his
critics who questioned whether or not he had the iron will to go
with his muscles of s teel. He had 24 touches in the first half and
two measly baskets to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal picked up his third foul before he had put up his third
shot and had nine points after 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the same situation last year, O'Neal would have dissolved
like an antacid tablet dropped into water. This time, with the
Lakers down by 13 points with 12 minutes remaining and the pressure
approaching the ear-popp ing point, he was so poised he gave his
primary defender, Aryvdas Saboni s, heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal made all four shots he tried in the fourth and final
quarter and was so aggressive Sabonis fouled out of the game trying
to thwart him. H e also was 3-for-4 from the free-throw line, no
insignificant statistic given that O'Neal's foul shooting had been
so shaky for most of the regu lar season he was benched in the
final seconds of a home game against P ortland in January so he
wouldn't wind up at the foul line with the ball and the game in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   That indignity seemed but a distant memory when O'Neal stepped
up to the free-throw line with 2:44 remaining and swooshed two
throws to draw the Lakers even with the Trail Blazers, at 77-77.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, O'Neal's final basket came on a resounding dunk on a
feed fro m Kobe Bryant with 41.9 seconds left. It was an
exclamation point for O' Neal, who finished with 18 points, five
assists, one blocked shot and no more knocks against him.
</P>
<P>
   You give O'Neal your stamp of approval and signal to the next
player in line.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant bounds up to your booth.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when Bryant never would have fallen in line behind
O'Neal, much less have his back. Last year the Lakers' two most
prominent players jockeyed for marquee billing and ended up
bringing down the whole producti on.
</P>
<P>
   This year they melded their games and their goals so they were
complemen tary, not contradictory. Bryant contributed a team-high
25 points and co llected 11 defensive rebounds. Without his hard
work and extra effort un der Portland's basket, the Lakers would
have been hopelessly out of posi tion to mount a furious
fourth-quarter comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In another era, this month would have found the 21-year-old
Bryant colle cting a college diploma. He no longer has to justify
his decision to lea p straight from high school to the pros.
</P>
<P>
   You give Bryant a stamp of approval and signal to the next in
line.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant you are face-to-face with the team's first-year
coach Phil Jackson. Lured out of retirement by the challenge of
turning the Lakers into something more precious than their
individual parts, Jackson succe eded where a lot of people believed
he was doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of leading O'Neal, Bryant and Co. to the NBA
Finals, he p roved his care and feeding of hulking, hungry egos
was, in retrospect, n o small contribution to the Chicago Bulls'
six NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's bearing buttressed his troops in the anxious hours
between the Lakers' ugly 10-point loss to Portland in Game 6 and
the start of Game 7. He oozed confidence and that's the scent that
engulfed the senses of people who visited the Lakers' practice on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It overrided any whiff of fear.
</P>
<P>
   You gladly give Jackson your stamp of approval and send him on
his way.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw is the next to greet you. The Lakers signed Shaw, 36,
to give them a warm body when Bryant was sidelined at the beginning
of the year with a wrist injury.
</P>
<P>
   If Bryant doesn't get hurt, Shaw isn't a Laker. It's that
simple.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Shaw survived his shaky status to see all the hours he
spent la st summer at the UCLA gym working on his shooting stroke
pay huge divide nds. He made three 3-pointers in the final 12:04 to
bring the Lakers back from the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   You give Shaw your stamp of approval and wave up the next player
in line .
</P>
<P>
   It is point guard Ron Harper, who most everybody but Jackson
considered too old and decrepit to lead the Lakers' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he is a 35-year-old warrior with the knees of
someone 73 , Harper emerged as the team's designated superego. It
was his job to re ign in all the ids.
</P>
<P>
   And sure enough, Harper was seen whispering into Bryant's ear
more than once Sunday, same as he has done all season, telling him
to play smart ball, not street ball.
</P>
<P>
   Harper took six shots and four of them went in. He also dished
out six a ssists, including one to O'Neal with a little over two
minutes to play t hat produced the basket that gave the Lakers
their first lead (at 79-77) since the middle of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   You wink at the player Bryant affectionately calls ``Old Head''
and give him your stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   One after the other you give your stamp of approval to forward
Rick Fox, who settled for less money to play for an NBA title
contender. And Glen Rice, who subjugated his own ego and much of
his offense for a chance a t a championship ring. And Robert Horry,
whose shot wasn't falling but w hose defense never faltered.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, all that remains is Los Angeles. The city that ushered
in the new year with a whimper rang out the Western Conference
finals with a bang. You give your stamp of approval to 18,997 fans
who made the Staples C enter a den of din and smile.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bonzi Wells didn't need to speak in order to
communicate the feelings of disappointment, despair and downright
disgust that filled the Portland locker room Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wells slumbered out of the showers, covered his face with both
hands as he reached his cubicle and eventually began rubbing the
top of his stubbled head, likely trying to conjure up some answers
to the million-dollar question: How could this happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have all summer to think about it,'' Portland forward
Brian Grant said minutes after the Trail Blazers had their season
end in agony with a Game 7 loss to the Lakers in the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers, one solid quarter away from their first trip
to the NBA Finals since 1992, can now take solace only in their
strong regular season and the fact that they pushed the Lakers to
the edge of elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the team, I'm proud of everybody, but we just
came up a little short,'' said guard Steve Smith, who scored 18
points. ``We felt that we played better minutes than they did in
the series, but the minutes that we didn't play (well), they took
advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Players denied that visions of the NBA Finals entered their
minds, even when Portland took a 15-point lead early in the fourth
quarter. But hosting Indiana in Game 1 couldn't, and shouldn't,
have been too far from the Trail Blazers' minds.
</P>
<P>
   This was a team built to win a Game 7, a team whose players
averaged more than 40 playoff games per man and a team led by a
player, Scottie Pippen, who was acquired in large part to provide
playoff leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers put themselves in position to achieve their
goal after battling back from a 3-1 series deficit, but that only
made Sunday's loss more difficult to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think they would be able to score 31 points against
us (in the fourth quarter),'' Greg Anthony said. ``Our guys played
hard, and we made the plays we wanted to offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we didn't give it our all, because we did. We
had our opportunities, and that's what makes it even more
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Portland players were just as quick to praise the
Lakers, particularly Shaquille O'Neal and Brian Shaw, for their
clutch fourth-quarter efforts, but stopped short of declaring the
Lakers the favorites against the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Indiana has) one of the deadliest shooters to play in the
NBA, Reggie Miller, and they've got a big man in Rik (Smits), so it
ought to be a good (series),'' forward Rasheed Wallace said. ``I'll
watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   As time expired, Pippen and Lakers guard Ron Harper, former
teammates with the Chicago Bulls, embraced following an
often-contentious series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished him good luck and told him to go win a
championship,'' Pippen said. ``We tried to push them to the limit
and they responded. Now we'll see if they will be champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen and the rest of the Trail Blazers will take the summer to
contemplate what might have been had they not missed 13 consecutive
shots in the fourth quarter, and wonder how many of the same faces
will return next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made it to semifinals, why wouldn't we be back?'' said
Smith, alluding to rumors in Portland that the team might be broken
up. ``We still want to win a championship together.''

miles apart, not even 15 minutes by car. Yet they are separated by
a far greater distance, one they say they never envisioned back in
Cuba. In ways that are obvious to the black man but far less so to
the white one, they have grown apart in the U.S. because of race.

unregulated soft money. Bush, who raised a staggering $70 million
in his primary campaign, dismissed the challenge as a ploy. But
now, with the Democrats dropping hints that they may soon begin a
television advertising campaign on behalf of Gore, Republicans are
eager to hoist the vice president on his own petard. Asserting that
Mr. Gore's message amounted to a solemn promise not to use soft
money, the Republicans are trying to paint Gore as a hypocrite even

Bat Day only a hit for fans, White Sox
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Easy like Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The first three hits were home runs, two by Chicago, and each
leading off an inning. The Astros' last base knock of the day
occurred in the fourth inning, a two-run dinger by Daryle Ward, as
White Sox pitchers retired 16 of the last 18 batters they faced,
eight on strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   So the Astros' offense retired early and the club went on to
lose the rubber game of this interleague series 7-3, and we are
trying to think of how many ways to describe how poorly the home
team played.
</P>
<P>
   In a goodwill gesture entirely unrelated to the outcome of the
game, the Astros gave away 3,000 Louisville Sluggers to kids
wearing their youth league uniforms. As luck would have it, the
varsity kept for itself the bats that had only five hits in them.
</P>
<P>
   The souvenirs were not miniatures, but full-sized bats, the kind
that come in handy if you're making a movie about the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   You reflect that every day is Bat Day at Enron Field, or so it
seems, with the visiting club usually taking the honors. Sunday's
game was tied until Octavio Dotel actually delivered his first
pitch, which Ray ``Bull'' Durham pounced on and drove over the wall
in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were behind to stay as lefty Mike Sirotka, a Houston
resident and LSU graduate, handcuffed them most of this dull,
one-sided day. Chris Singleton led off the second inning with a
rocket shot into the seats in right-center to give the Sox a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, Richard Hidalgo appeared to
surprise himself by hitting a ball with less than his best rip, but
his high fly kept going until it cleared the fence in left-center,
his 18th homer of the season. The ball traveled 355 feet, and
Hidalgo was laughing out loud when he took his seat in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Some would argue home runs are not just cheap at Enron.
Sometimes, like butterflies, they are free.
</P>
<P>
   The Pale Hose, as they are known in the mercantile world, put
away the game with a three-run burst in the third on four straight
hits, collecting two of them on Paul Konerko's double. Konerko
started in place of the menacing Frank Thomas, a move that must
have made Houston hearts leap like a fawn before the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Konerko broke out of a 1-for-26 slump with three hits,
including two doubles, as Dotel wobbled all day, leaving with two
out in the fifth and all seven runs charged to his account. The
loss was the fourth in five decisions for the young Dominican.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker has a policy, applauded by many, of
letting his starters try to work their way out of a bad situation.
The policy worked swell in the spacious Astrodome, but at Enron the
pitchers seem to create bad situations so they can make the best of
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had mounted their last threat in the bottom of the
fourth, when Ward connected with Lance Berkman on base for the runs
that cut the score to 5-3. The inning would have been bigger if
Hidalgo had not been thrown out at third base trying to stretch a
hit into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't get out of the box well,'' Dierker said. ``That
happens to a lot of hitters here. He didn't think the ball was hit
well, and all of a sudden it's off the wall. You start trying to
turn it on, and take that extra base.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Astros were unable to put together two solid
games in a row, failing to tie their longest winning streak of the
season. You can criticize the pitching, the hitting and the
baserunning, but the defense wasn't flawless either. Tony Eusebio
dropped a throw at the plate, allowing Konerko to score in a
two-run fifth inning. The bobble wasted a perfect throw from
Berkman.
</P>
<P>
   In the category of
shutting-the-barn-door-after-the-cow-has-fled, four Astros relief
pitchers threw shutout ball the rest of the day, with Doug Henry
striking out five in two innings and working out of a bases-loaded,
one-out jam in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros can't sink much lower. They are already last in their
division and competing for the worst record in all of baseball. The
White Sox pounded them for 13 hits, including two homers and four
doubles. Durham's first-pitch homer was an omen of the total misery
that loomed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Sirotka pitched seven strong innings, and the Astros won't win
often when Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell and Ken Caminiti are a
combined 0-for-10. Caminiti expressed his frustration by getting
the thumb in the eighth, after being called out on strikes.
</P>
<P>
   His temper provided the first excitement in two hours for
another sellout crowd of 41,117. The fans are still adjusting to
the park, too, cheering every ball hit in the air, including
infield pops, figuring the ball has a chance to go out.

BANK SHOT LEADS TO BLAZERS' TANK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Control started slipping away ever so innocently,
but when it went, it went quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst was Brian Shaw's desperation 3-pointer at the end
of the third quarter that missed so badly it banked in, cutting
Portland's 16- point lead to 13 heading into the fourth quarter of
the Lakers' 89-84 victory in Game 7 of the Western Conference
finals Sunday at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's fortunate clank did more than breathe life into the
Lakers, it staggered the Blazers. All of a sudden they looked tired
and confused. Their confident play up to that point became
tentative, unsure.
</P>
<P>
   Shots that were falling earlier bounced off the rim into the
hands of the Lakers. Calls that went Portland's way started going
to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers looked vulnerable, and L.A. sensed it.
</P>
<P>
   So did Portland, which missed 13 straight shots during one
stretch of the fourth to relinquish momentum, the game and the
series to the very appreciative Lakers, who responded with a 21-4
run to take a 79-77 lead with 2:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After climbing out of a three-games-to-one hole and taking a
16-point lead on the road in Game 7, the Blazers handed it all back
to the Lakers in one miserable quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With it went their chance to play for the NBA championship and,
perhaps, a little bit of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we sort of made cowards of ourselves in the fourth
quarter,'' Scottie Pippen said. ``We played like we were fatigued,
and they gained the momentum they needed to pull this game out.''
</P>
<P>
   How it happened is open to debate, although the Lakers' defense
was an obvious factor.
</P>
<P>
   Portland was shooting 46 percent from the field through three
quarters, then got harassed into 21.7-percent shooting (5 of 23) in
the final period to allow L.A. to swipe away control.
</P>
<P>
   The misses became contagious, spreading from one player to the
next. The Blazers not only misfired with hands in their faces but
also easy, open looks in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to the fourth quarter, and we just did not make
shots,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavey said. ``I thought that our
execution was pretty good. We didn't turn the ball over, we got
some pretty good looks. They just didn't fall for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was 0 for 3 in the quarter before fouling out with 32
seconds left. Rasheed Wallace, who had 30 points, was 3 of 9. Steve
Smith, Brian Grant and Bonzi Wells were a combined 1 of 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed some shots down the stretch, can't do nothing about
that,'' Wallace said. ``And it's all said and done with now.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland's offensive collapse energized the Lakers, who clamped
down even harder defensively and found a rhythm on offense,
shooting 60 percent (9 of 15) for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw connected on two 3-pointers, the second one tying the game
75-75 with four minutes left, by taking advantage of Shaquille
O'Neal's kickouts off double teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shots were just falling tonight,'' Shaw said. ``They were
doubling the ball, and we were swinging it, and we were open. We
were trying to take what the defense gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the Blazers gave away a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing not to come away with the win,
especially when you feel like you had it in your grasp,'' Greg
Anthony said. ``We just played a really poor fourth quarter.''

FROM A MOMENT, MEMORIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The stars of the moment are Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant. So why am I thinking about Kirk Gibson?
</P>
<P>
   The burning, lasting image is a lob pass and a dunk. So why am I
picturing a back-door slider and a miracle home run?
</P>
<P>
   The result is an NBA championship that is not yet secured but
seems now to be destiny. So why am I recalling a long-ago World
Series?
</P>
<P>
   Because the only way to do justice to the Kobe-to-Shaq lob with
42 seconds left in Sunday's playoff game, to the Lakers comeback it
capped and to the hysteria it launched, is to compare the moment to
Gibson, the Dodgers and October 1988.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be a fan of a certain age to remember the last time
it felt this good to be at an L.A. sports event.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years. The wait just might have been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers go on, as will be expected, to win the NBA Finals
over the Indiana Pacers, then their 89-85 victory in Game 7 of the
Western Conference finals against the Portland Trail Blazers will
go down as one of the signature moments in L.A. sports history.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest since Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were down by 16 late in the third quarter and by 15
with 10 minutes left in the game. The Trail Blazers had outplayed
them from afternoon to evening and were on their way to completing
a momentous comeback of their own - winning the series after
trailing 3 games to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look good,'' Lakers guard Brian Shaw said in the
locker room afterward. ``We had to remind ourselves we had a lot of
time to chip away at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The comeback started innocently enough with an O'Neal hook shot
to make it 75-62. Then Bryant spiked a Bonzi Wells shot, and Shaw
canned a 3-pointer from the left corner. Portland called time out
with 9:36 to play, and they were going crazy in the Staples Center,
19,000 fans in giveaway gold T-shirts putting life in the
first-year arena.
</P>
<P>
   But the best, the loudest, the most golden was yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry's 3-pointer, Bryant's floating jumper, Shaw's
3-pointer to tie the score at 75 with four minutes to play, Horry's
dive and scramble to come up with a critical rebound, O'Neal's bank
shot to give the Lakers their first lead since 5-4. ...
</P>
<P>
   And then ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq falling out of the rafters (to grab) that alley-oop,'' as
Lakers forward Rick Fox described the play.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were up 83-79 by this point. The clock was under 50
seconds. Bryant had the ball at the top of the key. He shook
Scottie Pippen with a crossover dribble, drove to the free-throw
line and threw a pass to the middle of the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Kirk Gibson reached down and away for a Dodgers
championship.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, Shaquille O'Neal reached up and ... up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was, like, `Damn! He closed it off!' '' Bryant said of
O'Neal's catch and dunk.
</P>
<P>
   That put the Lakers ahead by six - and in command.
</P>
<P>
   They were going crazier in the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just seemed to be a capper,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were a lot of plays (that made up the
comeback),'' backup center John Salley said. ``But that one kind of
summed up the way we played. Kobe threw it up high, and Shaq was
just determined to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   All night, the Blazers tried to hold O'Neal down, and mostly
they did, limiting him to 18 points, eight of those on free throws.
</P>
<P>
   And then, look who was coming up ... and up.
</P>
<P>
   It was a where-were-you-when? kind of moment.
</P>
<P>
   You - you in the gold - were lucky to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years ago, I was so sure the Dodgers were cooked in Game
1 of that World Series against the Oakland A's, I watched the
bottom of the ninth on a TV outside the clubhouse doors, wanting to
waste no time gathering the losers' quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, I was so sure the Lakers were done, I was writing down
lines for a column on how they got beat by a better team. (Possible
lead: ``The best team money can buy, indeed!'')
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if it's the Lakers or the Blazers who were the
better team the past two weeks. I don't know if that was the Lakers
stealing Game 7 or the Blazers giving it away.
</P>
<P>
   I do know there was something magical about it, something we'd
have missed if the Lakers had won in five games as they were
supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   And I do know that all of the emptiness L.A. fans have felt
since the city's last great sports moment ... she is gone.

GIVE SHAW A HAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Kobe Bryant hadn't broken his hand last fall,
it's doubtful Brian Shaw would have had such a large hand in
Sunday's memorable comeback victory over Portland.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Shaw promised he would be elsewhere if the Lakers had
not signed him as an emergency measure when Bryant went on the
injured list last November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be in Oakland up in the Bay Area on a fishing boat,''
Shaw said. ``Six-seven months ago, I didn't know where I would be
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's four victories from an NBA title, after hitting two
critical 3-pointers that helped the Lakers overcome a 15-point
fourth-quarter deficit and defeat the Trail Blazers 89-84 in Game 7
of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was nothing short of the Lakers' savior, scoring 11 points
and hitting three 3-pointers overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian Shaw carried us,'' Lakers forward Robert Horry said.
``He made some big shots and got us pumped.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of Shaw's 3-pointers was significant.
</P>
<P>
   --With 4.4 seconds left in the third quarter, Shaw banked in a
26-footer that gave the Lakers a glimmer of hope by cutting a
16-point Portland lead to 13 71-58 entering the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just glad that it went in. I wasn't trying to bank it,
and it went in,'' Shaw said. ``Somebody helped guide it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Lakers guard Ron Harper: ``I don't how he made that
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the shot didn't seem terribly important, but even
Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy singled it out after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big momentum play,'' Dunleavy said. ``It got them
to where they were in striking distance.''
</P>
<P>
   --After Portland rebuilt its lead to 75-60, Shaw helped stop the
Blazers' momentum again with a 24-foot jumper with 9:36 remaining
that brought the Lakers within 10 points (75-65).
</P>
<P>
   --Then came the shot he'll always remember. With the Lakers
trailing 75-72, Shaw saw an opening in the Blazers' defense and
nailed a 25-footer to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't aware what the score was,'' Shaw said. ``I was
just happy the basketball went in. I guess the stars were in
alignment. I've been in a pretty good groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to take what the defense gave me. I was one
of those guys (Portland) didn't count on.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a player the Blazers didn't want. Or couldn't keep.
They traded him to Houston last year in the deal that brought
Scottie Pippen to Portland. But a modest Shaw wasn't about to gloat
or admit any extra satisfaction over knocking a former team out of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very ironic the way it worked out, to play the team I
was on last year,'' Shaw said. ``I'm grateful to their organization
for giving me an opportunity. I didn't consider myself a castoff in
Portland. It just didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets didn't want Shaw either, and he only became a Laker
after being scouted in some local pick-up games when Bryant went
down prior to the season. He's another of Lakers coach Phil
Jackson's old-timers, along with Harper and John Salley.
</P>
<P>
   From Bryant's fateful injury came Sunday's heroics. Shaw was
quick to rank his final 3-pointer that tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, right now, it's the biggest moment of my career,''
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Now all he needs is an NBA ring. He was teammates with Shaquille
O'Neal in Orlando when they took the Magic to the NBA Finals in
1995, only to be swept by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't achieved the ultimate goal,'' Shaw said. ``We
didn't taste victory (in '95). Shaquille and I, we're calling this
the 'ShawShaq Redemption.' ''

Pippen: Plop, plop, fizz, fizz
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This never happened when Michael Jordan was
around.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen never had to lean on the old crutch about bad
officiating, because he could always lean on Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen never had to make big excuses, because he had Michael to
make the big shots.
</P>
<P>
   At long last, a reason for his own high-profile line of
basketball shoes _ Air Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   For the way the wind came out of the Blazers' sails. For the way
the air burst from their tires as if they had run over a bed of
nails at 80 mph. For the way Pippen stood by and let them blow it.
</P>
<P>
   The best team money could buy _ with a $74 million payroll _
turned up counterfeit in the biggest quarter of the season, and
Pippen in his vaunted role as leader looked as phony as a $3 bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Titanic was bigger, but the Blazers went down faster.
Vesuvius erupted without notice and buried Pompeii, but at least
the citizens could see the lava coming.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen and the Blazers went up like the Hindenburg, in a roaring
ball of flames.
</P>
<P>
   Their 89-84 victory in Game 7 of the NBA Western Conference
finals wasn't so much an ascendancy for the Lakers as it was a
complete and devastating Portland collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Think free fall.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-point Blazers lead went over the edge in just a little more
than 10 minutes and so did Pippen's false hopes of being the man
who could carry the banner.
</P>
<P>
   Some guys are born to be the Lone Ranger and others are simply
born to be Tonto.
</P>
<P>
   So while Pippen watched helplessly as the Blazers came unwound,
it was no real surprise to anyone who has followed his career of
riding Jordan's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you remember the Game 7 migraine against the Pistons. Not
if you remember the final 1.8 seconds against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Some horses pull the wagon and others are tied to a rope and
follow it.
</P>
<P>
   On his long-awaited day in the spotlight, Pippen melted like a
wax figure at Madame Tussaud's with just 12 points on 3-for-10
shooting. And when the heat was turned up most in the fourth
quarter, he evaporated faster than a drop of water in a microwave,
taking only three shots and missing every one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Pippen said. ``We realize we sort
of made cowards of ourselves in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody's yellow streak was bigger than Pippen's as the veteran
of six NBA championships with the Bulls never stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   This was the night Pippen finally was going to step out of
Jordan's shadow and instead he was swallowed up by it.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan never would have allowed his team to miss 13 straight
shots and fail to score on nine consecutive possessions in the
fourth quarter. Pippen did.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan never would have been content hanging around the
perimeter and dumping passes inside to Rasheed Wallace or standing
off to the side for clear-outs by Steve Smith. Pippen did.
</P>
<P>
   With the turnabout from a 3-1 deficit nearly complete and the
final game firmly in his hands, it was Pippen who ran the Portland
offense that sputtered and coughed and eventually broke down like a
Chevy Corvair in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   It is a game the LA fans will celebrate for the way the Lakers
got up off the floor and never quit running at Portland. It was a
performance that will go down as the biggest fourth-quarter
comeback in any seventh game of any playoff series in NBA history.
It was a moment that will live on for years just on the image of
Kobe Bryant blowing past Pippen, tossing that lob pass up there
toward the moon and Shaquille O'Neal going almost into orbit to
grab the ball and slam it home.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that will propel the Lakers into the Finals as the
favorites against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a game mostly the Blazers couldn't finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be aggressive and keep taking the ball to the
basket,'' Pippen said. ``But there was a momentum shift and once
that happens, then the officiating tends to shift and it's hard to
stop things then. We were no longer getting the calls we had been
getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq was allowed to camp out in the lane. It became an uphill
battle for us.''
</P>
<P>
   An uphill battle? With a 15-point lead?
</P>
<P>
   What Pippen had to do was what he had preached to everyone he
was doing all season and all through the series _ lead. What Pippen
had to do was show his untested teammates how to stay calm and to
keep functioning when the game was in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   What Pippen had to do was show the Blazers how to go in for the
kill. What he did was watch it all slowly slip away. With Shaq
limited to only nine shots and 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   It was more painful to watch than medieval torture. Pippen
didn't attack the basket. He didn't create shots for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Michael always rowed the boat ashore. Pippen couldn't get an oar
into the water.
</P>
<P>
   This never happened when Jordan was around. It's also why Tonto
never got his own show.
</P>
<P>

AMAZING RALLY LIFTS LAKERS TO FINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The greatest season in recent history nearly
became history until the Los Angeles Lakers at last made history,
with the greatest comeback anyone could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   And made one gigantic, fantastic, heart-stopping leap to the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are Western Conference champions and bound for the
Finals for the first time in nine years, because for one 12-minute
span Sunday, they assumed the identity of a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   Down to their last game of the series, down to their last
quarter, down 15 points to the Portland Trail Blazers, the Lakers
did not wilt.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't flinch. Didn't panic. Or even momentarily consider their
time had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they mounted a spectacular comeback filled with Robert
Horry's tough defense and Brian Shaw's clutch 3-point swishes, Kobe
Bryant's steady playmaking, and one gargantuan,
Oh-my-God-we're-going-to-the-Finals slam dunk by Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The championship banners hanging in the Staples Center rafters
shook, the Blazers fell, and the Lakers pulled out an 89-84 victory
to send 18,997 fans into delirious bliss, and send this franchise
to the championship round for the first time in nine years.
</P>
<P>
   The Finals begin Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers at Staples
Center. As soon as they can clean up all the sweat and confetti
that rained here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took everything we had,'' Glen Rice said. ``Guys had to dig
down deep. It was one of those situations where you had to lay it
all on the line, and that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, it was the biggest comeback in a Western Conference
finals Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficially, it was the biggest game Los Angeles has seen in
over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killer instinct, no?'' Bryant said with a wide smile.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be questioned again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've showed a lot of comeback efforts during the course of
the year, and I thought they had that part of it in them,'' said
coach Phil Jackson, who took just one season to deliver the Lakers
to the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great win for the fans, a great win for this
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   No one but the Lakers saw it coming. They trailed continuously
for most of three quarters in a game that looked very much like the
last two - both losses.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace was scoring at will, Steve Smith was shooting
with precision, and a swarming defense had all but shut down
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   So Jackson, in an early fourth-quarter timeout, gave in.
``Forget about Shaq,'' he told his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we forced the ball into him, we were creating
turnovers, either for Shaq or for us,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers worked the ball around and created their own
opportunities. But Rick Fox hit O'Neal for a bucket to cut the
deficit to 75-62 early in the fourth. Then Brian Shaw hit a
3-pointer. Then Robert Horry grabbed an offensive rebound and hit a
3-pointer, and the deficit was cut to five points with 7:06 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Comeback was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heart and effort,'' Bryant said. ``They outworked us pretty
good the last couple games, and we didn't want it to happen in the
seventh game, particularly on our home floor. So we just brought a
lot of heart and a lot of effort and a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   A Kobe jumper. A Kobe 3-point miss, a Jackson look of
exasperation on the bench. Then a Shaw 3-pointer, and with 4
minutes left, the Lakers had used a 15-0 run to forge the tie,
75-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't panic,'' Fox said. ``No one panicked. We just
continued to recognize the situation we were in. In the third
quarter we recognized, hey, if we were not going to win this game,
we were gonna not win it by fighting, and really giving it a
wholehearted effort. We did things defensively first, and then we
knocked down some shots. Pressure shifted toward them, those shots
didn't fall, and it was a matter of us making big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Horry kept fronting Wallace, who despite scoring a game-high 30
points, kept missing in the fourth. The Blazers missed 13
consecutive shots. And the Lakers kept coming.
</P>
<P>
   Free throws by Bryant and O'Neal gave them the lead, a Bryant
jumper over Scottie Pippen made it a 4-point game. And then came
the crushing blow.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant crossed up Pippen at the top of the key, lofted a perfect
lob to the right side of the hoop, and O'Neal - bottled up for the
last two games - unleashed every last ounce of frustration with a
right-handed jam and a bellowing victory yell.
</P>
<P>
   It was 85-79, with 41.3 seconds left, and the Blazers were done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard for me to get any shots all night,'' O'Neal said.
``We caught eye contact, and he just threw it up. And I just went
up and got it. That was an opportunity for me to get an easy
bucket, because I really didn't get any easy shots all game.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland had used a 21-4 run to take control in the third
quarter building a 16-point lead Jackson called ``daunting'' - but
the Blazers had nothing left for the fourth, which the Lakers won
31-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing not to come away with the win,
especially when you feel like you had it in your grasp. We just
played a really poor fourth quarter,'' said the Blazers' Greg
Anthony. ``For whatever reason, our best just wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers survived a mere 18-point night by O'Neal. They were
carried by Bryant's 25 points, Horry's 12 and 11 each from Rice and
Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been playing hard all game long,'' Bryant said, ``and in
this type of situation, all you can ask for yourself is just to
play hard. We felt like we could play hard for 48 minutes, and we
finally were able to wear them down.''

KOBE FINISHES STRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Not a sore right foot, a hyperactive Damon
Stoudamire, a hot-shooting Steve Smith or a wily Scottie Pippen
could rattle Kobe Bryant on Sunday, in the biggest game of his
young career.
</P>
<P>
   As the Los Angeles Lakers closed out the Western Conference
finals with an 89-84 Game 7 victory over Portland, Bryant took
turns closing down the Trail Blazers' main weapons. Stoudamire went
silent (5 points), while Bryant turned in key runs against the
other two.
</P>
<P>
   Although he collected four fouls, Bryant played without foul
trouble for most of the game, a luxury he hasn't had most of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his defense was really good,'' coach Phil Jackson
said. ``He was allowed to play defense, which is important because
he was aggressive, he was physical, he was active and he did a good
job on everybody we put him on today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's most obvious numbers were the 25 points and seven
assists he posted on offense. But he had 11 defensive rebounds and
blocked four shots - including a Bonzi Wells attempt early in the
fourth quarter, as the Lakers began a comeback from 15 points down.
</P>
<P>
   The right foot Bryant sprained in Game 5 never appeared to be a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took it as a personal challenge,'' he said, ``because I
felt like all series long, they've kind of been going at me, trying
to expose me, trying to get me in foul trouble, and it got to a
point where it really started to get under my skin. I just took it
as a personal challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's free: The Lakers' worst foul shooter Sunday was not
Shaquille O'Neal, who made 8 of 12, and 3 of 4 in the fourth
quarter. The foul-line liability turned out to be the usually
reliable Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant made just 6 of 12 from the line and missed three key free
throws in the fourth - one at the start of the comeback from 15
points down, and two near the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were up 86-82 with 25.4 seconds left when Bryant got
Scottie Pippen to foul out. But Bryant missed both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Horry also went 3 for 6 from the line as the Lakers made
just 10 of 18 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq shooting free throws well down the stretch, that's
something you couldn't depend upon, he did it,'' Jackson said.
``The rest of the guys not shooting free throws well at important
parts, that was a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, a career 81 percent foul shooter, isn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just nip it in the bud for the final series,'' he said. ``Just
forget about it, work on them and just knock them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Advantage: A lack of noise and crowd energy at times this season
made everyone wonder whether Staples Center could provide a
home-court advantage. Jackson himself had called it into question,
but not after Sunday's win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has to go to the hometown fans,'' he said. ``I think that
game is one that you have to count on as a home-court advantage
because of the energy that our fans gave us in that fourth
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brian Shaw, who fired up the masses with two big 3-pointers
in the fourth, ``It was pretty special today. Everybody in the
crowd stayed until the very end. That is what home-court advantage
is all about.''

FINALS ARE FOR THE BIRDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don't know who wanted the Los Angeles Lakers in
the NBA grand finale more, the Peacock or the Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, listenin' to Magic coach that team out there for a
while, we may have a shot at it,'' Larry Legend joked after his
Pacers polished off the Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Listenin' to Magic complain to Ahmad Rashad right before the
fourth quarter about how we ... uh, the Lakers ... were stinkin' it
up against the Blazers, sounds like he still is trying motivational
tactics.
</P>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That was some trick, making someone 7 feet 1 and
335 pounds disappear before a watching nation. Either Houdini had
slipped into a Trail Blazers uniform, or Shaquille O'Neal had
slipped out of the building.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is supposed to be basketball's most unstoppable force,
but the Portland Trail Blazers had somehow managed to reduce him to
Elden Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   This was the biggest game of O'Neal's Laker life, the game where
he was supposed to prove he really was the MVP, really had cause
for that ``S'' emblazoned all over everything he owns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for three quarters Sunday, O'Neal had made exactly two field
goals. He had taken but six shots and pulled down five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Portland hadn't given anything this much attention since Mount
St. Helens.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh game of the Western Conference finals, with a
trip to the Finals awaiting the winner, the Los Angeles Lakers
trailed 71-58, and O'Neal was looking at a long summer of
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   And then the strangest thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Portland was up by 15 early in the fourth quarter, when for one
of the few times on the night, O'Neal got the ball inside and
connected on a layup. It seemed innocent enough, but it started
perhaps the greatest comeback in Lakers history.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers went on a 15-0 run to catch the Blazers. O'Neal had
emerged from the phone booth. After Portland center Arvydas Sabonis
fouled out with 2:44 to play, O'Neal capped what was an overall
25-4 run when he electrified the crowd by skying to reach a Kobe
Bryant pass above the basket and slamming it through the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had a stunning 85-79 lead with 41.9 seconds to play,
and ready or not, were going to The Finals.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had nine points, four rebounds and an assist in the
fourth- quarter comeback. And something added to his reputation,
instead of subtracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got the guys together and said, `Let's ----ing go.
We've been here before. We've got to do it,''' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `We've come too far now to let it all slip away. Let's fight
and scratch. Let's crawl. Let's hit shots. Let's do it. They're not
going to let me shoot anyway, so just throw it down. I'm going to
let them come scramble and then kick it out. Make me look good.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was the wiser, more mature O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Portland has played him better in this series than any team he
had faced in his Lakers career. They had a big body in the 7-3
Sabonis to matchup against him, and were quick to double- and
triple-team him with 6-11 Rasheed Wallace and the long-armed
Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could seldom work the ball inside, and when they did,
the Blazers often fouled so quickly, O'Neal didn't have time to get
off a shot.
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers fell further behind, his frustration grew, but he
kept it hidden. The Big Man was not being given a chance by the
Blazers to have a big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little frustrated, but I just hung in there and never
really gave up,'' O'Neal said. ``I could tell early that my guys
were going to hit their shots. I knew my guys were focused and
ready, so I was just trying to do all the little things.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he was doing too little when the Lakers fell behind by as
many as 16 at the close of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was frustrated, but maybe that's because I know him
pretty well,'' Laker Brian Shaw said. ``But he never really let
anybody else see him like that. He kept his head up, kept his wits
about him, and continued to do what he needed to do and not let us
see him down. And I think that was very important to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw - O'Neal's former teammate in Orlando - hit three
3-pointers in the second half to help spark the comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why this is a team game,'' said Laker Robert Horry, who
had six points in the final quarter. ``We always count on him for
90 percent of our offense, but we've got to be a team. It's just up
to us to help him out. We can't always depend on him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was back in the building, and the Lakers back in the
Finals.

   LOS ANGELES _ The best team that money supposedly could buy came
up looking like Confederate currency when it came time to be
counted. For that, the Lakers are going to the NBA Finals. That
huge exhale you heard was from the executives over at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, down by 13 after three and by 15 with 10:28 to play,
took advantage of a monumental Portland meltdown in the fourth
quarter and won Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's dramatic Game 7, 89-84, before a
yellow-clad sellout at Staples Center. They will face Indiana in
the Finals, which begin here Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, a $73 million ensemble of All-Stars and Olympians,
looked like your basic Biddy Ball team when it came time to close
the deal. ``We realize we were sort of made cowards,'' said Scottie
Pippen, the six-time champion brought in to prevent such
happenings. The Blazers were outscored, 31-13, in the quarter. They
shot 5 for 23. They went 7:30 without a point and 8:11 without a
basket, missing 14 straight shots over that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Pippen, who was 3 for 10 and
finished with 12 points, none in the fourth. ``We lost this game in
one quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   How true. The Lakers are lucky to be where they are this
morning. They were hardly overwhelming, more like the long-lost
beneficiary of a will. But it was impossible for them not to
benefit from such largesse. They were down by 15 with 10:28 left.
They were tied with 4:00 to play. They missed 17 free throws in the
game, lost the turnover battle, and still won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen one quite like this,'' said LA coach Phil
Jackson, who has seen just about everything.
</P>
<P>
   Portland led, 75-60, when a second-chance layup by Shaquille
O'Neal got the rally rolling. Kobe Bryant (11 rebounds, 7 assists,
4 blocks) then swatted away a Bonzi Wells drive and the Lakers were
on their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a statement to them,'' Bryant said of the block.
``That was a statement to them that we were not going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw then hit the first of his two treys and the lead
quickly was 10. A Blazer timeout did nothing. Kobe (a free throw)
and Shaq (a free throw) cut it to 8 and then Robert Horry, who has
been bricking treys all series, knocked one down to make it 75-70.
Rasheed Wallace (30 points, but 3 for 9 in the fourth) then missed
and Bryant converted from the lane. Shaw then tied the game with
his second trey of the run and third of the game. His first was a
biggie at the end of the third quarter, cutting the lead from 16 to
13.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went at it, little by little,'' said Shaw, who, along
with O'Neal will be making his second visit to the NBA Finals. Both
were on the 1995 Orlando team that was swept by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazer drought ended with a Wallace finger roll with 2:58 to
play. That made it 77-75 and was Portland's last lead of the game.
There would be two more ties, the final one with 1:50 left (at 79)
after a Shaq goaltend.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bryant drove to the basket and got fouled by Wallace.
Bryant was a bit shaky at the line all night _ 6 for 12 _ but he
knocked these two down. Wallace then had the same opportunity nine
seconds later. He missed them both. Kobe (a jumper) and Shaq (a
high alley-oop from Bryant) blew the lead out to 6 and that was
that.
</P>
<P>
   Portland coach Mike Dunleavy sounded afterward as if he had
missed the entire quarter. He talked about how he was proud his
team had played 48 minutes _ he was off by 12 _ and how the Blazers
got good looks but simply didn't put the ball in the basket. The
last time we checked, that's how points are scored and games are
won.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave it a great run,'' he said of his team. ``A lot of
people wrote us off, during the season and during the series.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad it had to end in such calamitous fashion for
Portland. No one will remember the way the Blazers took the crowd
out of the game with a 13-0 first-quarter run. Or how they hung in
there despite early foul trouble to Arvydas Sabonis and Brian
Grant. Or how they shackled Shaq, who was a mere 5 for 9 from the
field. Or how they put on a clinic in the third quarter, going on
an 18-2 run and getting the lead to 16 with 20.6 seconds left in
the third.
</P>
<P>
   No one will remember any of that except the loyalists at the
Blazers Boosters Club. This one came down to winnin' time, a
familiar phrase here in the 1980s. The new Lakers may not be as
good or as successful as their predecessors, but they, like them,
know what to do when the game is on the line. They went out and won
it.

 PM-CLINTON-MISSILES05-COX &HT;    CLINTON PITCHES MISSILE DEFENSE TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton took his case for a new U.S. missile
defense system directly to the Russian people and their elected
representatives Monday, telling them the proposed shield poses no
threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In nationally televised remarks before the Russian parliament,
Clinton said it was ``inconceivable'' that the United States would
deploy such a system without working closely with Moscow to keep
from renewing an arms race between the world's two largest nuclear
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find any future apart from cooperation with you in the
nuclear area inconceivable,'' he said. ``The real question is a
debate over what the impact of this will be, because of the
capacity of the technology involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks capped a three-day visit to Moscow centered on tough
talks with President Vladimir Putin over missile defense and
nuclear weapons reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The first American president ever to address Russia's
parliament, Clinton left Moscow afterwards and flew to Kiev for an
afternoon of meetings with President Leonid Kuchma of the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to return to Washington late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In about eight hours of face-to-face summitry in Moscow, Clinton
was unable to overcome Putin's objections to a national missile
defense system to defend the United States from a missile attack by
a rogue state or terrorist group. The president is to decide this
fall whether to proceed with development of the system, which is
now being tested by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   He made a pitch for Russian acceptance of the system in a joint
speech before the 450-member Duma, the key legislative body, and
the 178-member Federation Council. Not all members were in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The system is aimed at protecting the United States from the
threat that a rogue state or terrorist group might one day try to
attack the country with a nuclear missile.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told Clinton the risk of such attack was being exaggerated
by advocates of the system, and that deploying it could cause more
harm than good by upsetting the balance of power between the United
States and Russia. Together, the two nations possess more than 80
percent of the world's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pleaded with Russians to think carefully about how
quickly global security is being changed by the wide availability
of new technology and information that will soon make it possible
for many new actors to acquire advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be realistic,'' said Clinton. ``Despite our best
efforts, the possibility exists that nuclear and other deadly
weapons will fall into dangerous hands, into hands that could
threaten us both.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ``the technology required to launch missiles
capable of delivering them over long distances, unfortunately, is
still spreading across the world. The question is, what is the best
way to deal with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his comments during a 45-minute speech meant to be
a grand survey of U.S.-Russian relations at a time of historic
turmoil inside the former superpower.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the Russian people to continue their difficult journey
from communist autocracy to free-market democracy and stressed the
need to build the elements of a civil society based on the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Above all,'' said Clinton, ``a strong state should use its
strength to reinforce the rule of law, protect the powerless
against the powerful, defend democratic freedoms, including freedom
of expression, religion and the press, and do whatever is possible
to give everyone a chance to develop his or her innate abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message ran into heavy weather, though, in the form of
parliament member Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist who
has built a political career by decrying the collapse of the former
Soviet Union and the subsequent decline of living standards across
the Russian motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Seated 14 rows away from Clinton, Zhirinovsky grumbled loudly
when the president was introduced. As applause filled the chamber
at the end of the speech, he hollered out to his colleagues, ``Why
are you applauding for him? He destroyed our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky led several dozen protesters _ some chanting
``Yankee go home,'' and ``U.S. out of Serbia _ outside of the Duma
building, while others waved red Soviet-era flags bearing the
hammer and sickle symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has poured money into Russia, and after
eight years, what has happened? It has brought to power a KGB
colonel, those whom the United States was fighting against on the
dollars of U.S. taxpayers,'' said parliament member Alexei
Mitrofanov, the number two man in Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is worse for most Russians after ten years of reform,''
Mitrofanov told American reporters immediately after Clinton's
speech. ``Clinton understands nothing of this.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Elian affair shows flaws in Cuban policy
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Elian goes home _ and it now seems all but certain that he
will _ perhaps he will leave us with something useful: a new
appreciation of just how goofy our Cuban policy has become.
</P>
<P>
   The boy should have been out of here six months ago, as soon as
he had recovered from his traumatic rescue and as quickly as
arrangements could be made for his father to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead _ famously, flamboyantly _ he became one of those
wildfire cause celebres that take over a whole era of news cycles,
only to wind up within a few years as a puzzling footnote, if even
that, to the real history of its time.
</P>
<P>
   The Castro-addled Miami Cuban community went ritually bananas
over his prospective return, claiming stronger stewardship resided
with cousins umpteen times removed than with the boy's dad. (A
claim based mainly on the finders-keepers taunt.) A whole
jurisprudence was jerry-built around the boy, like a mining camp
thrown up overnight after gold is struck.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics was sucked in, as Democratic nominee-to-be
Al Gore hurried to the TV cameras to pander for votes that just
might tip Florida his way. (GOP rival George W. Bush was
pre-pandered.)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration dithered for weeks, a wet finger to
the political winds, until finally deciding, oh, what the heck,
let's just follow the law.
</P>
<P>
   All of this because U.S. policy continues to be swung by that
tiny but hugely noisy electoral fraction at the tip of Florida,
allied elsewhere, especially in Congress, to a scatteration of
vestigial Cold Warriors with precious little war left to wage.
</P>
<P>
   Look, Fidel Castro is an enemy of his people's freedom. He is,
if not exactly a dictator, unilateral, pre-emptive and arbitrary.
His persistence in a failed command economy has reduced his nation
and its people to a shabby poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to love or endorse the aging autocrat to
recognize that the generation-old U.S. effort to isolate and
undermine his regime 1) doesn't and can't work and 2) has outlived
whatever usefulness it once had.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economic boycott of Cuba and grant of extraordinary
refuge to Cubans were meant to parry Castro's ability to play the
willing cat's paw for Soviet mischief in the hemisphere. That
ability ended when communism flopped in Russia and the Kremlin
stopped sending checks. All that remains of Cuba's revolutionary
fervor are a few wan and feeble gestures at pro forma rallies.
</P>
<P>
   The current U.S. interest lies in repairing relations in a way
that prepares for Castro's inevitable slump from power. That means
re-establishing commerce as a counterweight to Cuban economic
slide. Do we really want Haiti II just offshore? And it means
establishing a working political relationship that can prevent
further nonsense like the Elian affair.
</P>
<P>
   We just cut a permanent trade deal with China, for goodness
sakes, the mother of communist populations. It's time to develop a
Cuban policy. For years, we've only had a Castro policy.

   Perhaps it was inevitable that as the Internet began permeating
the culture, the techie language that was once confined to
textbooks and instruction manuals would begin to sound beautiful,
or at least pretty enough to sing. Physicists, who among other
things invented the World Wide Web, have been quick to realize that
their lexicon is no longer too obscure for pop songs.

   ``The language is so lyrical, and I think it lends itself to
poetry,'' said Lynda Williams, also known as the Physics Chanteuse.
</P>
<P>
   ```Boson, get it on,''' she continued, referring to a species of
subatomic particle. ``You know, everything rhymes.''
</P>
<P>
   Other thriving acts, like the Chromatics, an a cappella group,
and Les Horribles Cernettes, a doo-wop band from Geneva, harmonize
about everything from gamma rays to quarks to quantum theory.

   Will the Cernettes' ``Liquid Nitrogen'' hit the Top 40? Probably
not. But then again, maybe audiophiles should reserve space in
their collections for a coming invasion of warbling scientists.

a CD titled ``Cosmic Cabaret,'' a sort of greatest hits collection.

</P>
<P>
   Life on Earth is carbon based.
</P>
<P>
   It came here on rocks from outer space
</P>
<P>
   and formed organic compounds till
</P>
<P>
   the carbon-cycle went round and round!
</P>
<P>
   Carbon is a girl's best friend! ...
</P>
<P>
   Cuz time rolls on and supplies will be gone
</P>
<P>
   of diamonds, coal and petroleum.

   &UR; ANOTHER LIFE: A Memoir of Other People &LR;  By Michael Korda.
Delta, $14.95. A perpetually optimistic book editor recalls his
many years at Simon &AMP; Schuster and his encounters with nearly
everybody who is anybody, from Richard Nixon to Joan Crawford.
``Korda's tone of voice is affectionate and urbane, his manner that
of the accomplished raconteur who never spoils the story with a
heavy-handed moral,'' Lewis Lapham wrote in The New York Times Book
Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAYOVER &LR;  By Lisa Zeidner. Perennial, $13. Claire Newbold is a
successful middle-aged saleswoman who, after the death of her
3-year-old son and her husband's infidelity, simply refuses to go
home one day. Instead, she embarks on an odyssey of lust,
seduction, forbidden desire and furtive hotel hopping. ``The novel
rocks with a lot of great, sexy scenes, in which Zeidner's fine
writing is on glorious display,'' Karen Karbo wrote in The New York
Times Book Review in 1999. ``With `Layover,' Zeidner joins the
ranks of Doris Lessing, Margaret Atwood and Fay Weldon, all of whom
have written in the women-spiraling-into-madness genre.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST: A History of Financial Speculation &LR;  By
Edward Chancellor. Plume, $13.95. The author employs ballads,
newspaper articles and gossip in this tour of speculative manias, a
long trail of wild dreams, burst bubbles and lost fortunes
stretching back to the 17th century. Last year the reviewer Adam
Smith praised the book's ``admirable scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIPPING THE VELVET &LR;  By Sarah Waters. Riverhead, $13.95. The
heroine of this erotic first novel is a wide-eyed girl who falls
for a music-hall actress in late Victorian England. This
infatuation leads to heartbreak and a harrowing (if ultimately
redeemed) life as a cross-dresser and kept woman in the back alleys
and elegant homes of London. ``If lesbian fiction is to reach a
wider readership ... Waters is just the person to carry the
banner,'' Miranda Seymour wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY PILGRIM'S PROGRESS: Media Studies, 1950-1998 &LR;  By George W.S.
Trow. Vintage, $13. This book-length essay is not so much about
media as it is a social history of the decline of patrician New
York and the loss of authority once wielded by traditionally
civilized people like the author. Trow is ``an inspired close
reader of all the stuff we gloss, graze and glance at,'' Gerald
Marzorati wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SEA CAME IN AT MIDNIGHT &LR;  By Steve Erickson. Perennial, $14.
This apocalyptic novel revolves around a girl with a twisted past
who hooks up with an obsessive millennial freak; other plot lines
involve a creator of improbable maps and an illicit trade in time
capsules. ``The various stories mesh together at the level of
verbal echo and poetic metaphor,'' Geoff Nicholson wrote last year.
``Erickson also writes brilliantly sentence by sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LADIES FROM ST. PETERSBURG: Three Novellas &LR;  By Nina
Berberova. New Directions, $12.95. This posthumous collection
revolves around themes of flight and exile from Mother Russia, and
is steeped in an unromantic view of the author's homeland. In 1998
the reviewer Ken Kalfus admired ``the lucidity of ... Berberova's
prose and the deftness of her characterizations.''
</P>
<P>
   New Directions has also reissued  &UR; THE BLUE LANTERN: And Other
Stories &LR; , by Victor Pelevin ($12.95), in which irony, dark humor
and existential musings are given free rein in the strange
landscape of post-Soviet Russia. Pelevin continues to ``gnaw at our
confidence in conventional reality, like a dog worrying a bone,''
Kalfus wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROME AND A VILLA &LR;  By Eleanor Clark. Steerforth Italia, $18.
This series of rapturous sketches of postwar Rome and its people,
originally published in 1952 and updated in 1974, displays Clark's
``genius for attention, observation and recording'' and ``a true
sense and love of the grand, the tragic, the beautiful,'' Katherine
Anne Porter wrote in The New York Times Book Review.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE MIRACLE OF CASTEL DI SANGRO &LR; , by Joe McGinniss
(Broadway, $14.95), the author of ``Fatal Vision'' travels to a
remote Italian village to chronicle the efforts of the local soccer
team to recreate its Cinderella season of a year earlier. The
result is ``an engaging tale well worth telling, rich in comic
incidents, delightful characters and dramatic surprises,'' Bill
Barich wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIDNIGHTS: A Year With the Wellfleet Police &LR;  By Alec Wilkinson.
Ruminator, $14. At the age of 23, the author spent a year as a
rookie policeman on the nine-man force in a small town on Cape Cod.
His account of the trials and tedium of life in uniform ``enchants
the reader into caring about the subject and wanting to read on,''
Peter Benchley wrote in 1982. ``His perceptions of and compassion
for his fellow officers are profound.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS &LR;  By David Guterson. Harvest/Harcourt,
$14. A Seattle heart doctor who is dying of cancer sets out for the
high deserts and canyons of eastern Washington with his two dogs to
commit suicide. ``When Guterson is at his best, the story and the
landscape nearly become one,'' Robert Sullivan wrote in 1999.

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The war between Ethiopia and Eritrea is often
described as the most deadly in the world, fought on terrain of
little consequence while millions of people in two very poor
countries face starvation. This is all true.
</P>
<P>
   But the war _ which may finally be winding down after two years
_ is also something else, something that has become quite rare: A
war fought between the regular armies of two nations, in which both
sides generally follow the rules of war.
</P>
<P>
   It is an irony that while civilian deaths from the side effects
of war are so high, direct civilian casualties from combat are
quite low. And neither side is accused of gross violations of human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in short, a very old-fashioned kind of war, the only
clearly defined conflict in the world right now between two nations
(though India and Pakistan exchange artillery fire and the armies
of Rwanda and Uganda have skirmished recently in a third country,
Congo).
</P>
<P>
   Even the fighting itself has a tinge of sepia to it: Armies
lined up in trenches battle in close quarters, in contrast to the
remote-control technological wars that rich nations favor these
days.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to suggest in any way that this is a quaint or
``good'' war. But as Chris Bowers, a spokesman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, put it: ``It certainly
has a different character, and that is important to note.''
</P>
<P>
   In Africa since the Cold War ended, there has been a great deal
of conflict but hardly any between nations. This pattern dates to
the 1960s, when Africans gained their independence from Europe and
the newly-formed Organization of African Unity forbade African
nations from fighting each other directly. With few exceptions,
they haven't, out of concern for self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the wars in Africa have tended to be internal explosions
of ethnic violence, as in Rwanda or Burundi, or of flat-out greed
masquerading as a liberation struggle, as in Angola or Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Civilians are often the targets in these wars: ethnic rivals are
slaughtered in Rwanda; children's limbs are hacked off in Sierra
Leone. Almost any hospital at any time in eastern Congo will have
patients _ sliced in the head with machetes, pocked with bullet
holes _ who have been caught in the fighting from one of the
uncountable factions there.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia and Eritrea went to war in May 1998. Unlike many
conflicts in Africa, which are the result of states falling apart,
this was in many ways about people defining themselves as nations.
Once an Italian colony, then a British protectorate, Eritrea was
formally annexed in 1962 by the Ethiopian emperor, Haile Selassie,
to become Ethiopia's northernmost province. In 1991, guerrillas
from both Eritrea and Ethiopia defeated Mengistu Haile Mariam, who
had ousted the emperor in 1974, and in 1993 Eritrea peacefully
became a new nation.
</P>
<P>
   But its borders were not defined and good relations with
Ethiopia never developed. So a series of border skirmishes exploded
into all-out war that the leaders of neither side had the strength
to stop.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ethiopia and Eritrea were until recently united, it
could be argued that this war is just barely one between states.
But they have fought as if it was. There were two trained armies
lined up across trenches, with tanks, planes and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   A military analyst in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa,
believes this is why Eritrea has done so badly against an Ethiopian
offensive launched on May 12: The Eritreans, he said, were
excellent guerrilla fighters during their 30-year struggle against
the emperor and then the Mengistu regime. But once they had to
fight a conventional war, the analyst said: ``They didn't have
clue. Maybe the fact that they are sovereign nation and think of
themselves as a sovereign nation induced them to fight a battle
they didn't know how to fight.'' (The Eritreans say they were not
defeated militarily at all, but simply withdrew to save lives and
fight on their own terms.)
</P>
<P>
   Early in the war, Ethiopia bombed what it said were military
sites in the Eritrean capital, Asmara, and Eritrea bombed a school
in the northern Ethiopian town of Mekele. Amnesty International has
said ``dozens'' of civilians were killed in the first round of
fighting. But since then, civilians have for the most part been
moved away from the fronts, minimizing the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the last two weeks _ as Ethiopia drove north away from
the trenches and into Eritrean territory _ there have been few
reports of civilians killed, no more than a handful on either side.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, all of that may make little difference in
the impact the war is having on these desperately poor societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The humanitarian disaster has been drought and famine
affecting both countries,'' said Martin Hill, the Amnesty
International researcher in London who follows the wars on the Horn
of Africa. ``Fortunately there hasn't been another humanitarian
disaster of killings of civilians or killing fleeing refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hill suggests, this war may have been played more by the
rules than others in Africa, but there is no taming war itself.
Ultimately, it has been extraordinarily costly.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this latest round of fighting, it was estimated that
this very conventional war had ended the lives of at least 20,000
soldiers. Last year, President Clinton put the number of dead at
70,000.
</P>
<P>
   And that is far from the only cost. There is also the question
of resources: The war diverted perhaps $1 billion that could have
gone toward development. Both nations are among the poorest in the
world and have fought at a time when 8 million Ethiopians and some
770,000 Eritreans faced severe food shortages begun by drought and
worsened by war.
</P>
<P>
   It is also estimated that some 550,000 Eritreans have been
pushed from their homes by the latest round of fighting _ most of
them in the most fertile agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations now have representatives in Algeria to talk
about peace, but there has been no cease-fire and nobody is going
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a very severe effect on civilians,'' Bowers
said. ``The food situation was not great beforehand. And this is
not going to make it any better.''

A VERBAL WAY TO STAND TALL  
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some months back, I took my 2{-year-old son to the pediatrician
for a checkup and got some unexpected news: he had shrunk half an
inch from his previous visit.
</P>
<P>
   No cause for alarm here. The explanation was simple enough: for
the first time, Clement had been measured standing up, not lying
down fidgeting on the crinkly paper that covered the examination
table. With this one giant leap into toddlerhood, he had,
paradoxically, shrunk a bit in stature.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal. Except that my son is already on the short end of
the height spectrum _ something of a family trait, if truth be told
_ and he could really use that half inch.
</P>
<P>
   So in the admittedly unlikely event that the question of size
comes up among his pals as they tool around the sandbox, I will not
be surprised if he lies, reclaiming that stolen half inch and maybe
even adding on another for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Clement would be in a good company. A study appearing
this month in the American Statistical Association Proceedings
reports that many Americans appear to lie about their height. Not
weight or age, though they lie about that, too. Height.
</P>
<P>
   How do we know this?
</P>
<P>
   Because researchers at St. Louis University were curious about
the accuracy of the self-reported data used in many health studies
and decided to do a little comparison. The term refers to personal
information gathered from people who volunteer it to researchers
without benefit of physical exams. If the data is inaccurate, the
results of the surveys can be skewed.
</P>
<P>
   William Hart, the nutrition and dietetics professor who led the
study, compared the heights and weights reported by subjects in one
survey with figures from another in which people were examined. He
and his colleagues took self-reported data offered by more than
6,000 people who participated in the National Health Interview
Surveys from 1988 to 1994, and put them up against actual
measurements from the more than 500,000 people examined in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that many people fudged their weight _ not
a complete surprise. But they were not prepared for the number of
people who seem to have volunteered inaccurate information about
their height.
</P>
<P>
   From ages 20 to 84, men and women exaggerated. Indeed, more
people were inclined to overstate their height than to understate
their weight.
</P>
<P>
   For health experts, the main cause of concern is not the
prevarication itself but something perhaps more serious. If the
researchers are right, Americans, already among the most obese
people in the world, could be in worse shape than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did not offer any theories for the
misrepresentation. ``Psychosocial explanations can be postulated,
but not confirmed with this data,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a psychosociologist, however, to understand why
Americans would want to be taller. Height is often equated with
power, wealth and even intelligence, said Jennifer Taylor, a
clinical psychologist at Harvard University's McLean Hospital.
``It's something that's culturally ingrained from very early on,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Just consider the sight of two schoolchildren, back to back,
trying to see who is taller _ with one or both sneaking onto
tiptoes. Even in politics, presidential candidates who are taller
are often considered to have an edge over their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Where psychosociology might come in handy is in explaining why
people would believe they could get away with lying about height.
If you decide to shave 10 pounds off your weight, who can be sure?
If you say you're five years younger, who is going to argue?
</P>
<P>
   But asking others to believe you are a couple of inches taller
than you are, when they need only compare your stature with theirs,
is another matter entirely. It requires not just an absence of
skepticism on their part but actual complicity. It's the kind of
thing that could happen only if everybody were lying about height.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another explanation is that many people don't really
know their own height, some experts say. There are few occasions in
adulthood when it is taken. And in the end, it may simply be that
people are engaging not so much in deceit as in wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: My position is that I am 5 feet 4 inches. My wife
labors under the mistaken impression that she is 5 feet 4{ inches _
which is physically impossible, of course, because she is about 2
inches taller than I am. (Want more proof she's wrong? The other
day, after I told him how tall I was, my brother declared that he
was 5 feet 5. And yet he is shorter than my wife.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lying is such an ugly word. It is true that the last
time I was measured by a doctor, my height was not recorded as 5
feet 4. But maybe they got it wrong. It would not be surprising,
since they measured me when I was standing up.

<P>
   Just consider the sight of two schoolchildren, back to back,
trying to see who is taller _ with one or both sneaking onto
tiptoes. Even in politics, presidential candidates who are taller
are often considered to have an edge over their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Where psychosociology might come in handy is in explaining why
people would believe they could get away with lying about height.
If you decide to shave 10 pounds off your weight, who can be sure?
If you say you're five years younger, who is going to argue?
</P>
<P>
   But asking others to believe you are a couple of inches taller
than you are, when they need only compare your stature with theirs,
is another matter entirely. It requires not just an absence of
skepticism on their part but actual complicity. It's the kind of
thing that could happen only if everybody were lying about height.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, another explanation is that many people don't really
know their own height, some experts say. There are few occasions in
adulthood when it is taken. And in the end, it may simply be that
people are engaging not so much in deceit as in wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: My position is that I am 5 feet 4 inches. My wife
labors under the mistaken impression that she is 5 feet 4{ inches _
which is physically impossible, of course, because she is about 2
inches taller than I am. (Want more proof she's wrong? The other
day, after I told him how tall I was, my brother declared that he
was 5 feet 5. And yet he is shorter than my wife.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lying is such an ugly word. It is true that the last
time I was measured by a doctor, my height was not recorded as 5
feet 4. But maybe they got it wrong. It would not be surprising,
since they measured me when I was standing up.

TO WIN THE PEACE YOU DANCE WITH THE DEVIL

   LONDON _ Northern Ireland is locked in a grim struggle to trade
in tested old tribal instincts for risky new communal ones, and the
qualms and tensions in that swap were on display last week in
Belfast in the actions of a central figure in the peace
negotiations, David Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend Trimble, leader of the province's largest
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, revived what has been a
repeatedly jeopardized peace accord by persuading his quarrelsome,
doubting rank and file to trust in the disarmament promises of its
Catholic sworn enemies in Sinn Fein, which represents the Irish
Republican Army. Supporters of the 1998 accord, which aims to end
three decades of violence with the creation of power-sharing
political institutions, promptly praised him for his courage and
vision _ virtues infrequent in Ulster politics.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after achieving his narrow victory, Trimble stepped out
into the luminous gallery of glass-sheathed Waterfront Hall, which
is itself a symbol of a brighter future for the conflicted
province, and promptly reverted to an all-too-familiar
name-calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as democracy is concerned,'' he said of the Sinn Fein
politicians whose word he was championing moments before, ``these
folk ain't house-trained yet.'' They would have to be ``brought to
heel,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the opposition dogs and worse is standard-issue oratory
in Northern Ireland, where insult is the common currency of public
dialogue. One of those consigned by Trimble to the kennel, Sinn
Fein Assemblyman Alex Maskey, robustly protested the crude allusion
but quickly added that it was probably something the Ulster
Unionist leader felt impelled to say to keep party hard-liners on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this kind of grudging acceptance of each other's
atavistic imperatives has emerged a sense of sameness between two
rival communities that have spent generations fighting to maintain
their differences. It may not be the ultimate equality that
reformers are seeking, but it is a kind of companion conduct that
suggests consensual politics may stand a chance in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner was the home rule government up and running last week
than Sinn Fein dominated debate with an argument over whether its
ministers would allow the British flag to fly over public buildings
they now occupied. It was telling behavior for a party that has
regularly mocked Protestants for devoting so little time to real
issues and so much to symbolic ones like defending their right to
wave banners and parade around the province in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble finally got his delegates' support for going into
government with Sinn Fein by warning that if they voted no, they
would be banishing themselves to the margins and leaving the main
arena to their opponents. His point _ one that has taken time to
dawn on his tradition-bound audience and produced the support of
only a slight majority _ was that the only way to keep power was to
share it. Continue trying to hold onto all of it, he was saying,
and there's the unenviable possibility of ending up with none of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Summoning his party to the center was a daring bid because it is
the fringes that often are more alluring to Ulster politicians.
George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator who brokered the original
peace agreement, once commented that while the normal movement of
politics in Western societies was toward the middle space of
reconciliation, in Northern Ireland it was toward the poles of
defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has been in both places.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1944 in Bangor, a seaside resort in County Down, and
formerly a law professor, Trimble had his first political
involvement on the clamorous right wing of the unionists, whose
unionism sprang from a wish that Northern Ireland remain part of
the United Kingdom. He joined the Ulster Vanguard, which was formed
in 1972 to confront the more mainstream Ulster Unionists, and took
an active part in the hard-line protests that helped end the
Sunningdale Agreement in 1974, which was the last attempt at
power-sharing in the province.
</P>
<P>
   A result of that agitation was to bring down the home rule
government of Brian Faulkner, a Protestant moderate who occupied
the same position then, premier of Northern Ireland, that Trimble
does today as first minister.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper Bann district that he has represented in the British
Parliament since 1990 includes the town of Portadown, known as the
citadel of the militant Orange Order. It has been the scene of
violent standoffs every summer when the black-suited ``brethren''
in their bowler hats and orange sashes have tried to take their
parade commemorating centuries-old Protestant triumphs from
Drumcree Church along a road that wends through Catholic
neighborhoods. In 1995 Trimble attracted attention by leading the
marchers into a police formation blocking their path, hurling
himself against a patrolman and giving the officers a red-faced,
finger-wagging lecture. When the Orangemen penetrated the police
lines and reached their destination at the Portadown Orange Lodge,
he danced a victory jig arm in arm with the Rev. Ian Paisley, the
preacher-politician who is the best-known opponent of any
accommodation with Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1998, but just years earlier,
he was making his mark by acting rude, truculent and spiteful, his
occasional smiles tight, joyless and disdainful. Hardly a matinee
idol today, he has mellowed into a more relaxed and broadly
persuasive orator, indulging in the occasional hot-tempered
flashback as a reminder that his more primitive past still lurks.
</P>
<P>
   These days he is denounced by Paisley as a Judas, and Trimble's
picture hangs in a hut on Drumcree Hill, altered to show satanic
horns protruding from his forehead. His party has traditionally
been most comfortable saying no, and only 53 percent of the 862
ruling council members chose to say yes to accepting the IRA
pledges on disarmament and participating in government with Sinn
Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments, the two sponsors of the peace
effort, both believe that Trimble is the only person on the
Protestant side capable of maintaining progress in putting into
place the power-sharing arrangements that have continually
faltered. Sinn Fein also appreciates his fundamental value, and the
biggest threat to him now comes from his own co-religionists. There
will be lots of tactical maneuvering among them to try to undo what
he has done, and his leadership is sure to be challenged again.
</P>
<P>
   To the task of dealing with this crafty enemy within, Trimble
brings an important qualification. He was until recently one of
them himself.

T WO ELECTIONS ON AN ISLAND. SO CLOSE, SO FAR APART 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Wilda Severe carried the future in her
mind and body as she waited to cast her ballot last month in
Haiti's legislative elections. Though five months pregnant, she
stood for hours on a slowly moving line, hoping that her vote would
usher in a better life for her baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the conditions of the country to change,'' she said.
``The conditions are not good for anybody right now. People suffer
and there is no work. And there is insecurity. The country is still
not at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   More than five years after a U.S.-led military occupation
restored democratic rule in Haiti, the civil serenity that she and
many Haitians hoped for remains elusive. In the weeks before the
elections, politically motivated violence had left 15 people dead,
and in the slums the sense of poverty only deepened.
</P>
<P>
   When the last U.S. troops left Haiti this year, some policy
makers saw it as the end of a successful mission to restore
democracy. But the fact that the elections (in which former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party did well) found so many
Haitians still pining for peace and progress belies any boast. It
raises questions about why Haiti seems to stagger from crisis to
crisis as it tries to embark on the path to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of an answer lies just a short flight away in the Dominican
Republic _ a nation that shares not just the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti, but also a history of dictatorship, violence and U.S.
intervention. It too has had an election in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   But there, just over the border, the economy is expanding
rapidly. New roads, modernized government agencies and investment
have transformed the capital. Though many of the poorest Dominicans
felt excluded from the boom times, they peacefully voiced their
dissatisfaction at the polls, where a near majority elected
Hipolito Mejia president on May 16. And then the ruling party
abandoned its quest for a runoff and conceded defeat for the good
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Like the border that separates the two countries _ where the
lush green landscape of the Dominican Republic gives way to the
barren, deforested soil of Haiti _ the contrast in political and
social fortunes is sharp. Considering that Haiti was once the more
prosperous and cosmopolitan of the two countries, and that the
violence of Gen. Rafael Trujillo's dictatorship in the Dominican
Republic 35 years ago ago rivaled if not exceeded that of the
Duvalier family here, why do the two nations seem headed in
opposite directions?
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the answer can be summed up in two words: 30
years,'' said Michele Wucker, author of ``Why The Cocks Fight,'' a
book exploring the relationship between the two nations. ``Haiti is
now where the Dominican Republic was not too long after the United
States invasion in 1965.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within the shared experience of military intervention,
however, there are differences. After the 1965 intervention, when
Joaquin Balaguer came to power and ushered in years of repressive
rule, the United States essentially kept a hands-off policy in the
Dominican Republic, Ms. Wucker said. In Haiti, the United States
restored Aristide to power in 1994, but placed narrow constraints
on the exercise of his power. Wucker said that the United States
also contradicted itself, pressing for elections while cutting aid
to help finance them. ``They talk in pretty terms about
democracy,'' said. ``But deep down they are reluctant to let Haiti
muddle its own way in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of dictatorship also played out differently. While
some Dominicans still bear scars _ physical and psychological _
from Balaguer's early years, just as many recall benefiting from
jobs, homes and other favors. So strong are those memories that
nearly a quarter of the votes went to Balaguer, even though he is
93, blind and infirm.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, the experience of a former president running again is
relatively rare, since most have gone into exile after enriching
themselves. ``They had Balaguer, we had Duvalier, but the histories
are very different,'' said Raoul Denis, a record store owner in
Port-au-Prince. ``On our side, Duvalier destroyed the institutions
and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Those institutions, like the courts and the police, still
struggle to maintain a semblance of law and order in Haiti. At the
same time, other forces that could help bring pressure to bear lack
sufficient experience to prove effective. In the Dominican
Republic, public-interest advocates have played an important role
in calling for clean elections and good government. Business
owners, aware that tourists and factory jobs can flee unless there
is social and political stability, also had a stake in the future
and supported it with investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is we in Haiti do not have an authentic
bourgeoisie that has invested in Haiti,'' said Patrick
Pierre-Louis, a law school professor. ``All their money goes to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominican business leaders were a major force for their
country's stability, said a diplomat who has worked there and in
Haiti. When the United States worried about elections in the
mid-1990s, such leaders were vulnerable to friendly pressure, since
business owners wanted trade parity with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Haiti there isn't much tourism,'' said the diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The assembly sector is still not
large. They weathered the embargo and other bad situations. I'm not
sure the levers we had in the Dominican Republic could work here.''
</P>
<P>
   While Haiti's elections are the first step toward achieving a
normal government, bigger obstacles remain in a country where
winner-take-all has been a rule applied literally by victorious
candidates. Haiti's political leaders have yet to understand that
the power of the vote extends beyond election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominican interests are the interests of their country,'' said
Georges Sassine, a factory owner active in civic groups. ``Here,
you have people who come here, get rich and leave. We are still a
colony of ourselves.''

EVEN A WORM NEEDS LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month a hyperactive computer program bearing the message
``I Love You'' ricocheted around the world's e-mail systems in less
than 24 hours and infected tens of millions of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``I Love You'' bug, allegedly launched by a computer student
in the Philippines with too much time on his hands, touched off a
cyber-flu season. More than 29 variants have emerged so far,
including diabolical derivatives with names like ``NewLove'' and
``Resume _ Janet Simons.'' Most of the mutants arrived without
tidings of love, but instead carried a software payload designed to
erase victims' disks once the message's attachment was opened.
</P>
<P>
   While ``I Love You'' was startlingly swift and effective, most
of its imitators went almost nowhere. According to some computer
security experts, the copycat cyberplagues should have spread just
as rapidly as the worm (in computer entomology, worms propel
themselves while viruses hitchhike on other documents) they were
mimicking.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what's love got to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a lot, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts looking at the different contagion rates are
divided about whether Internet users learned a hard lesson in
computer hygiene or whether the world is actually a lonelier place
than anyone realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that men were much more likely to open the `I
Love You' worm than women,'' said George Cybenko, a computer
scientist at Dartmouth University and a founder of the Institute of
Security Technology Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ``I Love You'' message was so simple and beguiling
that in some cases it hoodwinked even the most sophisticated
computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Capps, a senior Microsoft software designer, padded
downstairs at 5 a.m. on the morning of the ``I Love You''
infection, poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down at his
computer to read his e-mail. It happened to be his birthday, so as
he scanned his mailbox he thought he saw a love note from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   After opening the program Capps quickly realized his error and
managed to delete the bug before it spread widely. ``What I
remember thinking was, ``How did Marie manage to sneak downstairs
late at night to send me a birthday note?'' he said sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   Capps was not alone. Hewlett-Packard &AMP; Co. acknowledged last
week that its computers suffered more than 700,000 infections from
the ``I Love You'' worm _ more than 500,000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The total damage _ primarily time spent restoring files and
cleaning out clogged e-mail systems _ may reach $950 million,
according to ICSA.net, a computer security company that tracks the
cost of computer infections.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the far more lethal ``NewLove'' bug began
infecting the address books of users of the popular Microsoft
Outlook e-mail program, sending itself to every person on the list.
But instead of delivering the endearingly named document
LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS, NewLove cloaked itself by snatching a
recent document name from its victim's hard disk and using that
name in the subject line of all subsequent messages sent from the
address list, destroying data on the hard drives of affected
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ``Resume'' bug urged e-mail recipients to look at
a job seeker's fabulous curriculum vitae, helpfully included as an
attachment _ which, of course served as an electronic Trojan Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their cleverness, however, both ``NewLove'' and
``Resume'' were stopped in their tracks. ``If `NewLove' had come
before `I Love You' it would have spread more slowly but we would
have had a bigger disaster,'' said Peter Tippett, chief technology
officer of ICSA.
</P>
<P>
   Tippett, who was trained as an epidemiologist before starting an
antivirus software company in the 1980s, has long argued that
computer viruses and infections closely mimic the biological world.
</P>
<P>
   That might be another reason why the lethal ``NewLove'' was less
effective than ``I Love You.'' In the real world as well as in
cyberspace, diseases that kill their hosts quickly tend to have
limited success in spreading through large populations. ``Viruses
that kill their hosts never make it,'' Tippett said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the Darwinian imperative or the irresistible power
of love at work, experts believe the current cyber-flu season will
not be the last, especially as the millions of PCs of the 1990s are
transformed into billions of cell phones, personal digital
assistants and even toaster-connected Internet appliances by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   For each new device connected to the Internet there are dozens
of new ways to spread infection. Even now, computer security
experts are warning that the growing popularity of music and
file-sharing programs like Napster, Gnutella, iMesh and Scour
Exchange will virtually insure new vectors for diseases.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean that disease in the cyberworld will become as
routine as cold season is today.

TROUBLING THE WATERS OF NUCLEAR DETERRENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By MICHAEL ORESKES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For nearly half a century the Cold War world's
tense stability was built on a simple bit of political philosophy.
Nicknamed, appropriately, MAD, for Mutual Assured Destruction, it
held that the leader of a country advanced enough to build nuclear
weapons would never actually use them if he was assured his nation
would also be obliterated by his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Why call this a political philosophy? Because at its core, as at
the core of every political philosophy from Plato to Marx, is an
appraisal of human nature. MAD's view of human nature was,
paradoxically, surprisingly sunny. It held that a leader, no matter
how ambitious, ideological or even nutty, would never be so far
gone (or allowed to be so far gone by his cohorts) as to risk the
annihilation of his own people.
</P>
<P>
   That was the heart of deterrence: America's belief that the
Russians were rational and their belief that Americans were, too.
</P>
<P>
   As nuclear technology proliferates, however, the nuclear
equation is becoming more complicated, and a new view of deterrence
is taking hold in the United States. That view was summed up by a
bipartisan report last fall from a federal advisory commission
studying national security in the 21st century: Threats to U.S.
security will be more diffuse, harder to anticipate and more
difficult to neutralize than ever before. Deterrence will not work
as it once did; in many cases, it may not work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because in the post-Cold War world, the new thinking goes,
there are some countries and leaders who simply cannot be trusted
to be rational about nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The old line in the sand was between two ideologies, each held
by people the other believed to be capable of acting sensibly. The
new line is between people who can be counted on to behave like us
and people who can't. Under the old thinking, the best defense was
the threat of an overwhelming offense. But in the new world, the
new theorists suggest, the best defense in some cases is actually a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, embraced this view in a speech recently calling for a
robust missile defense of the United States. And President Clinton
is in Moscow this weekend to discuss the new thinking, and his own
less expansive missile defense plans, with Russian President
Vladimir Putin, who holds a treaty barring the United States (or
Russia) from deploying a National Missile Defense (NMD).
</P>
<P>
   On his way to Moscow, Clinton gave a glimpse of the new
strategic view. The world, Clinton suggested during a stop in
Lisbon, can be divided between ``civilized nations,'' and
``irresponsible new nuclear powers and their possible alliances
with terrorists and other groups.'' Rest assured, Clinton said,
America would share with the civilized the technology to defend
against the irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Who belongs in this second group? Clinton named neither the
civilized nations nor the irresponsible ones, although there was a
hint he was prepared to include Russia in the civilized category
because the very phrase was one Boris Yeltsin had once used to
describe a world protected by missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But what of China, which is on the verge of modernizing and
expanding its nuclear force and openly views a system defending the
continental United States as a threat to that force?
</P>
<P>
   The Americans say it's not China they're worried about, either,
but what the Clinton administration calls ``rogue states.'' North
Korea, for example, would fall into this category. But why is Kim
Jong-il of North Korea not likely to be deterred by the threat of
national devastation, if he struck at America?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, North Korea is an isolated place, the last Stalinist
state and so economically troubled that people flee to China for a
better life. When Kim went on a secret state visit to Beijing last
week pictures released afterward showed him wearing a Mao jacket,
while China's president, Jiang Zemin, was attired in suit and tie.
Certainly he is behind the fashion curve. But does that mean he
would risk extinction?
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War there has been only one real-world
test of deterrence against a so-called rogue state, and it supports
those who say it remains effective. It came on the eve of the Gulf
War. In a variety of ways, including a direct meeting with Tariq
Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, the U.S. secretary of state,
James Baker, warned Saddam Hussein that the use of chemical or
biological weapons against allied forces would be met by ``the most
severe consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis did not use these weapons and later said they
understood the American warning to mean a nuclear response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein may have been ruthlessly expansionist, but he
did not act irrationally,'' writes Robert S. Litwak, a former
member of the national security council staff at the White House,
in his book, `` Rogue States and U.S. Foreign Policy'' (Woodrow
Wilson Center Press, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Critics of America's emerging new strategic thinking, which is
to say most of the rest of the world, seem to think that the new
theories of deterrence have more to do with the mind of America
than the mind of Saddam Hussein or of Kim Jong-il.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always seen themselves as self- reliant, and they
have placed great faith in technology. Replacing MAD with NMD
relieves you of a dependence on the rationality of your fellow man,
in favor of an independence granted by your homegrown radar,
computers and missiles. America's allies are not convinced that is
an improvement, but Americans seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that they do not know much about it, nearly
60 percent of Americans said in a survey last month that they favor
trying to build a missile defense system against nuclear attack.
Told that $60 billion had already been spent, opinion remained in
favor. One American in four wants to try to build the system
despite the cost, even if scientists conclude it probably won't
work, according to the survey, conducted by The New York Times and
CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   What most Americans have not begun to consider is that an
anti-missile system would represent a fundamental shift in how the
nation thinks about nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, the first year of the nuclear age, Albert Einstein
described atomic energy as a ``menace'' and added: ``Perhaps it is
well that it should be. It may intimidate the human race into
bringing order into its international affairs, which, without the
pressure of fear, it would not do.''
</P>
<P>
   For a half century that is what happened, more or less. What
frightens some analysts is that a shield against nuclear attack on
the United States would make Americans believe they are safe and
thus help lift from their leaders the pressure of fear, which helps
motivate the world's one superpower to work for continued order and
safety in the world.

T WO ELECTIONS ON AN ISLAND. SO CLOSE, SO FAR APART 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ Wilda Severe carried the future in her
mind and body as she waited to cast her ballot last month in
Haiti's legislative elections. Though five months pregnant, she
stood for hours on a slowly moving line, hoping that her vote would
usher in a better life for her baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the conditions of the country to change,'' she said.
``The conditions are not good for anybody right now. People suffer
and there is no work. And there is insecurity. The country is still
not at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   More than five years after a U.S.-led military occupation
restored democratic rule in Haiti, the civil serenity that she and
many Haitians hoped for remains elusive. In the weeks before the
elections, politically motivated violence had left 15 people dead,
and in the slums the sense of poverty only deepened.
</P>
<P>
   When the last U.S. troops left Haiti this year, some policy
makers saw it as the end of a successful mission to restore
democracy. But the fact that the elections (in which former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's party did well) found so many
Haitians still pining for peace and progress belies any boast. It
raises questions about why Haiti seems to stagger from crisis to
crisis as it tries to embark on the path to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of an answer lies just a short flight away in the Dominican
Republic _ a nation that shares not just the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti, but also a history of dictatorship, violence and U.S.
intervention. It too has had an election in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   But there, just over the border, the economy is expanding
rapidly. New roads, modernized government agencies and investment
have transformed the capital. Though many of the poorest Dominicans
felt excluded from the boom times, they peacefully voiced their
dissatisfaction at the polls, where a near majority elected
Hipolito Mejia president on May 16. And then the ruling party
abandoned its quest for a runoff and conceded defeat for the good
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Like the border that separates the two countries _ where the
lush green landscape of the Dominican Republic gives way to the
barren, deforested soil of Haiti _ the contrast in political and
social fortunes is sharp. Considering that Haiti was once the more
prosperous and cosmopolitan of the two countries, and that the
violence of Gen. Rafael Trujillo's dictatorship in the Dominican
Republic 35 years ago ago rivaled if not exceeded that of the
Duvalier family here, why do the two nations seem headed in
opposite directions?
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of the answer can be summed up in two words: 30
years,'' said Michele Wucker, author of ``Why The Cocks Fight,'' a
book exploring the relationship between the two nations. ``Haiti is
now where the Dominican Republic was not too long after the United
States invasion in 1965.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within the shared experience of military intervention,
however, there are differences. After the 1965 intervention, when
Joaquin Balaguer came to power and ushered in years of repressive
rule, the United States essentially kept a hands-off policy in the
Dominican Republic, Ms. Wucker said. In Haiti, the United States
restored Aristide to power in 1994, but placed narrow constraints
on the exercise of his power. Wucker said that the United States
also contradicted itself, pressing for elections while cutting aid
to help finance them. ``They talk in pretty terms about
democracy,'' said. ``But deep down they are reluctant to let Haiti
muddle its own way in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of dictatorship also played out differently. While
some Dominicans still bear scars _ physical and psychological _
from Balaguer's early years, just as many recall benefiting from
jobs, homes and other favors. So strong are those memories that
nearly a quarter of the votes went to Balaguer, even though he is
93, blind and infirm.
</P>
<P>
   In Haiti, the experience of a former president running again is
relatively rare, since most have gone into exile after enriching
themselves. ``They had Balaguer, we had Duvalier, but the histories
are very different,'' said Raoul Denis, a record store owner in
Port-au-Prince. ``On our side, Duvalier destroyed the institutions
and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Those institutions, like the courts and the police, still
struggle to maintain a semblance of law and order in Haiti. At the
same time, other forces that could help bring pressure to bear lack
sufficient experience to prove effective. In the Dominican
Republic, public-interest advocates have played an important role
in calling for clean elections and good government. Business
owners, aware that tourists and factory jobs can flee unless there
is social and political stability, also had a stake in the future
and supported it with investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem is we in Haiti do not have an authentic
bourgeoisie that has invested in Haiti,'' said Patrick
Pierre-Louis, a law school professor. ``All their money goes to the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominican business leaders were a major force for their
country's stability, said a diplomat who has worked there and in
Haiti. When the United States worried about elections in the
mid-1990s, such leaders were vulnerable to friendly pressure, since
business owners wanted trade parity with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Haiti there isn't much tourism,'' said the diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The assembly sector is still not
large. They weathered the embargo and other bad situations. I'm not
sure the levers we had in the Dominican Republic could work here.''
</P>
<P>
   While Haiti's elections are the first step toward achieving a
normal government, bigger obstacles remain in a country where
winner-take-all has been a rule applied literally by victorious
candidates. Haiti's political leaders have yet to understand that
the power of the vote extends beyond election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominican interests are the interests of their country,'' said
Georges Sassine, a factory owner active in civic groups. ``Here,
you have people who come here, get rich and leave. We are still a
colony of ourselves.''

EVEN A WORM NEEDS LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month a hyperactive computer program bearing the message
``I Love You'' ricocheted around the world's e-mail systems in less
than 24 hours and infected tens of millions of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``I Love You'' bug, allegedly launched by a computer student
in the Philippines with too much time on his hands, touched off a
cyber-flu season. More than 29 variants have emerged so far,
including diabolical derivatives with names like ``NewLove'' and
``Resume _ Janet Simons.'' Most of the mutants arrived without
tidings of love, but instead carried a software payload designed to
erase victims' disks once the message's attachment was opened.
</P>
<P>
   While ``I Love You'' was startlingly swift and effective, most
of its imitators went almost nowhere. According to some computer
security experts, the copycat cyberplagues should have spread just
as rapidly as the worm (in computer entomology, worms propel
themselves while viruses hitchhike on other documents) they were
mimicking.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what's love got to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a lot, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts looking at the different contagion rates are
divided about whether Internet users learned a hard lesson in
computer hygiene or whether the world is actually a lonelier place
than anyone realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that men were much more likely to open the `I
Love You' worm than women,'' said George Cybenko, a computer
scientist at Dartmouth University and a founder of the Institute of
Security Technology Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ``I Love You'' message was so simple and beguiling
that in some cases it hoodwinked even the most sophisticated
computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Capps, a senior Microsoft software designer, padded
downstairs at 5 a.m. on the morning of the ``I Love You''
infection, poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down at his
computer to read his e-mail. It happened to be his birthday, so as
he scanned his mailbox he thought he saw a love note from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   After opening the program Capps quickly realized his error and
managed to delete the bug before it spread widely. ``What I
remember thinking was, ``How did Marie manage to sneak downstairs
late at night to send me a birthday note?'' he said sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   Capps was not alone. Hewlett-Packard &AMP; Co. acknowledged last
week that its computers suffered more than 700,000 infections from
the ``I Love You'' worm _ more than 500,000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The total damage _ primarily time spent restoring files and
cleaning out clogged e-mail systems _ may reach $950 million,
according to ICSA.net, a computer security company that tracks the
cost of computer infections.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the far more lethal ``NewLove'' bug began
infecting the address books of users of the popular Microsoft
Outlook e-mail program, sending itself to every person on the list.
But instead of delivering the endearingly named document
LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS, NewLove cloaked itself by snatching a
recent document name from its victim's hard disk and using that
name in the subject line of all subsequent messages sent from the
address list, destroying data on the hard drives of affected
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ``Resume'' bug urged e-mail recipients to look at
a job seeker's fabulous curriculum vitae, helpfully included as an
attachment _ which, of course served as an electronic Trojan Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their cleverness, however, both ``NewLove'' and
``Resume'' were stopped in their tracks. ``If `NewLove' had come
before `I Love You' it would have spread more slowly but we would
have had a bigger disaster,'' said Peter Tippett, chief technology
officer of ICSA.
</P>
<P>
   Tippett, who was trained as an epidemiologist before starting an
antivirus software company in the 1980s, has long argued that
computer viruses and infections closely mimic the biological world.
</P>
<P>
   That might be another reason why the lethal ``NewLove'' was less
effective than ``I Love You.'' In the real world as well as in
cyberspace, diseases that kill their hosts quickly tend to have
limited success in spreading through large populations. ``Viruses
that kill their hosts never make it,'' Tippett said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the Darwinian imperative or the irresistible power
of love at work, experts believe the current cyber-flu season will
not be the last, especially as the millions of PCs of the 1990s are
transformed into billions of cell phones, personal digital
assistants and even toaster-connected Internet appliances by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   For each new device connected to the Internet there are dozens
of new ways to spread infection. Even now, computer security
experts are warning that the growing popularity of music and
file-sharing programs like Napster, Gnutella, iMesh and Scour
Exchange will virtually insure new vectors for diseases.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean that disease in the cyberworld will become as
routine as cold season is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what concerns me,'' said Kevin Kelly, author of ``Out
of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the
Economic World'' (Addison Wesley, 1994). ``These new systems leave
us completely open to these infections and we may just have to
learn to live with them.''

WHEN DEMOCRACY RUNS OFF THE RAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For years the United States has classified some
countries, like Iraq and North Korea, as ``rogue states.'' Now, as
the world becomes more democratic _ more than 60 percent of
countries have elected leaders _ something more complicated enters
the political lexicon. Call them ``rogue democracies.''
</P>
<P>
   These are democratic governments that go off the rails, either
in aggressiveness toward neighbors, cruelty to citizens or
backtracking on the promise that democracy will foster liberty and
equality.
</P>
<P>
   How to deal with this new type of rogue, or to know when to
recognize one, is not easy for established democracies. It is,
after all, tempting to assume that when other nations choose to
freely elect their leaders, good things automatically follow.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Peru is the latest example: an elected president,
Alberto Fujimori, has rewritten the constitution, cut the power of
his congress and chipped away at political liberties, all in the
name of social order. Now he is claiming a third term after an
election so riddled with irregularities that the opposition
boycotted it and the Organization of American States won't approve
it.
</P>
<P>
   What's the world to do? Shun Peru? Impose sanctions? When
Austria's voters put the xenophobe Jorg Haider near the seat of
power, Europe got together and forced his ostracism. But in Peru a
similar outcome seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   It has been obvious for some time that democracy no longer has
one universally accepted definition, and so it is hard to say when
a country ceases to be one. Consider the variety of forms in Peru,
Russia, India, Zimbabwe, the United States, Austria and Japan.
There is also a growing understanding that elections don't
guarantee free expression or fair treatment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a nation's ability to call itself a democracy often buys it
sympathy among voters in the West and among human-rights advocates
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Elected leaders on almost every continent have, indeed, long
used the forms of democracy as political wool to pull over the eyes
of those abroad who would judge their legitimacy to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Latin America, constitutions are routinely amended or
rewritten to expand the terms and power of presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, where parliamentary elections are now less than
three weeks away, President Robert Mugabe has systematically
attacked the opposition under the guise of a violent campaign to
seize land from white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, lame-duck conservatives tried to block the newly
elected reformist parliament; it was seated only with the suffrance
of the Islamic republic's ``supreme religious leader,'' who can
veto such earthly procedures as elections.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, and now Malaysia, elected Asian governments
dominated by intolerant leaders have fashioned the most
sophisticated, perfectly legal methods of destroying political
opponents through the courts. The slow-moving prosecution on sex
charges of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's once-fast-rising deputy prime
minister, is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   As for the component parts of the former Soviet Union, tidy
definitions of democracy are surely confounded by the
criminalization of the economy and, to some extent, political life,
not to mention the tenacity of Communist-era and Communist-style
political bosses who see elections pretty much as nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been imperfect democracies; the very messiness
of the political form invites imperfection. The United States has
had segregation, the internment of Japanese-Americans and repeated
episodes of local police brutality. Europeans differ on the limits
of free expression and how to treat minorities. But those can be
seen as shortcomings in realizing democracy's ideals, not a
negation of them. A more fundamental problem arises when
institutions are too weak to provide eventual remedies to the
shortcomings _ a role often played by elected legislatures and, in
America, the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, a democracy strays into rogue territory when a country
cannot muster any checks on the power plays of an elected leader
who chooses not to step aside and rewrites the rules accordingly. A
corollary is almost always oppression of some kind, often beginning
with the political opposition. And the mix becomes lethal, as it
did in Yugoslavia, if race, ethnicity or religion are then used to
inflame political passions.
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Craner, president of the International Republican
Institute, which is supported by the Republican Party, said that in
some dodgy democracies, ``a lot of people have figured out you can
have a bad election and get away with it.'' So his organization and
its opposite number in Washington, the National Democratic
Institute, have been thinking for years that it might be better to
concentrate more on what happens between elections. European
democracy groups and the Organization of African Unity are making a
similar shift, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating when there's no other reason why
countries that have poor human rights and democracy records don't
get sanctioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kaufman Purcell, president of the Americas Society in New
York, classifies the governments of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and
Fujimori in Peru as ``imperfect democracies'' _ adding that often
``it is a hard call where to draw the line between imperfect
democracies and fake democracies.'' A democracy, she says, ``at the
very least must have some basic defining characteristics, the most
important being the ability to vote an incumbent out of power
through the use of a functioning electoral process that allows
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Bengt Save-Soderbergh, who runs a new intergovernmental
organization in Stockholm called the International Institute for
Democracy and Electoral Assistance, says even free and fair
elections don't define democracy: ``Deep down it's a culture, with
values and also respect, tolerance _ all these things.''
</P>
<P>
   At Emory University in Atlanta, Robert Pastor, an expert on
Latin America who served in the Carter administration and who has
advised and monitored elections as far afield as China, draws a
line at downgrading the essential role of national elections. There
are those who say, for example, that building in voting experience
from the village up, as China and Pakistan say they are doing (and
as Americans did before 1789), may be more useful than imposing
periodic national elections on an inexperienced people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an argument that says democracy is more than
elections,'' Pastor said. ``I agree with that, but not when one
takes the next step and says that elections are not that important
for democracy. On that I completely disagree. Democracy should be
more than free elections, but it can't be less.''

   And then there is the problem of a different kind of rogue: The
electoral democracy whose human rights record or foreign policies
fall short of international standards but don't raise eyebrows. The
contrast between attitudes in America toward India and Pakistan is
instructive, one that human rights organizations often point to.
</P>

   The State Department's annual international human rights survey
is very critical of India for its treatment of women, minorities
and people declared ``untouchable'' by the Hindu majority. In the
disputed territory of Kashmir, which is under Indian military
occupation, the report found significant abuses of the local Muslim
population. Moreover, American officials say that India has only
narrowly escaped being placed on the list of terrorist nations for
its backing of unrest in neighboring nations, including bombings
and perhaps assassinations in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But at Human Rights Watch in New York, Kenneth Roth, the
executive director, said that Americans often overlook the record
because most of India's governments have been freely elected, while
neighboring Pakistan gets much closer scrutiny, having lurched in
and out of military rule. ``India has many attributes of a
democracy,'' said Roth. ``But it's too facile to embrace India as a
democracy without recognizing the flawed nature of its political
system when it comes to marginal populations or perceived security
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram Narayan Kumar, an Indian human rights leader, worries about
the precedent. ``Around India,'' he said, ``the lesson other
countries there will learn is that you just have to appear to be
democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples matter everywhere, said John Hirsch, a former U.S.
ambassador to Sierra Leone who is vice president of the
International Peace Academy, a research organization with close
ties to the United Nations. In Africa, he said, the two countries
in which to hope for continued success are Nigeria and South
Africa, both of which held open elections last year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Joseph Smith, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia, said that strong democracies ``haven't
given enough thought to maintenance and sustaining of democracy.''
In the case of Peru, he added, the United States could have given
stronger support to the Organization of American States. Instead,
the Clinton administration first endorsed, then backed away from,
an unusually bold OAS judgment that the election was flawed. Smith
and Craner said that was a bad message to send to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to mobilize the multilateral organizations to a far
greater extent,'' Smith said. ``Democracy needs constant
attention.''

TROUBLING THE WATERS OF NUCLEAR DETERRENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By MICHAEL ORESKES    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For nearly half a century the Cold War world's
tense stability was built on a simple bit of political philosophy.
Nicknamed, appropriately, MAD, for Mutual Assured Destruction, it
held that the leader of a country advanced enough to build nuclear
weapons would never actually use them if he was assured his nation
would also be obliterated by his enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Why call this a political philosophy? Because at its core, as at
the core of every political philosophy from Plato to Marx, is an
appraisal of human nature. MAD's view of human nature was,
paradoxically, surprisingly sunny. It held that a leader, no matter
how ambitious, ideological or even nutty, would never be so far
gone (or allowed to be so far gone by his cohorts) as to risk the
annihilation of his own people.
</P>
<P>
   That was the heart of deterrence: America's belief that the
Russians were rational and their belief that Americans were, too.
</P>
<P>
   As nuclear technology proliferates, however, the nuclear
equation is becoming more complicated, and a new view of deterrence
is taking hold in the United States. That view was summed up by a
bipartisan report last fall from a federal advisory commission
studying national security in the 21st century: Threats to U.S.
security will be more diffuse, harder to anticipate and more
difficult to neutralize than ever before. Deterrence will not work
as it once did; in many cases, it may not work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because in the post-Cold War world, the new thinking goes,
there are some countries and leaders who simply cannot be trusted
to be rational about nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The old line in the sand was between two ideologies, each held
by people the other believed to be capable of acting sensibly. The
new line is between people who can be counted on to behave like us
and people who can't. Under the old thinking, the best defense was
the threat of an overwhelming offense. But in the new world, the
new theorists suggest, the best defense in some cases is actually a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, embraced this view in a speech recently calling for a
robust missile defense of the United States. And President Clinton
is in Moscow this weekend to discuss the new thinking, and his own
less expansive missile defense plans, with Russian President
Vladimir Putin, who holds a treaty barring the United States (or
Russia) from deploying a National Missile Defense (NMD).
</P>
<P>
   On his way to Moscow, Clinton gave a glimpse of the new
strategic view. The world, Clinton suggested during a stop in
Lisbon, can be divided between ``civilized nations,'' and
``irresponsible new nuclear powers and their possible alliances
with terrorists and other groups.'' Rest assured, Clinton said,
America would share with the civilized the technology to defend
against the irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Who belongs in this second group? Clinton named neither the
civilized nations nor the irresponsible ones, although there was a
hint he was prepared to include Russia in the civilized category
because the very phrase was one Boris Yeltsin had once used to
describe a world protected by missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But what of China, which is on the verge of modernizing and
expanding its nuclear force and openly views a system defending the
continental United States as a threat to that force?
</P>
<P>
   The Americans say it's not China they're worried about, either,
but what the Clinton administration calls ``rogue states.'' North
Korea, for example, would fall into this category. But why is Kim
Jong-il of North Korea not likely to be deterred by the threat of
national devastation, if he struck at America?
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, North Korea is an isolated place, the last Stalinist
state and so economically troubled that people flee to China for a
better life. When Kim went on a secret state visit to Beijing last
week pictures released afterward showed him wearing a Mao jacket,
while China's president, Jiang Zemin, was attired in suit and tie.
Certainly he is behind the fashion curve. But does that mean he
would risk extinction?
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War there has been only one real-world
test of deterrence against a so-called rogue state, and it supports
those who say it remains effective. It came on the eve of the Gulf
War. In a variety of ways, including a direct meeting with Tariq
Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, the U.S. secretary of state,
James Baker, warned Saddam Hussein that the use of chemical or
biological weapons against allied forces would be met by ``the most
severe consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis did not use these weapons and later said they
understood the American warning to mean a nuclear response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein may have been ruthlessly expansionist, but he
did not act irrationally,'' writes Robert S. Litwak, a former
member of the national security council staff at the White House,
in his book, `` Rogue States and U.S. Foreign Policy'' (Woodrow
Wilson Center Press, 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Critics of America's emerging new strategic thinking, which is
to say most of the rest of the world, seem to think that the new
theories of deterrence have more to do with the mind of America
than the mind of Saddam Hussein or of Kim Jong-il.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always seen themselves as self- reliant, and they
have placed great faith in technology. Replacing MAD with NMD
relieves you of a dependence on the rationality of your fellow man,
in favor of an independence granted by your homegrown radar,
computers and missiles. America's allies are not convinced that is
an improvement, but Americans seem to be.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that they do not know much about it, nearly
60 percent of Americans said in a survey last month that they favor
trying to build a missile defense system against nuclear attack.
Told that $60 billion had already been spent, opinion remained in
favor. One American in four wants to try to build the system
despite the cost, even if scientists conclude it probably won't
work, according to the survey, conducted by The New York Times and
CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   What most Americans have not begun to consider is that an
anti-missile system would represent a fundamental shift in how the
nation thinks about nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, the first year of the nuclear age, Albert Einstein
described atomic energy as a ``menace'' and added: ``Perhaps it is
well that it should be. It may intimidate the human race into
bringing order into its international affairs, which, without the
pressure of fear, it would not do.''
</P>
<P>
   For a half century that is what happened, more or less. What
frightens some analysts is that a shield against nuclear attack on
the United States would make Americans believe they are safe and
thus help lift from their leaders the pressure of fear, which helps
motivate the world's one superpower to work for continued order and
safety in the world.

WHEN DEMOCRACY RUNS OFF THE RAILS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating) (The Week in Review) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For years the United States has classified some
countries, like Iraq and North Korea, as ``rogue states.'' Now, as
the world becomes more democratic _ more than 60 percent of
countries have elected leaders _ something more complicated enters
the political lexicon. Call them ``rogue democracies.''
</P>
<P>
   These are democratic governments that go off the rails, either
in aggressiveness toward neighbors, cruelty to citizens or
backtracking on the promise that democracy will foster liberty and
equality.
</P>
<P>
   How to deal with this new type of rogue, or to know when to
recognize one, is not easy for established democracies. It is,
after all, tempting to assume that when other nations choose to
freely elect their leaders, good things automatically follow.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Peru is the latest example: an elected president,
Alberto Fujimori, has rewritten the constitution, cut the power of
his congress and chipped away at political liberties, all in the
name of social order. Now he is claiming a third term after an
election so riddled with irregularities that the opposition
boycotted it and the Organization of American States won't approve
it.
</P>
<P>
   What's the world to do? Shun Peru? Impose sanctions? When
Austria's voters put the xenophobe Jorg Haider near the seat of
power, Europe got together and forced his ostracism. But in Peru a
similar outcome seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   It has been obvious for some time that democracy no longer has
one universally accepted definition, and so it is hard to say when
a country ceases to be one. Consider the variety of forms in Peru,
Russia, India, Zimbabwe, the United States, Austria and Japan.
There is also a growing understanding that elections don't
guarantee free expression or fair treatment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a nation's ability to call itself a democracy often buys it
sympathy among voters in the West and among human-rights advocates
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Elected leaders on almost every continent have, indeed, long
used the forms of democracy as political wool to pull over the eyes
of those abroad who would judge their legitimacy to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Latin America, constitutions are routinely amended or
rewritten to expand the terms and power of presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, where parliamentary elections are now less than
three weeks away, President Robert Mugabe has systematically
attacked the opposition under the guise of a violent campaign to
seize land from white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, lame-duck conservatives tried to block the newly
elected reformist parliament; it was seated only with the suffrance
of the Islamic republic's ``supreme religious leader,'' who can
veto such earthly procedures as elections.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, and now Malaysia, elected Asian governments
dominated by intolerant leaders have fashioned the most
sophisticated, perfectly legal methods of destroying political
opponents through the courts. The slow-moving prosecution on sex
charges of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's once-fast-rising deputy prime
minister, is a prime example.
</P>
<P>
   As for the component parts of the former Soviet Union, tidy
definitions of democracy are surely confounded by the
criminalization of the economy and, to some extent, political life,
not to mention the tenacity of Communist-era and Communist-style
political bosses who see elections pretty much as nuisances.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been imperfect democracies; the very messiness
of the political form invites imperfection. The United States has
had segregation, the internment of Japanese-Americans and repeated
episodes of local police brutality. Europeans differ on the limits
of free expression and how to treat minorities. But those can be
seen as shortcomings in realizing democracy's ideals, not a
negation of them. A more fundamental problem arises when
institutions are too weak to provide eventual remedies to the
shortcomings _ a role often played by elected legislatures and, in
America, the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, a democracy strays into rogue territory when a country
cannot muster any checks on the power plays of an elected leader
who chooses not to step aside and rewrites the rules accordingly. A
corollary is almost always oppression of some kind, often beginning
with the political opposition. And the mix becomes lethal, as it
did in Yugoslavia, if race, ethnicity or religion are then used to
inflame political passions.
</P>
<P>
   Lorne Craner, president of the International Republican
Institute, which is supported by the Republican Party, said that in
some dodgy democracies, ``a lot of people have figured out you can
have a bad election and get away with it.'' So his organization and
its opposite number in Washington, the National Democratic
Institute, have been thinking for years that it might be better to
concentrate more on what happens between elections. European
democracy groups and the Organization of African Unity are making a
similar shift, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating when there's no other reason why
countries that have poor human rights and democracy records don't
get sanctioned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Kaufman Purcell, president of the Americas Society in New
York, classifies the governments of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and
Fujimori in Peru as ``imperfect democracies'' _ adding that often
``it is a hard call where to draw the line between imperfect
democracies and fake democracies.'' A democracy, she says, ``at the
very least must have some basic defining characteristics, the most
important being the ability to vote an incumbent out of power
through the use of a functioning electoral process that allows
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Bengt Save-Soderbergh, who runs a new intergovernmental
organization in Stockholm called the International Institute for
Democracy and Electoral Assistance, says even free and fair
elections don't define democracy: ``Deep down it's a culture, with
values and also respect, tolerance _ all these things.''
</P>
<P>
   At Emory University in Atlanta, Robert Pastor, an expert on
Latin America who served in the Carter administration and who has
advised and monitored elections as far afield as China, draws a
line at downgrading the essential role of national elections. There
are those who say, for example, that building in voting experience
from the village up, as China and Pakistan say they are doing (and
as Americans did before 1789), may be more useful than imposing
periodic national elections on an inexperienced people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an argument that says democracy is more than
elections,'' Pastor said. ``I agree with that, but not when one
takes the next step and says that elections are not that important
for democracy. On that I completely disagree. Democracy should be
more than free elections, but it can't be less.''

   To Be or Not to Be, Texas Style, and Bush-Lessness &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has the distinction of presiding
over more executions (131) than any governor in the country. So, on
Thursday, when he granted his first 30-day reprieve to a death-row
inmate, the political world took note: was it an instance of a man
running as a compassionate conservative trying to advertise his
charitable nature?
</P>
<P>
   Matters of life and death can become embroiled in the theater of
politics. Eight years ago, a presidential candidate who also
happened to be a governor made a special trip back to his home
state of Arkansas to be on hand for an execution, an act viewed in
political circles as a demonstration of a moderate Democrat's
tough-on-crime credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides insisted there was nothing political about their
candidate's decision, which paved the way for DNA tests to be
administered to try to clarify the condemned man's guilt or
innocence in a case of rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an opportunity to get more information now from that
test,'' said Karen P. Hughes, a spokesman for Bush. ``So he feels
it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With the candidates' daily rollout of positions on all sorts of
pressing issues _ last week Bush and Vice President Al Gore offered
their takes on, among other things, mental health care, cancer
treatment and land conservation _ voters can be forgiven for
forgetting that the politicians still hold important day jobs that
can change lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the ceremonial aspects of their offices meld with the
oratorical requirements of their campaigns, as they did for Gore on
Monday, when he addressed a Memorial Day commemoration in
Pennsylvania. Noting his own military service, which included a
five-month stint in Vietnam as an Army reporter, Gore said, ``I
know that my service doesn't in any way match that of the heroes we
honor on this day.'' One of the more unusual aspects of the speech,
delivered in a week in which polls showed the presidential contest
to be neck-and-neck: not a single mention of Bush.

   The Physicist and the Wrapper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like poets who find inspiration on the kitchen table or back
porch, physicists are rediscovering the world they can see with the
unaided eye. The trend began at least a decade ago when they began
pondering why Brazil nuts, the largest and heaviest nuggets in a
can of mixed nuts, always end up on top after being jostled during
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The movement may have found its Ferlinghetti in Dr. Eric Kramer,
a physicist at Simon's Rock College in Massachusetts, who presented
experiments to explain that plague upon opera, theater and serious
music: the maddening, inescapable crackling of candy wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the sound, Kramer and a colleague discovered
that it was not a continuous rustle but a series of brief,
unpredictable bursts just thousandths of a second long. As
theatergoers may already suspect, opening a wrapper slowly does not
quiet those bursts but only slows down the rate at which they go
off. Each snap, Kramer found, is the product of a tiny
rearrangement of one of the creases in the wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of those innumerable little rearrangements is
complex enough to keep any physicist happy. But like the Brazil nut
phenomenon, which was found to be caused by a subtle circulation in
the can, the candy wrapper research may be most interesting as
another step in the journey of physicists back from the minuscule
scale of the atom and the gigantic scale of the cosmos. Like
Ferlinghetti, they are rediscovering the mysteries of the here and
now.

</P>
<P>
   The arrival of 2 of the 11 women legislators at the opening of
Iran's new Parliament, the first dominated by reformers since the
1979 Islamic revolution, signaled a change. Elaheh Koulai from
Tehran and Tahreh Rezazadeh from Shiraz chose not to wear the
chador, the head-to-toe black covering that has been an Iranian
symbol for two decades. More reformist chic than radical, they wore
long shapeless coats and pinned their black scarves tightly under
their chins so no hair showed, which the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers' plans include increasing press freedom and
creating a more prosperous economy for an overwhelmingly young
population. The women's dress, though, stirred hope that the new
Parliament may indeed ease religious restrictions that have
dominated social life for a generation.

 UNITED NATIONS: be less.''

</P>
<P>
   And then there is the problem of a different kind of rogue: The
electoral democracy whose human rights record or foreign policies
fall short of international standards but don't raise eyebrows. The
contrast between attitudes in America toward India and Pakistan is
instructive, one that human rights organizations often point to.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's annual international human rights survey
is very critical of India for its treatment of women, minorities
and people declared ``untouchable'' by the Hindu majority. In the
disputed territory of Kashmir, which is under Indian military
occupation, the report found significant abuses of the local Muslim
population. Moreover, American officials say that India has only
narrowly escaped being placed on the list of terrorist nations for
its backing of unrest in neighboring nations, including bombings
and perhaps assassinations in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   But at Human Rights Watch in New York, Kenneth Roth, the
executive director, said that Americans often overlook the record
because most of India's governments have been freely elected, while
neighboring Pakistan gets much closer scrutiny, having lurched in
and out of military rule. ``India has many attributes of a
democracy,'' said Roth. ``But it's too facile to embrace India as a
democracy without recognizing the flawed nature of its political
system when it comes to marginal populations or perceived security
threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram Narayan Kumar, an Indian human rights leader, worries about
the precedent. ``Around India,'' he said, ``the lesson other
countries there will learn is that you just have to appear to be
democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples matter everywhere, said John Hirsch, a former U.S.
ambassador to Sierra Leone who is vice president of the
International Peace Academy, a research organization with close
ties to the United Nations. In Africa, he said, the two countries
in which to hope for continued success are Nigeria and South
Africa, both of which held open elections last year.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Joseph Smith, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia, said that strong democracies ``haven't
given enough thought to maintenance and sustaining of democracy.''
In the case of Peru, he added, the United States could have given
stronger support to the Organization of American States. Instead,
the Clinton administration first endorsed, then backed away from,
an unusually bold OAS judgment that the election was flawed. Smith
and Craner said that was a bad message to send to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to mobilize the multilateral organizations to a far
greater extent,'' Smith said. ``Democracy needs constant
attention.''

   To Be or Not to Be, Texas Style, and Bush-Lessness &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has the distinction of presiding
over more executions (131) than any governor in the country. So, on
Thursday, when he granted his first 30-day reprieve to a death-row
inmate, the political world took note: was it an instance of a man
running as a compassionate conservative trying to advertise his
charitable nature?
</P>
<P>
   Matters of life and death can become embroiled in the theater of
politics. Eight years ago, a presidential candidate who also
happened to be a governor made a special trip back to his home
state of Arkansas to be on hand for an execution, an act viewed in
political circles as a demonstration of a moderate Democrat's
tough-on-crime credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides insisted there was nothing political about their
candidate's decision, which paved the way for DNA tests to be
administered to try to clarify the condemned man's guilt or
innocence in a case of rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an opportunity to get more information now from that
test,'' said Karen P. Hughes, a spokesman for Bush. ``So he feels
it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   With the candidates' daily rollout of positions on all sorts of
pressing issues _ last week Bush and Vice President Al Gore offered
their takes on, among other things, mental health care, cancer
treatment and land conservation _ voters can be forgiven for
forgetting that the politicians still hold important day jobs that
can change lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the ceremonial aspects of their offices meld with the
oratorical requirements of their campaigns, as they did for Gore on
Monday, when he addressed a Memorial Day commemoration in
Pennsylvania. Noting his own military service, which included a
five-month stint in Vietnam as an Army reporter, Gore said, ``I
know that my service doesn't in any way match that of the heroes we
honor on this day.'' One of the more unusual aspects of the speech,
delivered in a week in which polls showed the presidential contest
to be neck-and-neck: not a single mention of Bush.

   The Physicist and the Wrapper &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like poets who find inspiration on the kitchen table or back
porch, physicists are rediscovering the world they can see with the
unaided eye. The trend began at least a decade ago when they began
pondering why Brazil nuts, the largest and heaviest nuggets in a
can of mixed nuts, always end up on top after being jostled during
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The movement may have found its Ferlinghetti in Dr. Eric Kramer,
a physicist at Simon's Rock College in Massachusetts, who presented
experiments to explain that plague upon opera, theater and serious
music: the maddening, inescapable crackling of candy wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the sound, Kramer and a colleague discovered
that it was not a continuous rustle but a series of brief,
unpredictable bursts just thousandths of a second long. As
theatergoers may already suspect, opening a wrapper slowly does not
quiet those bursts but only slows down the rate at which they go
off. Each snap, Kramer found, is the product of a tiny
rearrangement of one of the creases in the wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics of those innumerable little rearrangements is
complex enough to keep any physicist happy. But like the Brazil nut
phenomenon, which was found to be caused by a subtle circulation in
the can, the candy wrapper research may be most interesting as
another step in the journey of physicists back from the minuscule
scale of the atom and the gigantic scale of the cosmos. Like
Ferlinghetti, they are rediscovering the mysteries of the here and
now.

</P>
<P>
   The arrival of 2 of the 11 women legislators at the opening of
Iran's new Parliament, the first dominated by reformers since the
1979 Islamic revolution, signaled a change. Elaheh Koulai from
Tehran and Tahreh Rezazadeh from Shiraz chose not to wear the
chador, the head-to-toe black covering that has been an Iranian
symbol for two decades. More reformist chic than radical, they wore
long shapeless coats and pinned their black scarves tightly under
their chins so no hair showed, which the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers' plans include increasing press freedom and
creating a more prosperous economy for an overwhelmingly young
population. The women's dress, though, stirred hope that the new
Parliament may indeed ease religious restrictions that have
dominated social life for a generation.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor refused a request by

voters in 1998 granting any adopted adult access to the birth
records. The birth mothers had argued that the nation's first such

adoptees said they have an even more basic right to try to discover
where they came from _ and what their biological parents' medical

PERU'S FUJIMORI: AUTOCRAT? DEMOCRAT? WELL, BOTH

   LIMA, Peru _ The year was 1991. Alberto Fujimori was Peru's
newly elected president, and diplomats were rejoicing that every
government in Latin America except Cuba's was now democratically
elected. So Fujimori joined the leaders of Peru's four Andean
neighbors in proposing a radical plan: the Organization of American
States would require all 34 member states to sever diplomatic
relations with any government that took power unconstitutionally.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, Fujimori must be happy his plan was never
adopted. This week, the Organization of American States is to
consider how to punish Fujimori for claiming a third five-year term
after an election last Sunday that was tainted by dirty tricks and
re-interpretation of the constitution, which limits Peru's
presidents to two terms. His opponent, Alejandro Toledo, wound up
boycotting the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Peru is probably safe from any drastic measures, in large
part because the United States has backed away from supporting
strong OAS condemnation, and because Peru is not alone among its
peers in slipping back into old authoritarian patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The current president of Ecuador, a civilian, came to power in
January by military coup. The elected president of Venezuela is a
former military coup leader who has made all-out war on the
Congress and the courts. Paraguay's civilian government is
teetering.
</P>
<P>
   Does this turn of events mean that the man on horseback is
coming back in Latin America? Or is it that Latin America never
completely unsaddled him?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, authoritarianism and democracy have long coexisted in
Latin America, and a swing toward elections has never meant
autocracy is dead. A pattern of generals replacing civilian
presidents only to be replaced again by generals has been the rule
from Panama to Argentina for the better part of a century. A
variant on the theme, in places like Peru and Mexico, is a civilian
leader who is elected and then rules by fiat, fraud or manipulation
of the courts and congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The box on the outside is labeled a democracy,'' said Piero
Gleijeses, a professor of Latin American studies at Johns Hopkins
University, ``but inside you have an authoritarian system.''
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Paz, the Mexican essayist, once wrote that the problem
with democracy in Latin America is that it was ``imported but not
adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   So Fujimori is not so much a model of a new kind of
authoritarianism as an exemplar of something older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military regimes were never that tough and our elected
governments were never that democratic,'' said Carlos Tapia, a
former Peruvian Congressman and social critic. ``Our coups were
never initiated by the military alone. There was always a group of
civilians ready to manipulate the military to jump in.''
</P>
<P>
   The model for the civilian strongman in Peru goes back at least
to the 1919 election of Augusto Leguia, a businessman with a taste
for top hats and thoroughbred horses, who served until a coup
upended his rule in 1930. Like Fujimori, Leguia was a
master-builder of roads and ports who eagerly sought foreign
investment. He also displayed little compunction about breaking
democratic rules. He ordered the army to shut down the congress, he
closed down newspapers that opposed him, and his race horses had
remarkable success at the track during his years in office.
</P>
<P>
   As for governing Peru, neither the military nor the civilian
strongmen have a stellar record. Most recently, the military
regimes that ruled from 1968 to 1980 pushed through a radical land
reform. But it ultimately failed, leading to a slump in agriculture
and a chaotic peasant migration to the cities that created
shantytowns that are still spreading. It did little for public
confidence in military efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   When civilians returned to power in 1980 the people were
overjoyed. But the next 10 years were marked by hyperinflation,
massive corruption and the eruption of terrorist violence. This
ultimately discredited the two traditional political parties,
leaving the public in despair about their hopes for order.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the people turned to Fujimori, the ultimate outsider, a
son of Japanese immigrants who belonged to no party and promised a
clean break with the past. His popularity soared when he disbanded
the Supreme Court and Congress in 1992, claiming that their corrupt
ways were blocking his policies. In 1995 he won re-election in a
landslide; it amounted to a democratic affirmation of
authoritarianism and left advocates of democracy worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``A full democracy means more than elections,'' noted Carlos
Ivan Degregori, an anthropologist at the Institute of Peruvian
Studies. ``It requires sturdy institutions: strong political
parties, an independent judiciary and a Congress willing to vote
against the executive branch.'' Most often, he said, ``the boundary
between democracy and authoritarianism is not so clear.''
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly true in the region's poorest countries,
such as neighboring Bolivia, where the democratically elected
president is a former military dictator. But it is also true in
Latin America's more economically and politically developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chile is still governed under a constitution that was written
when Augusto Pinochet was dictator; it gives the army independent
powers over selecting its commanders and even senators. The new
governor of Buenos Aires province in Argentina, when faced with a
rising crime problem, selected as his police chief a former army
colonel who had led a 1987 uprising to block trials against former
junta leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whichever way the pendulum swings,'' said Felipe Noguera, an
Argentine political consultant, ``it's not like the people
overnight become perfect democrats and the next day become
supporters of coups. People in this region are aware of both the
weaknesses of democracy and the perils of authoritarian rule.''
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why in the days leading up to last Sunday's
election, opinion polls showed that even though a majority of
Peruvians said they thought the election process was tainted, they
would vote for Fujimori.

   WASHINGTON _ A hot new issue is lurking just below the political
radar, ready to explode onto the American electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tests off the charts!'' said Neil Newhouse, a Republican
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Penn, President Clinton's pollster, said, ``Everybody's
seen it in their surveys _ it's pretty hard to miss. It's a pretty
powerful groundswell.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who held three hearings on the
subject last week, gushed, ``Boy, you prompt it with just a couple
words and you're going to get a torrent of responses from people.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is privacy. It encompasses far more than peeping toms,
or even hackers invading Web sites or intercepting cell phone
conversations. Not only are people frightened that information
about their personal peccadillos could turn up in hostile hands,
but also that thieves could cash in on their financial data.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, people confess to pollsters, they are suspicious
of companies that have access to their financial and health care
records, and are frightened that the information will be used
against them. They are no less wary of what the government could do
with such data.
</P>
<P>
   To many voters, that their movements and activities are being
tracked on the Internet _ perhaps even by their bosses _ may not
pose a direct danger. But the very idea of it is, well, creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Spotting an opportunity, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George
W. Bush have begun speaking out about protecting the dissemination
of private information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, there is greater protection for your video rental
receipts than for your most intimate medical information,'' Gore
said in a speech at New York University two weeks ago. ``I've seen
cases where people's prescription drug histories are sold freely to
direct mail companies without their permission; where hundreds of
employees at an HMO have access to patients' records.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Bush offered a nod, telling Business Week recently, ``I'm a
privacy-rights person. The marketplace can function without
sacrificing the privacy of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, privacy seems like a sure-fire political issue: it
touches day-to-day anxieties triggered when people are asked to
divulge their credit card number over the telephone or when they
retrieve cash from an ATM machine. It is always a draw for press
coverage. And as Internet use burgeons, so will fears.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians face a challenge to convert privacy from being a
subliminal worry to something that will actually affect how people
vote. Complicating that challenge is that privacy is not, at first
glance, a matter that would drive voters to one party or another.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been the most aggressive in vying for the privacy
niche. They are framing it as a tension between civil libertarians
and consumers on one side and big business on the other. Already,
in the House, Democrats have zeroed in on a vote taken last July,
in which most Republicans opposed instituting rigorous privacy
protection for customers' medical and financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Although privacy comes up less in political discourse among
Republicans, they argue that it would not be out of character for
them to seize the issue. After all, libertarians have always been
big on privacy. And Republicans were the most outspoken in
condemning the Census Bureau's long form, asserting that it was an
infringement on privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hill that nobody holds, and either party could seize
the ground,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who for
months has been using flip charts to persuade his clients that
privacy ``is a huge issue waiting'' for someone to grab. ``The
issue of privacy is very much in the place that health care was a
decade or so ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that either party could potentially become
identified with privacy, Newhouse said the competition will be over
who ``can be there first and strongest and be the noisiest on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a Gallup poll in March asked who would better handle
protecting ordinary Americans against invasions of privacy. Gore
drew 41 percent; Bush, 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy may be so potentially hot that some candidates did not
want to publicly admit that they were husbanding the issue for
their fall arsenals. Who wants to tip off a rival to a fresh line
of attack?
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaigns are reluctant about showing leg early on this,''
said Jim Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But candidates who face primary opponents do not have the luxury
of holding off. Last week, former Rep. Maria Cantwell, who is
running for the Democratic Senate nomination from Washington state,
began broadcasting a television commercial on privacy. Cantwell,
who lost her seat after one term in the Gingrich revolution of
1994, went on to make between $25 million and $50 million in the
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Peering into the camera, Cantwell says in the 30-second spot:
``What you do on your own computer should be your business and
nobody else's. I want to make sure no child is left behind and that
the Internet remains a tool for learning, not another way for
government, banks or insurance companies to invade your privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of another Democrat, Mike Ciresi, a trial lawyer
who is seeking the Senate nomination from Minnesota, last week
swamped potential supporters with thousands of glossy brochures
featuring the headline, ``Mike Ciresi Will Protect Your Privacy!''
'
</P>
<P>
   When voters are asked what concerns them most, they seldom cite
privacy right off the bat. Yet pollsters find that when voters are
probed about issues that affect their lives, privacy shoots to the
top _ or close to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave me a couple of ears _ I just listen to people,'' said
Brian Schweitzer, a peppermint farmer and soil scientist from
Whitefish, Mont., who is running for the U.S. Senate. ``Everywhere
I go in Montana people want to protect their privacy. It's huge!''
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer, a Democrat who hopes to oust Sen. Conrad Burns,
accused the Republican incumbent of co-sponsoring a bill that
``would force the individual consumer to contact corporate America
and beg them not to collate and sell your personal information.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Burns insisted that Schweitzer ``mischaracterized
the legislation'' and was simply ``trying to get his name in the
paper.'' He is just as committed, he said, to guarding people's
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether this issue will truly rouse voters in the
fall of 2000 to the same extent as health care and education. After
all, even after the tax revolt of 1978 in California, it took years
for cutting taxes to become a winning issue nationally. And despite
stirrings about smog and dirty water in the 1970s, the environment
did not emerge as a top-of-the-mind concern of American voters
until years later.
</P>
<P>
   The other challenge facing both sides is that there are no easy
remedies for protecting privacy. Even if consumers clamor about
their rights, no politician wants to be seen taking steps that
could hobble the new economy _ or provoke the Internet industry,
which has become increasingly generous in doling out contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates should also be mindful that there can be unintended
consequences when they try to capitalize on a new issue.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for Rep. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said that in
their drive to topple the incumbent Republican, Sen. Spencer
Abraham, they plan to castigate him as siding with big business _
and against consumers _ on privacy matters.
</P>
<P>
   But Abraham shot back that he intends to play up that his
campaign has an ``Internet privacy policy on our Web site _ and she
doesn't even have one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be interesting for Congresswoman Stabenow to make
that an issue,'' he said. ``We're explicit. We will protect the
privacy of people who log on to our Web site.''

A NEWT-LESS REVOLUTION WITH A FAMILIAR AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating)  (The Week in Review)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Gov. George W. Bush rolls out policy address
after policy address, congressional Republicans are watching him do
what Newt Gingrich, Trent Lott and the self-effacing Dennis Hastert
could not: win a fresh hearing for ideas cherished by
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Newt-less revolution.
</P>
<P>
   For all the recent talk of how Bush has moved to the center, the
thrust of his campaign has been to employ more sympathetic rhetoric
and symbolism to refashion a Republican policy wish list long
familiar on Capitol Hill and in conservative think tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not speak in strident, angry tones of big government.
Rather, he focuses on how conservative ideas can help the working
poor, describing, for example, how tax incentives could help expand
home ownership. Sometimes the picture alone sends a message, with
Bush standing next to minority children or campaigning in the inner
city.
</P>
<P>
   It's this sort of thing that has helped Bush give the
Republicans the kinder, gentler face they have longed for in place
of Gingrich's steely intellectualism.
</P>
<P>
   In substance, though, Bush has done little to challenge the
basic conservative tenets that have defined his party at least
since Ronald Reagan's presidency. Yes, he has chastised House
Republicans on the budget, and told Senate Republicans not to tie
the president's hands on foreign policy. But only on education has
he broken fundamentally with his conservative allies by calling for
the federal government to play a more forceful role in America's
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free market guys like me don't see in his suggestions anything
that's problematic,'' said Grover Norquist, president of Americans
for Tax Reform, who had been a Gingrich adviser. ``And we welcome
his much-improved tone and rhetoric _ over Barry Goldwater, let's
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's proposals, like diverting some Social Security
payroll taxes to individual investment accounts, have drawn rave
reviews from the conservative intellectuals. As the writer Ramesh
Ponnuru noted in a recent National Review story, Social Security is
``symbolically what's left of the New Deal,'' and Bush is not
holding it sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bush's ideas have been incubating in Republican policy
circles for years. For example:
</P>
<P>
   When Bush spoke on Social Security, he was picking up a ball
dropped by the House Ways and Means Committee, when Republican
leaders, afraid of the political risk, scuttled plans to create an
individual investment plan.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bush's support of a missile defense system with
global reach has a GOP heritage stretching back to President
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In advocating a $1.3 trillion tax reduction over 10 years, Bush
is aligning himself with House and Senate Republicans, who pushed
in 1999 for a $792 billion tax reduction, then retreated in
disarray after President Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, Bush's proposal for a tax credit of up to $2,000 a
family to help working people with low or moderate incomes buy
health insurance is very close to proposals pushed by Rep. Dick
Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader, and Sen. Bill Frist,
R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that Bush's advisers occasionally become impatient
with comparisons of their candidate's ``compassionate
conservatism'' to Clinton's ``New Democrat'' break with his own
party's orthodoxy. Bush's policy agenda, one of his aides said,
``is within Republican orthodoxy but takes it to the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   For congressional Republicans, who long regarded themselves as
belonging to the party of ideas, this is vindication. This time,
they feel, they have the right messenger and, as a presidential
contender, he has a megaphone almost as big as the president's.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Bush's Social Security proposal, Armey said, ``A
Republican in the House brings it up and before he can get it
before the American people it gets reframed as the secret
Republican plan to destroy Social Security. When Governor Bush
brings it up, people first say, `What is he talking about?' And
when he brings it up it has a standing with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman who attended many House
Republican hand-wringing sessions, noted that a lawmaker with an
idea got little attention, but ``when Governor Bush gave his speech
on Social Security it was carried live on CNN and Fox TV and made
the front page of all the national newspapers the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that, despite his amiability, Bush's positions
are to the right of those of the great American middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a fairly doctrinaire conservative,'' said Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``I think he has done a masterful job at
making himself look more moderate than the positions he has taken
in the campaign, let alone his record in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gore and his allies have been trying to portray Bush as out
of the mainstream by branding each of his proposals a ``risky
scheme.'' But this has proven harder for the Democrats than four
years ago _ and not just because of Bush's manner.
</P>
<P>
   The federal surplus has changed the political dynamics. In 1995,
when Republicans wanted to balance the budget as well as grant a
large tax cut, it meant they had to make unpopular reductions in
other programs. By contrast, Bush has been able to propose both a
large tax cut and new social spending. And Democrats, in trying to
co-opt or defuse some Republican ideas, have made them harder to
demonize.
</P>
<P>
   Take missile defense. Last year the White House dropped its veto
threat against legislation calling for a national missile defense
after some language was inserted committing the nation to build
such a program only when it became ``technologically possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That accommodation _ as well as a newly perceived threat from
rogue nations _ helped shift the debate so that the battle was no
longer over whether to have a missile defense, but what kind and at
what cost.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton's call for the government itself to invest
some Social Security taxes in the stock market, coupled with his
proposal to give lower income taxpayers up to $300 a year for a new
type of retirement account, makes it harder for Democrats to argue
against Bush's innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Public attitudes also change over time and over generations. The
Bush campaign is betting that with nearly half of American
households now owning stock, fewer Americans will so fear the
market that they will insist that Social Security remain as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has
come,'' Armey said. The Democrats are hoping mightily that Bush's
timing is off.  &QL;

conservatism'' to Clinton's ``New Democrat'' break with his own
party's orthodoxy. Bush's policy agenda, one of his aides said,
``is within Republican orthodoxy but takes it to the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   For congressional Republicans, who long regarded themselves as
belonging to the party of ideas, this is vindication. This time,
they feel, they have the right messenger and, as a presidential
contender, he has a megaphone almost as big as the president's.
</P>
<P>
   Praising Bush's Social Security proposal, Armey said, ``A
Republican in the House brings it up and before he can get it
before the American people it gets reframed as the secret
Republican plan to destroy Social Security. When Governor Bush
brings it up, people first say, `What is he talking about?' And
when he brings it up it has a standing with the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman who attended many House
Republican hand-wringing sessions, noted that a lawmaker with an
idea got little attention, but ``when Governor Bush gave his speech
on Social Security it was carried live on CNN and Fox TV and made
the front page of all the national newspapers the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that, despite his amiability, Bush's positions
are to the right of those of the great American middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a fairly doctrinaire conservative,'' said Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``I think he has done a masterful job at
making himself look more moderate than the positions he has taken
in the campaign, let alone his record in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   So Gore and his allies have been trying to portray Bush as out
of the mainstream by branding each of his proposals a ``risky
scheme.'' But this has proven harder for the Democrats than four
years ago _ and not just because of Bush's manner.
</P>
<P>
   The federal surplus has changed the political dynamics. In 1995,
when Republicans wanted to balance the budget as well as grant a
large tax cut, it meant they had to make unpopular reductions in
other programs. By contrast, Bush has been able to propose both a
large tax cut and new social spending. And Democrats, in trying to
co-opt or defuse some Republican ideas, have made them harder to
demonize.
</P>
<P>
   Take missile defense. Last year the White House dropped its veto
threat against legislation calling for a national missile defense
after some language was inserted committing the nation to build
such a program only when it became ``technologically possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That accommodation _ as well as a newly perceived threat from
rogue nations _ helped shift the debate so that the battle was no
longer over whether to have a missile defense, but what kind and at
what cost.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton's call for the government itself to invest
some Social Security taxes in the stock market, coupled with his
proposal to give lower income taxpayers up to $300 a year for a new
type of retirement account, makes it harder for Democrats to argue
against Bush's innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Public attitudes also change over time and over generations. The
Bush campaign is betting that with nearly half of American
households now owning stock, fewer Americans will so fear the
market that they will insist that Social Security remain as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has
come,'' Armey said. The Democrats are hoping mightily that Bush's
timing is off.  &QL;

 ART ADV: An illustration of a father fleeing from ties is available
by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By MARY LOFTUS 
 c.2000 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, I'll be brief. To the point. No frills.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 things to get dad for Father's Day that aren't
sappy, silly or sentimental. Because, when you get past the
hand-drawn card or the goofy tie, dads want stuff that's practical.
</P>
<P>
   They want presents that, just like good children, work hard,
don't cost much and do what they're supposed to do. And after the
ambiguity of parenthood, it might be nice to have something with a
lifetime guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   1. The Sapphire Lifetime Light ($20, Herrington, 800-903-2878).
A tiny but brilliant LED flashlight that clips to key ring, coat or
briefcase, and gives a full 180 degrees of illumination instead of
a narrow slice of light. The beam projects up to a mile, lasts for
more than 100,000 hours of use and comes with a lifetime guarantee.
It is shockproof and waterproof, and comes in burgundy, blue,
black, silver, gold, violet or green. You can gold-plate it for $10
more.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Timex Expedition pocket watch ($17, campmor.com,
888-226-7667). A water-resistant pocket watch with caribiner clip
that can attach to backpack, golf bag or belt. Can be used while
jogging, hiking, beach-combing or during sports. Hands are
luminescent, and it has large, easy-to-read numbers.
</P>
<P>
   3. An all-inclusive gift certificate with a theme: a weekend at
a beach condo wrapped in a deluxe beach towel with sunscreen,
baseball cap and Beach Boys CD; a car detailing inside a leather
map holder with a key chain and a dual cigarette power adapter; a
golfing day on the greens with new balls, shirt and tees.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Sony SkyMap GPS 2000 navigational system ($199, Best
Buy). Plug it into your laptop and the car's cigarette lighter, and
you can find your way around anywhere. Comes with a free year of
live traffic reports, for dads who hate traffic jams and asking for
directions.
</P>
<P>
   5. Simmons full-sized binoculars ($77, www.netique.com) feature
focus-free viewing, with a 367-foot field of view at 1,000 yards.
Fully coated lenses and leatherette fanny pack included. Great for
bird-watching while hiking, or seeing Cirque du Soleil from the
back rows.
</P>
<P>
   6. An online gift certificate from Barnes &AMP; Noble
(www.barnesandnoble.com) or Amazon.com (www.amazon.com). You can
send, browse and spend online, and your dad can pick the book he
wants, although you could give him some tips: ``Dave Barry Turns
50'' by Dave Barry himself ($15); ``Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic
Proportions,'' by Daniel Wallace ($18); ``Messages from My
Father,'' by Calvin Trillin ($8); ``Fathers and Sons: An
Anthology,'' by Alberto Manguel ($13); ``The Complete Illustrated
Guide to Everything Sold at Hardware Stores,'' by Steve Ettlinger
($15); ``The Fred Book,'' by Fred Imus ($11.)
</P>
<P>
   7. A Skil rechargeable, cordless screwdriver ($19, The Home
Depot). Handy for home repairs and shop projects. Does all the work
without stripping the screw. Comes with a plug-in recharger and
changeable bits, for Phillips or flathead.
</P>
<P>
   8. A subscription to a magazine, from the trendy Men's Journal
($10/10 issues, MensJournal.com) to Men's Health ($25 per year,
www.menshealth.com) to the digital Wired ($15 per year,
www.wired.com), to the top weekly news mags, Newsweek ($41 per
year, 1-800-631-1040) and Time ($67 per year, 1-800-843-TIME). Or
he may enjoy browsing Smithsonian magazine ($26 per year,
www.smithsonianmag.si.edu).
</P>
<P>
   9. Handyman for a day. Find a reputable fix-it-all tradesman in
your area and make up a short list of home improvements that dad
has been putting off all year. Pay by the job, and tell him to get
as far as he can in a day. Give him a bonus if dad wants to help.
</P>
<P>
   10. OK, this is a little bit sentimental: eBay auctions
(www.ebay.com) has a feature where you can plug in key words and
they'll let you know when related items become available, from a
picture postcard of the town where your dad grew up to a souvenir
ticket stub from the World Series. Just plug in key words then bid.
You'll be sure to get a few personalized items that are a custom
fit.

 ART ADV: Photo of East Brother Lighthouse available in JPEG format
by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355. 
 By KEN MCALPINE 
 c. 2000 Ken McAlpine. 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<TEXT>
<P>
   We stand, my wife Kathy and I, by the white picket fence marking
the rocky edge of East Brother Island. Close at hand, ghostly sea
gulls glide silently and a foghorn moans. Thirteen miles away, the
lights of San Francisco flicker. A light breeze carrying the scent
of tide, brings just enough damp to force Kathy to press into me,
and for this I am grateful. Above us, from atop the main house
where we have just finished a gourmet dinner, East Brother Light
Station swings its beam over a dark carpet of night-still water.
</P>
<P>
   Lighthouses lend themselves to many things. One of them is a
silence in which you might hear your wife's innermost desires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering,'' says Kathy. ``Maybe I should have asked for
the recipe for the fudge cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Good news is you can stay at the East Brother Light Station, and
assorted other lighthouses scattered about the country, indulging
in the romance you imagine.
</P>
<P>
   The days of the lightkeepers have receded into the past. At the
turn of the century there were about 1,000 lighthouses in the
United States manned by hardy folk unafraid of solitude and foul
weather. Of the 600-some lighthouses still operating today, only
one manned station remains (Boston Harbor Light _ the rest are
automated). But at a select few windswept locales, the keepers'
homes have been refurbished and reinvented to elevate solitude,
foul weather (if you're lucky) and languorous idyll to romantic
art.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight guests arrive at East Brother Island just past 4 p.m.
and depart at 11 the next morning. To people whose credo is ``seize
the day,'' it might seem wantonly indulgent to spend hours occupied
with nothing but eating, reading and gazing out at wind-beaten
waters. Nevermind. Letting the rest of the world seize the day
while we stepped off and into each other's arms sounded great to
us.
</P>
<P>
   And it sounded smarter still when Captain Gary met us that
afternoon at the San Pablo Yacht Harbor dock to whisk us, four
couples in all, by small outboard, the 10 minutes to East Brother
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Before we set foot in the boat, he made our responsibilities
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have three rules on the island,'' he said. ``Don't make the
cook mad, don't make the captain mad, and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   I liked Captain Gary. He and his wife Ann are the innkeepers at
East Brother Light. During our overnight stay, Ann would wield
spices and seasonings to fashion miracles, including broccoli
George Bush would weep for. For his part, Captain Gary displayed a
vast knowledge of lighthouses, wore numerous jaunty caps and
sported a mischievous manner that led me to believe he'd ignored a
few rules of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, we had more responsibilities than Captain Gary
outlined. Arriving at East Brother Island, we were greeted by Ann,
shown to our rooms, and presented with a tidy one-page schedule
indicating that in short order we were expected in the upstairs
parlor of the main house for champagne and French brie.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy and I were in the separate Fog Signal Building, in a small
room tucked just off from a maze of pipes and machinery which we
would soon see was in fine working order. (Four larger rooms are
located in the main house, which is topped by the light station).
Our room was just big enough for a sink, brass bed and well-stocked
bookshelf. But it was ship-cabin cozy, with white linens, the sweet
smell of wood and windows that looked out to the water and the
skyline of San Francisco turning pink-hued in the falling dark.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as we were alone, Kathy scanned our itinerary, quickly
assessing what was required of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd better not fill up on hors d'oeuvres. They're serving
Cornish game hen and chocolate fudge cake for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be little opportunity to walk any of this off.
Plunked at the juncture of the San Pablo and San Francisco bays,
East Brother Island is a but three-quarters of an acre of rock.
This provides just enough terra firma for two small, low-slung
buildings (our Fog Signal Building and Gary and Ann's
flower-fronted quarters), and, at the island's center, a concrete
hummock that marks the cistern. (The island's water supply comes
solely from gathered rain, so showers aren't allowed for guests who
stay just one night.)
</P>
<P>
   Rising above this, painstakingly resurrected from the mists of
the past, is the main house, a stately, four-story Victorian
mansion, beige with white gingerbread trim, capped with the light
tower that first winked to life over 100 years earlier. Island and
structures are all ringed by a hand-cut white picket fence,
overhung by wheeling gulls, and scoured by salt breezes. It's as if
someone touched a wand to nautical nostalgia and brought it to
life.
</P>
<P>
   In the upstairs parlor of the main house we shared hors
d'oeuvres with the four other couples staying the night. They were
friendly, in their early thirties to mid-fifties, mostly from
California _ computer programmers, business owners, educators and
engineers _ looking to celebrate something special or nothing at
all. Judging from a guest book I browsed through later, ours was a
representative group, though other guests have endured more.
(``It's day three,'' wrote one visitor, marooned on the island by a
storm, ``and we're almost out of wine!'').
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on soft couches and gleaming dark wood chairs,
wood-stove warmed and fortified with red-pepper-and-green-olive
hummus, we listened as Captain Gary explained some of the history
of East Brother Light. The house we sat in, he told us, was nearly
identical to the one a string of lightkeepers called home going
back to March 1, 1874, the day the station shot its first warning
beacon over the water.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the buildings were abandoned by the Coast Guard, then
for 10 years gnawed by the elements to near extinction. However,
the weather-beaten structures were rescued by a non-profit
citizen's group and restored, several hundred volunteers working
for 18 months to re-create each building down to the finest detail.
East Brother Light opened as a bed and breakfast in November, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The main house we were sitting in, Gary told us, was a bit more
luxurious than the original version the lightkeepers stayed in, but
not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why the house was so nice back then?'' Gary asked.
``They had to entice people to take the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, reading through an interesting history of the Island, I
discovered why. Husbands and wives did live together on East
Brother Island, and now and then they might have found time for
each other. But for the most part they were occupied with danger
(fires and shipwrecks), hardship (on foggy nights they slept _ or
tried to _ 50 yards from a foghorn loud enough to jump start a
hairline on a cue ball) and daily ennui _ repairs, sanding,
painting, record keeping and repairs on those repairs
</P>
<P>
   Looking to capture something beyond workaday life, one couple
cultivated a garden. Another husband and wife, Earl and Lillian
Snodgrass, planted a stand of young trees.
</P>
<P>
   In short, their lives together were a lot like ours.
</P>
<P>
   Before dinner, Gary provided us a brief glimpse of their lives.
We all trooped into the Fog Signal Building, where Gary fired up a
1939 Caterpillar Diesel engine you could eat off of, then moved
quickly about, turning handles and pulling levers to release the
required burst of air.
</P>
<P>
   The diaphone fog signal was no longer used to sound warnings,
but Gary set it off so guests might get a memorable feel for
fog-shrouded nights past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fog signal, is, shall we say, loud,'' said Gary, ushering
us quickly outside so that we might enjoy its full resonance. ``You
can hear it from 23 miles away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What about your neighbors?'' asked Pam Chupka, a young woman
from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``What neighbors?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a short wail, sounding plaintive, lovely and mournful.
This came from the small foghorn that still peeps regularly at
30-second intervals from the other side of the island. What
followed might be approximated if you handed Godzilla a tuba, then
stomped on his foot.
</P>
<P>
   The blast left my ears, but continued to reverberate in my chest
and kneecaps.
</P>
<P>
   Gary smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this was a working diaphone, it sounded every 20 seconds
for as long as it was foggy. That's why the exterior walls of the
house were mortar-lined brick. For insulation. Still, the keepers
didn't get much sleep in the foggy season.''
</P>
<P>
   In short order, our nerves were calmed by a magical four-course
meal accompanied by good conversation, sweet zinfandels and
tinkling silver. Post-dinner, our responsibilities consisted of
holding each other, backdropped by a lullaby of wind and water,
then waking early enough to get at Ann's hot popovers.
</P>
<P>
   That night the diaphone was silent, but still I woke in the
middle of the night, easing out of bed, leaving my softly breathing
wife. Outside the air was warm. I stood beside a row of eucalyptus
trees, watching the dark, swirling currents, happy to be alone
because I knew I wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Earl and Lillian Snodgrass are gone, but the trees they planted
together are tall and sweet-smelling now, tribute to a shared life.

   Philip Johnson's Brasserie was a chic haunt for late-night
regulars like Andy Warhol and Halston during its heyday in the '60s
and '70s. But by 1995, when it was damaged by fire, the hangout had
become famously tattered. Enter architects Elizabeth Diller and
Ricardo Scofidio _ a pair of professors currently sharing a 1999
MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' award _ for the makeover.
</P>
<P>
   The two began to rethink the room as a slick new East Side
restaurant with white upholstered Saarinen chairs and translucent
green resin tabletops.
</P>
<P>
   Today the streamlined Brasserie resembles nothing so much as the
first-class departure lounge at tomorrow's airport. Under a new
wraparound pearwood ceiling, the barstools wear clear plastic seat
pads filled with yellow medical gel. For the men's and women's rest
rooms, a single trough sink passes coyly through a slot cut in the
common wall, simultaneously serving both sexes. And a row of
flat-screen video monitors above the bar shows live surveillance
snapshots of patrons coming through the front door _ exactly what
you'd expect from a pair of architectural theorists who are
fascinated with the politics of watching and of being watched.
</P>
<P>
   With Manhattan's Brasserie having opened on January 11, 2000,
British lifestyle merchant Sir Terence Conran was not about to be
outdone. Just blocks away, Conran, together with partner Joel
Kissin, has inaugurated the nineteenth in his global portfolio of
signature restaurants (already a collection that includes London's
Bibendum and Bluebird). His new Guastavino's is actually a duo of
eateries, offering formal dining at Club Guastavino upstairs and a
less expensive bar and brasserie below.
</P>
<P>
   Finally redeveloped after decades of tortured planning, the
vaulted space _ built of fireproof tiles in 1914 by the architect
Rafael Guastavino y Esposito _ once arched over a farmers' market
under New York's Queensboro Bridge. Hometown architect Hardy
Holzman Pfeiffer specified repairs to the creamy tile shell and the
floor was paved with matching shades of marble.
</P>
<P>
   Conran's own designers installed a mezzanine that greatly
increases the capacity of the space. Extending under the rustic
granite arch of the bridge foundation, the upper level also
provides two private dining areas with gritty views out to the
roadway's underbelly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GETTING THERE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guastavino and Club Guastavino are located at 409 E. 59th St.
between First and York Avenues in Manhattan. Guastavino is open for
lunch from Monday through Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and for
Saturday and Sunday brunch, from 11:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Dinner is
served from 5:30 pm. For reservations, call (212)980-2455. Club
Guastavino is open for lunch from Tuesday through Saturday, 11:30
a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and for dinner Tuesday through Saturday, from
5:30 p.m. A special brunch menu is served on Saturdays and Sundays.
Call (212)421-6644 for reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The Brasserie is located at 100 E. 53rd St. between Park and
Lexington Avenues. From Monday through Saturday, it's open from 7
a.m. to 1 a.m. (except for a half-hour hiatus between 11 a.m. and
11:30 a.m. during which the restaurant is closed). The Brasserie
serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, and what it calls ``apres
midi'' _ a light, afternoon menu. Sundays, the Brasserie is open
from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. All menu items are a la carte. Dinner
entrees range in price between $15 and $29. For reservations, call
(212) 751-4840.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1973, Alvin Toffler, the alarmist author of ``Future Shock,''
observed the rapid proliferation of answering machines with
apprehension. Their surging popularity, he fretted, was giving
society little time to ``make the subtle kind of adaptation
necessary to it before it has committed itself to the use of the
technology. Maybe the consequences are trivial. But who knows and
who asks? Nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering machines could undoubtedly relieve owners of the
nagging worry that they might miss important calls, but Toffler and
others thought that being greeted by a recording rather than a live
person was unsettling or even alienating.
</P>
<P>
   One 1975 magazine article advised consumers to try to come up
with a greeting that would get the caller through the ``shock of
his discovery as gently as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, answering machines weren't all that new. They had been
invented in 1898 when a Danish engineer named Valdemar Poulsen
patented the first magnetic recorder which he called the
``telegraphone.''
</P>
<P>
   This device recorded sounds on a spindle of steel wire. Starting
in 1903, Poulsen marketed a modified version of the machine in the
United States as a tool for dictation and automatically recording
telephone messages.
</P>
<P>
   After being activated by the signal for an incoming call, the
telegraphone recorded the transmitted electrical impulses directly
onto the wire. Only when the user played the message back were they
converted into sound. Since there was no outgoing message, callers
had to know when the machine was in use. The telegraphone could
also record both sides of a telephone conversation, with or without
the knowledge of the party at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Poulsen's invention didn't work very well. The
recorded messages were often incomprehensible and the steel wire,
which had to move across the recording and playback heads at a rate
of several feet per second, tended to jam. The American
Telegraphone Company went bankrupt in 1915 after selling only a few
hundred units.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Poulsen seemed to be on to something. What if
Watson had been out to lunch when Alexander Graham Bell made the
first phone call in 1876? There was clearly a need for something
that could answer the phone when no one was home.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Edison was the next to enter the field with his
Telescribe in 1914. It recorded telephone conversations on wax
phonograph cylinders, which could be reused by shaving the wax
coating to erase old recordings.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't clear whether the Telescribe had any provision for
answering the telephone when the user wasn't present. Apparently
few businesses returned calls from Telescribe salesmen. Although a
number of models came on the market in the following decades,
answering machines remained rare and expensive curiosities until
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Then U.S. companies began selling and leasing a new generation
of machines incorporating the latest advances in postwar
electronics. AT&AMP;T's Peatrophone, introduced in 1951, occupied a
metal box about the size of a milk crate and used two phonograph
turntables for incoming and outgoing messages.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, magnetic tape had largely replaced wires and disks
in recording devices and transistors had supplanted clunky vacuum
tubes. Lower prices and improved reliability expanded the small
market for answering machines at the dawn of the 1970s, but they
still weren't cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Top-of-the-line machines cost $800 to $900. The customers for
them were mainly small businesses that couldn't afford
receptionists and upwardly mobile people who couldn't afford to be
without high-status appliances.
</P>
<P>
   In basic operation, answering machines of the 1970s differed
little from the computerized models of today. Like a telephone, an
answering machine has a detector circuit that waits for a ring
signal from the phone company. Instead of activating a bell, the
detector circuit waits a certain number of rings and then
automatically closes a circuit between the answering machine and
the phone company, signaling an ``off-hook'' condition, which is
the phone company's cue to open a voice connection with the caller.
A greeting is played, followed by the beep.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there is a fixed length for messages, circuitry enables
the machine to hang up when it receives a disconnect signal from
the phone company or after a long interval of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Even the better models 25 years ago were inconvenient.
Installation could be tricky, with phone companies requiring an
expensive coupling device designed to prevent third-party equipment
from damaging phone lines (or from competing with the phone
company's own equipment). You could get around this by using
answering machines that didn't plug right into the phone line;
instead the telephone handset rested in a cradle, like an early
computer modem.
</P>
<P>
   Sound quality in these models was poor. Many machines used
built-in tapes, inaccessible to the user, or special tape
cartridges available only from the unit's manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Cheaper models economized by using the same tape for incoming
and outgoing messages and making the user record a separate
outgoing message for each incoming message, taking care not to
erase the beep accidentally. Still, the benefits outweighed the
hassles for those who could afford a machine.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, lower prices and increasing experience with the
concept of talking by phone to a machine opened the way for
answering machines to become standard equipment for young
urbanites.
</P>
<P>
   Sales quadrupled between 1982 and 1986 while the average price
for a unit dropped below $100. Modular jacks and the removal of
phone company constraints made installation simple; touch-tone
codes provided an easy way to retrieve messages on the go.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Toffler's fears about the off-putting voice box fell by
the wayside. Suddenly, callers began to be affronted when someone
didn't have a machine. With bare-bones models costing as little as
$19.95, what was once a token of affluence became a perfectly
ordinary commodity.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, three out of five households had answering
machines. Moreover, familiarity and comfort with the machines have
transformed the way we use them. Most callers no longer feel that
they're talking to a machine; they are addressing a person, with
the machine a nearly transparent intermediary, much like the
telephone itself.
</P>
<P>
   Terse, awkward recitations have given way to casual, chatty
monologues. At the same time, call screening has introduced an
effective tool for avoiding communicating, such as when
telemarketers, bill collectors, or relatives call.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, callers nowadays often prefer to leave a recorded
message, making their communication without troubling with the
niceties of a two-way conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Today's high-tech answering machines are about as small as they
can get without making the controls inconveniently tiny. Low-cost
microchips handle all the work and offer such new features as an
individual voice-mail box for each member of a household. Tapeless
models capture sound as binary data on a chip, compressed by
mathematical algorithms and stored in memory to be reconstituted
later as that long-dreaded call from your aunt in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   However, the stand-alone answering machine may be an endangered
species, its functions getting absorbed by centralized voice mail,
the telephone itself, the fax machine, the computer, or some
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps before long, your computer will answer the phone and
engage in a simple conversation with a caller. Then as our friends'
computers call our computers, we will silently listen in, observing
what our machines have to say to each other.

<P>
   Carjackers forced Peter Behr to strip to his underpants. One
kicked him in the face. Another shoved a pistol in his mouth. A
third put a hunting knife to the throat of his 15-year-old son.
After commandeering his Mazda outside a shopping complex in
Nairobi, the carjackers became annoyed. Their hearts had been set
on a Toyota. When they discovered their mistake, they drove it and
its occupants to the outskirts of Kenya's capital and
pistol-whipped Behr and his son, Glen. The robbers then walked
away, leaving the car keys.
</P>
<P>
   The Behrs drove straight to a police station. When the Kenyan
police found out that the Mazda had not been stolen and that its
owner and his son were neither dead nor dying, they said, in
effect, no harm, no foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't want to know,'' whispered Behr, 47, a
third-generation Kenyan who retired as a white hunter when going
after big game was banned 23 years ago and is now a safari guide.
``I have been jumped by a leopard, but nothing was as scary as that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   He whispered his hijack story as we were sitting together in his
Land Rover in the middle of a herd of about 60 elephants grazing in
the Masai Mara game reserve. It was dawn. The only noise they made
was when they wrapped their trunks around clumps of dew-drenched
grass, ripping them from the earth. This was background music to
the white hunter's sotto voce story about his adventures with the
Nairobi criminals four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When I visited Peter Behr and his wife, Louise, at Masai Mara
early this year, it seemed as if the animals had come together on
the mile-high equatorial plain and decided to throw a party. Soft
rains had delayed the coming of the dry season. Gazelles chased
each other on the plain. Fat lions slept in the wondrously green
grass. The reserve, just a half hour by air from Nairobi, was all
dressed up for what should have been prime time in the tourist
season. But there was hardly a human around.
</P>
<P>
   During the two nights I spent at Behr's small but splendid camp
beside the Mara River, called Olonana, there were just two tourists
_ and they were there by sheer chance. A tour operator had sent
them to there after their walking safari in another Kenyan game
reserve had been canceled for lack of people.
</P>
<P>
   There is a link, of course, between the lack of paying customers
in paradise and the carjacking that haunts Behr. It's a
canary-in-the-coal-mine connection. The decline of tourism tracks
the decline of nearly everything in Kenya. Kenya was once a
celebrated exception to the rule of misrule in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   When I lived in Nairobi and traveled across the continent as a
reporter in the second half of the 1980s, it was always a relief to
come home. Kenya simply worked better than the rest of black-ruled
Africa. When I returned to Kenya this year after an 11-year
absence, the change was staggering. Roads were in ruins, telephones
barely worked during business hours and the school system was on
the verge of collapse. As a result, Western governments and
investors had turned their backs on the country.
</P>
<P>
   After years of daily flights, Lufthansa and Air France had
halted passenger service. In the 1990s foreign investment fell to a
fifth of previous levels. Major donors, including the United
States, had all but ended aid to the government. The coffee and tea
industries were in decline because of corrupt management that
allowed the state to bleed profits from farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, earnings from tourism, a cornerstone of the
economy and a key source of foreign currency, had slid nearly 40
percent in five years. Half the country's tourist beds had gone
empty since 1997. Kenya lost its dominance in the African safari
trade, according to American travel agents, as many travelers opted
for game-drive vacations in Botswana, South Africa and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? It is one of Africa's most familiar _ and saddest
_ stories since self-rule spread across the continent in the 1960s.
A one-man regime ruined the country to preserve itself. President
Daniel arap Moi, who is in his mid-70s and has been in office for
22 years, ran his country into the ground so that he might have a
few more years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya's fall is especially disturbing because it could easily
have been averted. Moi's government strangled an economy that was
vibrantly alive. It fomented ethnic violence where there was none,
triggering tribal bloodshed during election years. Displaced
Kenyans didn't vote, and Moi won disputed elections in 1992 and
1997. In the process, he crippled a tourist industry that thrived
on the passion of travelers who were enchanted by Kenya and who
went home to spread the word about an African paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Crime, which has been scaring off foreign tourists for years,
has reached a level that alarms many Kenyans. The Standard, a
Kenyan daily, wrote in an editorial this year that residents of
Nairobi ``yearn for the days when they only dreaded nightfall.
These days women are raped in broad daylight, muggings pass
unnoticed, murders are committed with relative impunity, while
carjackings are now the rule rather than the exception.''
</P>
<P>
   When I read that editorial, it struck me as a bit over the top.
But when I walked across Nairobi on a Saturday morning to pick up
an airplane ticket, I wandered into a shootout. That afternoon,
students at the University of Nairobi rioted for the third day
running. What got them started was an attack by ruling-party thugs
on opposition members of Parliament. Kenyan policemen had stood by
and allowed the thugs to beat up the opposition lawmakers. Then the
policemen arrested the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent students from busting up the Norfolk Hotel, which
abuts the university and is the oldest tourist establishment in
Nairobi, security guards with clubs took up positions in front of
the hotel's Lord Delamere Veranda. White tourists retreated to the
hotel bar, where some of them drank tea and tried to concentrate on
books about a gracious Kenya that used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Their preferred diversion was ``Out of Africa,'' Karen Blixen's
memoir of a coffee farm she owned in the 1920s at the foot of the
Ngong Hills. When I moved to Nairobi in 1985, the film version of
``Out of Africa,'' which starred Meryl Streep and won the Oscar for
best movie, had just been shot on location in Kenya. When I
returned this year, another big-budget movie, ``I Dreamed of
Africa,'' starring Kim Basinger, had also just been filmed. It,
too, was based on a memoir about living on a farm in Kenya. But for
security reasons it could not be shot inside the country.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers, most of them white and many with money to burn, have
been part of the economic backbone of Kenya since the turn of the
century. The Swahili word ``safari'' entered popular American usage
after Theodore Roosevelt arrived in 1909 and hired 500 porters to
follow him into the bush with everything from collapsible bathtubs
to cases of Champagne. Soon thereafter, socialites, plutocrats,
maharajas, royalty and movie stars began to parade across Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to understand why. ``You emerged into thousands of
acres of rolling English parkland, a haze of blue lawn rising and
falling to the horizon, untouched by the plow and apparently
uninhabited,'' wrote James Fox in ``White Mischief,'' an account of
upper-class British shenanigans in highland Kenya in the 1920s and
'30s.
</P>
<P>
   In one highland enclave called Happy Valley, not far from
Nairobi, more than a few white settlers succumbed to what became
known as ``the three A's'' _ altitude, alcohol and adultery. By the
1980s, Kenyan entrepreneurs had perfected the high-end safari. They
were helped along by ``Out of Africa,'' which transformed the
upper-crust safari into a booming business that, at its height in
the late '80s and early '90s, brought in about a third of Kenya's
hard-currency earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The ``product,'' as tourist operators call Kenya's natural
offerings, had become an expensive fantasy that was part Happy
Valley, part Hollywood and part Ralph Lauren: balloon rides at dawn
over the wildebeest migration, followed by a Champagne breakfast,
followed by a nap in a tent with a hot shower and flush toilet.
Bush boutiques selling crisp cotton outfits of the sort that Meryl
Streep/Karen Blixen wore when she had a farm in Africa. Nouvelle
cuisine dinners served in candlelit mess tents by Masai waiters
with impossibly high cheekbones. The smell of wood smoke, the
perfume of frangipani and somewhere in the near distance _ the
chance of white mischief.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of fantasy that Peter and Louise Behr were
selling _ or trying to sell _ when I visited them at their camp.
Even though the place was nearly empty, they maintained five-star
standards in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is your shampoo, your conditioner and your shower gel,''
said Maurice Tissah, the steward who showed me to my tent on a high
bank above the Mara River. The tent was the size of a pricey hotel
suite in Paris and was done up 1920s style, with new but
old-looking steamer trunks, brass lanterns, a pasha-style pull rope
that turned on the lights and diaphanous folds of mosquito netting
encircling two king-size beds. After I showered with hot water
(using the gel), I sat out on the porch of my tent, watching hippos
gambol in the river.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, during our game drive, Behr told me that the
safari trade was unlikely to survive. He said insecurity had taken
too firm a hold in Kenya for tourism to recover.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when state-sponsored, election-year tribal violence
exploded along the Kenyan coast, the International Monetary Fund
got fed up with Moi. Citing corruption and poor governance, the IMF
suspended its $220 million aid program. Nearly all donor money to
the government has since dried up. Without aid or tourism, Kenya's
economy went dead in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to get the money flowing again, Moi appointed a sworn
enemy, Richard E. Leakey, the famous paleoanthropologist and
conservationist, to head the civil service and clean up corruption
in Kenya. Five years ago, Moi accused Leakey of being a racist, a
colonialist and a foreigner. (Leakey is a third-generation Kenyan.)
Thugs from Moi's ruling party attacked and flogged Leakey, who had
founded an opposition party and was considering a run for the
presidency. And yet last July Moi made Leakey the second most
powerful man in the country. If nothing else, Moi's choice of
Leakey as a corruption-buster was a masterstroke of public
relations.
</P>
<P>
   It intrigued donors, giving Moi's government more credibility
than it has had in a decade. Western diplomats regarded Leakey as
the Kenyan least likely to be played by Moi for a fool. And since
he took over the civil service, there have been impressive
improvements in the way the government keeps track of money and in
the quality of people appointed to run key government agencies,
like the port of Mombasa. Moi also got serious as never before
about luring back tourists.
</P>
<P>
   He named his closest adviser and longtime business associate,
Nicholas Biwott, as minister of tourism, trade and industry. Biwott
is no Leakey. He is tainted by allegations of corruption and has
been accused of involvement in the murder of a rival who, at the
time of his death, happened to be Kenya's foreign minister.
Biwott's appointment suggests that while Moi is more interested
than ever before in reviving tourism, he is not all that keen on
fundamental change in the way his regime does business.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived in Nairobi, I asked to see Biwott and was ushered
into his office less than 12 hours later. This was a shock. When I
was writing critical stories about Kenya in the late '80s, Biwott
stood on the floor of Parliament and denounced me by name as ``the
well-known girlfriend'' of South African spies. When I telephoned
him then to explain that I was a man, he paused for a long time,
chuckled and said we must get together soon, but refused ever to
see me _ until tourism took a nose dive and Moi told him to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   During more than two hours of conversation, Biwott, a short,
gray, gimlet-eyed man in a bright blue suit, was invariably polite,
even a bit wistful. I didn't have the heart to bring up the
business about the South African spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we squandered quite a bit,'' he said, referring to
Kenya's lost reputation. ``We need to work with the international
press. It is that negative publicity that has killed us. That is
why I am very, very pleased to receive you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Biwott is the best minister of tourism in 25 years,'' says
Mahmud Jan Mohamed, chairman of the Kenya Tourism Federation and
managing director of Serena Hotels, the largest chain of safari
lodges in East Africa. Still, Biwott has an international
reputation as one of Kenya's most corrupt ministers.
</P>
<P>
   During his 10 years as minister of energy, Biwott was linked in
the Kenyan press with a number of kickback schemes and
noncompetitive contracts awarded to companies in which he had an
interest. Even worse, he became a prime suspect in the 1990 murder
of the Kenyan foreign minister, Robert Ouko. As a result, Moi fired
Biwott and later ordered him arrested. But after a short stint in
jail and a slightly longer stay in the political doghouse, Biwott
returned to the good graces of the president, a fellow member of
the Kalenjin tribe. The murder remains unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   To help Moi win re-election in 1992, Biwott paid Kalenjin youths
to start ethnic clashes with rival tribes, according to testimony
given at a parliamentary inquiry into the violence. The violence
has continued off and on ever since and is a major reason why
tourists have been scared away from Kenya. As Biwott smiled wanly,
I asked him about the charges of corruption, murder and fomenting
violence that terrified tourists. Who was he, I asked, to put a
welcoming face on Kenya?
</P>
<P>
   ``All these perceptions are false,'' he said, without raising
his voice or seeming annoyed. ``I am neither powerful nor corrupt.
I do my work diligently, according to rules and procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked about the apparent conflict of interest involved in his
being in charge of tourism. He owns Air Kenya, an airline that with
the collapse of the road system has become the lifeline of the
safari industry. He also has major interests in a number of tourist
hotels and lodges. ``When we are in government, we don't get
involved in private business,'' he said, his smile tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Although numbers are down, wealthy tourists continue to travel
to Masai Mara. Almost none of them, though, go by car. They fly out
from Nairobi, usually on Biwott's Air Kenya planes, skipping six
spine-crunching hours on bad roads. But they also miss a journey I
regard as one of the marvels of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   From Nairobi, the road climbs 2,000 feet up the Kikuyu
escarpment to where the air has the bracing purity of the Scottish
highlands. The rolling hills are covered with the unearthly Day-Glo
green of ripening tea. Then, quite suddenly, the road comes to what
seems to be the edge of the earth _ the eastern wall of the Great
Rift Valley. Far below, down through the heat rising from the floor
of the valley, dormant volcanoes march off into an impossibly
distant horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Having been away from Kenya for so long, I had forgotten the
country's capacity to inspire wonder. During the long, dusty drive,
I found myself making plans to return to Kenya for a vacation. I
wanted to believe that Biwott and Moi and maybe even Leakey could
somehow work together to reverse Kenya's decline, revive living
standards and make the country safe for tourists. When I got out of
the sun, I got over it.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you own a radio, you know her songs. In the lucrative field
of Top 40 songwriting, Diane Warren is like Michael Jordan, the New
York Yankees or Wal-Mart. One of the summer's most expensive
movies, ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' which opens Friday, features a new
Warren song, ``Painted on My Heart,'' recorded by the Cult.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, 43, is arguably the most successful songwriter in music:
three of her songs, Toni Braxton's ``Un-Break My Heart,'' Celine
Dion's ``Because You Loved Me'' and Aerosmith's ``I Don't Want to
Miss a Thing,'' were among the biggest hits of the '90s. Other
writers have had equal success for a year, or a few. But no one can
match Warren's sustained highs. Since the mid-1980s, she has
written more pop hits than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, pop music mostly maintained the Broadway division
of labor: writers wrote; singers sang. Then came Bob Dylan, whom
the great Brill Building songwriter Doc Pomus once called ``the
worst thing that ever happened'' to the trade because he inspired
mediocre talents to write, which put the veterans out of business.
Now, deep into the MTV era, labels favor artists who look good over
those who write, which has put songwriters back in business, and in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Songwriters usually remain anonymous, but as with all dynasties,
Warren's success has inspired hatred. A writer for an alternative
paper in Seattle called her ``the execrable Diane Warren.'' Even
artists who benefit from her songs express ambivalence; Aerosmith's
singer, Steven Tyler, has called Warren ``a genius,'' then moments
later said that a lot of her songs are ``'expletive' see-through.''
A deal with the group to record ``Painted on My Heart'' fell
through shortly before the final deadline, which Warren calls ``a
bit of a slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The company she owns, Realsongs, grossed $25 million from her
copyrights last year, according to an executive there. Warren has
even become a force in Hollywood; she wrote the title song for
``Music of the Heart,'' which earned an Oscar nomination for
original song, her fourth consecutive nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``sync fee'' for use of a song in a film is among the
highest in the business, according to an executive who has worked
with her, at $150,000 to $175,000. The songs ``are worth every
penny,'' says Kathy Nelson, president of music at Buena Vista
Motion Picture Group, who hired Warren to customize songs for
``Armageddon'' and ``Con Air'' _ which, respectively, grossed $554
million and $224 million worldwide, the latter helped immeasurably
by Warren's smash ``How Do I Live,'' which was a simultaneous hit
for both LeAnn Rimes and Trisha Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   Having a movie theme on the radio and MTV provides ``a constant
advertisement for the film,'' says Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced
both movies. Bruckheimer sends scripts to Warren before filming
starts ``to get her involved as soon as I can.'' She has become his
unofficial in-house writer; aside from her single for ``Gone in 60
Seconds,'' she wrote four songs for ``Coyote Ugly,'' about an
aspiring songwriter who works in a rowdy bar, to be released in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give people a hit, and they want to work with you,''
Warren says.
</P>
<P>
   In music and words, Warren's songs express epic sentiments with
unabashed fervor and describe the intense passions many people feel
but can't freely express. Yet the songwriter _ a funny, informal
woman who lives with two cats and four birds (including a cherished
parrot named Buttwings) _ is far more sarcastic than sentimental.
``People who know me well say, 'I can't believe you write these
songs,''' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She has a reputation, even in the music business, for being
vulgar. Her sense of humor, which she terms ``pretty twisted,''
focuses on body parts and body noises, and she swears like a
teen-ager in detention. She dislikes travel, has no hobbies and
rarely takes time out from a seven-day workweek, except for what
she laughingly calls ``much-needed therapy.'' And most
surprisingly, she hasn't had a relationship in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Even extremely successful people, accustomed to sacrifice and
ambition, worry about Warren's monomaniacal commitment. ``I urged
Diane a number of years ago to get into therapy,'' says her friend
David Geffen, ``because I think it's important to have balance in
life, and she did not have it. Diane simply works.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren once asked her therapist, ``Why am I in therapy?'' The
therapist, she says, answered: ``You're successful, you're
attractive, you're smart and your best friend's a parrot. That's
why you belong in therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren works in the established language of pop songwriting: she
rhymes ``heart'' with ``apart,'' ``pain'' with ``rain,'' ``baby''
with ``crazy.'' Her songs use elemental imagery: more rain than
Portland in April, more stars than a planetarium and frequent
references to fire, sun, rivers, tears and other cinematic cues.
The sentiments are broad enough to permit a wide appeal. This
vocabulary is unpremeditated, she says, the inevitable result of
her first and most enduring romance: the radio.
</P>
<P>
   She describes herself, with the relish of the vindicated, as the
worst music student in history. Diane Eve Warren grew up in Van
Nuys, Calif., ``beyond fanatical'' about songs even in adolescence.
A guitar teacher ``told my parents I had no future in music'' and
requested she not return. Her first professional income was
accompanied by an ignominious bruise: at 14, she was hired to sing
at a Venice restaurant, but after one song, the owner paid her $25
to stop. (Almost 30 years later, she still has crippling stage
fright. ``Even if I'm getting an award, I can't even breathe.'')
</P>
<P>
   Her two sisters are 11 and 14 years older, and partly as a
result, Warren spent much of her time alone. Her solace was the
radio, and extended listening infused her with a populist
aesthetic: the best songs are the ones people like. The writers she
grew up hearing _ Carole King and Gerry Goffin, Jerry Leiber and
Mike Stoller, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, Stevie Wonder, John
Lennon and Paul McCartney _ are still her favorites. The heyday of
pop, she says, was the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is good stuff now _ my stuff.'' She laughs. ``That's a
joke.'' Even at 15, she thought she was great. ``No one else did.
Except my dad.'' Her father, David Wolfberg, sold insurance and
``changed his name to make it more palatable to anti-Semitic
people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Although her mother ``would always yell at my dad and say, 'Why
did you get her that guitar?' '' he promised to support her writing
efforts as long as she stayed in college. She was indifferent to
the classes she took and plotted every action toward the goal of
writing hit songs. She briefly worked as a messenger but was fired
for giving tapes of her songs to music executives.
</P>
<P>
   By her early 20s, she was depressed and angry that she hadn't
yet written a hit, she says. Warren tells these stories while
sitting in a lounge off her writing office, nicknamed the Cave, a
small, claustrophobic pen, maybe 10 by 12 feet, with ``only room
for me and the cockroaches.'' Cassette tapes are stacked in towers
and piled precariously on every flat surface. A framed copy of her
first million-dollar check sits on the grand piano.
</P>
<P>
   It is said the room hasn't been cleaned in 15 years, and the
legend is believable. It is ``the most intimate place'' in her
life, Warren says, and company isn't welcome. When I trespass
inside to note the room's contents, she turns visibly anxious. She
sticks to sets of habits: she has pairs of lucky socks, and she
gets to the office at a certain time each day. Her therapist has
diagnosed a slight case of obsessive-compulsive disorder, she says.
``But whatever. Whatever gets the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   After Warren wrote her first hits in the mid-'80s, including
Laura Branigan's ``Solitaire'' and DeBarge's ``Rhythm of the
Night,'' she sued the publisher she worked for, charging nonpayment
of royalties. While the lawsuit was pending, no other publisher
would sign her, so she published her own songs, an incalculably
important factor in her success.
</P>
<P>
   Though its rules sometimes seem as secret as Masonry, song
publishing is a $6 billion annual business. A No. 1 single can
gross anywhere from $250,000 to $4 million. Not all of this money
goes to the songwriter. Publishers typically take 25 percent of
mechanical royalties, the money generated by albums sales; at the
current mechanical rate of 7.55 cents, one song on a record that
sells six million copies yields about $450,000. And performance
royalties, earned each time a song is heard on radio or TV, are
usually split equally between publishers and writers. Warren almost
never writes with anyone else, so publishing her own songs has
literally saved her millions of dollars in shared earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Warren is renowned for her tenacity in ``plugging'' songs. When
Cher didn't want to record ``If I Could Turn Back Time,'' a song
that revived her career, Warren dropped to her knees and begged.
She calls programmers at key radio stations and asks them to play
her singles. And she regularly phones a small circle of top
executives, producers and artists, sings them a song that's only
half-finished and asks, ``Do you want to record it?'' _ a practice
one executive calls ``very unusual.'' Her doggedness is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call and say you're gonna record one of her songs, she
says, 'Why not record two?''' says Nancy Russell, Trisha Yearwood's
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Where other top writers specialize in one genre, Warren has had
hits on the pop, R&AMP;B, Latin, dance, country and even Christian
charts. (She occasionally withholds songs from people she doesn't
like; although, she says with a laugh, ``If they sell 10 million
records, I might change my mind.'') Her songs have been recorded by
Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey,
Tina Turner, Patti LaBelle, Gloria Estefan, Reba McEntire, Whitney
Houston, Ricky Martin, 'N Sync, Christina Aguilera and Britney
Spears. All that success has had an effect on Warren. ``Maybe I'm
not as angry as I was before,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Warren paid close to $3 million to buy from
David Geffen a villa in the Hollywood Hills. An ascetic in a
hedonistic industry, Warren doesn't seem to own anything expensive,
aside from her house and a two-seat Aston Martin convertible, or to
enjoy her money. Her single-minded goal is validation, through
getting her songs on the radio. In her living room, which has a
view of Los Angeles from downtown to the mountains, hangs a signed
photograph of Irving Berlin, whom she calls ``kind of a hero of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   There are striking similarities between Warren and Berlin, a
hard-driving immigrant Jew who owned a publishing company and
rarely wrote personal songs. As Laurence Bergreen wrote in his
biography of the composer, Berlin ``was driven by the sublimation
of his erotic impulses. While his friends frolicked in bed, Irving
remained at his piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren says: ``I can relate to that. It's ironic that people are
falling in love to my songs, and maybe somewhere out there, the
person of my dreams is hearing it but can't really get to me.'' Her
last relationship was with Guy Roche, who is the producer and
co-writer of Aguilera's recent ``What a Girl Wants.''
</P>
<P>
   She likens the writing process to Method acting: she imagines a
character, in love or in misery, and then, ``For the whole week, or
however long I'm writing that song, I'm that person.'' Although she
has been single for a long time, she says, ``I know what it's like
to have a broken heart,'' even if the experiences she names are all
related to music: being turned down by publishers when she was 15,
or having record labels mishandle songs. ``I know what it's like to
love _ not that I do, much,'' she adds with a knowing laugh. ``I
love my parrots. There are some people I actually love, real
humans, believe it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, ``Because You Loved Me'' _ a tributary ballad she
wrote for the Michelle Pfeiffer-Robert Redford film ``Up Close and
Personal'' _ was inspired by thinking about her devoted father, who
died of heart failure in 1987. When Jerry Bruckheimer commissioned
her to write a ``Con Air'' theme, Warren watched the film and
decided to write a song in the voice of Nicolas Cage missing his
wife. Searching for a parallel in her life, she imagined how she
might feel if she couldn't write songs and wrote ``How Do I Live,''
which stuck on the charts for a record 69 weeks. She calls it ``my
love song to music,'' though most listeners never spot this
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Song ideas and titles occur to her constantly _ she writes them
on her hand and sings them into her answering machine or a Walkman
she keeps in the front seat of her car. She even thinks of songs
during therapy: ``I'll say, 'Wait, stop, I've got to write this
title down!''' During one session, Warren said, ``I don't really
get what you're talking about.'' Her therapist replied, ``One day
you will.'' Warren liked the phrase so much, she used it for a
song. (Deborah Cox recorded it.)
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday night, Warren was scheduled to meet with Les
Nubians, a pair of French-African sisters from Bordeaux whose last
album sold unremarkably in the United States. Some top writers
wouldn't deign to meet a struggling group, but Realsongs will be
the sisters' first stop; they will fly in from Paris, drop their
bags at a hotel, put on some lipstick (they are, after all, French)
and come straight to see Warren. But their flight is delayed, and
rain and lightning light up the L.A. sky as in one of Warren's
songs. Les Nubians' manager calls to say they will be late.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When a man with a gift for charming others meets a woman with a
gift for making others feel charming, there is no telling how it
will end. Sometime around Easter of 1997, Bill Clinton called Lindy
Boggs, whom he had known since he was a college student, and asked
her, somewhat improbably, to become his ambassador to the Holy See.
(She ``is maybe the only person on the earth who could convince the
pope that I am worth dealing with,'' Clinton has joked to his
friends.)
</P>
<P>
   Lindy told Clinton she would think about it, but she was only
being polite. Almost as soon as he had made the offer, she had made
up her mind to decline it. She was 82 years old, spoke no Italian
and knew no one in Rome. She intended to end her days as she had
begun them, in private life, in New Orleans. Then she changed her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   As she tells it, she was standing one Sunday morning at the back
of St. Louis Cathedral (which is just down the street from her
home) in front of the chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Prompt
Succor. Our Lady of Prompt Succor is the saint to whom the local
Ursuline nuns prayed on behalf of Andrew Jackson before the Battle
of New Orleans. (After the battle, Jackson went immediately to the
nuns to thank them for the saint's intercession.) Standing before
Our Lady of Prompt Succor, Lindy recalls: ``I thought: Lindy Boggs,
you are a big sissy. If the president asks you to do a job, you
could at least give it a try.''
</P>
<P>
   In Rome these days, you hear so many anecdotes about Boggs that
you have to remind yourself how little time she has had to generate
them. The morning after she arrived to take up the ambassador's
post, she was informed that she was to be seated that night at a
table filled with nothing but cardinals; she mulled that over, then
said, ``I think I'll wear red.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the time Lindy exchanged three phone calls in one day
with an Italian archbishop on some minor piece of Vatican
diplomacy. Picking up the receiver the last time, she said,
``Dahlin', does this mean we're going steady?''
</P>
<P>
   And there was the trip to the hospital after Lindy had fallen in
her driveway and broken her knee. As she was wheeled in, her eyes
lit on a tall, dark Italian surgeon. ``Tell me, doctor,'' she said,
``is it a prerequisite in Italy that all doctors have to be
handsome?''
</P>
<P>
   The woman who passed along this last anecdote happened to work
at the American Embassy at the Holy See. She suggested that if I
wanted to hear more of this sort of thing, I had come to the right
place. Whatever else our ambassador had absorbed in her two and a
half years on the job, she had clearly learned that a woman in her
mid-80s surrounded by men in dresses sworn to vows of celibacy can
say whatever she pleases. ``Is it true that she calls the pope
'Dahlin''?'' I asked. ``You'll have to ask the ambassador that.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time I had seen Lindy Boggs, she was making a
less-than-convincing attempt to leave politics. Her career as an
elected official had just ended, as it began, with a death in her
family. She was elected to Congress in 1973 _ to the seat left
vacant when her husband, Hale Boggs, was lost in a plane crash in
Alaska _ and decided to get out in 1990 to help one of her
daughters, Barbara Sigmund, who was then mayor of Princeton, N.J.,
fight cancer. (Lindy has two other well-known children: Cokie
Roberts, the Washington journalist, and Tommy Boggs, the Washington
lobbyist.)
</P>
<P>
   After the cancer won, Lindy moved back home to the French
Quarter of New Orleans, claimed to be retired, then promptly joined
the boards of just about 600 local charities. At the time, I was
living just around the corner from her on Bourbon Street and
stopped in a few times. One of these visits came the same evening
that a presidential candidate named Bill Clinton was scheduled to
pay Lindy a call. As it happened, it was also the same time the
Gennifer Flowers story was breaking.
</P>
<P>
   The party that night at Lindy's house was a fund-raiser dressed
up as an intimate gathering for a few old friends who might like to
meet an attractive young politician. The decorous hum of a handful
of New Orleans Democrats milling about Lindy's upstairs living room
was punctuated by a riot in the downstairs hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had burst into the house in a blaze of television lights
and a crush of reporters, all of whom wanted to confirm the precise
details of his extramarital sex life. The reporters bayed for
graphic details; Clinton, huge and pink, tried to shove past them
to the party. The situation had spun out of control, when Lindy
appeared at Clinton's side and took him by the arm.
</P>
<P>
   The mob went quiet: it takes some nerve to holler ``oral sex''
in the presence of a septuagenarian. Then Lindy did her usual
trick. She told the reporters how happy she was that they had come
to see her. She offered them refreshments. Refreshments! She might
as well have tried to distract a pack of hounds with a cheese dip _
or so I thought. But suddenly, and inexplicably, the mood in that
hallway changed. The hounds lost the scent, the baying ceased, the
fox grinned and strolled on by.
</P>
<P>
   She is one of those people who seem to have been put on this
earth to undermine attempts to generalize about politicians. During
her two decades as a member of Congress, she was the one person in
Washington it was against the rules not to like and who seemed, for
her part, incapable of disliking others. Richard Nixon and George
McGovern: both dear friends. She adored Jack Kennedy, and he, of
course, adored her. She also adored Lyndon Johnson, and he, of
course, adored her.
</P>
<P>
   When she ceased to be a congressional wife and became a
congresswoman, she said there was only one thing that bothered her
about the new job: she would be forced to vote. How could you vote
without voting against something? In most people, this approach to
public life would seem spineless. In Lindy, it came across like a
glimpse of an alternative, enchanted universe. And as political
strategy it was just plain shrewd.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindy effect seems to be working in Rome, too. For instance,
this year Pope John Paul II has beatified one New Orleanean, the
Rev. Francis Xavier Seelos, and will canonize another, Mother
Katharine Drexel. Up until now, outside of its professional
football team, New Orleans has not been long on saints. In nearly
300 years it has manufactured exactly one.
</P>
<P>
   In this jubilee year, the pope will miraculously increase the
number of sacred people for Lindy's former constituents to pray to.
Perhaps not entirely by coincidence, Lindy, for many years, was on
a church committee in New Orleans that was trying to persuade the
Vatican to beatify Seelos. But when I asked her if her presence had
anything to do with his beatification, she just said: ``Oh,
dahlin', the Vatican makes all those decisions in private. And
Father Seelos was such an easy choice.''
</P>
<P>
   When she said this, we were sitting in her office at the
American Embassy at the Holy See, with its view of the Palatine
Hill. She had spent nearly two hours avoiding an explanation of her
job. It is a strange fact about Lindy Boggs that the two things she
spends most of her time on _ politics and praying _ are the two
things she least cares to discuss. (``Lindy's really from the old
school that has pious faith,'' says the Rev. Christopher Nalty, a
young priest studying at the Vatican who often appears on the
ambassador's arm. ``You didn't really question it, or talk about
it. You just had it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Still, I couldn't help wondering, What does an ambassador to the
Vatican do all day? Actually, that was the wrong question. What
Lindy did with most of her days in Rome had already become clear.
She went to the endless parties and meetings of cardinals and
archbishops and the other ambassadors and invited all the same
people to her own parties and meetings. Wherever she went, five
Italian policemen with machine guns followed.
</P>
<P>
   Her schedule was as merciless as a New Orleans debutante's. Each
day between 10 in the morning and midnight she seemed to pause only
once, briefly, to send a cable or two back to the State Department
in Washington, where it was read by a foreign-service officer whom
Lindy had never met. But how did she fill up all those cables? It
was this that she did not care to discuss. And there is not an
intrusive question in the world for which Lindy Boggs does not have
a charming anecdote with which to defuse it.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her, say, about the jockeying among cardinals to see who
gets to be the next pope, and she'll reply with a funny story of a
lunch she had with Ronald Reagan. ``My mother is uncharmingly
discreet,'' Cokie Roberts says. ``All those years I was a reporter
on Capitol Hill, and she never told me a damn thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, after a few hours of listening to delightful and
charming stories about former heads of state, it dawned on me.
``The whole point of your job here,'' I said, ``is to avoid
controversy.'' ``Which I have been doing my whole life!''
</P>
<P>
   The Embassy at the Holy See, which Reagan established in 1983,
would seem at first glance to be a textbook case of the Pointless
Embassy. There is almost nothing the United States can do to shape
Vatican policy. Vatican theology, on which much Vatican policy
rests, is officially off limits to the U.S. ambassador. Moreover,
the Vatican may be the least concerned of all nations about what
the United States wants it to do.
</P>
<P>
   When the pope decides to air his opinion that cancer can be
caused by ``certain sexual behavior,'' as he did last year, the
United States does not even bother to try to stop him. To do so
would be worse than pointless. It would risk incurring the wrath of
the one man outside the United States who, with a flick of his
wrist, could wreak havoc with U.S. public opinion. As a result,
much of what constitutes Vatican diplomacy is actually appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the job,'' admits one official at the United States
Embassy at the Vatican, ``is to put the best possible face on the
inevitable.'' But there is something else, too, and it is peculiar
to the Embassy at the Holy See. The information that flows into the
Vatican from missionaries and churches _ perhaps the world's most
elaborate news-gathering network _ is information the State
Department would like to possess. In the darkest days of the
Bosnian war, for example, the Vatican had an intimate view of
affairs in the Balkans. Now it has perhaps the closest thing
available outside Congo and East Timor to the ear-to-the-ground
story on the conflicts inside.
</P>
<P>
   And so the question for the American ambassador becomes: How do
you get people inside the Vatican to tell you things? ``The Vatican
operates much like the U.S. government did right after World War
II,'' Lindy says. ``The difference is that you can't override the
pope's veto.'' What she means by this is that in both places the
protocol is so arcane as to constitute a subject unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Protocol is the Esperanto of Vatican social life. It operates as
a substitute to local custom and tends to be more elaborate in
places where people have the least culturally in common. Vatican
protocol is by itself of little interest. What is interesting is
the way it is used to mask Vatican politics or, rather, to keep
people out who don't belong. As one well-placed monsignor put it to
me: ``How you communicate here is as important as what you
communicate. Ambassador Boggs seems to know this instinctively.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't until you stop thinking of Lindy as an emissary and
start thinking of her as a seeker of Vatican secrets that you can
see the sense in her social life. Perhaps coincidentally, perhaps
not, she has befriended not merely the upper echelon of Vatican
officials but also other ambassadors. One of her new dear friends
is the Spanish ambassador, who, as the representative of the oldest
embassy at the Vatican, enjoys a privileged access; another is the
German ambassador, who, as it happens, is also privy to a lot of
Vatican gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising fact about Lindy Boggs is that she
can't sleep at night. She spends all day sincerely looking for
little ways to make the world a better place and then spends all
night staring at her ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was in Congress, she was always tired,'' recalls her
former legislative aide, Jan Schoonmaker. ``I used to schedule
downtime for her because I knew she hadn't slept the night before.
I'd ask her why, and she'd say that she was worrying. Or some
constituent had called at 2 a.m. to ask why he hadn't got his
Social Security check. I'd say, 'Lindy, you need an unlisted phone
number.' And she'd say, 'But dahlin', then people wouldn't know how
to find me at night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a habit with her still. Our last meeting in Rome coincided
with one of her many dinner parties. The last archbishop had gone,
and she was running a fever, yet she insisted that I hang around.
She had something to show me.
</P>
<P>
   She's worried _ though, of course, she does not come right out
and say it _ that I'm going to depict her as a sweet old lady who
makes a lot of people happy but doesn't really serve any greater
purpose. She handed me a yellow Post-It on which she had scribbled
what she called ``my political interests.'' The list read:
Preservation, National Archives, Holocaust museum, Smithsonian,
Children and Families, NASA. It may be the least controversial list
of political interests ever created, offering only the tiniest
sliver of her view of the world. I asked her about her long record
of voting against abortion rights. ``Oh,'' she said, ``I've always
been for life. But I never would have raised it as a political
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   She still had an expectant air about her; the list wasn't the
thing that she wanted to show me. She grabbed me by the arm and led
me out to the bottom of her marble staircase. There on the banister
rested a plain manila folder. She had placed it there before the
dinner so that it would be at hand afterward. She opened it and
extracted a stack of photographs. The pictures of her first meeting
with the pope, when she presented him with her credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are with the Holy Father,'' she said, as she paged
through them, lovingly, ``you feel you are in the presence of
something. He's just pure ... goodness.'' It was an extraordinarily
detailed sequence. Every move seemed to have been documented.
</P>
<P>
   As I paged through the photographs, Lindy described the ritual
leading up to the papal encounter. When she finished, I realized
she had once again spoken at great length, and had told me
everything but what I wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Lindy,'' I asked, ``what did you and the pope talk
about?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dahlin', that's private!''

   SEC-KRAMER _ SEC commissioner Roy Kramer turns 71 in October and
shows no signs of slowing down. Since he become commish in 1990,
the SEC has evolved into the most powerful conference in the
nation, routinely competing for national titles. But his biggest
impact is on the bottom line: The schools were dividing $10 million
per year in '90, now they are divvying up $68.5 million. And he has
been a driving force behidn the BCS series to determine the
national football titleist. How much longer can he keep on? It's
time for the SEC to begin taking a look at who will replace him.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: We have been looking
<TEXT>
for a Golden Book titled ``My Snuggly Bunny.'' This was my mother's
favorite book as a little girl. I was hoping to surprise her with
it this Christmas.
<P>
   _ Wendy G.
</P>
<P>
   A: Golden Books, 888 Seventh Ave., New York 10106, has no plans
to reissue this selection. I found a copy online ($18). Check out
www.alibris.com. One of the writers/illustrators of ``My Snuggly
Bunny'' was Patsy Scarry, wife of Richard Scarry. The best-selling
Golden Book? ``Pokey Little Puppy,'' which is also the best-selling
children's hardback book. The Smithsonian even has a copy in its
permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our wedding rehearsal dinner was an outdoor affair _
Texas-style. Fun, but many out-of-town guests were covered with
chigger bites the next day. What are chiggers? What works to stop
the itching and encourage healing? Why are some bothered and others
not at all?
</P>
<P>
   _ Muriel B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Chiggers have four stages, reports John Jackman of A&AMP;M's
entomology department: egg, larva, nymph and adult. The larva, a
six-legged critter, is the blood-sucking mite causing the itching.
No one knows why some are chigger magnets while others are not.
Chiggers seem to be attracted by odors, says allergist Dr. Russell
Roby. Vitamin B's odor often repels chiggers and fleas. The most
effective way to avoid them? Cover as much skin as possible
(special attention to areas covered with elastic), avoid fields and
brush, and use insect repellent. Try sulfur in your socks and shoes
or Avon's Skin-so-Soft. Shower after exposure or bathe in water
laced with a tablespoon of bleach. Antihistamines and anesthetics
provide quick temporary relief as does Fels Naptha soap.
Hydrocortisone cream is slow-acting, but longer lasting. For more
information, contact the Allergy Center (338-4336) at
www.allergy-center.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A guest inadvertently put a gold-rimmed dinner plate in the
microwave. The microwave set off sparks from the plate, and the
gold rim was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lisa F.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can touch up the paint, but the plate is then only good
for decorative purposes. A plate is fired after it is made, so the
new paint would not last.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My husband works in the manufacturing section of a high-tech
company. Sometimes when they run out of parts and are unable to
work, employees are forced to use vacation time or take the time
off without pay. Is this legal? It seems unfair that the employees
should suffer because somebody did not order enough parts. Also, we
can never plan a vacation because we never know how much time he
will have left due to the company's inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   _ M.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, this is legal. Texas is an employment at will state.
Generally, vacation and leave policies are matters of negotiation
between employer and employee, remarks Larry Jones of the Texas
Workforce Commission. Texas employers may place conditions on the
use of accrued vacation leave, such as requiring employees to take
it during temporary shutdowns. Why unpaid leave? Under the Federal
Fair Labor Standards Act, an employer is under no obligation to pay
an hourly employee for time not actually worked. By imposing such
conditions, an employer risks employees filing unemployment
insurance benefits claims because of having been laid off for lack
of work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have several hundred pre-recorded cassettes, 30-45 minutes
per side, most in plastic cases. Is there a nonprofit group that
can use them? I hate to just throw them out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cindi W.
</P>
<P>
   A: Then don't, because some of my readers would love to have
them. Sounds like a bird's nest on the ground for some lucky group.
Call Wallace at (512) 250-9284.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do so many roads bleed black rivulets _ an eyesore? They
seem to be a recent phenomenon. Has technology recessed?
</P>
<P>
   _ Rasika H.
</P>
<P>
   A: Blame it on the weather and the traffic. When the roadway
surface becomes thin from an overabundance of vehicles, it begins
to bleed, or shell, causing cracks that must be patched. The seal
coat is a thin layer of asphalt, which not only eliminates
shelling, but also prevents water from getting into small roadway
cracks and freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We were on a trip the week CBS presented the miniseries
``Jesus.'' Could you help me get a copy of either the whole series
or the second part?
</P>
<P>
   _ J. Schulz
</P>
<P>
   A: CBS is selling this video, but it is currently back ordered
for four to six weeks. Apparently ``Jesus'' sells faster than Round
Rock doughnuts. Call (888) 227-8881 to order ($29.98 plus shipping
and handling).
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a round plastic card holder to fan out
playing cards. It is especially good for games that you play with a
lot of cards, like double deck pinochle (20 cards).
</P>
<P>
   _ Joanne M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ecologically conscious? Order a plastic one made from
recycled detergent containers from O.N.E. at (530)396-2327 or
online at www.recyclestore.com. Only $2 each, but you must purchase
a minimum of 10 disks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every time I tell someone where I live (Shepherd Mountain),
my brother says ``it is really just a hill; there are no mountains
in Texas.'' I say they would call it Shepherd Hill if that were
true. Are these true mountains? How can you tell?
</P>
<P>
   _ H.N.A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Texas is not a mountainless state. Ever heard of West Texas'
Guadalupe Mountains? Guadalupe Peak has the highest elevation in
Texas at 8,751 feet. According to the American Geological
Institute's ``Glossary of Geology,'' generally a mountain will
project at least 1,000 feet above the surrounding land or 2,000
feet above sea level, reports Sigrid Clift of UT's Bureau of
Economic Geology. If a mountain has a distinctive feature that
rises above the surrounding land area with steep sides and a
restricted summit, the moniker fits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an old wooden crank telephone (Western Electric, 317P)
inherited from my grandfather. It has all the original equipment,
including the wiring diagram. How can I find out its age and the
best way to care for it? I was thinking of having the case
refinished, but don't want to harm it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cherry K.
</P>
<P>
   A: If the phone is in good condition, use Johnson's Paste Wax to
protect the wood (if you restain, attend to the underside of the
bells). Hard to date it without more data. One, two or three boxes?
Cathedral top or no? You probably have a peaked top from the
1910-1930 period, says Phone Wizard's Bruce Patterson. Contact him
at (504) 822-4730 or phonewizard(at)juno.com about working on the
phone. Patterson can even modernize it without devaluing the piece.
An appraisal? Send photos of the phone to Museum of Independent
Telephony, 412 S. Campbell, Abilene, Kan. 67410. You will be
charged a small fee for research.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We saw a John Wayne movie called ``The Cowboys.'' Was this
the only movie where he died?
</P>
<P>
   _ L.E.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: No, the Duke's character died in eight films, reports the
Birthplace of John Wayne, a museum in Iowa: ``The Shootist,'' ``The
Cowboys,'' ``The Alamo,'' ``Sands of Iwo Jima,'' ``Wake of the Red
Witch,'' ``The Fighting Seabees,'' ``Reap the Wild Wind'' and
``Central Airport.'' Pay attention! This is a list you expect to
see on ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''

 &HT;    Some free stuff offered on the Internet is actually free
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The world is full of free offers. There's the classic
advertising ploy called _ in the trade _ BOGOF (buy one, get one
free). If you leaf through almost any newspaper or magazine you'll
find offers for free subscriptions, free catalogs, free
installation of car stereos _the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The magic word ``free'' is also a big deal on the Internet. As
you'd expect, there are dozens of Web sites devoted to bringing you
the opportunity to sign up for almost any kind of free offer you
can imagine. So today, at absolutely no cost to you, we'll look at
some of the sites that guide you to free offers.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep in mind that there is no true free lunch and that many
of these offers may end up charging shipping costs, or be
contingent on you buying something. So let the non-buyer beware.
</P>
<P>
   The first site is called The Original Totally Free Stuff and can
be found at www.totallyfreestuff.com/. The free offers here are
conveniently lumped into categories such as books, clothing,
coupons, audio, educational, e-mail accounts and hardware. One nice
feature of the site is a listing _ always found on the opening page
_ of free offers that have recently been added.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on a recent visit, there were new offers for a
free mouse pad, a six-month magazine subscription and the seemingly
incredible offer of $75 free. But if you follow the link to sign up
for the free money, you'll learn that, to get it, you have to agree
to sign up for a telephone service and an Internet service. Which
just goes to show that not everything is free, even on a site
called Totally Free.
</P>
<P>
   Volition.com calls itself ``the oldest free stuff site'' on the
Net. It can be found, logically enough, at
www.volition.com/free.html. Just as was true with our first site,
you'll find free offers listed by category. Some of the categories
include home furnishings, credit cards, toys, pet supplies and
family fun.
</P>
<P>
   Just as was true with the first site, not all the free offers
offer free stuff. For instance, here's an offer you'll find at the
site:
</P>
<P>
   ``Receive a free $25 SuperCertificate from GiftCertificates .com
when you are approved for a Discover Platinum Card.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, you can also sign up for a free online
chat with a psychic.
</P>
<P>
   Next let's stop in at a site called Get-it-for-Free at
www.get-it-for-free.com/. You'll find the now-familiar free
mousepad offer there, too. Among other offers, you can get a free
rubber stamp (you'll pay $2.39 in shipping and handling costs to
get your free stamp); coupons that are said to be worth $100; and
an offer for a free Neopet (you'll have to travel to the site to
find out what a Neopet is).
</P>
<P>
   TheFreeSite.com at www.thefreesite.com/ calls itself ``the best
place to find freebies, freeware, free stuff, samples, games'' and
it does seem _ on casual observation _ to be one of the best of the
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the offers here include services that offer free e-mail
and free Internet service, free postcards, free games and free MP3
computer audio files.
</P>
<P>
   You may find more legitimately free offers here than on the
other sites. Even so, don't expect to get a free BMW or trip to
Hawaii. But the allure of the free offer _ to those caught in its
trance _ may be more important than the product.

caught on fire and nearly burned the place down almost won. And the
Texas auditor reimbursed for the rental of an elephant almost took

   CRASH-TEST (Undated) _ All of you who are patiently waiting for
the Chrysler PT Cruiser you ordered are going to love this: The
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration paid a premium to

   AUTO-PASSAT (Undated) _ Make no mistake about it: Volkswagen is
back. The brand is not quite on top again, but it is pushing hard
to get there, thanks in part to the huge success of its New Beetle,
introduced just two years ago as a thoroughly modern car with a
retro look, and the hot-selling midsize Passat sedan, which has
topped the lists of best midsize cars in several recent consumer
automotive publications. By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III.

<P>
   AUTO-LEXUS (Austin, Texas) _ When it comes to luxury sedans,
Lexus leaves most of its competitors scrambling to catch up. But
there has been something missing in the Lexus lineup: a true
driver's car that would appeal to younger buyers. Now there is a
Lexus that looks and feels like a sporty BMW 3-series car _ the IS
300, and it goes on sale at North American Lexus dealerships June
23. By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III.

   EXCITE-AT-HOME (San Francisco) _ ExciteAtHome has certainly been

of chief executive officer in January. By ALAN T. SARACEVIC.

   MARINES-BOOK (Undated) _ More than half a century ago, Gerry
West and Bob Addison took part in seven critical, bloody battles

appeared in Rolling Stone. By DOUG BLACKBURN.

<P>
   MUSIC-TIEMPOS (Undated) _ While most salsa/Caribbean music is
known for its spicy rhythms and danceable grooves, the music on
Ruben Blades' recent CD ``Tiempos'' is meant for the mind. The

leaving little swirls with each stroke, and so quiet you could
almost hear the flowers bloom. Just then, 10 feet off the shore of
a small, nearby island, a raucous splash and squawk on the surface

 &HT;    It's Martha, minus the attitude
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Believe it or not, there may be one thing you can
probably do better than Martha Stewart, the undisputed goddess of
gracious living.
</P>
<P>
   Martha, as you may know, has become legend for baking 240
chocolate chip cookies to decorate her Christmas tree, making her
own garden compost and creating picture frames from twigs found on
her Connecticut estate.
</P>
<P>
   But you know, when it comes to the Internet, Martha still seems
a little lost, which is odd, considering her Web site is one of the
best of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In between pruning peonies and making Polish delicacies with her
mother on her syndicated TV show, Martha will occasionally sit down
at the computer and attempt to show us how to surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I've seen Martha get really excited about the Web
was during a demonstration she did about how to order seed catalogs
online. Here she was clearly in her element. Look! A catalog of
rare hybrids from Holland. Look! A British seed catalog brimming
with things you could never find in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That time, Martha herself was at the terminal, and she was
having a ball. Finding things online that genuinely interest you
that you didn't even know about before you logged on is one of the
main reasons people get so excited about the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But moments like that are rare. Last week, Martha had on her
show Jay Walker, co-chairman and founder of Priceline.com, the
name-your-own-price Web site best known for arranging discount
airfares to almost anywhere. He sat down at the computer, neatly
located in the computer storage hutch Martha built on an earlier
episode, and proceeded to show Martha how to buy airline tickets
online.
</P>
<P>
   During the demonstration, Martha sat quietly beside Walker while
he walked her through the nuances of the pull-down menu and other
computer basics while explaining how the service works. For people
who know how to surf the Web, and especially for people who've
always wondered how you can get plane tickets to Paris for a song,
it was a great segment.
</P>
<P>
   NOT IN HER ELEMENT
</P>
<P>
   But watching the show, I got the distinct feeling that Martha
Stewart has never logged on to Priceline.com and probably never
will. When she gets out the flour and butter and makes a
three-tiered wedding cake to die for, her enthusiasm and her
dedication to perfection is clear _ and is part of what makes her
the woman you love to hate. But when she takes a nod at the Net,
with the exception of the seed catalog extravaganza or passing
references to the wonders of eBay, you can just tell her heart
isn't in it.
</P>
<P>
   Martha should know people don't watch Martha Stewart Living to
find out how to get a cheap flight to Paris (or Buffalo, which was
the destination Martha selected for the demonstration). The people
who watch her show and read her magazine are as interested in the
Internet as they are in making the perfect flower arrangement, and
she knows she has to talk about the Internet whether she likes it
or not.
</P>
<P>
   What Martha can't seem to do is bring her trademark perfection
to the fine art of Web surfing. The legions of Martha devotees want
to know what sites she surfs, not just for seeds but for cooking
supplies, gardening tools and directions for making that yummy
dessert she whipped up last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martha _ the person _ is still learning to love the
Web, Martha Stewart the company has already claimed its own corner
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Martha is a shrewd enough businesswoman to know she needs a Web
site, and www.marthastewart.com is a great site with a slightly
different attitude from the person, TV show and magazine of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   Martha never pretends to be a Web geek, and I love her for that.
So whether she knows it or not, MarthaStewart.com is an excellent
example of multichannel media delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The people behind the Martha Stewart Living juggernaut know that
they are not in the magazine business, the TV business or even the
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living is all about attaining a certain lifestyle
and makes use of any and every media outlet, including the
Internet, to give people the information that has made Martha
Stewart a billion-dollar media company.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart.com is beautifully organized, easy to use and
jam-packed with practical information you can actually use, such as
how to get all the wrinkles out of a linen tablecloth or select the
right type of homeowner's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   MarthaStewart.com also has an extensive e-commerce section,
where the truly devoted can purchase some of the items used to
create various projects demonstrated in the magazine and on TV. It
may be a little heavy on the e-commerce links, but this is the only
place to get the actual items Martha uses and recommends, and her
company is smart enough to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web version of Martha Stewart is useful and interesting.
Although Martha has final say, the tone is a little easier to take
than the stern taskmaster of print and video. The information on
the Web site is written a crisp, clear, no-nonsense manner, but
Martha's schoolmarmish tone is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who wishes they could cook, garden or craft like
Martha without actually having to put up with Martha, the Web site
is a refreshing, highly recommended alternative.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a while before Martha Stewart the person understands
what her viewers want her to do with the Web, but Martha Stewart
the businesswoman understands how to use the Web to her very best
advantage.

 &HT;    Maken X looks great but lacks substanceBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Superconsole horsepower pushing superconsole graphics does well
to hide less than super gameplay in Maken X ($40; www.sega.com; for
the Dreamcast). There is probably a reason the first-person
``slasher'' genre is under exploited: A sci-fi sword game offers
close-quarter combat but does not, by nature, offer an appropriate
perspective. Maken is the weapon, with an innate ability to ``brain
jack'' or possess various characters throughout the game. But this
clever approach is befuddled by poor control of the mostly-unseen
Maken wielder. Auto-locking on a given target does afford the gamer
some ability to dodge/thrust/parry without becoming completely
disoriented, but it makes for a shallow combat system just the
same. Add to that a story that is so completely hokey _ (We're
fighting evil. How evil? The Devil!) _ and plodding, poorly
scripted dialogue, and all you end up with is a great-looking,
fast-moving, wannabe anime role-playing sword game that only
exploits fresh gaming style, while the extraordinarily cool gaming
concept is unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   X-COM Collector's Edition ($30; www.hasbro-interactive.com; for
Windows) is a retro buff's dream, harkening back to the days (a
mere half decade ago) when games were perhaps more graphically
simplistic yet characteristically more deep, more absorbing and
simply better _ in this case at least. A collection of the three
X-COM strategy games, UFO Defense, Terror from the Deep and
Apocalypse, Collector's Edition, promises to satiate both the game
addict's hunger for a solid game experience as well as introduce
new or casual gamers to urity of gameplay often lost in late-model
splatter and gore festivals. A set of strategy, micromanagement and
resource hoarding games in essence, the X-COM titles have always
garnered praise for their attention to intangible details and sheer
addictiveness. One more kick at the can seems their due, especially
at a mere $10 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Need For Speed: Porsche Unleashed from Electronic Arts ($35,
www.needforspeed.com, for Windows PCs) takes a big risk by focusing
its game on a single line of automobiles, and it succeeds wildly.
Driving the venerable ''Need For Speed'' franchise to a new,
faster, more hair-raising place with a long list of innovations,
the focus here is on creating a true simulation, not just a game.
And the genius is in the details, from the glint of sunlight on
chrome to the completely realistic driving physics, fully
functional dashboard, mesmerizing replay mode and long list of
once-and-future Porsches you can customize and drive. Multiple
camera angles capture every twist of dozens of beautifully detailed
tracks, all so easy to customize that you'll never run out of ways
to race. Perhaps the most fun is in the ''evolution'' style of
campaign gameplay in which you work toward faster,
smoother-handling cars. The only drawback is the large amount of
computer muscle needed to run the sim, but you can easily tweak
down the detail level. Electronic Arts promises to have an online
racing site running within a few weeks to make the multiplayer
options easier. This is the best of the series and goes to the top
of the list of ''must-haves'' for road-racing gamers. Vroom.

 &HT;    Refilling ink cartridges saves money but can be risky
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I read that a kit has been developed and is being sold that
allows you to refill black or color printer ink cartridges. I want
to try it but can't remember the company offering the kits. Can you
help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Dobrin, Beachwood, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are two schools of thought on refilling ink
cartridges in printers. One is that you shouldn't do it because the
risk outweighs the cost savings. The other is to get a good kit and
do it right to save a buck or two.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Yeah, if you get a bad kit or refill the ink cartridges
improperly, you run you the risk of spilling ink inside your
printer. You could have quite a mess on your hands, literally. All
the money you would have saved is put toward getting your printer
cleaned out.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: On the other hand, you can save quite a bit of money.
You'll pay $25 to $30 for four to six color refills. As for the
black cartridge, you'll pay about the same for the kit but get 10
to 15 refills. Think about it. Instead of paying 20 bucks a pop,
you're getting several refills for the price of one. Be aware,
different printers require different ink formulas. No one ink works
for every printer. Make sure you buy specifically for your printer.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: You cannot refill indefinitely. You may be able to refill
up to 20 times if you take care of your cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are many companies out there that provide this
service. Check out Richland Marketing at www.refills.com. They have
kits for Apple, Canon, Epson, HP and a few others. Other sites to
research are www.netwares.com or
www.affordableprinter.com/right.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Before replacing our PC, we want to ensure all personal account
numbers and information are removed. Is there software available?
One suggestion was to reformat the hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Nicolson, Cumming, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Your concern is legitimate. Deleting files doesn't
necessarily erase those rascals. It just removes pointers or
references to where those files are located. Anybody who knows
squat about a computer can recover that data. Even reformatting the
hard drive can still leave data behind that somebody can ferret
out.
</P>
<P>
   also at cnet.com. Also, a good source for these two utilities
and freeware in general is freewarefilez.com.

 &HT;    'Best encyclopedia' is no idle boast for Microsoft's Encarta
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a ``Letter from the Editor'' on the opening page of
the Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 2000, Gary Alt calls his
product ``the very best general encyclopedia available in any
medium _ electronic or print.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be right.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of pure information, Britannica has to be considered
king of the encyclopedia hill. However, while I have not seen the
2000 edition, last year's electronic Britannica was just beginning
to test the multimedia waters. Britannica doesn't e in this
anti-erudite age, nor does it cater obviously to the elementary
school student.
</P>
<P>
   The time line is a wonderful tool. It can be broken into
numerous topics _ art, science and the like _ and into numerous
areas _ Africa, Europe, etc. _ and two of these can be brought
on-screen for direct comparison.
</P>
<P>
   If you can only have one encyclopedia, Encarta is the one you
want.

 &HT;    Digital watches
 &HT;    By James Cumming
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ One principle almost always holds true when it
comes to gadgets of any kind: The more the gadget is able to do,
the harder it is to get it to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   The same principle goes for watches. Wind-up watches couldn't
calculate the rate of return on your investment portfolio, but at
least they don't force you to read a manual that would give Stephen
Hawking a headache just to get the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Timex, longtime manufacturers of inexpensive watches, has come
up with a digital watch that is actually easy to set and use.
</P>
<P>
   While many digital watches have an array of buttons, knobs and
bars that must be depressed, pulled, twisted or jabbed, the Timex
i-Control crown-set watch line has one button and one ``crown''
like the stem and knob on a traditional wind-up watch.
</P>
<P>
   Crown-set watches offer some of the most popular features of
other digital watches: They keep track of the date, they have a
built-in alarm and they have a night light that makes the watch
face easy to read in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The digits are nearly half an inch high, so telling the time at
a quick glance is no problem.
</P>
<P>
   It took less than two minutes to set a sample watch with the
correct time, date and an alarm time. The instructions are so
simple that everything you need to know to operate the watch is
scribed on the back of the watch body.
</P>
<P>
   Pull the stem out until it clicks at the halfway point and the
watch tells you you're ready to set the time. Pull the stem until
it clicks at the fully extended point and the watch tells you
you're ready to set the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Timex i-Control crown-set watches should be available now for a
suggested retail price of $34.95 at stores that carry other Timex
products. If you have trouble finding the watches, contact the
company at (800) 367-8463 or www.timex.com for a retailer near you.
</P>
<P>
   Also new from Timex are a line of i-Control ring-set watches
that offer more features such as stopwatch functions and countdown
timers. But of course, with more features comes more complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the crown and button that control the crown-set
watches, the ring-set watches have a crown, two buttons and a
movable ring around the face of the watch. Still, they are a little
easier to use than other watches with comparable features.
</P>
<P>
   The ring-set watches come in Ironman Triathlon, Reef Gear and
Expedition styles and sell for $42.95 to $47.95.

 &HT;    More juice for your Game Boy
 &HT;    By Staff Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   A must-have peripheral for Nintendo's Game Boy Color, The Game
Buddy ($20; www.bti.ca) from Battery Technologies, Inc., is an
add-on rechargeable battery pack for the puny little hand-held game
device. It supplies nearly 24 hours of constant play with each
charge. It purports a whopping 2,000 hours of total storage
capacity and fits snugly to the base of the Game Boy Color where it
interfaces with the AC adapter port. It remains attached even while
charging. The Game Buddy also acts as a night light when it's
recharging, a beacon of hope in a dark sleepless night. The unit
also gives the Game Boy significantly more heft than some portable
game users are accustomed to, but don't be a wimp _ you've got 24
hours of recuperation and gaming time for your efforts. It's cool.
</P>
<P>
   DAZZLING, DIRT-FREE DIMPLES
</P>
<P>
   And from the ``what will they think of next and shouldn't we
shoot them before they do?'' files comes the BallButler ($90;
www.golfballbutler.com), a washing accessory for avid golfers who
happen to own their own electric golf carts. Mounted just about
anywhere on one's cart (fender, basket, drink holder _ No! No! Not
the drink holder!) and drawing power from the cart battery, the
patented BallButler embraces one's filthy whackable orb while a
diminutive 12-volt motor spins it about amongst ``polypropylene
monofilament brushes in a solution of water and detergent leaving
it sparkling clean.'' What more could you want? Someone to hit for
you, maybe?

   www.greatkids.com _ Read stories about extraordinary kids who
are inventors, volunteers, sports stars and musicians. There's
12-year-old Daniel in Santa Cruz, Calif., who invented a
``decrinkler'' for dollar bills, an idea inspired by finicky
bill-changing machines at video arcades. Meet Craig, also 12, from
near Toronto, who with 20 friends started a non-profit group called
Free the Children that encourages world leaders to pass laws to
protect children from employers who exploit them. There are now
Free the Children chapters in seven countries. They credit a new
child labor law in Canada to their work. If you know a kid who
should be recognized, the operators of this site would like to hear
from you.

 &HT;    A traveler's jack-of-all-trades
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Before the international business trip, there's
often the trip to the travel store for business communications
supplies. Tracking down the right phone and plug adapters can be as
challenging as navigating train schedules or maneuvering through
foreign languages and customs.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint recently began selling a convenient solution _ though not
a cheap one. Its Business Traveler Kit ($95 for current customers;
$150 for new customers with service included; www.sprint
.com/businesstravel) contains 13 phone adapters and five power
plugs, with a guide matching the devices to the countries where
they work. Packed neatly in a 9-inch-by-12.5-inch leather binder,
the kit also includes a nifty 10-foot phone cord that spools from a
small plastic case, a phone line tester that can protect gear from
power surges and a guide with tips about logging online from
outside the United States. Purchasers also can get access to voice
and data telecom services that Sprint says include low calling
rates, easy conference call setup, online presentation software, a
Web site with helpful travel information and extra customer service
help. Costs for the related phone services vary.

 &HT;    Wireless age to bring new freedoms ... and burdens
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deb Spicer Tompkins lives in the blur.
</P>
<P>
   There is a blur, she will tell you, where there used to be a
line separating professional and family, private life and public.
But with her cellular phone, pager and wireless digital assistant,
Tompkins often finds herself where there is no line at all.
</P>
<P>
   As managing director of the technology practice at Hill and
Knowlton, a public relations firm, she gets e-mail from clients,
pages from her children, phone calls from co-workers, all the time,
everywhere. ``If you're not careful, it puts you in a perpetual
reactive mode,'' she said. ``Sometimes instead of reducing
information overload, it contributes to information overload.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, the human relationship with technology has always been
two-way. And now, in the wireless revolution, we have combined the
mobility of cars, the reach of phones and the power of computers.
``This is huge,'' said Steve Jones, professor and head of
communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``Wireless
Internet access represents as much of a revolution as the
introduction of the Internet itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who grew up in the pre-Net era, the prospects can sound
like an episode of ``The Jetsons.'' Say you're driving to the
theater. The car knows where you are going, sees the time, does a
quick calculation and realizes you are not going to make it on
time. The car calls the theater, then sells the tickets to someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Prial, marketing director for IBM's pervasive computing
unit, says it is hardly a stretch from what can be done now to that
scenario. ``You get to the theater and sure enough, you say, `Darn,
we're late.' And the car says, `No problem. I sold the tickets.'''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of the technology seems clear enough: Employees can
hit the beach without ducking a critical conference call, children
can reach parents from a party gone sour, stranded motorists can
summon a tow truck. The near future is even more alluring: paying
for items before you get to the store, turning on the oven when you
are miles from home, checking in to a flight while still on the way
to the airport _ something Swissair already does in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   ``And tomorrow, you'll have your electronic boarding pass on
your phone,'' Prial said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many burdens of wireless technology are also hard
to miss. The relentless flood of e-mail and voice mail. The ease
with which a colleague or boss can intrude on your free time. The
annoyance of hearing strangers blithely discussing private business
in public places on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet work and bad manners are not new, even if we have witnessed
a spate of new technologies. How much of a difference does it make
that we can communicate without wires?
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Net power in the palm of your hand _ for
transactions, for information, for communication _ will be the
difference, said Steve Jones, professor and head of communication
at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``People will become more
spur of the moment. It makes the Internet more a part of everyday
life.''
</P>
<P>
   As voice recognition software improves, users will ask their
hand-held devices for movie information, the nearest four-star
Italian restaurant and maybe even to translate what a stranger
says. ``We can get terribly Star Trek about it, but it's
possible,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is not happy about what technology has done so far. Flip
answers to critics _ ``well, just turn it off!'' _ ring hollow, he
said. ``People are realizing that even as they turn cell phones off
and don't check e-mail, it doesn't stop coming.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTENDS WORK WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Wireless extends the work week and may also add a layer of
stress, said Deborah Borisoff, professor in the department of
culture and communication at New York University. ``E-mail ups the
ante for responding. People call you and say, `I sent you threkd.
``Whatever the advantages, efficiencies, conveniences and
portability, these are devices for imposing private life on public
life. These devices surround people with a kind of shell in which
they become inaccessible and unaware of the world around them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not just discourteous, Carey said. ``Democracy is a form
of public life that depends ultimately on people being aware of
strangers and being able to converse with them. There have been
many incursions and erosions of that. This is a kind of wholesale
assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to IBM's Prial, that blending of public and private is only
for the better.
</P>
<P>
   If someone on an airplane recommends a book, now you may write
the name on a napkin, shove it in your pocket and forget it. But
soon, you will tap out the book title on your wireless, press a
button that says, ``buy this book'' and it will be waiting for you
at your hotel or when you get home.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless evangelicals expect the home to be networked as well.
Put a ``Web cam'' in the refrigerator that you can view from work,
so you know if you are low on milk. Better yet, install an
automatic ``replenishment'' sensor that calls you, he said. ``You
are driving home from work and you get a message that says, `Pick
up milk.' That improves your life.''
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACY AN ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Some scoff at the IBM version of the wireless world-to-come.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just silly,'' said Alan L. Marcus, professor of history
at Iowa State University. ``That's Pollyanna stuff, although I can
understand in a world where one is selling things that this would
be attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Take one example _ the availability of a patient's medical
information, he said. ``Think about an insurance company having
your test results and, all of a sudden, you are not insurable. The
one thing that everybody wants is privacy, and this means that
privacy is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But wireless is really part of a much larger picture, said
Marcus, author of ``Technology in America: A Brief History.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans love technology, especially the kind that gives them
personal control _ or at least seems to. Look at cars,
videocassette players, cable television _ the culture is deep-fried
in individualism, Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it does change relationships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless encourages bosses to reach out and touch employees at
odd moments _ undermining the ``I wasn't home to get the phone
call'' alibi. And increasingly personalized work schedules raise
another barrier to unions, which often rely on a shared work
experience. But Marcus doesn't blame the wireless wave on muscular
marketing efforts to sell wireless service to one and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic forces only work if people buy stuff,'' Marcus said.
``There has to be a reason why you spend your money that way.
Talking about economic forces reverses how we think. We think about
`them' doing it to us, but we do it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Marcus went to a wedding and wondered: Should he turn
off his cell phone and risk missing an emergency call from his
children or risk disrupting the wedding? Obviously, he should have
found out the number at the wedding's location and left that with
the kids. Instead, he switched off his phone, later marveling at
his own narrow-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I had a cell phone, it never occurred to me how to
operate without a cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   GOOD FOR GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget money.
</P>
<P>
   While wireless may appeal to our need for autonomy and
productivity, it is also a potentially dramatic economic
fertilizer. Leaps forward in communications and transportation have
spurred business expansion by lowering costs, raising efficiency
and making possible transactions that were simply not feasible
before.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless does the same.
</P>
<P>
   The service has grown much cheaper even as it becomes a more
powerful tool. Business-to-business electronic commerce _ something
increasingly possible via wireless _ will make companies more
efficient. Wireless also lets employees work away from the office _
in cars, airports, hotels and at home. Meanwhile, consumers find
them

 &HT;    Some free stuff offered on the Internet is actually free
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The world is full of free offers. There's the classic
advertising ploy called _ in the trade _ BOGOF (buy one, get one
free). If you leaf through almost any newspaper or magazine you'll
find offers for free subscriptions, free catalogs, free
installation of car stereos _the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The magic word ``free'' is also a big deal on the Internet. As
you'd expect, there are dozens of Web sites devoted to bringing you
the opportunity to sign up for almost any kind of free offer you
can imagine. So today, at absolutely no cost to you, we'll look at
some of the sites that guide you to free offers.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep in mind that there is no true free lunch and that many
of these offers may end up charging shipping costs, or be
contingent on you buying something. So let the non-buyer beware.
</P>
<P>
   The first site is called The Original Totally Free Stuff and can
be found at www.totallyfreestuff.com/. The free offers here are
conveniently lumped into categories such as books, clothing,
coupons, audio, educational, e-mail accounts and hardware. One nice
feature of the site is a listing _ always found on the opening page
_ of free offers that have recently been added.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on a recent visit, there were new offers for a
free mouse pad, a six-month magazine subscription and the seemingly
incredible offer of $75 free. But if you follow the link to sign up
for the free money, you'll learn that, to get it, you have to agree
to sign up for a telephone service and an Internet service. Which
just goes to show that not everything is free, even on a site
called Totally Free.
</P>
<P>
   Volition.com calls itself ``the oldest free stuff site'' on the
Net. It can be found, logically enough, at
www.volition.com/free.html. Just as was true with our first site,
you'll find free offers listed by category. Some of the categories
include home furnishings, credit cards, toys, pet supplies and
family fun.
</P>
<P>
   Just as was true with the first site, not all the free offers
offer free stuff. For instance, here's an offer you'll find at the
site:
</P>
<P>
   ``Receive a free $25 SuperCertificate from GiftCertificates .com
when you are approved for a Discover Platinum Card.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, you can also sign up for a free online
chat with a psychic.
</P>
<P>
   Next let's stop in at a site called Get-it-for-Free at
www.get-it-for-free.com/. You'll find the now-familiar free
mousepad offer there, too. Among other offers, you can get a free
rubber stamp (you'll pay $2.39 in shipping and handling costs to
get your free stamp); coupons that are said to be worth $100; and
an offer for a free Neopet (you'll have to travel to the site to
find out what a Neopet is).
</P>
<P>
   TheFreeSite.com at www.thefreesite.com/ calls itself ``the best
place to find freebies, freeware, free stuff, samples, games'' and
it does seem _ on casual observation _ to be one of the best of the
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the offers here include services that offer free e-mail
and free Internet service, free postcards, free games and free MP3
computer audio files.
</P>
<P>
   You may find more legitimately free offers here than on the
other sites. Even so, don't expect to get a free BMW or trip to
Hawaii. But the allure of the free offer _ to those caught in its
trance _ may be more important than the product.

 &HT;    It's Martha, minus the attitude
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Believe it or not, there may be one thing you can
probably do better than Martha Stewart, the undisputed goddess of
gracious living.
</P>
<P>
   Martha, as you may know, has become legend for baking 240
chocolate chip cookies to decorate her Christmas tree, making her
own garden compost and creating picture frames from twigs found on
her Connecticut estate.
</P>
<P>
   But you know, when it comes to the Internet, Martha still seems
a little lost, which is odd, considering her Web site is one of the
best of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In between pruning peonies and making Polish delicacies with her
mother on her syndicated TV show, Martha will occasionally sit down
at the computer and attempt to show us how to surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I've seen Martha get really excited about the Web
was during a demonstration she did about how to order seed catalogs
online. Here she was clearly in her element. Look! A catalog of
rare hybrids from Holland. Look! A British seed catalog brimming
with things you could never find in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That time, Martha herself was at the terminal, and she was
having a ball. Finding things online that genuinely interest you
that you didn't even know about before you logged on is one of the
main reasons people get so excited about the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But moments like that are rare. Last week, Martha had on her
show Jay Walker, co-chairman and founder of Priceline.com, the
name-your-own-price Web site best known for arranging discount
airfares to almost anywhere. He sat down at the computer, neatly
located in the computer storage hutch Martha built on an earlier
episode, and proceeded to show Martha how to buy airline tickets
online.
</P>
<P>
   During the demonstration, Martha sat quietly beside Walker while
he walked her through the nuances of the pull-down menu and other
computer basics while explaining how the service works. For people
who know how to surf the Web, and especially for people who've
always wondered how you can get plane tickets to Paris for a song,
it was a great segment.
</P>
<P>
   NOT IN HER ELEMENT
</P>
<P>
   But watching the show, I got the distinct feeling that Martha
Stewart has never logged on to Priceline.com and probably never
will. When she gets out the flour and butter and makes a
three-tiered wedding cake to die for, her enthusiasm and her
dedication to perfection is clear _ and is part of what makes her
the woman you love to hate. But when she takes a nod at the Net,
with the exception of the seed catalog extravaganza or passing
references to the wonders of eBay, you can just tell her heart
isn't in it.
</P>
<P>
   Martha should know people don't watch Martha Stewart Living to
find out how to get a cheap flight to Paris (or Buffalo, which was
the destination Martha selected for the demonstration). The people
who watch her show and read her magazine are as interested in the
Internet as they are in making the perfect flower arrangement, and
she knows she has to talk about the Internet whether she likes it
or not.
</P>
<P>
   What Martha can't seem to do is bring her trademark perfection
to the fine art of Web surfing. The legions of Martha devotees want
to know what sites she surfs, not just for seeds but for cooking
supplies, gardening tools and directions for making that yummy
dessert she whipped up last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martha _ the person _ is still learning to love the
Web, Martha Stewart the company has already claimed its own corner
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Martha is a shrewd enough businesswoman to know she needs a Web
site, and www.marthastewart.com is a great site with a slightly
different attitude from the person, TV show and magazine of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   Martha never pretends to be a Web geek, and I love her for that.
So whether she knows it or not, MarthaStewart.com is an excellent
example of multichannel media delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The people behind the Martha Stewart Living juggernaut know that
they are not in the magazine business, the TV business or even the
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living is all about attaining a certain lifestyle
and makes use of any and every media outlet, including the
Internet, to give people the information that has made Martha
Stewart a billion-dollar media company.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart.com is beautifully organized, easy to use and
jam-packed with practical information you can actually use, such as
how to get all the wrinkles out of a linen tablecloth or select the
right type of homeowner's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   MarthaStewart.com also has an extensive e-commerce section,
where the truly devoted can purchase some of the items used to
create various projects demonstrated in the magazine and on TV. It
may be a little heavy on the e-commerce links, but this is the only
place to get the actual items Martha uses and recommends, and her
company is smart enough to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web version of Martha Stewart is useful and interesting.
Although Martha has final say, the tone is a little easier to take
than the stern taskmaster of print and video. The information on
the Web site is written a crisp, clear, no-nonsense manner, but
Martha's schoolmarmish tone is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who wishes they could cook, garden or craft like
Martha without actually having to put up with Martha, the Web site
is a refreshing, highly recommended alternative.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    'Best encyclopedia' is no idle boast for Microsoft's Encarta
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a ``Letter from the Editor'' on the opening page of
the Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 2000, Gary Alt calls his
product ``the very best general encyclopedia available in any
medium _ electronic or print.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be right.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of pure information, Britannica has to be considered
king of the encyclopedia hill. However, while I have not seen the
2000 edition, last year's electronic Britannica was just beginning
to test the multimedia waters. Britannica doesn't hurry into
anything.
</P>
<P>
   One can argue that an electronic encyclopedia is more valuable
than a print encyclopedia, because its user can find the
information more readily, and because it can present information
that the print media cannot, most importantly in terms of video and
audio.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Encarta is by far the best of the 2000 electronic
encyclopedias I have seen. The Deluxe version is available in the
Reference Suite _ five CDs or one DVD. I'm looking at the latter.
In addition to the encyclopedia, which can be had separately, the
reference suite includes the World English Dictionary, which
provides synonyms and basic facts and figures in addition to
standard dictionary services, and Microsoft's Interactive World
Atlas as well as a research organizing tool.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta's interface has been revamped again. Gone are the rather
startling (at least initially) snap-down menus, replaced by the
more familiar click-to-scroll kind. Every article is accompanied by
boxes containing links to available multimedia, topic-specific
online sites and an assortment of online search engines.
</P>
<P>
   The most imposing feature of Encarta continues to be its refusal
to shortchange its users through cost-cutting. You won't hear the
segment of Haydn's London Symphony played on some electronic
version of the hurdy-gurdy. You'll hear it played properly by an
orchestra. All the music, and there's a lot of it, is played on the
instruments for which it was written. You don't get this on any
other electronic encyclopedia with which I'm familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Some information _ as with any of the encyclopedias _ is shaky.
The unsigned article on flamenco is still the most accurate and
informative of all, but it persists in referring to Spanish gypsies
as Roma or Romani instead of gitanos, and uses the word ``canto''
instead of the proper ``cante'' for the vocal heart of the art.
</P>
<P>
   A video clip from a film on gypsy life has been added, which is
most welcome. But once again, the information is somewhat wrinkled.
It shows a woman dancing what is purported to be a zambra, ``a type
of flamenco dancing which owes much to Roma culture.'' The zambra
owes much to Moorish culture, not gypsy culture. What little we
hear sounds more like a tango, which indeed owes much to the
gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the Archive, a large collection of articles from
Collier's Yearbook taken from the years before Encarta was created.
There doesn't seem to be much point to most of the older stuff
other than curiosity; it's extremely general, stiff and, the
intervening years have shown, wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta continues to do a good job of appealing to all ages. It
is not as erudite as Britannica, which I suppose is a commercial
advantage in this anti-erudite age, nor does it cater obviously to
the elementary school student.
</P>
<P>
   The time line is a wonderful tool. It can be broken into
numerous topics _ art, science and the like _ and into numerous
areas _ Africa, Europe, etc. _ and two of these can be brought
on-screen for direct comparison.
</P>
<P>
   If you can only have one encyclopedia, Encarta is the one you
want.

 &HT;    Medium-priced computers could be the best vintageBy Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am not exactly an international sophisticate. So _
when I took a corporate job during a break from newspapering _ my
boss, a veteran of really wicked expense account wars, tried to
help and explained his theory of ordering wine in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get the most expensive wines,'' he said. ``Restaurants
just put them there as window dressing; they don't expect to sell
many bottles. And don't get the cheapest ones, they're overpriced
for what they are and not very good. Look in the middle prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when I came to work after a long holiday weekend, I
started thinking about that 15-year-old advice. There were four or
five e-mails from readers asking what to look for in a new
computer. I realized computers and wine have a lot in common. The
ones in the middle price ranges are usually the best choice. That's
not universal advice, but those who need a really powerful computer
usually are advanced users who don't need my advice.
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can figure, the middle ground for computers right now
is a 500 megahertz PC. It seems so strange, typing that. Just a few
years ago, computer magazines were writing with awe about 350
megahertz machines.
</P>
<P>
   Newer faster PCs keep coming along and _ if you really want to
stay at the top of the heap _ you can buy PCs in the 1 gigahertz
range now.
</P>
<P>
   And there still is the high tech equivalent of an arms race. As
processors get faster, software gets more demanding, so you almost
have to upgrade just to run the latest programs. That trend is
still around, but it seems to have slowed some. You can do nicely
now and probably for the next couple of years, as far as running
your favorite programs, on a 500 megahertz machine.
</P>
<P>
   The next decision is memory. Even ordinary home PC users should
consider getting 128 megabytes or even more of RAM. Memory does
make a difference. A good video card and a fat hard disk are nice
too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the neat thing. As I glance through the ads for PCs in
the 500 megahertz range, it's easy to see that every one of them
comes loaded with almost everything you need. So, for ordinary
folks, there aren't too many difficult choices to make anymore. My
guess is that the machine you find at the store will be more than
adequate without changing a thing.
</P>
<P>
   But there are decisions to make.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there are two choices when it comes to who makes the
processor chip (and that's the real brains of your computer).
There's Intel, the safe choice, and AMD, a relative newcomer but a
respected one. I prefer Intel chips, but you're really fine with
either one. And the AMD advocates make a good case: AMD chips
usually test out just as fast or faster than the Intel chip. I go
with Intel simply because it's an old habit _ mostly a brand
preference.
</P>
<P>
   The next big choice is between a brand name PC _ one made by a
company like Dell or Gateway _ or a no-name machine, usually
assembled by what is called a ``screwdriver shop'' in the trade.
The no-name machines, logically enough, cost much less because the
manufacturer isn't saddled with a lot of advertising and marketing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that there would be a large and consistent
quality difference between, say, a Dell and some PC with a name
such as Sunshine Computing Co. on the case. Life would be easier if
that was the case. Then the decision would be to pop the extra
bucks for the brand name machine. But the truth is that some of the
screwdriver shop PCs are great, others are jokes.
</P>
<P>
   So what you get (and what you ought to buy if you're a novice)
is consistent dependability from the big brand name manufacturers.
You also get more reliable and professional customer support if
things go wrong. What you can get (if you know computers or have a
trusted friend who does) from the screwdriver shops is a real
bargain. So if you have a spirit of adventure and enough know-how
to evaluate the machine, you can save some money.

 &HT;    Maken X looks great but lacks substanceBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Superconsole horsepower pushing superconsole graphics does well
to hide less than super gameplay in Maken X ($40; www.sega.com; for
the Dreamcast). There is probably a reason the first-person
``slasher'' genre is under exploited: A sci-fi sword game offers
close-quarter combat but does not, by nature, offer an appropriate
perspective. Maken is the weapon, with an innate ability to ``brain
jack'' or possess various characters throughout the game. But this
clever approach is befuddled by poor control of the mostly-unseen
Maken wielder. Auto-locking on a given target does afford the gamer
some ability to dodge/thrust/parry without becoming completely
disoriented, but it makes for a shallow combat system just the
same. Add to that a story that is so completely hokey _ (We're
fighting evil. How evil? The Devil!) _ and plodding, poorly
scripted dialogue, and all you end up with is a great-looking,
fast-moving, wannabe anime role-playing sword game that only
exploits fresh gaming style, while the extraordinarily cool gaming
concept is unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   X-COM Collector's Edition ($30; www.hasbro-interactive.com; for
Windows) is a retro buff's dream, harkening back to the days (a
mere half decade ago) when games were perhaps more graphically
simplistic yet characteristically more deep, more absorbing and
simply better _ in this case at least. A collection of the three
X-COM strategy games, UFO Defense, Terror from the Deep and
Apocalypse, Collector's Edition, promises to satiate both the game
addict's hunger for a solid game experience as well as introduce
new or casual gamers to purity of gameplay often lost in late-model
splatter and gore festivals. A set of strategy, micromanagement and
resource hoarding games in essence, the X-COM titles have always
garnered praise for their attention to intangible details and sheer
addictiveness. One more kick at the can seems their due, especially
at a mere $10 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Need For Speed: Porsche Unleashed from Electronic Arts ($35,
www.needforspeed.com, for Windows PCs) takes a big risk by focusing
its game on a single line of automobiles, and it succeeds wildly.
Driving the venerable ''Need For Speed'' franchise to a new,
faster, more hair-raising place with a long list of innovations,
the focus here is on creating a true simulation, not just a game.
And the genius is in the details, from the glint of sunlight on
chrome to the completely realistic driving physics, fully
functional dashboard, mesmerizing replay mode and long list of
once-and-future Porsches you can customize and drive. Multiple
camera angles capture every twist of dozens of beautifully detailed
tracks, all so easy to customize that you'll never run out of ways
to race. Perhaps the most fun is in the ''evolution'' style of
campaign gameplay in which you work toward faster,
smoother-handling cars. The only drawback is the large amount of
computer muscle needed to run the sim, but you can easily tweak
down the detail level. Electronic Arts promises to have an online
racing site running within a few weeks to make the multiplayer
options easier. This is the best of the series and goes to the top
of the list of ''must-haves'' for road-racing gamers. Vroom.

<P>
   www.mutantwatch.com _ Are you or someone you know a mutant? It's
a pretty transparent tie-in to the upcoming ``X-Men'' movie, but
this site has a cute premise _ national hysteria about mutants
spawns an anti-mutant Web site. Using this site, you can report
friends as mutants and they'll receive a notification from
mutantwatch.com about their unlucky mutant status.
</P>
<P>
   www.americatakingaction.com _ Cobbled together by ``parents,
teachers and business and community leaders across the nation,''
this site is a comprehensive education site listing schools all
over the country. It features massive amounts of information on
schools broken down by state and township. Along with addresses and
phone numbers, the site also has events calendars and parent
resource centers.

<P>
   www.sylloge.com/5k/ _ Tired of bloated, lumbering Web sites that
take forever to load? This contest, which required entrants to
build an entire self-contained Web site using only five kilobytes

make up for hard drive space.

   www.lyricsworld.com _ If you've ever stayed up late at night,
wondering what in the world Eddie Vedder was mumbling about on the

will route you along, hopefully to the same song you've got in your

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   A must-have peripheral for Nintendo's Game Boy Color, The Game
Buddy ($20; www.bti.ca) from Battery Technologies, Inc., is an
add-on rechargeable battery pack for the puny little hand-held game
device. It supplies nearly 24 hours of constant play with each
charge. It purports a whopping 2,000 hours of total storage
capacity and fits snugly to the base of the Game Boy Color where it
interfaces with the AC adapter port. It remains attached even while
charging. The Game Buddy also acts as a night light when it's
recharging, a beacon of hope in a dark sleepless night. The unit
also gives the Game Boy significantly more heft than some portable
game users are accustomed to, but don't be a wimp _ you've got 24
hours of recuperation and gaming time for your efforts. It's cool.

<P>
   And from the ``what will they think of next and shouldn't we
shoot them before they do?'' files comes the BallButler ($90;
www.golfballbutler.com), a washing accessory for avid golfers who
happen to own their own electric golf carts. Mounted just about
anywhere on one's cart (fender, basket, drink holder _ No! No! Not
the drink holder!) and drawing power from the cart battery, the
patented BallButler embraces one's filthy whackable orb while a
diminutive 12-volt motor spins it about amongst ``polypropylene
monofilament brushes in a solution of water and detergent leaving
it sparkling clean.'' What more could you want? Someone to hit for
you, maybe?

 &HT;    Refilling ink cartridges saves money but can be risky

   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I read that a kit has been developed and is being sold that
allows you to refill black or color printer ink cartridges. I want
to try it but can't remember the company offering the kits. Can you
help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Dobrin, Beachwood, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are two schools of thought on refilling ink
cartridges in printers. One is that you shouldn't do it because the
risk outweighs the cost sa and pieces from the hard disk. It's also
at cnet.com. Also, a good source for these two utilities and
freeware in general is freewarefilez.com.

 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Before the international business trip, there's
often the trip to the travel store for business communications
supplies. Tracking down the right phone and plug adapters can be as
challenging as navigating train schedules or maneuvering through
foreign languages and customs.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint recently began selling a convenient solution _ though not
a cheap one. Its Business Traveler Kit ($95 for current customers;
$150 for new customers with service included; www.sprint
.com/businesstravel) contains 13 phone adapters and five power
plugs, with a guide matching the devices to the countries where
they work. Packed neatly in a 9-inch-by-12.5-inch leather binder,
the kit also includes a nifty 10-foot phone cord that spools from a
small plastic case, a phone line tester that can protect gear from
power surges and a guide with tips about logging online from
outside the United States. Purchasers also can get access to voice
and data telecom services that Sprint says include low calling
rates, easy conference call setup, online presentation software, a
Web site with helpful travel information and extra customer service
help. Costs for the related phone services vary.

 &HT;    Digital watches
 &HT;    By James Cumming
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ One principle almost always holds true when it
comes to gadgets of any kind: The more the gadget is able to do,
the harder it is to get it to do anything.
</P>
<P>
   The same principle goes for watches. Wind-up watches couldn't
calculate the rate of return on your investment portfolio, but at
least they don't force you to read a manual that would give Stephen
Hawking a headache just to get the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   Timex, longtime manufacturers of inexpensive watches, has come
up with a digital watch that is actually easy to set and use.
</P>
<P>
   While many digital watches have an array of buttons, knobs and
bars that must be depressed, pulled, twisted or jabbed, the Timex
i-Control crown-set watch line has one button and one ``crown''
like the stem and knob on a traditional wind-up watch.
</P>
<P>
   Crown-set watches offer some of the most popular features of
other digital watches: They keep track of the date, they have a
built-in alarm and they have a night light that makes the watch
face easy to read in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The digits are nearly half an inch high, so telling the time at
a quick glance is no problem.
</P>
<P>
   It took less than two minutes to set a sample watch with the
correct time, date and an alarm time. The instructions are so
simple that everything you need to know to operate the watch is
scribed on the back of the watch body.
</P>
<P>
   Pull the stem out until it clicks at the halfway point and the
watch tells you you're ready to set the time. Pull the stem until
it clicks at the fully extended point and the watch tells you
you're ready to set the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Timex i-Control crown-set watches should be available now for a
suggested retail price of $34.95 at stores that carry other Timex
products. If you have trouble finding the watches, contact the
company at (800) 367-8463 or www.timex.com for a retailer near you.
</P>
<P>
   Also new from Timex are a line of i-Control ring-set watches
that offer more features such as stopwatch functions and countdown
timers. But of course, with more features comes more complexity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the crown and button that control the crown-set
watches, the ring-set watches have a crown, two buttons and a
movable ring around the face of the watch. Still, they are a little
easier to use than other watches with comparable features.
</P>
<P>
   The ring-set watches come in Ironman Triathlon, Reef Gear and
Expedition styles and sell for $42.95 to $47.95.

 &HT;    Bored public left with the Senate
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I have not succeeded in making myself
follow the presidential elections. In this, I suspect I am not so
different from most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   When you have two candidates racing to out-moderate each other,
they tend to blur together in people's minds. Both Vice President
Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush are pursuing reasonableness
to an unreasonable degree.
</P>
<P>
   That's why people who enjoy following politics as though poll
results were sports-page box scores have turned to U.S. Senate
races as the biggest game in town.
</P>
<P>
   This has had an odd effect. People who have lived their whole
lives in cities where waitresses ask you if you want grits or home
fries with the breakfast special suddenly are fonts of opinion on
New York state politics.
</P>
<P>
   They talk knowingly about the up-state vote. They had decided
views on when and whether Mayor Rudolph Giuliani would be in or out
of the race. And once he was out, whether that young Lazio guy, who
lives on an island somewhere, is dead in the water or a sure bet
against Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Political junkies across the country have been seized with New
York Envy. They, at least, have a real race. One with scandal,
sudden reversals, surprises and outrageous fortune!
</P>
<P>
   It all makes speculating about vice presidential candidates too
boring to mention and not worth handicapping.
</P>
<P>
   Even Florida's Senate race is more engaging than the national
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is seeing something that's not supposed to happen here:
a duke-it-out Senate primary among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For generations, the traditional Florida Senate race has been a
pile-on in the Democratic primary with ballots as long as your arm.
The winner would face the sole designated Republican.
</P>
<P>
   No more. Now Florida is a genuine two-party state, and
Republicans really and truly are fighting for nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Two Republicans want to succeed Connie Mack in the Senate _
Education Commissioner Tom Gallagher and U.S. Rep. Bill
</P>
<P>
   McCollum. (Actually three, Ray Sessman, a teacher from Fort
Lauderdale whom nobody has heard of, also will be on the ballot.)
</P>
<P>
   McCollum, a 10-term congressman with a familiar '90s style
guns-and-impeachment record, is trying to soften his image.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, a former state insurance commissioner and candidate
for governor, is running as a Real Florida Guy opposing a
Washington Insider.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Insider is to political advertising what the
Bargain Brand is to detergent ads. As a black-suited wrestling
opponent, he is second only to the Tax-and-Spend Liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, when Gallagher ran an ad suggesting an unnamed
McCollum is a Washington Insider. McCollum responded instantly. He
ran an ad saying Gallagher is a Tax-and-Spend Liberal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's slick. He's sly. And he tried to raise your taxes,'' the
ad said.
</P>
<P>
   This slogan may not be as great a masterpiece as ``Hey Buddy,
You're a Liberal,'' the slogan that made Mack a senator, but expect
to hear it again.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, it might be put to music. Maybe with tune like ``You're A
Mean One, Mr. Grinch.'' He's-s-s s-s-s-lick. He's-s-s s-s-s-lyyy
... He's a mean one . . . .
</P>
<P>
   The tax increase in question was a move in 1994 for Floridians
to vote on raising the sales tax to pay for more prisons. Fear of
crime and early release of prisoners made this a momentarily
popular issue. It was the Vanilla Ice of constitutional
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher told reporters the ad was, well, ``typical Washington
insider stuff.'' Neither candidate, it appears, is going to stray
much from the basics this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And when it's over, the winner will face the Democrat, Insurance
Commission Bill Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   The primary winner then will call him a Tax-and-Spend Liberal.
And a Tallahassee Insider.
</P>
<P>
   If the home-grown variety of insider doesn't sound as scary as
Washington's, don't worry. With the right camera effects and a
couple million dollars worth of repetition after Labor Day, this
creature could look every bit as ugly
</P>
<P>
   By Halloween, they may be selling masks.

 &HT;    Man-made lights confuse baby sea turtles _ and lead many to
their deaths
 &HT;    By Cathy Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They crawl from the sea in the dark of night. They are
big. They are quiet. They are determined.
</P>
<P>
   What are they? Mother sea turtles looking for a safe place to
lay their eggs!
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that sea turtles existed before the
dinosaurs. But without human help, sea turtles could become
extinct, too.
</P>
<P>
   All six of the sea turtle species that swim in the waters around
the United States are on an endangered- or threatened-species list.
That makes it against the law to disturb them or their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to know that if you spend part of your summer
vacation on the coast of Florida, Georgia or any other Southern
state, because you might be sharing beach space with sea turtles or
their eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Turtle specialists tell us that beginning in mid-May each year,
females come out of the ocean several times to lay nests of about
120 eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The turtles work hard to dig a deep hole with their back
flippers. After laying the eggs, they kick sand over the nest and
leave, going back to the ocean until it's time to lay more.
</P>
<P>
   About two months later _ if people, animals or high tides don't
bother the eggs _ baby turtles hatch and make a fast dash to the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   People's love of the beach creates problems for sea turtles,
according to Martha Maglothin, a turtle researcher employed by the
Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Center in Florida.
Building and other activity on beaches means there's less room for
turtle nests.
</P>
<P>
   Baby turtles can get confused by man-made lights. When they come
out of their eggs, baby turtles want to crawl as fast as they can
toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Their brains are programmed to find the water by looking for the
brightest thing on the horizon, which used to be the ocean before
so many people came along.
</P>
<P>
   Now baby turtles get confused by the lights on houses and
hotels, and even by flashlights and bonfires, Maglothin said.
</P>
<P>
   They often run away from the sea and end up dying in the sand.
Unattended bonfires can burn the baby turtles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists used to think that about one in 1,000 hatchlings made
it to adulthood. Now it is believed that the number is closer to
one in 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is the main place in the United States where sea turtles
come to lay eggs, and people there are trying to protect the
turtles, according to Barbara Eells, a teacher and turtle volunteer
in Port St. Joe, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Power Corp. has developed a ``Lights Out for Sea
Turtles'' program to urge people to help keep beaches dark at night
when it's May through October.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp boats, once a big threat to sea turtles, now are
outfitted with special devices to prevent turtles from getting
caught in nets and then drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Also, students and grownups are learning about the dangers of
letting garbage get into the sea. Turtles sometimes eat plastic
bags and bottles, which can kill them.
</P>
<P>
   Baby sea turtles still have many animal predators _ such as
raccoons, dogs, cats and ghost crabs _ that raid nests for food.
</P>
<P>
   But human beings are starting to get the message about saving
sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an uphill battle, but I think we're finally starting
to make a difference,'' Maglothin said.
</P>
<P>
   DID YOU KNOW?
</P>
<P>
   Sea turtles are large air-breathing reptiles. They move slowly
on land but swim quickly and gracefully in the sea. When they are
active, sea turtles must swim to the ocean surface to breathe every
few minutes. When they are resting, they can remain underwater for
as long as two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sea turtles live in all but the coldest of the world's oceans,
but they nest only on warm beaches. Sea turtles lay 40,000 to
70,000 nests in Florida each year, making Florida the most
important nesting area in the United States. The sea turtles most
commonly found in Florida are loggerheads, green turtles and
leatherbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that many sea turtles return to the place
where they were hatched when they decide to make their nests. Some
sea turtles swim thousands of miles to nest.
</P>
<P>
   A sea turtle may live 40 to 60 years or more. But the vast
majority of baby turtles that hatch never make it to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Much about sea turtles is still a mystery, including where they
live for the first year or two of their lives. Scientists call this
period the ``lost years'' because turtles of this age group are
rarely seen by people.

 &HT;    Elian a step closer to Cuba
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Elian Gonzalez's father won a major victory last week
toward taking his son home to Cuba. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which is in Atlanta, ruled that it was OK for the U.S.
government not to grant Elian an asylum hearing. At an asylum
hearing, a person can ask the U.S. government to protect him and
not force him to return to his home country.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is a Communist nation about 90 miles south of Florida.
Cubans often try to come to the United States because they think
they'll have a better life here. Elian's mother died at sea while
trying to bring Elian to America. Elian's father wants the boy to
return to Cuba with him.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have two weeks to fight the decision in
court.
</P>
<P>
   BEWARE OF THE BEARS!
</P>
<P>
   More houses are being built in Atlanta where there used to be
forests and fields. And sometimes bears still live there.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a young black bear stole food near some townhouses.
Last month, a family of bears moved into a subdivision and another
bear was spotted on a golf course _ but wasn't playing well at all.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife rangers tranquilized the bear near the townhouses and
released it in the North Georgia mountains. One of the subdivision
bears was captured and released into woodlands. But the other bears
are still at large.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want to come face to snout with a bear, rangers
say, keep your trash cans covered and keep pet food inside.

 &HT;    New kid on the block
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The weather's been good _ some rain, some
sun. The corn is just about as tall as it should be this time of
year, and nobody died last night _ which means there's not a whole
lot to grumble about this morning. The cafe's kind of quiet _ until
Gene walks in _ then it's time to pick on the new
</P>
<P>
   guy.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Gene decided it was time to retire to the
country so he sold his radio station in Sandusky, bought 10 acres
just outside of our village, built a house and a barn, got himself
a horse and a tractor, and put in a row of tomato plants. Now he's
a farmer _ at least that's what he calls himself. My coffee
buddies, most all retired farmers, like to tease him. Fortunately,
Gene gives as good as he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Gene!'' Amos hails him as he comes through the door.
``That new tractor of yours still running?'' Gene grins, says it
runs great, and that he's even thinking about buying a sidecar for
it so Amos can ride with him when he plows, just to make sure he's
doing it right.
</P>
<P>
   Amos (340 acres _ retired) is ready for him. He jabs his gnarled
index finger on the table top right next to the cup Gene just set
down and says real loud so everybody can hear, ``If it don't have
yellow wheels, I don't ride on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal (260 acres _ retired), not wanting to miss any of the fun,
jumps in. ``We told you that if you wanted to be a real farmer like
the rest of us you had to buy the tractor that ``runs like a
Deere'' so's folks'd take you seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene reminds them, ``I'm almost 70 and my wife is in great
health. So what if I died and became an angel? First thing you
know, I'd fly in to check out the farm and there'd be my widow's
new husband riding around on my John Deere tractor. That'd make me
so mad I'd do something un-angel-like and wind up down
</P>
<P>
   below.
</P>
<P>
   Amos says that's where all Brand-X tractor owners end up anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many new folks move to our village so when a stranger
shows up in the cafe three or four mornings in a row, the regulars
who've lived here all their lives and know everybody and who they
married, are curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's the guy at the counter?'' someone will ask in a stage
whisper. If no one knows for sure, the process of elimination
begins. ``Maybe it's Harold Specht's cousin from Michigan. He looks
a little like them Spechts, don't you think?'' Or, ``That could be
one of those Burkhausen boys that moved away when he
</P>
<P>
   was still a kid. Any of them left out there on the homeplace?''
Usually, when the genealogy trail cools, they lose interest and
forget about the stranger, but that didn't happen with Gene _ he
didn't give them a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why he just come over and sat right down and started talking
to us,'' Amos says, ``kind of like you did Lizzie when you first
moved to town. How long ago was that?''
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years, I tell him, since I sat down to my first cup of
coffee with them _ we've shared a lot of history across these
scarred tabletops. ``When I met all of you I was still renovating
my house; remember all the questions I used to ask about plaster
and plumbing?'' Cal says he recalls telling me that farmers don't
do inside stuff _ that's why they have wives.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years we've been through college (mine) and
grandchildren (theirs), retirements, a couple of heart attacks,
three bypasses, and some prostate problems (also theirs). We've
lost a couple of our regulars. Mr. Brown almost made it to 90.
</P>
<P>
   Gene finishes his decaf and stands up. ``Gotta' go,'' he says.
``Got a lot to do today.'' Amos asks what's so all-fired important.
</P>
<P>
   A big grin spread's across Gene's face. ``Gonna' paint my
tractor wheels yellow so I can be like you big guys,'' he says and
heads for the door. Everybody cracks up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' Amos asks, chuckling so hard he can hardly
get out the words. ``He's one of us regular guys,'' then he turns
to me and adds, ``just like you, Lizzie.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty high praise in my book.

   www.greatkids.com _ Read stories about extraordinary kids who
are inventors, volunteers, sports stars and musicians. There's
12-year-old Daniel in Santa Cruz, Calif., who invented a

bill-changing machines at video arcades. Meet Craig, also 12, from
near Toronto, who with 20 friends started a non-profit group called
Free the Children that encourages world leaders to pass laws to
protect children from employers who exploit them. There are now
Free the Children chapters in seven countries. They credit a new

 &HT;    Wireless age to bring new freedoms ... and burdens
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deb Spicer Tompkins lives in the blur.
</P>
<P>
   There is a blur, she will tell you, where there used to be a
line separating professional and family, private life and public.
But with her cellular phone, pager and wireless digital assistant,
Tompkins often finds herself where there is no line at all.
</P>
<P>
   As managing director of the technology practice at Hill and
Knowlton, a public relations firm, she gets e-mail from clients,
pages from her children, phone calls from co-workers, all the time,
everywhere. ``If you're not careful, it puts you in a perpetual
reactive mode,'' she said. ``Sometimes instead of reducing
information overload, it contributes to information overload.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, the human relationship with technology has always been
two-way. And now, in the wireless revolution, we have combined the
mobility of cars, the reach of phones and the power of computers.
``This is huge,'' said Steve Jones, professor and head of
communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``Wireless
Internet access represents as much of a revolution as the
introduction of the Internet itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who grew up in the pre-Net era, the prospects can sound
like an episode of ``The Jetsons.'' Say you're driving to the
theater. The car knows where you are going, sees the time, does a
quick calculation and realizes you are not going to make it on
time. The car calls the theater, then sells the tickets to someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Prial, marketing director for IBM's pervasive computing
unit, says it is hardly a stretch from what can be done now to that
scenario. ``You get to the theater and sure enough, you say, `Darn,
we're late.' And the car says, `No problem. I sold the tickets.'''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of the technology seems clear enough: Employees can
hit the beach without ducking a critical conference call, children
can reach parents from a party gone sour, stranded motorists can
summon a tow truck. The near future is even more alluring: paying
for items before you get to the store, turning on the oven when you
are miles from home, checking in to a flight while still on the way
to the airport _ something Swissair already does in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   ``And tomorrow, you'll have your electronic boarding pass on
your phone,'' Prial said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many burdens of wireless technology are also hard
to miss. The relentless flood of e-mail and voice mail. The ease
with which a colleague or boss can intrude on your free time. The
annoyance of hearing strangers blithely discussing private business
in public places on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet work and bad manners are not new, even if we have witnessed
a spate of new technologies. How much of a difference does it make
that we can communicate without wires?
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Net power in the palm of your hand _ for
transactions, for information, for communication _ will be the
difference, said Steve Jones, professor and head of communication
at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``People will become more
spur of the moment. It makes the Internet more a part of everyday
life.''
</P>
<P>
   As voice recognition software improves, users will ask their
hand-held devices for movie information, the nearest four-star
Italian restaurant and maybe even to translate what a stranger
says. ``We can get terribly Star Trek about it, but it's
possible,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is not happy about what technology has done so far. Flip
answers to critics _ ``well, just turn it off!'' _ ring hollow, he
said. ``People are realizing that even as they turn cell phones off
and don't check e-mail, it doesn't stop coming.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTENDS WORK WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Wireless extends the work week and may also add a layer of
stress, said Deborah Borisoff, professor in the department of
culture and communication at New York University. ``E-mail ups the
ante for responding. People call you and say, `I sent you three
e-mails. Why haven't you answered?'''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite the advantage of mobility, erosion of
personal life is becoming ``the norm,'' she said. ``We know the
comparison with the way it was, but what about the new
generation?''
</P>
<P>
   Borisoff ran into resistance when she demanded that graduate
students switch off phones and pagers in class. ``People tell me,
`I would lose my job if I turned off my beeper.'''
</P>
<P>
   James W. Carey, author of ``Communication as Culture'' and
professor at Columbia University, recounted standing behind a woman
in a Baskin-Robbins ice cream shop who was taking orders via
wireless phone from the people at home, apparently oblivious to the
people behind her in line.
</P>
<P>
   When the key division between home and public disappears, people
act rudely and don't even know it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Martin, who writes the syndicated Miss Manners column,
said new technology takes getting used to. ``Some people think they
are in an etiquette-free zone. Still, I think that everyone will
calm down when we get used to cell phones.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not technology that makes people rude, she said. ``It is
amazing how technology improves but people don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carey said he believes technology does shape expectations.
Television, he believes, has convinced some people that those being
watched can't watch back. One student who sat in the front row
constantly talked during class and was astonished that he
complained, Carey said. ``She said, `You mean you noticed? I didn't
think it would bother you.'''
</P>
<P>
   POWERFUL MEDIUM
</P>
<P>
   Many people still think the technology is just for talking.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the Europeans know and as Americans are finding out,
wireless is reaching new realms. When the phone's souped-up
software connects to sophisticated networks, the phone becomes a
map, a wallet and a window on the Web. With a tiny screen, phones
won't replace computer surfing, but Net sites are being configured
to be usable _ if not exciting _ via the phone.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Atlanta-based Hotpalm.com has software that will
let users trade stocks by phone. Moreover, Hotpalm technology can
let a shopper in a store connect to a search engine that will sweep
the Web to find the best price for the item you are looking at,
said Chandan Seernmani, chairman, chief executive officer and
co-founder of Hotpalm.com. ``Then you can take that to the service
desk and say, `Would you care to match this price or should I push
the button and buy this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Phones fitted with global positioning software can tell you
where the nearest Home Depot is _ and how to get there. Connected
to the Net, an emergency medical technician might read a patient's
medical history as she is lifted into the ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will change the way that people live and the way they do
things,'' Seernmani said. ``This is the wave we are getting ready
to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW GATED COMMUNITY
</P>
<P>
   It started with the Walkman _ the first technology to create a
kind of ``gated community in the street,'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the man on the sidewalk talking on the phone, the woman
in the coffee line speaking loudly into her hand and ignoring those
around her, he said. ``Whatever the advantages, efficiencies,
conveniences and portability, these are devices for imposing
private life on public life. These devices surround people with a
kind of shell in which they become inaccessible and unaware of the
world around them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not just discourteous, Carey said. ``Democracy is a form
of public life that depends ultimately on people being aware of
strangers and being able to converse with them. There have been
many incursions and erosions of that. This is a kind of wholesale
assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to IBM's Prial, that blending of public and private is only
for the better.
</P>
<P>
   If someone on an airplane recommends a book, now you may write
the name on a napkin, shove it in your pocket and forget it. But
soon, you will tap out the book title on your wireless, press a
button that says, ``buy this book'' and it will be waiting for you
at your hotel or when you get home.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless evangelicals expect the home to be networked as well.
Put a ``Web cam'' in the refrigerator that you can view from work,
so you know if you are low on milk. Better yet, install an
automatic ``replenishment'' sensor that calls you, he said. ``You
are driving home from work and you get a message that says, `Pick
up milk.' That improves your life.''
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACY AN ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Some scoff at the IBM version of the wireless world-to-come.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just silly,'' said Alan L. Marcus, professor of history
at Iowa State University. ``That's Pollyanna stuff, although I can
understand in a world where one is selling things that this would
be attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Take one example _ the availability of a patient's medical
information, he said. ``Think about an insurance company having
your test results and, all of a sudden, you are not insurable. The
one thing that everybody wants is privacy, and this means that
privacy is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But wireless is really part of a much larger picture, said
Marcus, author of ``Technology in America: A Brief History.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans love technology, especially the kind that gives them
personal control _ or at least seems to. Look at cars,
videocassette players, cable television _ the culture is deep-fried
in individualism, Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it does change relationships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless encourages bosses to reach out and touch employees at
odd moments _ undermining the ``I wasn't home to get the phone
call'' alibi. And increasingly personalized work schedules raise
another barrier to unions, which often rely on a shared work
experience. But Marcus doesn't blame the wireless wave on muscular
marketing efforts to sell wireless service to one and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic forces only work if people buy stuff,'' Marcus said.
``There has to be a reason why you spend your money that way.
Talking about economic forces reverses how we think. We think about
`them' doing it to us, but we do it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Marcus went to a wedding and wondered: Should he turn
off his cell phone and risk missing an emergency call from his
children or risk disrupting the wedding? Obviously, he should have
found out the number at the wedding's location and left that with
the kids. Instead, he switched off his phone, later marveling at
his own narrow-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I had a cell phone, it never occurred to me how to
operate without a cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   GOOD FOR GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget money.
</P>
<P>
   While wireless may appeal to our need for autonomy and
productivity, it is also a potentially dramatic economic
fertilizer. Leaps forward in communications and transportation have
spurred business expansion by lowering costs, raising efficiency
and making possible transactions that were simply not feasible
before.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless does the same.
</P>
<P>
   The service has grown much cheaper even as it becomes a more
powerful tool. Business-to-business electronic commerce _ something
increasingly possible via wireless _ will make companies more
efficient. Wireless also lets employees work away from the office _
in cars, airports, hotels and at home. Meanwhile, consumers find
themselves using wireless more as its costs fall. And new versions
of wireless will let them do more business _ whether it's buying
stocks, books or clothes.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, technology is an economic driver and wireless is a
key technology, said Charles Mahla, senior economist for Econ One,
a California-based consulting group. ``Ultimately that's going to
result in greater profits, greater incomes, greater demand for
consumer products. All this propels the economy forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless also holds the promise of evening out economic
inequities. Development, technology and wealth are concentrated in
a relatively few places. But when new technology changes costs, the
possibilities shift, too, said Linda Garcia, associate director of
the Georgetown University Program in Communication, Culture and
Technology. ``From my point of view, the special thing about
wireless is that it has a very different cost structure. Wireless
doesn't have a high fixed cost. You can recover your capital
faster. This is exciting for, say, rural India.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the rural United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think cooperatives, rural telephone companies, have been
more likely to deploy technology more rapidly than the regional
Bell companies (like BellSouth). They have to make a capital
investment, but they don't have to make a profit. I'm just afraid
that it won't continue to happen. Other people can come and eat
their lunch _ these are great takeover companies.''
</P>
<P>
   For its advantages, many wonder if technology liberates us or
ties us further down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to think about whether this is freedom or an
illusion,'' said NYU's Borisoff. ``What do we mean by freedom? And
freedom from what?''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Seagraves, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Georgia, uses her phone frequently _ but often
leaves it switched off. ``I don't find it to be an intrusion
because, if I don't want to talk, I turn it off. We sometimes give
technology a control that it doesn't have to have. And maybe we are
blaming technology for our own inability to set boundaries and make
our own choices.''
</P>
<P>
   But those choices are not easy for us, said Ralph Keyes, social
critic and author of ``We, the Lonely People.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans constantly tussle with technology, hoping it is a tool
to improve lives, even as it sometimes forces a trade-off. ``Every
day I ask myself, is my life better because I have all this
technology? I don't have a clear answer to that.''

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The weather's been good _
some rain, some sun. The corn is just about as tall as it should be
this time of year, and nobody died last night _ which means there's
not a whole lot to grumble about this morning. The cafe's kind of
quiet _ until Gene walks in _ then it's time to pick on the new
guy. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I have not succeeded in
making myself follow the presidential elections. In this, I suspect
I am not so different from most Americans. When you have two
candidates racing to out-moderate each other, they tend to blur
together in people's minds. Both Vice President Al Gore and Texas
Gov. George W. Bush are pursuing reasonableness to an unreasonable
degree. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN - LONDON - It is a situation in which I often
find myself. No visit to London can be complete without a swing
through that leviathan of a department store, Harrod's.
Particularly to the book department as that is contiguous to the
sewing and needlepoint department to which my wife is devoutly
drawn despite the fact that the inventory there hasn't changed in a
dozen years. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED

PARENTS OF BIRMINGHAM BOMB VICTIMS TELL STORY OF BLACK SURVIVAL IN

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Every time I chat with Mrs. Alpha Robertson, I am reminded by
her voice and overall demeanor that I am in the presence of an
ignored chapter in American social history. She is the embodiment
of the historic travail of black parents who lived during the era
of lynch rule in the South.
 &HT;    In the South there was once a truism among blacks stating that
regardless of what parents did for their children, they always was
the albatross of the lynch mob.
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson, 81, is the mother of Carole Robertson, one of
the four teenage girls murdered when racists bombed Birmingham's
black 16th Street Baptist church in 1963. I've maintained a great
friendship with Mrs. Robertson since I first interviewed her in
Chicago over 15 years ago.
 &HT;    Recently, I spoke by phone with Mrs. Robertson following the
announcement by the State of Alabama that two alleged Klu Klux
Klansmen had been indicted for the murder of her child. The nature
of the conversation required me to consider my words carefully.
There could be no lightweight reporters' banter: ``Will you be glad
if the two alleged Klansmen are sentenced to the chair?''
 &HT;    Yet, the temptation to dwell on the superficial was offered. One
of the indicted reportedly had said that his ``only regret's that
the black church was not filled'' when the bomb exploded.
 &HT;    This heartless statement represents an age-old, pervasive,
antihuman attitude that black parents once had to endure whenever
their children left their doorsteps. It also represents the
mentality that once gave lynch mobs a degree of acceptability
throughout the land _ not just in the South.
 &HT;    Despite over 4,742 lynchings from 1909 through 1968, as recorded
by the NAACP, the U.S. Congress remained silent for decades, even
though 1,297 of the hanging victims had been white. Congress
refused to pass any antilynching legislation until after World War
II, when the annual statistics for lynchings had dropped to single
digits.
 &HT;    But don't confuse the lynching of blacks with the hanging of
whites. A black lynching usually expressed a ritualized worship of
racial supremacy. Frequently lynchers dressed in their Sunday best
or wore old army attire from the Spanish American War or World War
I. The lynchers and attendant mob carried the Confederate war flag,
as though brutalizing blacks was an act of patriotism.
 &HT;    Some of the mob even fought for charred souvenirs such as toes,
fingers, and in some instances, burnt genitals for display at
country stores and barbershops.
 &HT;    The tolerance of lynching represented a national and regional
sickness. This sickness can be witnessed today in those who
advocate Confederate flags flying over state capitol grounds.
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson and I strongly favor justice finally prevailing
in solutions to old murders, but we are also largely concerned
about changes in old attitudes. We detect a modicum of hope in the
singular fact that the State of Alabama is trying to correct at
least one of its sins of the past.
 &HT;    As we talked, I recalled a conversation we had one evening over
20 years ago when I was visiting Montgomery, Ala. The phone rang
and an unannounced voice spoke as though it was old friend. ``Hey,
Vernon, how you doin', fella,'' the voice said. ``Your friend Alvin
(black Alabama Rep. Alvin Holmes), told me you were in town ... Any
thing you need?''
 &HT;    I couldn't detect the drawl until the man said ``This is George,
you know me, the governor. I jess wanted to know if everything was
all right.''
 &HT;    Gov. Wallace went on to talk about how he had changed, and how
``we all had to change, no doubt about it.'' Wallace said ``we know
we didn't treat colored people right, and so does everybody.''
 &HT;    I turned down Gov. Wallace's offer of transportation to the
airport, but I conceded to myself that times had changed at some
level in the South. I couldn't resist remembering that in 1963
Wallace stood at the entrance of the University of Alabama and
drawled, ``I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow and
segregation forever.''
 &HT;    Nor could I clear from memory the spiritual climate of 1963 when
those four girls were slain and two black boys were killed the same
day _ one shot by a cop in Birmingham. I also recalled a white
civil rights marcher named William L. Moore of Baltimore who was
shot to death near Attalla, Ala., and that in Jackson, Miss.,
Medgar Evers was assassinated for trying to register blacks to
vote.
 TAKING DOWN THE CONFEDERATE FLAG  
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson and I recognize the significance of this singular
initiative coming from the State of Alabama. Indeed, it should
proceed with serious intent. A sector of Alabama, like Gov.
Wallace, has become clearly aware of the power of the black ballot.
Martyrs such as Martin Luther King Jr., Evers and so many others
did not die in vain.
 &HT;    However, delayed indictments of old culprits will never truly
compensate noble souls like retired school teacher Alpha Robertson
or the ghost of her late educator husband Alvin Robertson Sr. whose
biggest sin was sending their pretty little child ``all dressed
up'' to die in Sunday School.

 By ED ODEVEN  
 &HT;    Sang-Hoon Lee stands out in more ways than one. The 29-year-old
pitcher from Seoul is on the verge of becoming the first man in
history to play in the elite levels of professional baseball in
Korea, Japan and the United States. Lee signed a two-year contract
with the Boston Red Sox in January and at press time appeared to be
slated as the No. 2 lefty in the Red Sox bullpen behind veteran
Rheal Cormier.
 &HT;    Oh, and then there's his famous shoulder-length, bushy
reddish-brown hair that has earned him the nickname ``Samson'' _ a
reference to the Biblical warrior with impressive physical prowess.
 &HT;    Lee has also accomplished what few pitchers have done: excel as
a starter and closer. In 1995, he had a 20-5 record as a starter
and earned the Korean Most Valuable Player honors. Two years later,
Lee saved 37 games, and was chosen as the relief pitcher of the
year.
 &HT;    Last season, he had a 6-5 record and a 2.83 earned run average
(ERA) while pitching for the Chunichi Dragons in Japan. In 95.1
innings, Lee struck out 65 batters and walked 30 in 36 appearances.
 &HT;    These numbers and past accolades, however, don't mean much to
Lee nowadays.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to put too much meaning in them,'' Lee said
through interpreter Seung-hyun Park before a recent exhibition game
against the visiting Minnesota Twins at Wilbur ``Billy'' Smith
Field in Fort Myers, Fla. ``I just want to do my best and not think
about the past.''
 &HT;    Lee adds his main goal for this season is to earn a spot on
Boston's 25-man roster and stick around to contribute all season.
 &HT;    Joining Lee at the Red Sox training camp are fellow Koreans Jin
Ho Cho and Sun-Woo Kim. Cho split last season with Boston's
Triple-A Pawtucket team (9-3 with a 3.45 ERA and 80 strikeouts in
109.2 innings), and also appeared in nine games with the Red Sox,
posting a 2-3 record in 39.1 innings of work.
 &HT;    Kim, a 22-year-old from Inchon, was 9-8 with a 4.89 ERA in 26
games last season all starts for Double-A Trenton. The
hard-throwing right-hander fanned 130 batters and yielded just 44
base on balls in 149 innings.
 &HT;    According to Lee, the duos' presence in Ft. Myers has made his
transition to America easier.
 &HT;    ``It's been very beneficial to have Jin Ho Cho and Sun Kim
here.''
 &HT;    During his brief stay in the United States, Lee says the Red Sox
coaches haven't asked him to alter his pitching style. So, what
should baseball fans expect from Lee this season?
 &HT;    ``He's somebody we are looking for to get out left-handers in
key situations,'' teammate Mike Stanley says.
 &HT;    Certainly that's an important role for a team yearning to
overtake the lefty-loaded New York Yankees as the American League
East's premier ballclub this season. Wendell Kim, Boston's third
base coach, says in limited playing time Lee has made a favorable
impression with the organization.
 &HT;    ``It looks like he can handle himself. He might be able to get
you out with his pitches' change of speeds,'' he says.
 &HT;    After a respectable stint in the big leagues last summer, Cho
appears ready to crack the starting rotation on a full-time basis
as well.
 &HT;    ``He's obviously battling for that number five spot,'' Stanley
says. ``He gave us some good quality innings last year coming up.
He's got pretty good experience and knows what it takes to compete
and win at this level.''
 &HT;    Minnesota Twins manager Tom Kelly believes Cho is progressing as
a productive hurler.
 &HT;    ``He seems like a guy that's sort of learning and making the
transition. I'm sure it's a challenge for him to come over here and
pitch, especially at this level,'' says Kelly, who guided the Twins
to thrilling seven-game World Series triumphs in 1987 and 1991.
 &HT;    ``I think he's handled it well. He seems to be pretty composed
on the mound and I'm sure it s quite a learning experience. You've
got to admire that and take your hat off to the young man for
trying.''
 &HT;    While observing the 20-plus pitchers during spring training,
Wendell Kim notices Sun Kim has the necessary skills to succeed.
 &HT;    ``He's around the plate. He's got a good presence on the mound.
He looks poised. Nothing seems to rattle him,'' Wendell Kim
reports.
 &HT;    Gary Gaetti, who broke into the majors with the Twins in 1982
and is currently fighting for a spot on the Red Sox roster, says
Lee, Cho and Kim have become welcome additions during the
Grapefruit League season.
 &HT;    ``They are very pleasant human beings,'' the easy-going Gaetti
says. ``Now there are a lot more Latin players and a lot more Asian
players. And I guess that's good because we are trying to get
global with baseball.''

 By NAT IRVIN II  
 &HT;    What if the United States and the rest of the world were at the
beginning of a period of change _ an economic expansion driven by
technological progress that would literally dwarf the magnitude of
the Industrial Revolution? If this were true, what would the
implications be for African-Americans?
 &HT;    One way to understand the future is by learning to make up
stories about the future through scenarios. Scenarios are a way of
organizing what we already know (what we've learned from the past),
while encouraging different perspectives on what the future might
hold.
 &HT;    Gerald Harris, of Global Business Network, a San Francisco-based
planning organization, uses scenarios. Harris says that telling
stories about the future can be a very important tool for the
African-American community as a way of seeing the future now, not
later.
 &HT;    ``We can't win the race by looking to see who is coming up from
behind and who is running beside us. We must also see who is in
front of us,'' Harris says.
 &HT;    Futurist thinking is not about predicting the future, but it is
a way of thinking intelligently about how the future might play
out, and making decisions and adjustments today _ in anticipation.
 &HT;    It is also a way of learning from, and interacting with, events
and trends as they unfold and making adjustments when new things
are learned. For example, using scenarios, you can fast-forward to
the year 2025 and then reframe the present by looking backward and
imagining how people in the future might look back on the world
today.
 &HT;    For example, let's ``look back'' from the year 2025. You would
see the American landscape being reshaped by information and
communication technology. It would be a world where the rapid
spread of technology, combined with a world movement toward
capitalistic economic systems, formed an irresistible force of
change and growth.
 &HT;    Looking back, you'd see a world where telecommunications,
biotechnology, nanotechnology and alternative sources of energy had
come together in an era of globalization. It had all come together
to create a long boom of economic expansion with new jobs and new
opportunities.
 &HT;    It was a world in which our ability to communicate with the rest
of the world increased _ faster and broader as the power of the
networked society evolved through communications networks adopted
by nearly one-third of the globe's teen-agers.
 &HT;    This was a world of the networked society where work is varied,
including new work arrangements with employers. There were more
independent contractors used, and there was a big increase in the
speed and scope of transactions and interactions.
 &HT;    It was a world in which AOL gobbled up Time Warner to form a new
company with a market value of about $300 billion. That merger of a
new Internet company and an old media powerhouse brought forth a
new era and was the first of many megamergers of necessity. The
Internet needed content in order to survive, and media companies
wanted to capture a larger audience through personal computers.
 &HT;    It was a world in which identifying and using genetic
information doubled every one or two years, transforming
agriculture, nutrition and health care to create new products in an
emerging life-sciences industry.
 &HT;    In this long-boom scenario of the future, periods of slow
worldwide economic growth are very short and transitional, with no
recessions and no depressions. As to who wins in the long economic
boom to the networked economy, some nations do and some don't.
 &HT;    Every nation that matters _ not just China but Namibia, Ghana,
Nigeria, India, Trinidad and Tobago _ must determine to get on
board this economic train or be left behind in a quickly advancing
game, where being behind can be fatal.
 &HT;    OK, come back to today, April 2000. Ask yourself what are the
implications for the United States in the long-boom scenario? What
are the implications for the African-American community in the
long-boom scenario? What does this mean to you?
 &HT;    The answer, in part, is for African-Americans to take advantage
of the future we envision by reframing the present.
 &HT;    The next generation of African-Americans, according to Harris,
will need to reposition ``the center point of our American
experience beyond the slavery/racist nexus of our past.
 &HT;    ``Black Americans are a diverse group. But as a community, there
will be advantages to forward looking _ a more open vision of
ourselves and our place in America,'' Harris explains. ``What we
are talking about is adding a major plank to our cultural sense of
self.''
 &HT;    We are going to have to change the way we see ourselves, and we
need a tool that allows us to learn to do this. Utilizing the
technique of scenario planning and thinking can help.

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    In the weeks after she snatched a crying Elian Gonzalez from his
relatives' home in Miami's Little Havana, federal immigration agent
Betty A. Mills received repeated death threats.
 &HT;    Mills is the officer who fought her way through a gauntlet of
angry protesters as she struggled to reach a waiting government van
while carrying the 6-year-old boy.
 &HT;    The agent eventually made it to the van, but the raid led to
street riots later that day.
 &HT;    This chaotic and rebellious portrait of our nation's
Cuban-American community, as presented by the world's news media,
has since come to hurt Cuban-Americans.
 &HT;    In Florida, the Elian controversy exacerbated political and
racial rifts between Cuban-Americans and other local groups.
Nationally, the Elian affair exposed longstanding divisions between
Cuban-Americans and other Latinos.
 &HT;    Most notably, the months-long saga highlighted the waning power
of the once seemingly indomitable community of Cuban exiles.
 &HT;    Many Americans _ including a growing number of Cuban-Americans _
believe that conservative Cuban leaders went too far this time in
using Elian to wage their latest political assault against Fidel
Castro, Cuba's communist dictator.
 &HT;    Elena Freyre, director of the Miami office of the Cuban
Committee for Democracy, blames most of the negative publicity her
community has received on the Cuban American National Foundation
(CANF) and its hard-line stance against the Clinton administration.
 &HT;    ``It's been a PR disaster,'' she said. ``In Washington,
traditionally hard-line Cuban-Americans have certainly lost a lot
of power.''
 &HT;    Almost from the moment that immigration agents handed over the
child to his Miami relatives last November, CANF has orchestrated a
relentless legal and public-relations crusade to keep Elian in the
United States.
 &HT;    CANF's efforts have largely backfired, and its ability to shape
U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba has weakened.
 &HT;    But the cracks in the once-unshakable alliance between
conservative Cuban exiles and their supporters in Congress weren't
created by the fight over Elian, said Julia Sweig, deputy director
of Latin-American Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 &HT;    She said the power of conservative exiles began to wane after
the death of CANF's former chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa, in 1997. And
the group's influence was further weakened by Pope John Paul II's
visit to Cuba in 1998. The pontiff's visit, analysts say, helped
soften Castro's international image.
 &HT;    Sweig noted that the Cuban exile lobby has almost always had its
way in Washington. Witness the nearly 40-year economic embargo
against Cuba.
 &HT;    Another powerful lobbying group, however, has been chipping away
at CANF's powerbase in Washington in recent years. A growing number
of U.S. business leaders, especially in the farm industry, now back
proposals to boost trade with Cuba.
 &HT;    Last month, House and Senate committees approved an easing of
the trade embargo, though conservatives and Cuban exile leaders vow
to block the measure's final passage.
 &HT;    Back in Miami, the Elian controversy rocked local politics.
 &HT;    Miami Mayor Joe Carollo fired City Manager Donald Warshaw for
refusing to fire Police Chief William O'Brien. Carollo was furious
that O'Brien did not tell him in advance that the raid was going
down. Carollo wants Elian to remain in the United States.
 &HT;    Tom Fiedler, editorial-page editor of the Miami Herald, says
Carollo's behavior during the Elian affair angered many in Miami.
As a result, the mayor may face a tough challenge if he seeks
reelection.
 &HT;    Many believe the Elian controversy did nothing to help improve
already strained relations between Cuban-Americans and other U.S.
Latinos.
 &HT;    A California group representing mostly Mexican and Central
American immigrants marched to protest the ``special treatment''
granted Cuban emigres. Unlike other immigrants, Cubans who reach
U.S. soil automatically receive permanent legal status.
 &HT;    Observers also note that the nation's leading Latino advocacy
organizations never publicly sided with CANF or the boy's Miami
relatives.
 &HT;    Lisa Navarette, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La
Raza, says her group did not get involved in CANF's battle with the
feds because the issue didn't resonate with NCLR's Latino
constituency.
 &HT;    The Elian dispute, she said, wasn't a ``Latino issue.''
 &HT;    Navarette also noted that conservative Cuban exile groups,
including CANF, have rarely supported NCLR's pan-Latino agenda,
including its stances on issues such as immigration or bilingual
education.
 &HT;    I asked Navarette if she thought CANF's power in Washington has
been waning. She said CANF and its allies continue to wield
substantial influence in Washington, though she believes the tide
has changed.
 &HT;    In Navarette's words: ``I think we are in a different time.''
 &HT;    She's right. It's time for Elian to go home and for
Cuban-Americans to let the country know that CANF and its
right-wing allies do not speak for the entire community.

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Every time I chat with Mrs. Alpha Robertson, I am reminded by
her voice and overall demeanor that I am in the presence of an
ignored chapter in American social history. She is the embodiment
of the historic travail of black parents who lived during the era
of lynch rule in the South.
 &HT;    In the South there was once a truism among blacks stating that
regardless of what parents did for their children, they always was
the albatross of the lynch mob.
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson, 81, is the mother of Carole Robertson, one of
the four teenage girls murdered when racists bombed Birmingham's
black 16th Street Baptist church in 1963. I've maintained a great
friendship with Mrs. Robertson since I first interviewed her in
Chicago over 15 years ago.
 &HT;    Recently, I spoke by phone with Mrs. Robertson following the
announcement by the State of Alabama that two alleged Klu Klux
Klansmen had been indicted for the murder of her child. The nature
of the conversation required me to consider my words carefully.
There could be no lightweight reporters' banter: ``Will you be glad
if the two alleged Klansmen are sentenced to the chair?''
 &HT;    Yet, the temptation to dwell on the superficial was offered. One
of the indicted reportedly had said that his ``only regret's that
the black church was not filled'' when the bomb exploded.
 &HT;    This heartless statement represents an age-old, pervasive,
antihuman attitude that black parents once had to endure whenever
their children left their doorsteps. It also represents the
mentality that once gave lynch mobs a degree of acceptability
throughout the land _ not just in the South.
 &HT;    Despite over 4,742 lynchings from 1909 through 1968, as recorded
by the NAACP, the U.S. Congress remained silent for decades, even
though 1,297 of the hanging victims had been white. Congress
refused to pass any antilynching legislation until after World War
II, when the annual statistics for lynchings had dropped to single
digits.
 &HT;    But don't confuse the lynching of blacks with the hanging of
whites. A black lynching usually expressed a ritualized worship of
racial supremacy. Frequently lynchers dressed in their Sunday best
or wore old army attire from the Spanish American War or World War
I. The lynchers and attendant mob carried the Confederate war flag,
as though brutalizing blacks was an act of patriotism.
 &HT;    Some of the mob even fought for charred souvenirs such as toes,
fingers, and in some instances, burnt genitals for display at
country stores and barbershops.
 &HT;    The tolerance of lynching represented a national and regional
sickness. This sickness can be witnessed today in those who
advocate Confederate flags flying over state capitol grounds.
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson and I strongly favor justice finally prevailing
in solutions to old murders, but we are also largely concerned
about changes in old attitudes. We detect a modicum of hope in the
singular fact that the State of Alabama is trying to correct at
least one of its sins of the past.
 &HT;    As we talked, I recalled a conversation we had one evening over
20 years ago when I was visiting Montgomery, Ala. The phone rang
and an unannounced voice spoke as though it was old friend. ``Hey,
Vernon, how you doin', fella,'' the voice said. ``Your friend Alvin
(black Alabama Rep. Alvin Holmes), told me you were in town ... Any
thing you need?''
 &HT;    I couldn't detect the drawl until the man said ``This is George,
you know me, the governor. I jess wanted to know if everything was
all right.''
 &HT;    Gov. Wallace went on to talk about how he had changed, and how
``we all had to change, no doubt about it.'' Wallace said ``we know
we didn't treat colored people right, and so does everybody.''
 &HT;    I turned down Gov. Wallace's offer of transportation to the
airport, but I conceded to myself that times had changed at some
level in the South. I couldn't resist remembering that in 1963
Wallace stood at the entrance of the University of Alabama and
drawled, ``I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow and
segregation forever.''
 &HT;    Nor could I clear from memory the spiritual climate of 1963 when
those four girls were slain and two black boys were killed the same
day _ one shot by a cop in Birmingham. I also recalled a white
civil rights marcher named William L. Moore of Baltimore who was
shot to death near Attalla, Ala., and that in Jackson, Miss.,
Medgar Evers was assassinated for trying to register blacks to
vote.
 TAKING DOWN THE CONFEDERATE FLAG  
 &HT;    Mrs. Robertson and I recognize the significance of this singular
initiative coming from the State of Alabama. Indeed, it should
proceed with serious intent. A sector of Alabama, like Gov.
Wallace, has become clearly aware of the power of the black ballot.
Martyrs such as Martin Luther King Jr., Evers and so many others
did not die in vain.
 &HT;    However, delayed indictments of old culprits will never truly
compensate noble souls like retired school teacher Alpha Robertson
or the ghost of her late educator husband Alvin Robertson Sr. whose
biggest sin was sending their pretty little child ``all dressed
up'' to die in Sunday School.

 By ED ODEVEN  
 &HT;    Sang-Hoon Lee stands out in more ways than one. The 29-year-old
pitcher from Seoul is on the verge of becoming the first man in
history to play in the elite levels of professional baseball in
Korea, Japan and the United States. Lee signed a two-year contract
with the Boston Red Sox in January and at press time appeared to be
slated as the No. 2 lefty in the Red Sox bullpen behind veteran
Rheal Cormier.
 &HT;    Oh, and then there's his famous shoulder-length, bushy
reddish-brown hair that has earned him the nickname ``Samson'' _ a
reference to the Biblical warrior with impressive physical prowess.
 &HT;    Lee has also accomplished what few pitchers have done: excel as
a starter and closer. In 1995, he had a 20-5 record as a starter
and earned the Korean Most Valuable Player honors. Two years later,
Lee saved 37 games, and was chosen as the relief pitcher of the
year.
 &HT;    Last season, he had a 6-5 record and a 2.83 earned run average
(ERA) while pitching for the Chunichi Dragons in Japan. In 95.1
innings, Lee struck out 65 batters and walked 30 in 36 appearances.
 &HT;    These numbers and past accolades, however, don't mean much to
Lee nowadays.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to put too much meaning in them,'' Lee said
through interpreter Seung-hyun Park before a recent exhibition game
against the visiting Minnesota Twins at Wilbur ``Billy'' Smith
Field in Fort Myers, Fla. ``I just want to do my best and not think
about the past.''
 &HT;    Lee adds his main goal for this season is to earn a spot on
Boston's 25-man roster and stick around to contribute all season.
 &HT;    Joining Lee at the Red Sox training camp are fellow Koreans Jin
Ho Cho and Sun-Woo Kim. Cho split last season with Boston's
Triple-A Pawtucket team (9-3 with a 3.45 ERA and 80 strikeouts in
109.2 innings), and also appeared in nine games with the Red Sox,
posting a 2-3 record in 39.1 innings of work.
 &HT;    Kim, a 22-year-old from Inchon, was 9-8 with a 4.89 ERA in 26
games last season all starts for Double-A Trenton. The
hard-throwing right-hander fanned 130 batters and yielded just 44
base on balls in 149 innings.
 &HT;    According to Lee, the duos' presence in Ft. Myers has made his
transition to America easier.
 &HT;    ``It's been very beneficial to have Jin Ho Cho and Sun Kim
here.''
 &HT;    During his brief stay in the United States, Lee says the Red Sox
coaches haven't asked him to alter his pitching style. So, what
should baseball fans expect from Lee this season?
 &HT;    ``He's somebody we are looking for to get out left-handers in
key situations,'' teammate Mike Stanley says.
 &HT;    Certainly that's an important role for a team yearning to
overtake the lefty-loaded New York Yankees as the American League
East's premier ballclub this season. Wendell Kim, Boston's third
base coach, says in limited playing time Lee has made a favorable
impression with the organization.
 &HT;    ``It looks like he can handle himself. He might be able to get
you out with his pitches' change of speeds,'' he says.
 &HT;    After a respectable stint in the big leagues last summer, Cho
appears ready to crack the starting rotation on a full-time basis
as well.
 &HT;    ``He's obviously battling for that number five spot,'' Stanley
says. ``He gave us some good quality innings last year coming up.
He's got pretty good experience and knows what it takes to compete
and win at this level.''
 &HT;    Minnesota Twins manager Tom Kelly believes Cho is progressing as
a productive hurler.
 &HT;    ``He seems like a guy that's sort of learning and making the
transition. I'm sure it's a challenge for him to come over here and
pitch, especially at this level,'' says Kelly, who guided the Twins
to thrilling seven-game World Series triumphs in 1987 and 1991.
 &HT;    ``I think he's handled it well. He seems to be pretty composed
on the mound and I'm sure it s quite a learning experience. You've
got to admire that and take your hat off to the young man for
trying.''
 &HT;    While observing the 20-plus pitchers during spring training,
Wendell Kim notices Sun Kim has the necessary skills to succeed.
 &HT;    ``He's around the plate. He's got a good presence on the mound.
He looks poised. Nothing seems to rattle him,'' Wendell Kim
reports.
 &HT;    Gary Gaetti, who broke into the majors with the Twins in 1982
and is currently fighting for a spot on the Red Sox roster, says
Lee, Cho and Kim have become welcome additions during the
Grapefruit League season.
 &HT;    ``They are very pleasant human beings,'' the easy-going Gaetti
says. ``Now there are a lot more Latin players and a lot more Asian
players. And I guess that's good because we are trying to get
global with baseball.''

 By NAT IRVIN II  
 &HT;    What if the United States and the rest of the world were at the
beginning of a period of change _ an economic expansion driven by
technological progress that would literally dwarf the magnitude of
the Industrial Revolution? If this were true, what would the
implications be for African-Americans?
 &HT;    One way to understand the future is by learning to make up
stories about the future through scenarios. Scenarios are a way of
organizing what we already know (what we've learned from the past),
while encouraging different perspectives on what the future might
hold.
 &HT;    Gerald Harris, of Global Business Network, a San Francisco-based
planning organization, uses scenarios. Harris says that telling
stories about the future can be a very important tool for the
African-American community as a way of seeing the future now, not
later.
 &HT;    ``We can't win the race by looking to see who is coming up from
behind and who is running beside us. We must also see who is in
front of us,'' Harris says.
 &HT;    Futurist thinking is not about predicting the future, but it is
a way of thinking intelligently about how the future might play
out, and making decisions and adjustments today _ in anticipation.
 &HT;    It is also a way of learning from, and interacting with, events
and trends as they unfold and making adjustments when new things
are learned. For example, using scenarios, you can fast-forward to
the year 2025 and then reframe the present by looking backward and
imagining how people in the future might look back on the world
today.
 &HT;    For example, let's ``look back'' from the year 2025. You would
see the American landscape being reshaped by information and
communication technology. It would be a world where the rapid
spread of technology, combined with a world movement toward
capitalistic economic systems, formed an irresistible force of
change and growth.
 &HT;    Looking back, you'd see a world where telecommunications,
biotechnology, nanotechnology and alternative sources of energy had
come together in an era of globalization. It had all come together
to create a long boom of economic expansion with new jobs and new
opportunities.
 &HT;    It was a world in which our ability to communicate with the rest
of the world increased _ faster and broader as the power of the
networked society evolved through communications networks adopted
by nearly one-third of the globe's teen-agers.
 &HT;    This was a world of the networked society where work is varied,
including new work arrangements with employers. There were more
independent contractors used, and there was a big increase in the
speed and scope of transactions and interactions.
 &HT;    It was a world in which AOL gobbled up Time Warner to form a new
company with a market value of about $300 billion. That merger of a
new Internet company and an old media powerhouse brought forth a
new era and was the first of many megamergers of necessity. The
Internet needed content in order to survive, and media companies
wanted to capture a larger audience through personal computers.
 &HT;    It was a world in which identifying and using genetic
information doubled every one or two years, transforming
agriculture, nutrition and health care to create new products in an
emerging life-sciences industry.
 &HT;    In this long-boom scenario of the future, periods of slow
worldwide economic growth are very short and transitional, with no
recessions and no depressions. As to who wins in the long economic
boom to the networked economy, some nations do and some don't.
 &HT;    Every nation that matters _ not just China but Namibia, Ghana,
Nigeria, India, Trinidad and Tobago _ must determine to get on
board this economic train or be left behind in a quickly advancing
game, where being behind can be fatal.
 &HT;    OK, come back to today, April 2000. Ask yourself what are the
implications for the United States in the long-boom scenario? What
are the implications for the African-American community in the
long-boom scenario? What does this mean to you?
 &HT;    The answer, in part, is for African-Americans to take advantage
of the future we envision by reframing the present.
 &HT;    The next generation of African-Americans, according to Harris,
will need to reposition ``the center point of our American
experience beyond the slavery/racist nexus of our past.
 &HT;    ``Black Americans are a diverse group. But as a community, there
will be advantages to forward looking _ a more open vision of
ourselves and our place in America,'' Harris explains. ``What we
are talking about is adding a major plank to our cultural sense of
self.''
 &HT;    We are going to have to change the way we see ourselves, and we
need a tool that allows us to learn to do this. Utilizing the
technique of scenario planning and thinking can help.

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    In the weeks after she snatched a crying Elian Gonzalez from his
relatives' home in Miami's Little Havana, federal immigration agent
Betty A. Mills received repeated death threats.
 &HT;    Mills is the officer who fought her way through a gauntlet of
angry protesters as she struggled to reach a waiting government van
while carrying the 6-year-old boy.
 &HT;    The agent eventually made it to the van, but the raid led to
street riots later that day.
 &HT;    This chaotic and rebellious portrait of our nation's
Cuban-American community, as presented by the world's news media,
has since come to hurt Cuban-Americans.
 &HT;    In Florida, the Elian controversy exacerbated political and
racial rifts between Cuban-Americans and other local groups.
Nationally, the Elian affair exposed longstanding divisions between
Cuban-Americans and other Latinos.
 &HT;    Most notably, the months-long saga highlighted the waning power
of the once seemingly indomitable community of Cuban exiles.
 &HT;    Many Americans _ including a growing number of Cuban-Americans _
believe that conservative Cuban leaders went too far this time in
using Elian to wage their latest political assault against Fidel
Castro, Cuba's communist dictator.
 &HT;    Elena Freyre, director of the Miami office of the Cuban
Committee for Democracy, blames most of the negative publicity her
community has received on the Cuban American National Foundation
(CANF) and its hard-line stance against the Clinton administration.
 &HT;    ``It's been a PR disaster,'' she said. ``In Washington,
traditionally hard-line Cuban-Americans have certainly lost a lot
of power.''
 &HT;    Almost from the moment that immigration agents handed over the
child to his Miami relatives last November, CANF has orchestrated a
relentless legal and public-relations crusade to keep Elian in the
United States.
 &HT;    CANF's efforts have largely backfired, and its ability to shape
U.S. foreign policy toward Cuba has weakened.
 &HT;    But the cracks in the once-unshakable alliance between
conservative Cuban exiles and their supporters in Congress weren't
created by the fight over Elian, said Julia Sweig, deputy director
of Latin-American Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 &HT;    She said the power of conservative exiles began to wane after
the death of CANF's former chairman, Jorge Mas Canosa, in 1997. And
the group's influence was further weakened by Pope John Paul II's
visit to Cuba in 1998. The pontiff's visit, analysts say, helped
soften Castro's international image.
 &HT;    Sweig noted that the Cuban exile lobby has almost always had its
way in Washington. Witness the nearly 40-year economic embargo
against Cuba.
 &HT;    Another powerful lobbying group, however, has been chipping away
at CANF's powerbase in Washington in recent years. A growing number
of U.S. business leaders, especially in the farm industry, now back
proposals to boost trade with Cuba.
 &HT;    Last month, House and Senate committees approved an easing of
the trade embargo, though conservatives and Cuban exile leaders vow
to block the measure's final passage.
 &HT;    Back in Miami, the Elian controversy rocked local politics.
 &HT;    Miami Mayor Joe Carollo fired City Manager Donald Warshaw for
refusing to fire Police Chief William O'Brien. Carollo was furious
that O'Brien did not tell him in advance that the raid was going
down. Carollo wants Elian to remain in the United States.
 &HT;    Tom Fiedler, editorial-page editor of the Miami Herald, says
Carollo's behavior during the Elian affair angered many in Miami.
As a result, the mayor may face a tough challenge if he seeks
reelection.
 &HT;    Many believe the Elian controversy did nothing to help improve
already strained relations between Cuban-Americans and other U.S.
Latinos.
 &HT;    A California group representing mostly Mexican and Central
American immigrants marched to protest the ``special treatment''
granted Cuban emigres. Unlike other immigrants, Cubans who reach
U.S. soil automatically receive permanent legal status.
 &HT;    Observers also note that the nation's leading Latino advocacy
organizations never publicly sided with CANF or the boy's Miami
relatives.
 &HT;    Lisa Navarette, a spokeswoman for the National Council of La
Raza, says her group did not get involved in CANF's battle with the
feds because the issue didn't resonate with NCLR's Latino
constituency.
 &HT;    The Elian dispute, she said, wasn't a ``Latino issue.''
 &HT;    Navarette also noted that conservative Cuban exile groups,
including CANF, have rarely supported NCLR's pan-Latino agenda,
including its stances on issues such as immigration or bilingual
education.
 &HT;    I asked Navarette if she thought CANF's power in Washington has
been waning. She said CANF and its allies continue to wield
substantial influence in Washington, though she believes the tide
has changed.
 &HT;    In Navarette's words: ``I think we are in a different time.''
 &HT;    She's right. It's time for Elian to go home and for
Cuban-Americans to let the country know that CANF and its
right-wing allies do not speak for the entire community.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Vision so dominates our perception that we give precedence to
what our eyes tell us _ even when that information contradicts more
accurate data coming from other senses.
 &HT;    When you watch television, for example, dialogue seems to emerge
from the actors' mouths, not the set's speakers.
 &HT;    And although many mammals overindulge their eyes as we do, a
few, such as bats and dolphins, navigate by sonar, emitting clicks,
chirps and grunts and using the echoes to determine the location of
things around them.
 &HT;    Sonar may seem a bizarre method of finding one's way, but humans
can be surprisingly good at it. Blind people, for instance,
navigate pretty well by listening to echoes from the tapping of
their canes. We can locate where sounds originate because we have
two ears and a brain that automatically analyzes differences in the
timing and intensity of sounds.
 &HT;    When a noise is closer to one ear than the other, its acoustic
energy will reach that ear faster and louder than the other ear.
Try these experiments to see how well your brain extracts location
from time and intensity cues.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    With a friend, 10 feet of string, a nine-inch square of
cardboard, a straight pin, a soda straw and some tape, make a
``sound locator'' as shown in the accompanying photo. Make sure the
string rests on top of the cardboard and that the straw and the
string don't touch.
 &HT;    Sit in a large, quiet room with your eyes shut and your head
facing forward, holding the locator in front of you. Your friend
grasps the loose end of the string and stands 10 feet away at seven
different points: directly in front of you at 12 (as on the face of
a clock) and near but not exactly at 9, 10, 11, 1, 2 and 3 _ but in
random sequence.
 &HT;    At each new position, your friend sings a single note _ bong _
for two seconds in the lowest pitch he or she can muster. Be
careful that your friend doesn't tug the string too hard _ it will
give her location away.
 &HT;    Point the short end of the straw in the direction you think the
bong came from. Then open your eyes and note if the straw and the
string agree. The difference between the two marks represents the
degree of accuracy with which you locate each sound.
 &HT;    Now repeat the experiment at each of the seven positions _ only
this time have your partner emit a loud click with his or her
tongue and palate. Switch places with your accomplice and compare
performances.
 &HT;    If you're like most people, your errors were small but probably
increased as the bongs and clicks moved farther away from 12. You
should have done better with the clicks, which carry a wider range
of tones for acoustic neurons to work with.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    While voicing bongs in experiment 1, you might have noticed that
the person holding the locator tilted his head. Some blind people _
or those who are deaf in one ear _ do this because the head
rotation provides the brain with information about the intensity of
sounds and their arrival times from different positions, making
noise localization more accurate.
 &HT;    Now, have your friend repeat the bong and click experiment while
you hold the locator. Move your head quickly from side to side to
see if this reduces localization errors. Switch positions and
repeat.
 &HT;    Paying close attention to theacoustic world can help you get
around better in the dark and keep your brain healthy by vigorously
exercising seldom-used auditory pathways.
 &HT;    Visit www.discover.com/brainworks for more sound effects that
exploit time/intensity differences _ but with a riveting third
dimension guaranteed to astonish you.

 (Three color slides are available.) 
 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Aside from hid dancing left foot, Anthony Curtis, 42, looks like
any other sucker tourist dropping a wad at the Binion's Horseshoe
blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hair slicked back, nose busted twice from rugby, left hand
curled around his second imported beer _ not water, a dead giveaway
for card-counters _ he seems wound tighter than most, maybe, but
inside the bounds. After three minutes of play, he's down $100.
 &HT;    He's seems distracted by the waitress's cleavage and acts
surprised when his luck turns.
 &HT;    ``My God, this never happens,'' he murmurs as he flips a natural
21: a 10 of hearts and ace of diamonds.
 &HT;    Next two hands, he stands on 17 and 18. The dealer busts both
times. Now he's up $150 _ ``Better quit,'' he says, clumsily
scooping up 12 green chips and striding to the cashout cage. The
pit boss _ whose job it is to spot counters _ smiles and waves at
him. The dealer doesn't even look up.
 &HT;    While Curtis did his dumb-luck shtick above the table, the real
action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.
 &HT;    Standing shoulder to shoulder with the hapless hordes, Curtis
represents the tiny coterie of mathematically talented, driven,
inconspicuous gamblers who methodically drub the casinos at their
own games.
 &HT;    Even those who don't plan to go pro can learn from the new
gambling elite and turn a potentially impoverishing vacation into a
profitable experience.
 &HT;    ``To figure this stuff out is just very alluring to someone like
me,'' says Olaf Vancura, a casino-game creator with a Ph.D. in
physics and the author of ``Knock-Out Blackjack,'' a new
card-counting system that's within the reach of the average
intellect.
 &HT;    Winning over the long haul demands research, stamina, nerve and
no small measure of acting ability, but the principal requisite is
a rock-solid grounding in probability.
 &HT;    Curtis estimates that 99 percent of what's offered in casinos
and other legal betting venues is what he terms negative
expectation games, meaning that over the long haul, the house will
harvest anywhere from 1 percent to 60 percent of money gambled.
 &HT;    The average bettor accepts his skinning because he imagines the
house odds are insurmountable. The average bettor is wrong. People
always say, ``Who pays for the lights in Las Vegas?'' observes Jean
Scott, a 61-year-old video-poker-playing grandmother who, with her
husband, Brad, earned enough in two years to purchase their Las
Vegas condo. ``All I know is, I don't.''
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    The books that inspired Curtis grew out of a flowering of
scientific gambling analysis that began with ``The Optimum Strategy
in Blackjack,'' an article printed in the September 1956 issue of
the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
 &HT;    Four Army mathematicians, known today as the Baldwin group,
demonstrated how to play each hand to maximize winning potential,
proving that a player who followed their program in a single-deck
game would, over time, be virtually even with the house. That made
blackjack by far the most advantageous casino game to play.
 &HT;    But the giant of blackjack theory, and nearly a god to young
Curtis, was MIT mathematics professor Edward 0. Thorp, who
published ``Beat the Dealer'' in 1962.
 &HT;    The Baldwin group had focused on how to optimize play using each
hand's visible cards, reckoning that card-counting was impractical.
Thorp's twin breakthroughs, bolstered by then-nascent computer
calculation, were that smart folks could learn to count cards as
they were played and that, in doing so, these gamblers could gain a
consistent advantage over the house.
 &HT;    On his own, day after day, Curtis practiced card-counting until
his brain ached and his fingers were raw. At 21, he turned his back
on a UCLA wrestling scholarship, moved to Las Vegas, bellied up to
the Sahara's blackjack pit and put his $1,800 life's savings on the
line.
 &HT;    ``The first night, I won $22. The second day, I lost $900. At
the table, I started hyperventilating. Then I got physically
sick.''
 &HT;    Curtis had slammed into the brutal reality of fluctuation around
the average return, or what statisticians call standard deviation.
Although an astute blackjack card counter can, over the long haul,
realize up to a 1.5 percent profit (depending on such variables as
the number of decks, which card-counting system he employs and how

last for weeks. There's a saying: If you can't stand the flux,
don't bet the bucks. Many technically proficient blackjack counters
have been run out by flux.
 &HT;    An elegant mathematical expression of standard deviation's power
in gaming is the so-called risk of ruin, which establishes the
likelihood that a particular bankroll will go to zero before it
doubles.
 &HT;    According to calculations by Vancura, a blackjack card-counter
playing with a 101.11 percent expected return (the expectation of
one version of his card-counting system) and a bankroll that's just
25 times the minimum bet has close to a 47 percent chance of going
broke before doubling his money.
 &HT;    To drop the likelihood of going broke to, say, .5 percent
requires a bankroll 1,000 times larger than the game's minimum
wager; in a $5 to $25 game, that's $5,000.
 &HT;    Chastened, Curtis returned to the real world, first as a
stockbroker, then as the smallest bouncer in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    The lean years ended when Stanford Wong _ the nom de guerre of a
statistics and finance professor who relishes anonymity _ enlisted
Curtis to play tournament blackjack. Financed by Wong, Curtis was
free to make the big bets that would harvest big money.
 &HT;    After he retired from tournament play, Curtis set up his
publishing house. Today, while still winning a sizable return in
his off-hours, he reigns over a stable of authors in his growing
library of gambling science.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    Even if Vancura's simplified card-counting book achieves
best-seller status, as Thorp's did, the lights will likely keep
blazing just as fiercely in the desert and along the boardwalk and
in the Indian casinos and on the riverboats and aboard the ocean
liners.
 &HT;    Curtis and Vancura seem appalled at the apathy and ignorance of
the average gambler. Successful gambling is unquestionably
possible, and someday, they hope, the fleeced hordes will decide
they've lost enough.
 &HT;    Someday casino profits may shrink from the obscene to the merely
respectable, and the successes of those who win through
intellectual effort rather than luck may inspire a newfound
appreciation for the beauty, wonder and irresistible power of
probability.
 &HT;    But don't bet on it.

 (Three color slides are available.) 
 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Aside from hid dancing left foot, Anthony Curtis, 42, looks like
any other sucker tourist dropping a wad at the Binion's Horseshoe
blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hair slicked back, nose busted twice from rugby, left hand
curled around his second imported beer _ not water, a dead giveaway
for card-counters _ he seems wound tighter than most, maybe, but
inside the bounds. After three minutes of play, he's down $100.
 &HT;    He's seems distracted by the waitress's cleavage and acts
surprised when his luck turns.
 &HT;    ``My God, this never happens,'' he murmurs as he flips a natural
21: a 10 of hearts and ace of diamonds.
 &HT;    Next two hands, he stands on 17 and 18. The dealer busts both
times. Now he's up $150 _ ``Better quit,'' he says, clumsily
scooping up 12 green chips and striding to the cashout cage. The
pit boss _ whose job it is to spot counters _ smiles and waves at
him. The dealer doesn't even look up.
 &HT;    While Curtis did his dumb-luck shtick above the table, the real
action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.
 &HT;    Standing shoulder to shoulder with the hapless hordes, Curtis
represents the tiny coterie of mathematically talented, driven,
inconspicuous gamblers who methodically drub the casinos at their
own games.
 &HT;    Even those who don't plan to go pro can learn from the new
gambling elite and turn a potentially impoverishing vacation into a
profitable experience.
 &HT;    ``To figure this stuff out is just very alluring to someone like
me,'' says Olaf Vancura, a casino-game creator with a Ph.D. in
physics and the author of ``Knock-Out Blackjack,'' a new
card-counting system that's within the reach of the average
intellect.
 &HT;    Winning over the long haul demands research, stamina, nerve and
no small measure of acting ability, but the principal requisite is
a rock-solid grounding in probability.
 &HT;    Curtis estimates that 99 percent of what's offered in casinos
and other legal betting venues is what he terms negative
expectation games, meaning that over the long haul, the house will
harvest anywhere from 1 percent to 60 percent of money gambled.
 &HT;    The average bettor accepts his skinning because he imagines the
house odds are insurmountable. The average bettor is wrong. People
always say, ``Who pays for the lights in Las Vegas?'' observes Jean
Scott, a 61-year-old video-poker-playing grandmother who, with her
husband, Brad, earned enough in two years to purchase their Las
Vegas condo. ``All I know is, I don't.''
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    The books that inspired Curtis grew out of a flowering of
scientific gambling analysis that began with ``The Optimum Strategy
in Blackjack,'' an article printed in the September 1956 issue of
the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
 &HT;    Four Army mathematicians, known today as the Baldwin group,
demonstrated how to play each hand to maximize winning potential,
proving that a player who followed their program in a single-deck
game would, over time, be virtually even with the house. That made
blackjack by far the most advantageous casino game to play.
 &HT;    But the giant of blackjack theory, and nearly a god to young
Curtis, was MIT mathematics professor Edward 0. Thorp, who
published ``Beat the Dealer'' in 1962.
 &HT;    The Baldwin group had focused on how to optimize play using each
hand's visible cards, reckoning that card-counting was impractical.
Thorp's twin breakthroughs, bolstered by then-nascent computer
calculation, were that smart folks could learn to count cards as
they were played and that, in doing so, these gamblers could gain a
consistent advantage over the house.
 &HT;    On his own, day after day, Curtis practiced card-counting until
his brain ached and his fingers were raw. At 21, he turned his back
on a UCLA wrestling scholarship, moved to Las Vegas, bellied up to
the Sahara's blackjack pit and put his $1,800 life's savings on the
line.
 &HT;    ``The first night, I won $22. The second day, I lost $900. At
the table, I started hyperventilating. Then I got physically
sick.''
 &HT;    Curtis had slammed into the brutal reality of fluctuation around
the average return, or what statisticians call standard deviation.
Although an astute blackjack card counter can, over the long haul,
realize up to a 1.5 percent profit (depending on such variables as
the number of decks, which card-counting system he employs and how
many cards remain before the dealer reshuffles), losing streaks can
last for weeks. There's a saying: If you can't stand the flux,
don't bet the bucks. Many technically proficient blackjack counters
have been run out by flux.
 &HT;    An elegant mathematical expression of standard deviation's power
in gaming is the so-called risk of ruin, which establishes the
likelihood that a particular bankroll will go to zero before it
doubles.
 &HT;    According to calculations by Vancura, a blackjack card-counter
playing with a 101.11 percent expected return (the expectation of
one version of his card-counting system) and a bankroll that's just
25 times the minimum bet has close to a 47 percent chance of going
broke before doubling his money.
 &HT;    To drop the likelihood of going broke to, say, .5 percent
requires a bankroll 1,000 times larger than the game's minimum
wager; in a $5 to $25 game, that's $5,000.
 &HT;    Chastened, Curtis returned to the real world, first as a
stockbroker, then as the smallest bouncer in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    The lean years ended when Stanford Wong _ the nom de guerre of a
statistics and finance professor who relishes anonymity _ enlisted
Curtis to play tournament blackjack. Financed by Wong, Curtis was
free to make the big bets that would harvest big money.
 &HT;    After he retired from tournament play, Curtis set up his
publishing house. Today, while still winning a sizable return in
his off-hours, he reigns over a stable of authors in his growing
library of gambling science.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    Even if Vancura's simplified card-counting book achieves
best-seller status, as Thorp's did, the lights will likely keep
blazing just as fiercely in the desert and along the boardwalk and
in the Indian casinos and on the riverboats and aboard the ocean
liners.
 &HT;    Curtis and Vancura seem appalled at the apathy and ignorance of
the average gambler. Successful gambling is unquestionably
possible, and someday, they hope, the fleeced hordes will decide
they've lost enough.
 &HT;    Someday casino profits may shrink from the obscene to the merely
respectable, and the successes of those who win through
intellectual effort rather than luck may inspire a newfound
appreciation for the beauty, wonder and irresistible power of
probability.
 &HT;    But don't bet on it.

 By ERIC HASELTINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Vision so dominates our perception that we give precedence to
what our eyes tell us _ even when that information contradicts more
accurate data coming from other senses.
 &HT;    When you watch television, for example, dialogue seems to emerge
from the actors' mouths, not the set's speakers.
 &HT;    And although many mammals overindulge their eyes as we do, a
few, such as bats and dolphins, navigate by sonar, emitting clicks,
chirps and grunts and using the echoes to determine the location of
things around them.
 &HT;    Sonar may seem a bizarre method of finding one's way, but humans
can be surprisingly good at it. Blind people, for instance,
navigate pretty well by listening to echoes from the tapping of
their canes. We can locate where sounds originate because we have
two ears and a brain that automatically analyzes differences in the
timing and intensity of sounds.
 &HT;    When a noise is closer to one ear than the other, its acoustic
energy will reach that ear faster and louder than the other ear.
Try these experiments to see how well your brain extracts location
from time and intensity cues.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 1  
 &HT;    With a friend, 10 feet of string, a nine-inch square of
cardboard, a straight pin, a soda straw and some tape, make a
``sound locator'' as shown in the accompanying photo. Make sure the
string rests on top of the cardboard and that the straw and the
string don't touch.
 &HT;    Sit in a large, quiet room with your eyes shut and your head
facing forward, holding the locator in front of you. Your friend
grasps the loose end of the string and stands 10 feet away at seven
different points: directly in front of you at 12 (as on the face of
a clock) and near but not exactly at 9, 10, 11, 1, 2 and 3 _ but in
random sequence.
 &HT;    At each new position, your friend sings a single note _ bong _
for two seconds in the lowest pitch he or she can muster. Be
careful that your friend doesn't tug the string too hard _ it will
give her location away.
 &HT;    Point the short end of the straw in the direction you think the
bong came from. Then open your eyes and note if the straw and the
string agree. The difference between the two marks represents the
degree of accuracy with which you locate each sound.
 &HT;    Now repeat the experiment at each of the seven positions _ only
this time have your partner emit a loud click with his or her
tongue and palate. Switch places with your accomplice and compare
performances.
 &HT;    If you're like most people, your errors were small but probably
increased as the bongs and clicks moved farther away from 12. You
should have done better with the clicks, which carry a wider range
of tones for acoustic neurons to work with.
 &HT;    
 EXPERIMENT 2  
 &HT;    While voicing bongs in experiment 1, you might have noticed that
the person holding the locator tilted his head. Some blind people _
or those who are deaf in one ear _ do this because the head
rotation provides the brain with information about the intensity of
sounds and their arrival times from different positions, making
noise localization more accurate.
 &HT;    Now, have your friend repeat the bong and click experiment while
you hold the locator. Move your head quickly from side to side to
see if this reduces localization errors. Switch positions and
repeat.
 &HT;    Paying close attention to the acoustic world can help you get
around better in the dark and keep your brain healthy by vigorously
exercising seldom-used auditory pathways.
 &HT;    Visit www.discover.com/brainworks for more sound effects that
exploit time/intensity differences _ but with a riveting third
dimension guaranteed to astonish you.

action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.
 &HT;    Standing shoulder to shoulder with the hapless hordes, Curtis
represents the tiny coterie of mathematically talented, driven,
inconspicuous gamblers who methodically drub the casinos at their
own games.
 &HT;    Even those who don't plan to go pro can learn from the new
gambling elite and turn a potentially impoverishing vacation into a
profitable experience.
 &HT;    ``To figure this stuff out is just very alluring to someone like
me,'' says Olaf Vancura, a casino-game creator with a Ph.D. in
physics and the author of ``Knock-Out Blackjack,'' a new
card-counting system that's within the reach of the average
intellect.
 &HT;    Winning over the long haul demands research, stamina, nerve and
no small measure of acting ability, but the principal requisite is
a rock-solid grounding in probability.
 &HT;    Curtis estimates that 99 percent of what's offered in casinos
and other legal betting venues is what he terms negative
expectation games, meaning that over the long haul, the house will
harvest anywhere from 1 percent to 60 percent of money gambled.
 &HT;    The average bettor accepts his skinning because he imagines the
house odds are insurmountable. The average bettor is wrong. People
always say, ``Who pays for the lights in Las Vegas?'' observes Jean
Scott, a 61-year-old video-poker-playing grandmother who, with her
husband, Brad, earned enough in two years to purchase their Las
Vegas condo. ``All I know is, I don't.''
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    The books that inspired Curtis grew out of a flowering of
scientific gambling analysis that began with ``The Optimum Strategy
in Blackjack,'' an article printed in the September 1956 issue of
the Journal of the American Statistical Association.
 &HT;    Four Army mathematicians, known today as the Baldwin group,
demonstrated how to play each hand to maximize winning potential,
proving that a player who followed their program in a single-deck
game would, over time, be virtually even with the house. That made
blackjack by far the most advantageous casino game to play.
 &HT;    But the giant of blackjack theory, and nearly a god to young
Curtis, was MIT mathematics professor Edward 0. Thorp, who
published ``Beat the Dealer'' in 1962.
 &HT;    The Baldwin group had focused on how to optimize play using each
hand's visible cards, reckoning that card-counting was impractical.
Thorp's twin breakthroughs, bolstered by then-nascent computer
calculation, were that smart folks could learn to count cards as
they were played and that, in doing so, these gamblers could gain a
consistent advantage over the house.
 &HT;    On his own, day after day, Curtis practiced card-counting until
his brain ached and his fingers were raw. At 21, he turned his back
on a UCLA wrestling scholarship, moved to Las Vegas, bellied up to
the Sahara's blackjack pit and put his $1,800 life's savings on the
line.
 &HT;    ``The first night, I won $22. The second day, I lost $900. At
the table, I started hyperventilating. Then I got physically
sick.''
 &HT;    Curtis had slammed into the brutal reality of fluctuation around
the average return, or what statisticians call standard deviation.
Although an astute blackjack card counter can, over the long haul,
realize up to a 1.5 percent profit (depending on such variables as
the number of decks, which card-counting system he employs and how
many cards remain before the dealer reshuffles), losing streaks can
last for weeks. There's a saying: If you can't stand the flux,
don't bet the bucks. Many technically proficient blackjack counters
have been run out by flux.
 &HT;    An elegant mathematical expression of standard deviation's power
in gaming is the so-called risk of ruin, which establishes the
likelihood that a particular bankroll will go to zero before it
doubles.
 &HT;    According to calculations by Vancura, a blackjack card-counter
playing with a 101.11 percent expected return (the expectation of
one version of his card-counting system) and a bankroll that's just
25 times the minimum bet has close to a 47 percent chance of going
broke before doubling his money.
 &HT;    To drop the likelihood of going broke to, say, .5 percent
requires a bankroll 1,000 times larger than the game's minimum
wager; in a $5 to $25 game, that's $5,000.
 &HT;    Chastened, Curtis returned to the real world, first as a
stockbroker, then as the smallest bouncer in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    The lean years ended when Stanford Wong _ the nom de guerre of a
statistics and finance professor who relishes anonymity _ enlisted
Curtis to play tournament blackjack. Financed by Wong, Curtis was
free to make the big bets that would harvest big money.
 &HT;    After he retired from tournament play, Curtis set up his
publishing house. Today, while still winning a sizable return in
his off-hours, he reigns over a stable of authors in his growing
library of gambling science.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    Even if Vancura's simplified card-counting book achieves
best-seller status, as Thorp's did, the lights will likely keep
blazing just as fiercely in the desert and along the boardwalk and
in the Indian casinos and on the riverboats and aboard the ocean
liners.
 &HT;    Curtis and Vancura seem appalled at the apathy and ignorance of
the average gambler. Successful gambling is unquestionably
possible, and someday, they hope, the fleeced hordes will decide
they've lost enough.
 &HT;    Someday casino profits may shrink from the obscene to the merely
respectable, and the successes of those who win through
intellectual effort rather than luck may inspire a newfound
appreciation for the beauty, wonder and irresistible power of
probability.
 &HT;    But don't bet on it.

 (Three color slides are available.) 
 By BRAD LEMLEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Aside from hid dancing left foot, Anthony Curtis, 42, looks like
any other sucker tourist dropping a wad at the Binion's Horseshoe
blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
 &HT;    Hair slicked back, nose busted twice from rugby, left hand
curled around his second imported beer _ not water, a dead giveaway
for card-counters _ he seems wound tighter than most, maybe, but
inside the bounds. After three minutes of play, he's down $100.
 &HT;    He's seems distracted by the waitress's cleavage and acts
surprised when his luck turns.
 &HT;    ``My God, this never happens,'' he murmurs as he flips a natural
21: a 10 of hearts and ace of diamonds.
 &HT;    Next two hands, he stands on 17 and 18. The dealer busts both
times. Now he's up $150 _ ``Better quit,'' he says, clumsily
scooping up 12 green chips and striding to the cashout cage. The
pit boss _ whose job it is to spot counters _ smiles and waves at
him. The dealer doesn't even look up.
 &HT;    While Curtis did his dumb-luck shtick above the table, the real
action was below, down on the gaudy carpet. One of the best
blackjack players in the world _ he won the World Match-Play
Blackjack Championship in 1987 _ Curtis counted every card played,
maintaining a multiparameter tally, which means he tracked several
things at once.
 &HT;    His left foot's job was to tick off the aces. When one ace had
been dealt, he put his heel down; second ace, he tilted his foot to
the left; third, up on his toe; fourth, tilted to the right.
Meanwhile, in his head, he kept a running count of the other cards:
Twos and eights each counted as plus one; threes, fours, sixes and
sevens were each plus two; fives were plus three; nines were minus
one; and tens and face cards (which all count as 10 in blackjack)
were minus three.
 &HT;    The idea is that blackjack _ unlike, say, craps _ is a game of
dependent events, and tracking the dealt cards yields valuable
information about the ones that remain. A wealth of tens and aces
left in the deck favors the player, because the player is more
likely to get a blackjack (for which the house pays 1.5 times the
bet) and because the house, which plays by fixed rules, is more
likely to bust.
 &HT;    Whenever Curtis' count went positive _ that is, above zero _ he
boosted his average bets and, on this evening, his winnings. Do it
all while looking like a distracted, none-too-bright vacationing
drunk, and you, too, can win big.
 &HT;    Card-counting can be daunting _ it's a science that's under
constant revision and an art that demands great discipline _ but it
can also be extremely rewarding. By 1989 Curtis had won enough
money at the tables to bankroll a gambling-book publishing house.
He still plays in his off-hours and remains plugged into the
professional blackjack subculture.
 &HT;    Standing shoulder to shoulder with the hapless hordes, Curtis
represents the tiny coterie of mathematically talented, driven,
inconspicuous gamblers who methodically drub the casinos at their
own games.
 &HT;    Even those who don't plan to go pro can learn from the new
gambling elite and turn a potentially impoverishing vacation into a
profitable experience.

CLINTON SHOULD CREATE MORE NATIONAL MONUMENTS

<P>
   Four more national monuments are coming America's way soon. And
there is a strong likelihood that President Clinton will designate
several more monuments before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   There will be the usual clamor in Congress claiming the
president has abused his power _ a power given to the presidency by
Congress when it passed the Antiquities Act in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt sent the
president a recommendation that four unique landscapes be protected
under the Antiquities Act. The proposed national monuments are
located on federal public lands in Arizona, Colorado, Oregon and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiquities Act authorizes the president to create national
monuments on federal land to protect areas of special cultural,
scientific, archeological and ecological interest.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton doesn't have to act on Babbitt's
recommendation, the president has shown a strong inclination to use
the Antiquities Act to protect special landscapes that are in
jeopardy from urban sprawl, development or exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Clinton has designated five new national
monuments and expanded an already existing one, the Pinnacles
National Monument in California. The most recent designation, the
Giant Sequoia National Monument in California, was announced on
April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt proposes that the president designate the Ironwood
Forest National Monument in Arizona, Canyons of the Ancients
National Monument in Colorado, Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument
in Oregon and Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Ironwood Forest National Monument is located 25
miles northwest of Tucson and encompasses approximately 135,000
acres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in
the Sonoran Desert. The area supports one of the highest densities
of ironwood trees in the Sonoran Desert. An ironwood tree can live
as long as 800 years.
</P>
<P>
   The ironwood landscape is also critical habitat for the desert
Bighorn sheep. Unfortunately, this unique area is threatened by
numerous golf courses and housing developments.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Pima County Board of Supervisors sent a unanimous
resolution to Babbitt seeking national monument status for this
area, which is within their county.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Canyons of the Ancients National Monument is
located in the Four Corners region of southwest Colorado, about 45
miles west of Durango. The BLM manages the 164,000 acres that would
be included in the proposed monument. The area contains the highest
known density of archeological sites in the nation _ more than
20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The archeological finds include great kivas, cliff dwellings,
shrines, sacred springs, petroglyphs, sweat lodges and villages.
</P>
<P>
   The integrity of these archeological sites is threatened by the
growth of population in the area, with tourism and increasing
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., introduced a
bill to protect the landscape and sites as a National Conservation
Area. He suspended all action on the bill in late March due to
local controversies over the NCA designation.
</P>
<P>
   National monument status is the only quick solution to
protecting the area.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument is located 25
miles southeast of Medford, along the Oregon-California border. It
includes the biologically significant Soda Mountain _ significant
because of its geological age, soil types and transitional climate
zones.
</P>
<P>
   The 52,000-acre area of BLM land is situated where the Klamath
and Cascade mountains converge, creating a rich ecology that
supports a wide variety of rare plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Hanford Reach National Monument contains 200,000
acres of public land located in south-central Washington, along the
Columbia River. The area is within the Department of Energy's
Hanford Nuclear Reservation, but outside the radioactive hot spots
and would become a buffer zone around the nuclear reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would give the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the
responsibility of managing the monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Reach is the last free-flowing, non-tidal stretch of
the Columbia River, where nearly 80 percent of fall chinook salmon
spawn.
</P>
<P>
   The area also contains American Indian cultural artifacts that
span more than 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a great deal of political pressure to convert
portions of the area to agricultural uses. Such uses could
jeopardize salmon habitat and threaten other historic objects
within the area of the proposed monument.
</P>
<P>
   If the president designates these sites as national monuments,
he will have created or expanded 10 monuments during his
administration _ setting aside more than 3.8 million acres for
greater protection.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the public agrees with the administration's goal to
ensure greater protection of unique public lands. And the public
can expect Clinton to designate other sites as national monuments
before he leaves office _ the Missouri Breaks area in central
Montana and Steens Mountain in southeastern Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   And the president may expand the Great Sand Dunes National
Monument in Colorado and Craters of the Moon National Monument in
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The move to put these lands out of the reach of oil and mining
interests, developers and those who would plunder natural and
archeological resources for private gain is the right move at the
right time.
</P>
<P>
   With an increasing and mobile population, let us ensure that
future generations have the opportunity to enjoy their special
heritage in nature. The president should adopt Babbitt's
recommendations.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Those green things on our dinner plates
 &HT;    For release June 7, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON - It is a situation in which I often find myself. No
visit to London can be complete without a swing through that
leviathan of a department store, Harrod's. Particularly to the book
department as that is contiguous to the sewing and needlepoint
department to which my wife is devoutly drawn despite the fact that
the inventory there hasn't changed in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   And so here I am again. Having worked my way through British
History, World Travel, Mysteries, Biographies and some seamy
magazines I encounter my wife in Cooking, to which she drifted
after finally realizing that, indeed, Harrod's sewing and
needlepoint department has been trapped in a time bubble.
</P>
<P>
   As my wife pages through multiple cooking books, my otherwise
bored gaze drifts to one of the shelves that displays a book
entitled, simply, ``Parsley.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone write a book about parsley? I asked myself --
curiously reaching for the book itself. It is thin and buttressed
by myriad pictures of the same old thing, parsley, on different
types of dinner dishes.
</P>
<P>
   It regenerated my own reaction to parsley on my plate: I toss it
onto my wife's plate, or onto the table itself; gently but with
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   To me, parsley is what broccoli is to George Bush, the
courageous former president who dared go public with his eating
enmity. ``I do not like broccoli and I haven't liked it since I was
a little kid and my mother made me eat it and I'm president of the
United States and I'm not going to eat any more broccoli,'' he
whined after it was served him aboard Air Force One in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   He will be remembered more by me for that than for his
victorious Gulf War coalition or even his disastrous ``read my
lips'' utterance.
</P>
<P>
   He said what he felt, that he hated broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   And while I like broccoli, I detest parsley. Seemingly, it's
everywhere -- clumped as sprigs atop the meal or sprinkled around
the plate in tiny fragments for those growing numbers who labor
under the impression that a plate of food is an artistic
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants don't even have to be chic to be part of the parsley
coterie; plain, old eating joints do it. If they don't have
parsley, then it's watercress, or chicory, or some other bitter
green.
</P>
<P>
   It is my contention that grub of this type merely are roadside
grasses mowed up from highway medians and tossed onto our plates.
Some diners look at parsley and the like as nourishment, others see
it just as coloring to an otherwise drab plate of food.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, I don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   In agreement was the late poet Ogden Nash, who summed it all up
in three succinct words: ``Parsley is gharsley.''
</P>
<P>
   I flipped through the pages of the book on parsley in search of
justification for its presence atop my restaurant meals but I
really found none. I did, however, find a little history:
</P>
<P>
   During the Isthmian Games of ancient Greece, winners were
crowned with wreaths of parsley. They wore it, they didn't eat it,
they didn't scatter it on their food!
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in this book, as I waited, waited, waited for my wife,
I read that parsley often was laid at the tombs of the dead - which
speaks wonders to its use today. And, yes, the Greeks also used it
for a spice but heaven knows why.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, I am offending many who love parsley, who grow
parsley, who serve parsley and, particularly, who sell parsley.
Realize, however, that I am just a sprig of grievance, a lonely
voice against a preponderance of people who regularly use and enjoy
parsley as either a vegetable, herb, decoration or graveside
remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   To those I have offended, I apologize. Which is more than Bush
did for the broccoli lovers. But then again, he didn't get
re-elected; I presume because of it. It's something George W. might
think about as the campaign gets more involved in issues.
</P>
<P>
   As you can imagine, I did not purchase the book; it's still
there for other Harrod's roamers to ponder. Come out of Magazines,
turn right to Cooking, look down to the corner, bottom shelf; it's
right next to Parsnip.

 &HT;    NFL star pleads guilty to misdemeanor
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- NFL star Ray Lewis pleaded guilty today to a
misdemeanor charge that will allow him to stay out of prison and
escape murder charges in the Buckhead stabbing deaths of two
Decatur men.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 25, is now a witness for the prosecution and will testify
against his former co-defendants, Reginald Oakley and Joseph
Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garland, Lewis' lead lawyer, also said the linebacker will
give testimony ``that affects more than the people here on trial.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, testimony was given implicating two other men
who were passengers in Lewis' stretch limousine Jan. 31. During a
street brawl after a night of post-Super Bowl partying, Jacinth
Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, died of stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an innocent man, wrongly accused, and who's been
through an awful ordeal,'' Garland said in a hastily called news
conference. ``Today, he has been exonerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland said his client is expected to take the witness stand
Tuesday and that it has been ``arranged'' that Lewis will return
and play this upcoming season for the Baltimore Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief plea hearing before Superior Court Judge Alice D.
Bonner, Lewis answered questions with ``yes'' and ``no,'' except to
say ``guilty'' to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction charge is for giving incomplete statements to
police and demanding that those in his limousine keep quiet about
the fatal fight.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Clint Rucker said he will drop the
murder, felony murder and aggravated assault charges against the
All-Pro player.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis will testify that he did not see anyone stab a victim
during the fight, Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray saw no knife being used, but Ray will say what he saw
during the fight and let the jury make those determinations,''
Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner accepted the deal that Lewis serve a one-year sentence on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis agreed to pay one-third of the court costs to Fulton
County for the prosecution of his case. That sum has yet to be
determined, Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis pleaded guilty under the First Offender Act, which means
if he stays out of trouble during the term of his probation, the
misdemeanor charge will be expunged from his record.
</P>
<P>
   After the plea agreement was approved this morning, Charita
Lollar, cousin to Richard Lollar, told a reporter, ``money talks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought if you were part of a crime in Georgia, you were
held guilty,'' she said. ``But in Atlanta if you have money...
you'll walk out of here and play football.''
</P>
<P>
   She then shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, a lawyer for Oakley, said the prosecutors had just
proved Lewis was a ``liar'' and now they want him to be their
witness. ``I plan to cross-examine the (expletive) out of him,''
the lawyer promised.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sadow, a lawyer for Sweeting, predicted that, regardless
of Lewis' testimony, his client will be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner adjourned court until Tuesday, although Sadow said he
wanted to continue the proceedings today and even hear Lewis'
direct testimony. Postponing the case another day ``gives the state
a little more time to get its case together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey and Sadow received tapes of the statement Lewis gave
prosecutors Sunday in their preparation to attack Lewis on
cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The case, by nearly all accounts, has gone badly for the
prosecution, with flip-flopping witnesses and scant evidence that
Lewis had attacked anyone. In fact, no witness so far has
testtified to seeing anyone stabbing a victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very interested in what (Lewis) will say; I bet he doesn't
even know right now,'' Harvey said. ``It'll hurt Sweeting a hell of
a lot more than Oakley. But Sweeting's his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, prosecutors brought a Baltimore man, Sherman
Street, who came to testify that the day before Oakley turned
himself in, Street had warned Oakley that he would be ``the fall
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Lewis has all the money and the resources,'' Street had
told Oakley, who then agreed with that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner refused to allow that statement to be admitted. Harvey
wanted to use that to show Oakley's ``state of mind'' before
turning himself in. The judge ruled that would be prejudicial
evidence of one defendant (Oakley) testifying against another
defendant (Lewis).
</P>
<P>
   Now, that statement should be admitted and Harvey said his hands
won't be tied. ``Now we can try this (expletive) case,'' Harvey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garland said that early Sunday, District Attorney Paul Howard
called him and came to his Buckhead home to broach a deal. The two
men met, with Howard deciding to drop the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This became a political issue; people moved quickly and
without study,'' said Garland. Prosecutors ``got caught up in the
media swirl. They rushed into this and didn't study.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland said the plea and Lewis' testimony will put to rest
``any lingering idea that the lawyers got him off or the DA fumbled
the ball. That's not the case here. Here the DA came forward and
said `He's not guilty.' ''

A BETTER WAY OF FINDING THE GUILTY

<P>
   When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who had always denied pleas
for reprieves from execution, finally granted one last week, he
made the right call, acknowledging the importance of DNA evidence
and the right of a condemned man to ask for testing.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not political considerations of Bush's presidential
campaign were at work, the prisoner, Ricky McGinn, now has time for
the tests that might clear him of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, depending on the results of the tests, McGinn could
wind up eating another last meal in a few months. And the episode
throws only a tiny wedge of light onto a criminal justice system
that needs to take an unflinching look at the growing evidence of
error.
</P>
<P>
   Two other cases last week were far more revealing. In Virginia,
Gov. James S. Gilmore III gave permission for advanced DNA testing
of Earl Washington, who had already been moved off death row
because earlier tests suggested he was innocent of rape and murder.
And in Texas, A.B. Butler received a pardon from Governor Bush
after spending the last seven of his 16 years in prison fighting to
get the tests that cleared him of kidnapping and rape.
</P>
<P>
   These cases stand for more than the importance of DNA evidence.
They reveal how the search for the guilty can go wrong. What
matters most is not how these people got out of prison, but how
they got in.
</P>
<P>
   We know eyewitnesses sometimes make mistakes. Snitches tell
lies. Confessions are coerced or fabricated. Racism trumps the
truth. Defense lawyers sleep through trials. Prosecutors and police
tell fibs.
</P>
<P>
   Never have these flaws been more starkly exposed than in the
past decade, when DNA has freed scores of wrongly convicted people
and kept thousands of the wrongly accused out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the lessons have been ignored. Of all the
statistics tallied by the system, not one shows the number of
innocent people sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Oversight is fundamental for any system in which life or liberty
is at stake. We have mechanisms to investigate plane crashes,
deaths in hospitals and collapses of buildings. Only the criminal
justice system exempts itself from accountability for its mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bright exceptions to this indifference to
accountability is Gov. George Ryan of Illinois, who followed his
landmark moratorium on executions with the appointment of a
commission to find out why 13 men were wrongly sent to death row.
New York's Governor George Pataki has proposed that a committee
review all convictions overturned on DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings should be used to make it harder for innocent
people to wind up in prison. And to make it easier for these people
to get out, Congress should pass the Innocence Protection Act,
which would give inmates the right to DNA tests to prove innocence
and would require the preservation of evidence after conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, though, that DNA solves crimes only when there is
biological evidence. The quality of old-fashioned evidence can be
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitnesses will produce fewer false identifications and just
as many correct ones, social scientists say, if police follow a few
simple techniques that cut down guessing by witnesses and hints by
detectives. False confessions can be curbed by requiring that all
interrogations be recorded on tape, as is already done in
Minnesota, Alaska, Ireland and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Convicting an innocent person not only commits a terrible
injustice, but leaves a guilty criminal on the streets. Every state
and every American has an interest in doing all we can to prevent
it from happening.
</P>

Innocence'' (Doubleday, 2000), about the wrongfully convicted.)

NOT TALKING SENSE ON A MISSILE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (New York Times OpEd for release Sunday, June 4, and thereafter.)

 By FRANCES FitzGERALD  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thus far into the presidential campaign, the debate over
national missile defenses has been nothing short of surreal.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have
been promoting a limited defense system to protect the nation
against attacks by rogue states, though the system has not been
proven and may never work reliably. They have also been asking
Russia to agree to amend the Antiballistic Missile Treaty to permit
such a system, though the Russians have always adamantly opposed
such an amendment and continued to do so at the summit meeting in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Gov. George W. Bush, backed by such Cold War
heavyweights as Henry Kissinger, George Shultz and Brent Scowcroft,
has promised a much more robust national missile defense, though
based on technologies he has not yet named.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he has promised deep reductions in the American and
Russian strategic arsenals. The Russians, however, have already
told us that they see a larger defense effort as a threat to their
nuclear deterrent. The idea that they would make deep reductions in
the face of such an effort defies logic.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Washington knows all of this, so what is going on?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is politics. But it is a politics that
cannot be understood apart from the history of the debate, a debate
that has never been about reality.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, 1983, President Ronald Reagan, whose hard-line
anti-Soviet policies had by then given rise to the largest
antinuclear movement in Cold War history, personally _ and almost
in secret _ wrote an insert to a routine defense speech, calling on
the scientific community to turn its great talents to the cause of
world peace and to give us a means of rendering nuclear weapons
``impotent and obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   In background briefings after the speech, there was talk of such
Buck Rogers weaponry as space-based lasers that could destroy the
entire Soviet missile arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's own officials, among them Shultz, his secretary of
state, were appalled, and some speculated that the president had
gotten the idea from a science-fiction film. It took them almost a
year to discover what a stroke of political genius the speech
insert was.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1946, opinion polls had shown that the vast majority of
Americans believed that scientists could develop a defense against
nuclear missiles if they put their minds to it. Indeed, except when
the issue of vulnerability was front and center in the news, most
Americans expressed confidence that the United States had a defense
against nuclear weapons already.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks after Reagan's speech, a White House poll asked
respondents whether they believed scientists could come up with ``a
really effective way to destroy Soviet nuclear missiles from
space.'' The answer was, as always, a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan certainly expected this answer. In addition, he and his
close aides recognized that, because of its inherent ambiguity, a
defense initiative would appeal to conservatives as a way to
develop a weapons system even while it appealed to the public at
large as a means to eliminating the nuclear threat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of Reagan's re-election in November 1984, all of his
top officials had lined up behind the Star Wars concept. A number
of existing research programs were cobbled together, and the
Strategic Defense Initiative was launched with great fanfare and
much rhetoric about the potential of lasers and other exotic
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Shultz, Robert McFarlane and other moderates in the
administration wanted to use SDI as a bargaining chip for Soviet
strategic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like giving them the sleeves off our vest,''
Shultz told the president.
</P>
<P>
   However, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, his aide Richard
Perle and their fellow hard-liners had other ideas. They saw SDI as
a way to block offensive-arms reductions, to tear up the 1972 ABM
treaty and to begin an arms race in defensive as well as offensive
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides brawled for the rest of the Reagan administration,
and neither succeeded in gaining its ends.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, SDI became extremely popular in the
polls. While the hard-liners pleased knowledgeable conservatives by
blocking strategic talks, Reagan pleased the public by offering to
share SDI technology with the Soviets and promising the elimination
of nuclear weapons. The antinuclear movement, its rhetoric stolen,
gradually faded away.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 years, the United States has spent $60 billion on
antimissile-defense research and has yet to produce a workable
weapons system. An effective defense of the country remains wholly
elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Republican conservatives have continued to speak as if
exotic technologies were ready to jump off the assembly lines, and
have continued to press for a deployment of something _ anything _
that would irrevocably commit this country to an open-ended process
of developing national missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats tried to resist the pressure, but their
ability to do so waxed and waned with their own political fortunes
and those of the Republican right. In early 1998, or around the
time the Republicans took their impeachment case against President
Clinton to the Senate, the Democrats gave way.
</P>
<P>
   The previous fall a commission headed by Donald Rumsfeld, a
former defense secretary, had concluded that ``rogue states'' could
acquire ballistic-missile technologies, and North Korea had
test-fired a long-range missile out over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In January the Clinton administration pledged financing for the
deployment of a national missile-defense system to cope with this
threat. In March the Senate, with administration support,
overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for a deployment.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, White House officials commented that the
administration's support for the bill would help to defuse a potent
political issue for the Republicans in the campaign of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Clinton announced that he would make a final
deployment decision this summer, in the very midst of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This determination clearly had little to do with technology, for
the schedule did not permit time for adequate testing _ and since
then one of the two tests has failed. Rather, it had to do with the
fear that the Republicans would call Democrats weak on defense.
</P>
<P>
   In their unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Russians to agree
to the deployment, administration officials assured them that they
could defeat the system if they kept 1,000 or more strategic
nuclear weapons on full alert. This was hardly a bargain for either
country, given the decay of the Russian early-warning system and
the increasingly real threat of an accidental launch.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of these technological and diplomatic
embarrassments for the administration, Bush revived the political
issue by calling for the entire Reagan program: Star Wars, radical
nuclear-arms reductions, the de-alerting of nuclear forces and the
sharing of antimissile technology with our allies and possibly the
Russians as well.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is, of course, self-contradictory. It is also
wildly implausible, in that the Pentagon is no more likely to agree
to give away advanced American technology than it ever was, and no
country except the United States can afford an open-ended
missile-defense program.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the majority of Americans did not notice any of these
problems when Reagan made the proposal 15 years ago.

There in the Blue: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For those of us who remember a time before pimply dot-com
billionaires and Gatesian wealth, the recent passing of Saul
Steinberg's longtime investment company, Reliance Group Holdings,
marks the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   Weighted down by debt, Steinberg sold Reliance to a competitor,
Leucadia National Corp., for pennies on the dollar. Sold as well
was Steinberg's palatial Park Avenue apartment, thought to be the
largest in Manhattan, as well as its contents, including many of
the fine paintings and draperies that once hung on its walls. And,
let's not forget, a multimillion-dollar commode made of
rococo-gilded bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980s, an era when financial alchemy brought jaw-dropping
wealth to a generation of Wall Streeters, can now safely be said to
be over.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 years or so, Steinberg was an oversized symbol
of a decade whose legacy will forever be debated by economists and
historians.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, however, Steinberg's reputation was built largely
through his groundbreaking but failed attempt to take over Chemical
Bank in 1969, a precursor to 1980s-style corporate raids. That run
enshrined him in Wall Street lore, vividly illustrating to a
generation of hungry young men what could be accomplished with a
modest amount of cash and a large dose of moxie.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1980s, aside from collecting $60 million in greenmail
which Disney paid him to go away in 1984, Steinberg mostly stayed
on the sidelines, watching as corporate raiders such as Carl Icahn,
T. Boone Pickens and Ron Perelman engaged in a financial fox hunt
that sent hundreds of American companies scurrying for the woods
with baying investment bankers on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   It was what Steinberg did with his wealth that so aptly
capsulized the era. It wasn't just the apartment, once owned by
John D. Rockefeller, with its scarlet-and-gold dining room and
seven-figure tchotchkes. His third wife, Gayfryd, was conspicuously
young. His parties were legend: For his 50th-birthday party in
1989, models were dressed as figures in Old Masters paintings. You
get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   His sad fate could be taken as yet another lesson on the hollow
nature of 1980s wealth, especially when compared to the wealth of
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   This new era has brought a good deal of speculative excess, of
course, as is the nature of Wall Street _ raw capitalism is not
pretty. But whatever one thinks of the current excesses in stock
valuations, it's undeniable that the latest billionaires actually
helped build something _ in this case the Internet and all its
attendant new technology.
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said for the 1980s. The billions of dollars
made from corporate raids and leveraged buyouts _ in which a public
company's shareholders are bought out using the company itself as
collateral _ were about nothing more than paper shuffling. When
companies were cracked open like piggy banks or split up like
pizzas to reduce the debt, was anyone really surprised that the
parts were worth more than the whole?
</P>
<P>
   In these exercises no breakthrough products were created, no
Edisons were uncovered. Is there some gee-whiz product out there
that Steinberg's insurance company engineered? I doubt it. From the
very first such deals, there was a sense it was all a shell game,
that there was something patently wrong about wealth created by
tearing apart companies rather than building them up, by firing _
or ``downsizing'' _ workers rather than hiring them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even the harshest critics of corporate raids would probably
acknowledge that, at the dawn of the 1980s, too many American
companies were overstuffed, overperked and none too sympathetic to
the desires of their shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Put aside all the envy, all the sniping about gold-plated
cabinetry, and Steinberg and his ilk were agents of change, pure
and simple. They were wolves clearing out the stragglers, forcing
the other animals to get into fighting trim. True, they inflicted a
great deal of pain, but financial Darwinism has never been for the
squeamish.
</P>
<P>
   For those who handle such unpleasant tasks, there is a classic
American arc. In 1982, at the beginning of the raider era, the men
who launched hostile-takeover attempts were lauded as American folk
heroes. When they first took to the floors of annual meetings,
Gordon Gekko-style, to attack the bloated old-boys networks that
ran too many large companies, people actually cheered. While
Pickens and others stormed the ramparts, Henry Kravis and other
buyout artists were standing by in boardrooms, ``rescuing'' the
raiders' frightened prey by taking them private with velvet gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the raiders finally went too far. In 1988, the
unseemly free-for-all for control of RJR Nabisco triggered a
backlash that killed the golden goose. Afterward it got ugly, as
these things usually do, with a barrage of insider-trading and
securities-fraud indictments and prison sentences for the untoward
and the unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the raiders, Steinberg included, now had publicly
owned companies tucked under their arms to manage, and it's been
informative to see how many of them proved unable to follow through
on the promises they made at those bygone annual meetings. Pickens
was unceremoniously ousted from control of his company, the former
Mesa Petroleum, in a shareholder uprising. Perelman's company,
Revlon, is a stock-market laggard. Steinberg's Reliance Group
flirted with bankruptcy for years before the last air finally eased
from its balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The intriguing question is to what degree the winnowing and
strengthening of the 1980s set the stage for the explosive growth
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter best left to economists, but one suspects it is no
accident that a slew of large non-Internet companies, from Wal-Mart
to Gillette _ itself a target of hungry raiders during the 1980s _
embarked on rapid growth and stock-price rises in the 1990s. Would
they have done so had raiders like Steinberg not frightened them
into shaping up?
</P>
<P>
   It would be the richest irony to argue that Saul Steinberg begat
Bill Gates. I won't. But one should also avoid the facile
conclusion that Steinberg's story is simply a fitting end for an
era in which ruthless corporate raiders destroyed corporations and
laid off tens of thousands of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it is very, very difficult to envision a day when
Gates would be forced to auction off his living-room drapes.
</P>

the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco'' (Harper Collins, 1993), is a

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lexus finally has built a BMW.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus, the luxury brand of Japan's largest automaker, Toyota,
entered the U.S. market in 1990 and soon set the benchmark for
luxury cars worldwide, leaving European stalwarts Mercedes-Benz,
BMW, Audi and Jaguar wringing their hands with worry.
</P>
<P>
   The LS 400 sedan, Lexus' flagship, soon led the luxury pack with
top overall quality ratings from J.D. Power &AMP; Associates, and both
the European and Japanese competitors were scrambling to catch up.
The U.S. luxury brands, meanwhile, weren't even in the running.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I say is that almost overnight, we went from a question
mark to a benchmark,'' said Mike Watson, a longtime U.S. Toyota
executive who has been involved with Lexus from the start.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson, Lexus' service and technical training manager, is
among those at Lexus who are the first to acknowledge that, at
least for some consumers, there has been something missing in the
Lexus lineup: a true driver's car that would appeal to younger,
more sport-oriented buyers. Buyers, they say, who would opt for a
bright-yellow BMW 328i, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the first time ever, there is a bright yellow Lexus,
and it looks and feels like a sporty BMW 3-series car.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the IS 300, and it goes on sale at North American
Lexus dealerships June 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 10 years, we've built our reputation by introducing quiet,
sophisticated luxurious cars,'' Lexus Marketing Manager Greg
Kitzens said during the recent national media launch of the IS 300
at the Barton Creek Resort in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, like Mercedes, our current lineup doesn't bring in many
customers under 40 years old,'' he said. ``So we recognize it's
time for Lexus to broaden its appeal an attract younger buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, then, the IS 300, with rear-wheel drive, an inline
six-cylinder engine (both longtime BMW attributes) and an
affordable price tag: $30,995, well-equipped.
</P>
<P>
   That puts the car in the same ballpark with the BMW 328i and
Audi A4, both of which are seen by younger consumers as truly fun
drivers' cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have six distinct model lines that accounted for
sales of nearly 186,000 units last year,'' Kitzens said.
</P>
<P>
   But to broaden Lexus' appeal, he said, ``We knew we needed a
sporty, stylish, performance-oriented car. We broke ground in this
area with the ($46,000) 1998 GS 400, which is the dream car of many
young people. But we wanted to introduce a performance Lexus that
the younger crowd could afford without resigning themselves to
eating 99-cent chalupas at Taco Bell every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced more than a year ago in Europe as the IS 200, with a
smaller engine, the car already has become a hit overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lexus rolls out the IS 300 for the U.S. market, sporting
bold looks similar to a German sports sedan and carrying a
3.0-liter six-cylinder engine that cranks out 215 horsepower and
218 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   That's more power than found in either the BMW 328i, with 193
horsepower and 206 foot-pounds of torque, or the A4, with 190
horsepower and 207 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   The IS 300 beats both of those competitors in zero to 60 mph
performance. The Lexus reaches 60 mph in 7.1 seconds, compared with
7.2 seconds for the BMW and 8.4 seconds for the A4. There is a
sportier version of the A4, called the S4, but it costs $37,000 and
comes with a turbocharged 2.7-liter engine.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the IS 300 will be offered only with a five-speed
automatic transmission, but a five-speed manual is scheduled for
sometime next year for those who want even sportier performance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the automatic has a clutchless manual-shift option
similar to Audi's Tiptronic transmission that lets the driver
choose when to move to another gear.
</P>
<P>
   As Lexus' first offering in the entry-level sporty sedan
segment, the IS 300 has no loyal owner base to draw from, Kitzens
said. Lexus is breaking new ground here.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we might attract a few current Lexus owners looking for
something new, for the most part the IS 300 customer will be
someone who's never entered our dealerships before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He or she is someone who sped right past a Lexus store driving
a BMW or (Acura) Integra, maybe glancing to see if their dad had
dropped off his LS 400 for service. But now, it's our job to lure
this buyer in.''
</P>
<P>
   The target IS 300 buyer, Kitzens said, generally will be male,
35-40 years old, married, highly educated, with a median household
income of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This person likes to drive,'' he said. ``He or she has an
active lifestyle, participates in sports, and is techno-savvy, but
is perhaps looking for an alternative to a typical yuppiemobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Lexus plans an entirely separate marketing campaign focusing on
the IS 300, integrating traditional media such as newspapers,
magazines and television with an increased presence on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company launched its IS 300 ad campaign via its
www.lexus.com Web site, offering Web surfers the opportunity to win
an IS 300 by designing their own TV commercial for the car.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, the winning commercial will be shown during ``Who
Wants to be a Millionaire.'' Both the person who wrote the ad, as
well as someone who voted in the contest, will win new IS 300s, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet ads kicked off the IS 300 campaign theme:
``sufficiently radical.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The scenarios in our national and dealer ads depict people who
live life on the edge and are about to go over the top,'' Kitzens
said. ``The IS 300 is shown as a vehicle that provides sufficient
stimulation in one's life, avoiding the need to resort to drastic
behavior. We think these ads will position the car as daring and
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he said, the IS 300 offers ``flashy styling and
amenities such as the in-dash, six-disc CD stereo system. Add in
the competitive price as well as Lexus' reputation for quality, and
this car is poised for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Lexus already has proved that it can cut into the sales of
German luxury cars, but it remains to be seen whether the brand can
make inroads where BMW and Audi clearly have held the edge _ in
lower-end, sporty performance cars that appeal to youthful buyers.
</P>
<P>
   If Lexus predictions are accurate, the company will sell 25,000
of the IS 300 in North America annually. And probably, many of
those will be the bright yellow one, Lexus officials said.

&HT;     WITH SPIFFY PASSAT, VW IS ON A ROLL

<P>
   A $31,000 Volkswagen?
</P>
<P>
   That's 15 times what I paid for my first Volkswagen, back in the
days when you could buy a brand-new Beetle for about $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   But, then, Volkswagen has come a long way from its humble U.S.
beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, during VW's heyday in the 1960s, the Beetle was
quite a fad, and Volkswagen dealers were among the snootiest people
around. I remember that the VW dealership where I grew up was so
independent that the management wouldn't let customers anywhere
near the service department.
</P>
<P>
   You dropped your car off out in front of the dealership, and a
white-uniformed attendant took it away into the secret complex in
the rear, where, presumably, other white-uniformed people performed
magic on it to get it running well again.
</P>
<P>
   With the huge influx of Japanese imports in the '70s, consumers
suddenly got spoiled. The Japanese cars didn't have to go back to
the dealership every few weeks (or days) for service; they actually
held up for a long, long time with very little maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   People weary of all the maintenance headaches with their little
German VWs turned to the Japanese cars, and the rest, as they say,
is history. VW dealerships fell onto hard times, and many went out
of business. The Beetle fad was over.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the best-selling cars in the United States are Japanese
models _ the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake about it: Volkswagen is back. The brand is
not quite on top again, but it is pushing hard to get there, thanks
in part to the huge success of its New Beetle, introduced just two
years ago as a thoroughly modern car with a retro look.
</P>
<P>
   The New Beetle isn't the only reason VW is enjoying a new era of
popularity with U.S. consumers, however. One key to that success is
the hot-selling midsize Passat sedan, which has topped the lists of
best midsize cars in several recent consumer automotive
publications _ not the least of which is Consumer Reports.
</P>
<P>
   I generally don't put a lot of stock into what Consumer Reports
has to say about cars, but at least on this point I am pretty much
in agreement: The Passat is an outstanding family sedan, and most
definitely one of the finest midsize cars on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I'm not sure I'm ready to pay $31,000 for a Passat, which
was the price tag on our test car: the 2000 Passat GLX 4Motion
sedan with all-wheel drive. Thankfully, you really don't have to
pay $31,000 to get a nice Passat; prices for the base GLS four-door
begin at just over $21,000.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have an extra few bucks to spend, and you want a car
that rivals similarly priced luxury models from VW's sister, Audi,
as well as BMW, Volvo, Saab and Mercedes-Benz, then perhaps this
vehicle is the one for you.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, luxury models. This Passat is nothing like any Volkswagen
of the past. Forget the cheap, affordable ``people's car'' image of
VW, and think high-end, premium-quality motorcar.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath, of course, the Passat shares basic components with
the premium Audi A4, including engines and transmissions. There are
differences, however. The Audi is a bit shorter and somewhat more
compact, but the Passat is truly a midsize sedan with room for five
adults.
</P>
<P>
   And it is certainly well equipped. Air conditioning, which was
virtually unheard of on the Beetle and other early VW products, is
standard here, of course, and it's not just a basic manual system.
This is automatic climate control.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are power windows and door locks (never in a
Beetle!), power mirrors with an anti-fog system, a tilt and
telescopic steering wheel, and for $1,075 extra (included on our
test car), the five-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission like the
one used in Porsches. This transmission allows the driver to shift
manually (without a clutch), or it will do the shifting on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Other amenities that would have been foreign to the original
Beetle, but which are standard on the Passat GLX (accounting for
much of the price difference from the GLS model), include leather
interior, genuine wood interior trim, cruise control, front and
side air bags for the front occupants, four-wheel disc anti-lock
brakes, the great-sounding Monsoon audio system with eight
speakers, a power glass moon roof, multifunction trip computer, and
heated seats and windshield-washer nozzles.
</P>
<P>
   The only options on our test car were the automatic transmission
and the 4Motion full-time all-wheel-drive system ($1,650), which is
offered on the Passat for the first time this year. This is the
same system found on the Audi.
</P>
<P>
   The base Passat comes with a 1.8-liter, 20-valve turbocharged
four-cylinder engine, similar to the one offered in the New Beetle,
rated at 150 horsepower and 155 foot-pounds of torque. But the GLX
comes only with the 2.8-liter, 30-valve V-6, which turns out 190
horsepower and 206 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   This is a smooth engine with plenty of power for quick starting
and freeway merging. But even the base engine, with one of the most
unobtrusive turbochargers I've experienced, offers plenty of zip,
with much better fuel economy as a plus (up to 23 miles per gallon
in the city and 32 on the highway).
</P>
<P>
   Road handling is one of the great features of this vehicle,
particularly the all-wheel-drive model. The car is extremely
sure-footed in tight turns, and there is no wheel slippage on
acceleration. No, it's not a sports car, but sometimes it feels
like it's as close to one as you can get with a sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat's ride is very smooth, and the cabin is very quiet,
even at freeway speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features on the GLX include power rack-and-pinion
steering, an anti-theft system for the vehicle and the audio
system, anti-intrusion side-door beams, integrated front fog lamps,
comfort seats with height and lumbar adjustments up front,
rain-sensing automatic wiper speed-control, and child safety
rear-door locks.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker for our test car was $30,905, including $525
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the V-6 engine with automatic
transmission are 17 miles per gallon in the city and 24 mpg on the
highway. The tank holds 16.4 gallons of gasoline.

&HT;     SAFETY AGENCY PAYS PREMIUM TO BUY POPULAR CHRYSLER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of you who are patiently waiting for the Chrysler PT Cruiser
you ordered, which the dealer said will take four to six months to
receive, are going to love this:
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of
the federal government, went out shopping for a couple of PT
Cruisers last month and, after looking east and west, north and
south, came up with not one, but two, at a dealership in East
Aurora, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   NHTSA's shopper bought both of them _ at a premium of about
$10,000 over the manufacturer's sticker price for each one.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see any happy bureaucrats cruising around in
these Cruisers with U.S. government license plates on them.
</P>
<P>
   These two Cruisers are destined for the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday and Thursday, these two cars will be smashed beyond
repair as part of the government's consumer crash-testing program,
agency spokesman Rae Tyson said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The first, for which the government paid $28,900, will undergo a
side-impact test in which the testing lab simulates the impact of
another car T-boning the Cruiser at 38.5 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   This particular PT Cruiser comes with the optional side air bags
for the front occupants, so NHTSA can gauge how well those work in
protecting the driver and front passenger.
</P>
<P>
   In the second test, a Cruiser that the government paid $27,500
for will be crashed head-on into a concrete barrier at 35 mph to
test how occupants would fare in such an accident.
</P>
<P>
   The government will rate the PT Cruiser on front and side
impacts on a scale of one to five stars, with five being the best.
Tyson said the results will be posted on NHTSA's consumer Web site
at www.nhtsa.gov probably no later than July 1.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to buy one of the PT Cruisers, you might
want to wait to see how well it fares in the crash tests, Tyson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer who sold the cars to the government said he had one
of them in stock and had been using it as a demonstrator, and the
second one was on order when the NHTSA shopper came in looking for
two of the Cruisers.
</P>
<P>
   The government doesn't buy cars from the manufacturer for crash
testing; it goes out and buys them from dealers just like retail
customers would, Tyson said. ``That way we know the vehicles are
representative of what consumers are buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, the dealership _ Delia Car Co. _ wasn't told up
front who the buyer would be or what would become of the cars, but
he knew before the sale was completed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I knew before I gave them the cars what they were going
to do, and it really doesn't bother me,'' said the dealership's
manager, August Delia. ``We still have one of them here; they
haven't picked it up yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Delia acknowledged that the cars are in short supply and that
customers are clamoring for them, but he said he felt that the
crash tests were a worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lots of people waiting for the Cruisers, and we've
told them to expect to wait about six months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government appreciates Delia's gesture in selling the cars
for the crash tests, Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he did us a favor,'' Tyson said. ``We made the
decision to get the crash tests done as soon as possible, even
knowing that availability was going to be a problem. We looked out
West and down South and found there would be a long wait. But we
felt timeliness was important.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to see two perfectly good, brand-new,
hot-selling cars totaled on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The government won't have to take the cars very far to have the
tests done, Tyson said. East Aurora is a suburb of Buffalo, N.Y.,
home of the independent laboratory that NHTSA uses for such tests.

   FORD DELAYS NEW SUV MODELS
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. said this week it will delay introduction of the
larger, redesigned four-door Explorer sport utility vehicle from
this fall until early next year. Manufacture of the new models will
not begin until late this year, and the vehicles will go on sale in
late winter or early spring as 2002 models.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned vehicles, which replace the current generation
Explorer and its upscale clone, the Mercury Mountaineer, originally
were to have gone on sale later this year as 2001 models.
</P>
<P>
   Ford blamed the delay on quality issues concerning ``fit and
finish'' of the trucks, which have been the nation's best-selling
passenger vehicles since shortly after their introduction in 1990.

&HT;     JAVA CONFERENCE BEGINS IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some 20,000 Java enthusiasts will be in San
Francisco this week for the fifth JavaOne Conference, sponsored by
Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Java has nothing to do with coffee. It is a computer programming
language, developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s as a
building tool for Internet-based applications.
</P>
<P>
   Although developed by Sun, the language's building blocks have
been distributed freely over the years in an effort to develop
software programmers who use it.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has worked. Java-based applications rule the Internet,
and the language is favored by hand-held device programmers, as
well, fueling application for 3Com's popular Palm Pilots and other
personal digital assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use it almost continuously,'' said Bill Rowe, a 40-year-old
Java programmer from Westborough, Mass. ``I started about five
years ago and now it's essential to the way I operate.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also become essential for software and Internet companies
to keep a stable of Java programmers on call, or better yet, in
house.
</P>
<P>
   That demand has resulted in huge increase in programmers'
salaries. A recent survey conducted by the Java Pro Web site, in
concert with the Wilson Research firm, showed the average
compensation for Java professionals worldwide was $73,000 a year,
and $86,400 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Java programming community is growing very rapidly,'' said
Mike Kaul, the chief executive of HotDispatch, a Mountain
View-based Java start-up that offers programmers a forum for
exchanging tips and solutions to programming problems on line.
``They're in high demand and are paid very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like HotDispatch consider JavaOne the event of the
year. ``It makes all kinds of sense to be there. Everyone who's
everybody in the Java universe will be there,'' Kaul said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bill Gee, vice president of marketing for Sun's
software products and platforms, ``We have over 300 companies
exhibiting on the floor, which is also way up from last year. We
sold out about six weeks ago and have a waiting list.''
</P>
<P>
   On premise will be a nine-hole mini-golf course, pingpong
tables, air hockey and twice-nightly live performances of the
television show ``Win Ben Stein's Money.'' The entertainment side
of things will peak on Thursday night, with a performance from rock
band Blues Traveler at the San Francisco Exhibition Concourse.
</P>
<P>
   Sun chairman and chief executive Scott McNealy will address the
convention Tuesday morning.

&HT;     CREATIVE EXPENSE REPORT WINS `DILBERT'-LIKE PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The guy who expensed his Chicago hotel room for
$2,788 after a kielbasa sausage dinner caught on fire and nearly
burned the place down almost won. And the Texas auditor reimbursed
for the rental of an elephant almost took the grand prize too.
</P>
<P>
   But the winning entry in the funniest expense report contest
came from the Lake Oswego, Ore., marketing manager who wrote off
two voodoo dolls: He had bought them to curse an industry analyst
who frequently bashed his company.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the competition, ``Dilbert'' cartoonist Scott
Adams, called the voodoo doll story submitted by Dan Wolff ``a
wonderful blend of inappropriate spending and malicious intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect Dan Wolff to go far in management,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff wiped more than 100 other competitors off the expense
account books in a national Internet contest called ``Laughing at
Your Expense,'' the results of which were published Monday. Entries
were submitted to Freeworks.com, a Mountain View-based Internet
company that specializes in streamlining administrative tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Contestants were asked to write essays of up to 150 words
describing their most creative business expense reports, and give
voice to the ``cubicle-constrained workers of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner, said Adams, had to make him laugh and to demonstrate
an appropriate amount of chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to be trying to get away with something,'' Adams
said. ``And the more bizarre, the better. If it was something cruel
and unusual, even better yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Wolff was working in the Portland branch of a San
Rafael, Calif.-based software company when he and a vice president
were sent to a conference in New Orleans. While strolling by the
Rev. Zombie's House of Voodoo, Wolff was grumbling about the
industry analyst when he got a brilliant idea:
</P>
<P>
   Buy a voodoo doll and curse the wickedly unfair critic, whom he
humorously recalled as ``the embodiment of evil analysts whom we
lived in fear of and hated.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff's vice president was delighted with the concept. He picked
out a doll and handed it to Wolff with this blessing: ``Expense
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff spent $70 for two dolls, and another $1 for two sets of
coffin nails. He would use the one doll, and just for good measure,
send the other to the poor public relations chief who had to deal
with the dreaded analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, whose popular cartoon strip lambastes management and
lampoons the idiosyncrasies of the work world, said deciding on a
winner was tough, considering the competition. Among the other
competitors:
</P>
<P>
   _ Kathryn Scott, an internal auditor from Amarillo, Texas, who
submitted a $2,500 expense for renting an elephant, which she used
to pull heavy machinery out of the mud.
</P>
<P>
   _ A technology consultant whose colleague expensed $200 in beer
while on a business trip in Germany. This expense was approved,
although a $7 movie rental was turned down because it was against
company policy to reimburse for such entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This went all the way up to the chief financial officer,''
said Ann Garcia, the consultant from San Carlos, Calif. ``We're
talking about $7 for an expense and a bunch of people who are
making a couple of hundred grand a year.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A police officer was reimbursed for condoms, which he said
were for use on duty. The department's bomb squad uses water-filled
condoms to disrupt the internal circuits of a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Freeworks is giving Wolff and his wife, Suzy, a weekend in San
Francisco and dinner with Adams at Stacey's Cafe, a restaurant that
Adams co-owns.
</P>
<P>
   After Wolff was reimbursed for the voodoo dolls, he chickened
out when it came time to do the curse. The analyst is alive and
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine from New Orleans wouldn't even touch it,''
Wolff said. ``He told me, `We don't mess around with voodoo.' It
sort of made us feel odd about using it.''

<P>
   I am tossing my old record albums.
</P>
<P>
   Every baby boomer can feel the sting of this phrase, the gravity
of the decision. Even those who have internalized the 1970s mantra
``let it go,'' combined it with the '90s credo ``we have to move
on,'' and have unsentimentally pared down their lives to the
Restoration Hardware and Eddie Bauer essentials can appreciate this
particularly painful form of separation anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Albums. The very word is a dead giveaway to a person's
generation. If at a music store you find yourself saying, ``Do you
have the new Ben Folds Five alb ... uh, CD?'' you're a boomer. If
the word ``disc'' or ``CD'' rolls right off your tongue, you're a
definite X. If you never even heard of a Shure or Pickering
tone-arm cartridge, you're a Y _ or whatever name sticks to the
generation after X.
</P>
<P>
   Even as we began amassing CD collections, we boomers invariably
toted our prized LPs from one home to another, like a child taking
an armful of stuffed animals from room to room. Album retention is
deeply embedded in our psyches. It's an aural fixation that Gen
Xers and their even younger counterparts can't fathom, first
because they don't have albums and, second, as they tell us
Methuselahs, because every old album can be found on CD anyway _ or
downloaded from some distant Internet redoubt. Which is not only
untrue, it completely misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   Our hundreds and even thousands of vinyl discs are practically
living organisms to us. We've spent countless hours removing dust
from their skins, carefully holding them by the edges as we replace
them in their sleeves. These albums were temperamental,
inconvenient, high-maintenance creatures of great and often
irritating fragility. Whereas CDs are metallic digital clones made
up of strings of ones and zeros in invisible mathematical
configurations, albums were physical, tactile entities that
demanded care, sensitivity, commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Our record albums saw us through decades. Each one, like an
individual person, carried its particular history. CDs always have
a nice day and don't care what you do to them. Albums are moody and
could easily end up injured or broken. CDs, gleaming and cold and
technocratic, glint like the steely eyes of a corporate takeover
executive and have the survival ability of roaches.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, to this day, those old vinyl stalwarts maintain a
warmer, richer sonic ambience than even the most artfully mastered
CDs. While CDs are more technically accurate in their reproduction
of music, with a greater dynamic range than records, albums had
that ineffable quality of human depth _ even sensuality _ that CDs
never seem to capture. The sound of a record simply had more
character.
</P>
<P>
   We may have shed most of the merchandise we acquired over the
years: Qiana shirts, lava lamps, and black-light posters. But our
album collection remained an inviolate part of our lives, through
dorm rooms to first apartments to first homes, through various
marriages and living arrangements and divorces. And through it all,
each album assumed a set of snaps, crackles and pops that ranged
from irritating to infuriating, but somehow we got used to them and
ultimately accepted them. Albums were like a collection of familiar
friends: You lived with the flaws and learned to love the records
all the more because of them.
</P>
<P>
   After a few playings, albums became as individual to us as DNA.
Within my record collection, for example, there was the loud,
familiar clicking near the English muffin line in Simon and
Garfunkel's ``Punky's Dilemma'' on their Bookends album. There was
the telltale skip at the beginning of ``Lay Lady Lay'' on Bob
Dylan's Greatest Hits album _ ``Lay acro ... acro ... acro ... acro
...'' _ which always needed a little nudge of the turntable arm to
get it back on track. The subtle series of pops at the transition
point in my copy of Sgt. Pepper's ``A Day in the Life'' soon became
an embedded aesthetic element of the song. Recently, when I heard
it on CD, it seemed to be missing something; my music memory had
integrated the flaws.
</P>
<P>
   I began tossing the albums in batches this past fall, and as I
did, I began to ruminate on my life in ways more poignant (and
somewhat more maudlin) than I could have anticipated. Or perhaps I
did expect to relive the pleasures and the pain, and that was what
made me so hesitant to finally do the deed: To consider each LP was
to confront my history in ways both aural and visual. Over the
course of a month, I privately eulogized each one before dropping
it into the trash bin. More than 2,000 bit the dust before I
finished. I tossed them slowly, with days of reflection in between,
before relegating them to rock 'n' roll heaven.
</P>
<P>
   I savored the associations of time and place that came and went
with each. The Beatles, the Moody Blues, Aaron Copland, Quicksilver
Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, the Monkees, Culture Club,
Bill Evans, Barry White, Van Morrison, Woodstock, the Animals,
Cream ... even Gary Lewis and the Playboys. I never anticipated
that this process, which started out to be so cleansing, would
become so unexpectedly grim. How do you say goodbye to Frank Zappa?
</P>
<P>
   Bidding adieu to a huge collection of record albums that have
gone unplayed for years is a symbolic act of leaving one's past
behind. These albums saw many of us through the better part of
three decades. Throwing out even a dozen records represents a
decade's worth of flashbacks in one dizzying moment. Perhaps it's
because our record albums had the power to understand us better
than any person ever could. In our most confusing years,
adolescence and early adulthood, music was our confessor, our
teacher. Such was the power of music that it could look into the
very corner of our souls.
</P>
<P>
   And that, finally, was why I procrastinated. It took me years to
start the process of tossing out my LPs and replacing them with
CDs. Gone are the album covers with the photographs and
illustrations that could instantly transport me back: Bob Dylan
walking down a windy New York street with a pretty girl beside him,
or the Siamese-twin heads of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel sprouting
from what appeared to be one black turtleneck. Or the
phantasmagoric Magical Mystery Tour cover. Let's face it: A
scaled-down Big Brother and the Holding Company CD in its flimsy
plastic case looks like it needs to be reconstituted. And as for
Sticky Fingers ...
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I tell myself, I'll have more space. I'll be
traveling lighter. It's time to move on. Why lug a sackful of
20th-century rocks into the new millennium? But as I tossed out my
collection, I saw that a part of me was being lost as well. In the
end, it turned out that my records had been playing me all along.
This ungainly collection of faded cardboard sleeves and their
timeworn vinyl inhabitants had become the one thing I hadn't
expected: witnesses to a life.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Tom Boardman had a frustrating trip. As head of
an influential South African financial house, he had gone to
Britain and the United States in mid-May seeking investors. But
every meeting started the same way _ with concerns about
instability in Zimbabwe, where a land grab has marred an election
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appetite for buying into South Africa has been tempered by
Zimbabwe,'' said Boardman, chief executive of the Cape Town-based
Board of Executors, a banking and asset-management group. ``They
all asked the same question: What makes you think South Africa
won't go the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   Western pessimism about Africa is nothing new, but more and more
people across the continent find it hard to take. Sure, they
concede, Africa has serious troubles. But writing it off as
``hopeless,'' as one influential British magazine did recently, is
too much of a generalization.
</P>
<P>
   From Ghana to Botswana, politicians, intellectuals, and
corporate captains assert that their continent has passed into a
new era, where good governance and economics are gradually becoming
the norm.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of this ``African renaissance'' lies a fundamental
change in the way Africans see themselves _ less as helpless
recipients, more as capable partners. After a century of foreign
exploitation and homespun mischief, Africans are knocking at the
doors of richer nations with briefcases rather than beggars' bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most essential factor of an African renaissance is our
perception of ourselves in relation to the global community,'' said
Malegapuru Makgoba, a prominent South African academic. ``Before
you can drive human rights, before you can drive economic
development, you have to be conscious of who you are and what you
want to be. We are becoming conscious of our own dignity and
self-respect.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the year, Africans heralded what they
enthusiastically called ``the African century,'' the dawn of an era
in which Africa would emerge as a vibrant marketplace in the global
village, rather than its festering ghetto. Gone were colonialism,
the Cold War, apartheid, and dictatorial Zaire. For the first time,
democratic governments ruled South Africa and Nigeria, the
continent's two most important hubs, at the same time. Africa, it
seemed, captured the millennium's spirit of new beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   But things fell apart, again. The government of Zimbabwe,
challenged by a surging opposition movement after two decades of
uninterrupted rule, let loose ax-wielding thugs against its rivals.
Mobs invaded white-owned farms under the pretext of land reform,
but then turned the occupied lands into ``re-education camps,''
beating black farm workers into allegiance to the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Floods devastated Mozambique. Rwanda and Uganda, two allies in
the multinational war in Congo, turned their guns on each other.
Famine struck arid Ethiopia, which then attacked its seaside
neighbor, Eritrea. And a ragtag rebel movement of boy-soldiers that
terrorized Sierra Leona a year ago by hacking the limbs off
children with machetes took 500 international peacekeepers hostage,
violating a peace accord that made its leader vice president of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The crises tapped a deep well of ink as the international media
cried for a hopeless continent. ``Brutality, despotism, and
corruption exist everywhere,'' the Economist magazine stated two
weeks ago, ``but African societies, for reasons buried in their
cultures, seem especially susceptible to them.''
</P>
<P>
   African intellectuals find such condemnations sweeping and
wrong, but not surprising. As late as 1987, Margaret Thatcher, then
prime minister of Britain, declared that ``anyone who thinks that
the ANC is going to run the government of South Africa is living in
Cloud Cuckooland.'' Just seven years later, African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela was sworn in as state president.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Mandela's successor, Thabo Mbeki, who spent
the latter part of May urging political and business leaders in
Britain and the United States to help developing nations combat
poverty, is that Africa's Western critics fail to distinguish one
African country from another. No one has said, Mbeki noted during a
recent fireside chat with a few foreign journalists, that the
Balkan crises of the past decade proved all Europe was culturally
barbaric. Yet, Africa is repeatedly seen as one entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of which, of course, is that when war erupts
between Eritrea and Ethiopia, it's Africa; when Foday Sankoh,'' the
rebel leader of Sierra Leone, ``and his people kidnap UN
peacekeepers, that's Africa; instability around Zimbabwe around the
land question, that's Africa,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela signaled two years ago that Africans wanted a new set of
rules. Standing alongside President Clinton at a news conference in
Cape Town, he chided the West for questioning his choice of
friends. Libya's Moammar Khadafy and Syria's Hafez Assad may be
international pariahs, Mandela said, but they supported black
liberation struggles.
</P>
<P>
   That tone may sound arrogant, said Mandela's longtime friend,
Mac Maharaj, but it derives from the decades of struggle against
oppression, and it still applies as Africans demand a new place at
the world's table.
</P>
<P>
   As the country that epitomizes Africa's positive shift, South
Africa is the moral and intellectual midwife of the renaissance
ideal. But the call for renewal resonates across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, Strive Masiyiwa, arguably Zimbabwe's most
successful businessman, has battled official corruption. As the
generation that fought against colonialism fades, he said, Africans
are rapidly shifting their view.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great challenges . . . revolves around this very
issue that, `Let's not wash our dirty linen in public.' That
mind-set has led to a lot of our greatest minds turning a blind eye
to a rising demagoguery in our society. That's what we have to
break. Comradeship must not be a refuge for lies and intellectual
dishonesty,'' Masiyiwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Makgoba said he sees a kind of second flowering of black
consciousness. In the 1970s, a dynamic young South African named
Stephen Biko argued that blacks needed to find their own self-worth
before they could find peace with their white oppressors. That same
ideal, Makgoba said, shapes Africa's emerging assertiveness. ``What
we are trying to say is, `Don't dictate to us.' That's an important
development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Themba Sono said fellow Africans shouldn't get
carried away with a renaissance ideal, particularly when children
are forced into soldiering, people sold into slavery, and
governments brutalize their people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a new man, prove it,'' said Sono, of the University
of Pretoria. ``Our priority should be to correct what's wrong, to
see that the thugs are brought to book and find humanity for
African people.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Mbeki said, is to build a more constructive
partnership between Africa and the West. Africa is rebuilding, he
said. South Africa is helping its neighbors to build aluminum
smelters and regional natural-gas pipelines. Nigeria has offered to
send election monitors to Zimbabwe. More and more leaders are
pressing their peers to adhere to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we looked at some detail at what is happening in Africa, it
is possible to isolate the bad things that are happening,'' Mbeki
said. ``What then do we do about Africa, not to deny the bad things
that are happening, but also not then to allow that those bad
things overshadow the very important work that is being done? I
would like us to have a look at this question.''

OLD TIRE FACTORY STOKES A NEW ENGINE IN RUSSIA

<P>
   YAROSLAVL, Russia _ This could be what hell looks like.
</P>
<P>
   Gaunt, sweating men heft massive metal and rubber objects onto
huge metal hooks, while others struggle with steaming, hissing
machines in 120-degree heat. The roar of machinery drowns out all
other noise; the infernal green steam blots out all sight.
</P>
<P>
   These are the first impressions created by a visit to the old
production line at the Yaroslavl Tire Factory, where they still
make tires the way they did when the place was built in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   But first impressions in Russia are often misleading. This is
not hell. Nor is it another example of Russia's descent into
post-Soviet industrial blight.
</P>
<P>
   If the long lines of job-seekers that form outside Yaroslavl
Tire are any indication, this is one of the most desirable
workplaces in this city of 600,000 on the Volga River, 120 miles
northeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavl Tire, which employs 8,000 workers, is also a prime
example of how Russia's crumbling, old smokestack industries,
neglected under years of socialist stagnation and post-Soviet
blight, could be on the verge of revival.
</P>
<P>
   A chat with the company's youthful general director, Nikolai
Tonkov, provides an intriguing look at the mixture that makes for
success in Russia's still-developing market economy. Agile
management, new ideas, and good timing are no doubt important. But
it helps quite a bit to have the financial backing of one of
Russia's oligarchic superconglomerates, in Yaroslavl Tire's case
the natural gas monopoly Gazprom. And the support of political
heavyweights is absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a good relationship with the authorities, you can
work,'' said Tonkov, who enjoys close ties with Yaroslavl's
Governor Anatoly Lisitsyn, and who served as a representative in
Yaroslavl for the recent election campaign of President Vladimir V.
Putin. ``I'll always try to be with the party that runs the
country. I'll never be in the opposition, because I realize that is
useless in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonkov, 33, received a reporter in Yaroslavl Tire's tastefully
remodeled front offices, which provide a first impression more in
line with the company's recent successes.
</P>
<P>
   A former tire salesman who had expanded his retail network to
100 stores across Russia before taking the top job at Yaroslavl
Tire two years ago, Tonkov has doubled company sales to $12 million
to $14 million per month. Workers, who used to receive their pay
several months late, and in tires that they had to resell, now get
paid on time and in cash. In a country where many companies have
been threatened with layoffs, Tonkov is expanding his operation.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tonkov's leadership, Yaroslavl Tire has changed its
mentality from a Soviet-style behemoth that mass-produced huge
amounts of unwanted tires to a smart player that is aiming for
Russia's growing market of motorists driving imported cars and
trucks. Gradually, the factory has begun replacing the 1930s-era
technology with new, automated machinery that pumps out the
steel-belted radials consumers want with a fraction of the labor
needed to produce the older lines.
</P>
<P>
   This leap into modernity has brought new challenges. Convincing
workers to embrace the new technology has not been easy. Stanislav
Pismarev, during a tour of the old production line, the roof of
which is still scarred by Nazi bombs from World War II, said
workers prefer the more familiar 1932 line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to teach people new skills,'' Tonkov said. ``The old
habits die hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge has been financing new equipment. No Russian
factory produces the latest machinery, so the company had to look
for expensive alternatives abroad. To afford them in an economic
environment where there is little interest in long-term investment,
Yaroslavl Tire had to tighten spending and cut corners on the heavy
tax burden placed on Russian enterprises, which Tonkov said totals
87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This is one area where the relationship with Lisitsyn, the
governor, comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to help with taxes,'' Lisitsyn said in an interview. He
said large employers like Yaroslavl Tire do not pay rent for their
premises. Lisitsyn caused a small uproar recently when he reduced
local taxes for manufacturers, then made up for the money by
introducing a trade tax paid by consumers. This is technically
illegal _ governors do not have the right in Russia to introduce
taxes _ but Lisitsyn defends his moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still forming the market in Russia, and we have to
protect our own producers,'' he said. ``Some day there will be
equal rules for everyone and governors here will have a reduced
role, like governors in the United States, but for now Russia has
89 regions with 89 different economies . . . we have to lobby the
interests of our manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisitsyn's lobbying has brought Yaroslavl Tire and another
rubber-products factory Tonkov recently acquired purchase orders
from government agencies for such equipment as tents for refugees,
medical supplies, and components for naval and military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russian governors like Lisitsyn will be able to retain
such powers is one of the questions raised by Putin's recent
attempts to tighten federal control over the regions.
</P>
<P>
   The political pact with Lisitsyn also came in handy last year,
when Yaroslavl Tire was up for sale. Tonkov was able to fend off
buyers who were hostile to the idea of him staying on as general
director, and with the governor acting as an intermediary, was able
to come to an agreement with Siburo, the Gazprom subsidiary that
eventually bought the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Close relationships between businessmen and politicians are
nothing new in Russia. But generally these ties have been exploited
in ways that benefit individual bureaucrats and factory managers,
not the public. A group of directors earned personal fortunes by
privatizing factories at ridiculously low prices, often through the
banks run by politically connected insiders. Then the best assets
were gradually siphoned away to offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Tonkov says he tries to explain to American businessmen _ and
potential investors _ that ``in Russia, there is not only
corruption, but also the development of competitive business.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task, and Tonkov knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that there are directors who can't earn profits
by manufacturing, so instead they incur millions of dollars of
losses while making a fortune in bribes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dishonesty at the workplace had a trickle-down effect in Soviet
factories that has been hard to overcome. One of Tonkov's reforms
was to hire a 700-member security detail for the industrial complex
to help crack down on rampant theft that had been crippling the
factory. (``We catch all the thieves,'' Tonkov said.)
</P>
<P>
   Tonkov is not hoping to make Yaroslavl Tire the next Michelin
anytime soon. A more realistic target is Matador, a Slovak tire
manufacturer that has made inroads in European markets after
overcoming decades of industrial stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   Even that seemed an ambitious goal two years ago, when Tonkov
was invited by Yaroslavl Tire's owners to take on the job of
commercial director, with the understanding that he would
eventually take over as general director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that the whole place was a mess,'' he said. ``They were
making one size of tire, no one bought them, no one knew how to buy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonkov replaced the old management with people from his tire
sales company, VVSh, and began restructuring Yaroslavl Tire.
</P>
<P>
   He was inadvertently helped by the August 1998 crash of the
Russian currency, the ruble, which actually helped Yaroslavl Tire
by temporarily making imports far too expensive for Russians to
buy. Tonkov's response included using a new, patriotic-sounding
slogan, ``Russian Tires for Russian Roads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Russian economy is stuck in the 1970s,'' he said.
``I hope the president looks at the successful companies, the ones
that have changed, and says, that's the way we should do it.''

PRICELINE FOR GROCERIES SAVES MONEY, SQUANDERS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Like so many bargain opportunities these days, Priceline.com's
new online bid-for-groceries service forces users to decide which
is more important: time or money.
</P>
<P>
   The service offers real savings over supermarket prices on
brand-name items, but requires users to spend more time shopping
and in the checkout lane.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there's a tradeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Deena Ferguson of Greenfield, Mass., put it well: ``I have found
it to be both a colossal pain in the neck and a great way to save
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The savings are what draw you in and keep you coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline WebHouse Club, a private affiliate of Priceline.com,
started doing business in the Boston area in mid-March. It already
has 25,000 members here and plans to expand nationally later this
year. The company says the average customer saves about $15 per
shopping trip.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. After signing up and giving Priceline your
credit-card information, you start shopping. The first 90 days are
free; after that, you pay $3 a month for months in which you use
the service.
</P>
<P>
   Say you want yogurt. Priceline gives you one size (8-ounce
containers) and three brands to choose from (Dannon, Colombo, and
Breyers). You have to choose at least two brands, but the odds of
having your bid accepted go up if you are willing to accept any of
the three.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline says the typical price for yogurt is 79 cents to 83
cents per container. It lets you choose whether you want to pay 65
cents (odds for success are put at 90 percent), 59 cents (75
percent), 50 cents (65 percent), 45 cents (50 percent), or submit
your own bid.
</P>
<P>
   I tried 50 cents and 45 cents with no success. You have to wait
24 hours before submitting a new bid. My 59-cent bid for three
containers was accepted, and the winning brand was Colombo. My
credit card was immediately charged, and I was given 90 days to
pick up my purchase at a participating Stop &AMP; Shop, Star Market,
Big Y, or A&AMP;P supermarket. Shaw's is expected to join soon.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline issues each customer a debit card. When you go through
the supermarket checkout, the groceries are scanned in the usual
way, and you use the debit card, which matches the groceries
scanned to what you've already paid for through Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   With Colombo selling for 75 cents a container last week at the
Stop &AMP; Shop in Quincy, Mass., I saved 16 cents per container by
shopping on Priceline. My biggest savings was $4.30 on a jumbo
package of Pampers diapers.
</P>
<P>
   For items that don't have multiple brands (milk, vegetables,
many meats), Priceline requires you to use half-price tokens. The
tokens, which also can be used on other items, guarantee bidding
success and substantial price savings.
</P>
<P>
   A gallon of milk, for example, cost $1.47 with one token. Perdue
boneless, skinless chicken breasts cost $2.13 a pound with two
tokens, instead of $4.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   There is even some price protection with Priceline. If your
local supermarket has an item on sale for less than what you paid
with Priceline, Priceline says it will make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline also currently honors all manufacturer's coupons and
swallows bottle and can deposits, but those benefits aren't likely
to last. Priceline spokesman Robert Padgett says coupon acceptance
will be phased out over the next two weeks, and the deposit
benefit's days are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem most consumers have with Priceline is that
it takes a lot of work to get the savings and, if you're not
careful, the whole process can end up being more trouble than it's
worth.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, a Priceline customer shops twice _ once online and
again at the store. You even have to check out twice at the store,
once with your Priceline items and a second time with any items you
decide to buy in the store that you didn't purchase through
Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Prybot of Gloucester says it takes an extra 15 to 20
minutes for her to shop online with Priceline. Daniel Smith of
Norwood says he gets dirty looks from the customers behind him in
line while he pays for his Priceline groceries and then repeats the
process for his other items.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with Priceline can get complicated. Gerald McCullough of
Westborough says it took him more than six weeks to extract credits
out of Priceline for coupons he had used. He also was charged sales
tax on items that are exempt from sales tax in Massachusetts, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Others have complained about how Priceline handles sales of
taxable items. The company collects sales tax on what Priceline
says is the prevailing price for the item in Massachusetts, not
what the customer actually pays for it or even what the supermarket
charges. The Massachusetts Revenue Department, which disagrees with
that approach, is currently investigating.
</P>
<P>
   While the savings with Priceline are respectable, several
consumers wondered how big they really are.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Nelson, for example, bought a box of Trix recently on
Priceline for $2.87. That represented a substantial savings over
the regular Stop &AMP; Shop price of $3.19, but it didn't look so good
when compared to the Shaw's price of $2.50.
</P>
<P>
   In my yogurt example above, I paid 59 cents for an 8-ounce
container of Colombo yogurt, a savings of 16 cents over the regular
Stop &AMP; Shop price. I could have bought the Stop &AMP; Shop brand of
yogurt for 50 cents and saved even more money. On every item I
purchased, in fact, a generic version could be purchased for less
than my winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that Priceline is for people who buy name
brands at full retail price. For those who look for sales or buy
store brands or make a trip to Wal-Mart for toiletries or
detergents, Priceline is not going to do you a lot of good,'' says
Rich Griggs of Taunton.
</P>
<P>
   The half-price tokens are another source of frustration. They
offer great savings, but many consumers see them as annoying
teases. You get six tokens for free when you start. To get more,
you have to buy them (six for $12.95), refer potential new members
(two tokens for four e-mail addresses), or sign on with a Priceline
partner. (Priceline is able to offer lower token prices because its
partners put up the money.) By buying a $25 subscription to Star
magazine, for example, you can get 12 tokens.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest complaint I hear from consumers is that you
have to take the brand and size Priceline gives you. While the
restriction is understandable, and for many people and many items
no big deal, it still can be annoying.
</P>
<P>
   As Susan White of West Yarmouth says: ``For many items, there is
only one brand that is acceptable to both me and the kids. My
9-year-old son can pick out the only spaghetti sauce he's willing
to eat in a blind taste test.''

WEB SITES OFFER TOOLS FOR VOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A personal finance and philosophical movement known as voluntary
simplicity has gone online, using the latest technology to spread
its message of living simply and saving money and other resources.
</P>
<P>
   Popularized by the bestselling book ``Your Money or Your Life,''
voluntary simplicity has gained hundreds of thousands of followers
around the country, with study groups meeting regularly in
Massachusetts and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the technology may seem contrary to a simple life, now
there are Web sites for people who have already begun living
substantially below their means for either personal finance or
philosophical reasons, and for those who are interested in learning
about the lifestyle trend.
</P>
<P>
   There's a site by the foundation that first published ``Your
Money or Your Life,'' as well as sites by authors of other books on
the subject. There is a site run by a nonprofit trying to redefine
the American dream toward ``more fun, less stuff,'' and one by an
organization called the Simple Living Network.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to personal finance and money-saving tips, some of
the Web sites emphasize such issues as protecting the environment.
While many of the adherents of voluntary simplicity start for
personal finance reasons, they often end up using their newfound
freedom from having to work just for a paycheck for such causes as
the environment or social injustice.
</P>
<P>
   For Marc Eisenson, co-author of the book ``Invest in Yourself:
Six Secrets to a Rich Life'' and a proponent of voluntary
simplicity for about 15 years, the lifestyle choice is all about
being able to spend time the way you want. He and his co-authors
share some of their secrets at the Web site
www.investinyourself.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to have to constantly be buying, buying, buying has
allowed me to live debt free,'' said Eisenson. ``I feel that work
is something you do for money that you wouldn't be doing otherwise.
That's what people do, they need money, they go to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had to work,'' said Eisenson. ``I've always been
able to do what I've wanted to do,'' working in his garden when he
feels like it, spending time with family, or giving money-saving
advice through books and a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   While the lifestyle isn't for everyone, here are summaries of
some of the voluntary simplicity Web sites for those who are
interested in finding out more:
</P>
<P>
   --www.investinyourself.com: Here, you can find out that
prepaying your mortgage with as little as $25 a month extra can
save you tens of thousands of dollars in interest over 30 years.
You'll also get tips on how to save more of the $2 million a
typical American family earns over a lifetime of working, by
spending less than you earn, avoiding debt, and taking other
money-saving steps. And you'll learn how much a new car can cost
you after you factor in interest and other costs. The site also
promotes the book of the same name by Eisenson, Gerri Detweiler,
and Nancy Castleman, as well as a newsletter called the Pocket
Change Investor.
</P>
<P>
   --www.newroadmap.org: At this Web site by the foundation that
first published ``Your Money or Your Life,'' you can learn more
about the nine steps outlined in the book, which is subtitled
``Transforming Your Relationship With Money and Achieving Financial
Independence.'' You can also link to a ``time value calculator'' on
Microsoft's MoneyCentral site, to figure out how much it really
takes out of your life to work that 40-hour work week, in terms of
commuting time, dry cleaning expenses, and other costs, whether you
earn $50 an hour or $100,000 a year. One of the aims of ``Your
Money or Your Life'' is to help people place a value on the time
they spend working solely for a paycheck, taking them away from
family and other activities they really care about. The site also
sells the book and an accompanying workbook.
</P>
<P>
   --www.fiassociates.org: Also started by the New Road Map
Foundation, this site provides further details about achieving what
``Your Money or Your Life'' calls FI, which stands for ``financial
intelligence,'' ``financial integrity,'' and ``financial
independence.'' There is information here about finding relatively
inexpensive health insurance if you don't want to keep working at a
job just for the health coverage. And there are answers to
frequently asked questions about the nine steps outlined in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   --www.angelfire.com/ma/fi/main.html: This is the home page for
the Massachusetts study groups following the ``Your Money or Your
Life'' program of watching your budget, reducing your expenses, and
otherwise living your life the way you want. Here you get a list of
the upcoming meetings and potluck dinners, as well as minutes from
previous gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   --www.awakeningearth.org: This is a Web site by Duane Elgin,
author of ``Voluntary Simplicity: Toward a Way of Life that Is
Outwardly Simple, Inwardly Rich,'' published in 1981, and ``Promise
Ahead: A Vision of Hope and Action for Humanity's Future,''
published this year. Elgin, who popularized the phrase voluntary
simplicity and describes himself as an ``MBA gone bad,'' comes to a
simple life more from an environmental and philosophical
perspective than from a personal finance angle. But his Web site
features links to other voluntary simplicity sites with such
information.
</P>
<P>
   --www.newdream.org: The Center for a New American Dream, a
Maryland nonprofit working to shift Americans away from what it
calls a culture of consumption, emphasizes environmental protection
and a better quality of life as its aims. The site's money and
personal finance page is a bit thin on content and has some
outdated links, but there are still some useful references for
anyone interested in learning more about reducing spending.

   ``As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised As A Girl'' by John
Colapinto; read by Howard McGillin; abridged, approximately 5
hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $24.
</P>
<P>
   This thoroughly researched and skillfully told profile of David
Reimer deserves to be an early candidate for best nonfiction book
of the year. Colapinto received the National Magazine Award for his
abbreviated version of Reimer's saga, which he detailed in Rolling
Stone a couple of years ago. ``As Nature Made Him'' is the rest of
that compelling story, including actual names and additional
horrifying details.
</P>
<P>
   Reimer, an identical twin, was the victim of a botched
circumcision in 1967. His parents, just older than teen-agers
themselves, followed the advice of medical experts and agreed to a
radical treatment, surgically altering their son to live as a girl.
</P>
<P>
   It was hailed as a landmark case by the physician championing
Reimer's sexual reassignment, Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins
University, as well as by feminists eager to tout nurture over
nature. But Reimer was never in the least comfortable being female,
which Dr. Money refused to admit, and late in adolescence went
through an excruciating series of operations (including a double
mastectomy) to have his gender reversed once again.
</P>
<P>
   Few abridged audio books make me want to pick up the text in its
entirety. William Least Heat Moon's travelogue ``River Horse,'' is
the only other recent book on tape I can think of that is so
riveting and well done that any modification of the original seems
unfair.

   ``Squandering Aimlessly: My Adventures in the American
Marketplace'' by David Brancaccio; read by the author; abridged,
approximately 3 hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $18
</P>
<P>
   I like the National Public Radio weekday business program
``Marketplace,'' which David Brancaccio hosts. And I enjoy
Brancaccio on that eclectic, often informative, award-winning show.
</P>
<P>
   But I have had a difficult time listening to ``Marketplace''
ever since I popped Brancaccio's first book into the car stereo.
This purports to be the author's financial pilgrimage, a
cross-country trip that details how we Americans spend, invest and
save our money.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: It doesn't work, perhaps because this is a heavily
edited version of the author's book, perhaps because the author
badly needed an editor he didn't have. Brancaccio's travels, from
Minnesota's Mall of America to Wall Street, could better be titled
``Wandering Aimlessly.'' While he regularly deploys routines used
during ``Marketplace,'' such as ``Let's take a look at the
numbers,'' he also goes off on tangents during different segments,
leaving the listener wondering what happened to the storyline.

   ``Pay It Forward'' by Catherine Ryan Hyde; read by Debra Monk,
with Leland Gantt, Enid Graham, Michael McGlone, Liam Norton, Anne
Pitoniak, Sharon Quinn and Gordon Weiss; abridged, approximately 4
hours; Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio; $23
</P>
<P>
   This simple story, about a 12-year-old boy who innocently hopes
he can change the world by doing good deeds and manages to have far
more impact than anyone could possibly have guessed, is in the
process of being made into a movie starring Kevin Spacey, Helen
Hunt and Angie Dickinson. That blockbuster cast almost assures it
of a lot of attention, possibly more than it merits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Pay It Forward'' is not quite as simple as it sounds:
Choose three people for whom you want to do a favor, and when they
ask to pay you back, tell them to ``pay it forward'' instead, to
find three people who they can help. It's a pyramid scheme of sorts
designed to generate goodwill in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   I won't give away the ending of this inspirational tale, which
has surprisingly well developed minor characters, but let me give
two words of advice to folks planning to see ``Pay It Forward'' in
the theaters: Take Kleenex.

<P>
   Susan Herring, associate professor of linguistics at the
University of Texas-Arlington, has been studying correspondence
from the Internet since before it was the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The computer network was initially called the ARPANET. Estimated
date of birth: 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Herring acquired transcripts of ARPANET
discussion groups from the 1970s and began to study them to see how
e-mail has influenced language.
</P>
<P>
   With that research, she launched the field of computer discourse
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Herring was looking at several factors in network and e-mail
language: etiquette, formality/informality, grammatical complexity,
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Her findings include:
</P>
<P>
   Sentence structure is simple but has not devolved into
fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Slang has become more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discourse markers'' usually found only in the spoken word are
common: ``oh,'' ``hey.''
</P>
<P>
   Errors decreased slightly over time.
</P>
<P>
   Herring found distinctions between the writing used in chat-room
discussions and that in e-mail. The former is less formal and
contains more typographical errors, abbreviations and simple
sentences as people type quickly to keep up with real-time
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail writers take more time to review their messages and clean
up errors. Formality depends on the recipient and purpose of the
message.
</P>
<P>
   In general, correspondence over the computer is a hybrid of
traditional writing and the spoken word. Chat rooms fall closer to
speech, while e-mail is more like writing.
</P>
<P>
   New words are being invented rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer technology is the biggest supplier of (new)
vocabulary,'' Herring says.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how many of those words seep into
common usage. Some have already come and gone - ARPANET, ``FTP''
(file transfer protocol) and gopher. The latter two are file
retrieval terms that predate the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend Herring has noted is the evolution of spelling as
words fall into common usage. Upper case is abandoned, hyphens drop
out. In many circles, Internet is no longer capitalized. E-mail is
often spelled ``email.''
</P>
<P>
   Old words take on new meaning. ``Spam'' once referred only to
the Hormel processed meat product. Now it denotes unwanted,
``junk'' e-mail and is both noun and verb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flame'' once referred to actual fire or was a slang term for
flamboyant homosexuality. In computer talk, it now means a message
sent with hostile content. &QL;

<P>
   StockGift.com makes perfect sense. But it feels all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This is a generational problem. Anyone who remembers the Beatles
live on the Ed Sullivan show is probably going to have trouble with
an online wedding gift registry set up to give the happy couple
shares of Microsoft. Or Lycos. Or AT&AMP;T. Or whatever makes their
portfolio sing.
</P>
<P>
   The service, started in February by Gino Heilizer out of
Washington, D.C., is similar to a department store gift registry,
except that instead of toasters, glassware, and china patterns, it
lists stocks and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of selecting an item, gift givers pledge money that goes
into an account the bride and groom will use to buy their
investments. If someone wants to transfer shares of stock from an
outside brokerage account, that can be arranged, too.
</P>
<P>
   Click, click, click and the deals are done, complete with an
electronic gift card. Also available for christenings, bar
mitzvahs, birthdays, and anniversaries. Cost to the recipients is
$19.95 per stock or fund, and they can choose up to four. Cost to
the giver is a 2.95 percent transaction fee on credit cards and
nothing for checks.
</P>
<P>
   So, what's not to like? This is a new millennium, practicality
is king, and Ed Sullivan is dead.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that some of us are unreconstituted romantics who
mist up over the wrapping paper in the Hallmark store. We spring
for the bows with the tacky bells attached and have invested
heavily in crystal over the years because, as our grandmothers used
to say, ``It means something.''
</P>
<P>
   Heilizer's sigh is as heavy as Waterford. ``People are very busy
and don't have time to buy gifts,'' says the 31-year-old
entrepreneur, who got his idea while planning his wedding two years
ago. He and his wife didn't need anything, but set up a traditional
gift registry as a convenience for friends and relatives. When his
wife put a cheese grater on their list just to fill the space,
Heilizer hit the wall and decided to change the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those defining moments in life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But what's wrong with a cheese grater, Gino? Not in the same
class with crystal, certainly, but a nice grater with a wooden
handle and different settings for strings, shreds, and chunks could
be pretty darn swell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asking people to spend money to come to my wedding and
also to waste money on gadgets we didn't need,'' explains Heilizer,
a man on a mission, who has 250 people registered on his site.
``I'm frugal. I drive a 10-year-old car.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Magee, 30, and Malachy Beare, 32, a Boston couple who
registered with StockGift.com for their August wedding, ply an
antiquated mind-set with more logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have a lot of the items couples traditionally
request on bridal registries, since we've been living on our own
and together for some time,'' notes Magee, who has a wedding Web
page with a link to StockGift.com. The StockGift site also features
a page on the couple, as it does for all registrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking people to contribute to our future and our
children's future,'' says Beare.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it a little cold asking people for money?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some stocks are very hot,'' quips Beare, whose registry lists
Microsoft, Cisco, and Motorola. ``And if you have a gift registry
at a department store, you're asking people for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Heilizer tries to put it in reassuring baby boomer terms:
``Think of it as a US Savings Bond, only better.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, maybe. But where is the joy of surprise? Where is
the spontaneity in the housewares department? What about intriguing
packages arriving in the mail? And does this mean nobody will laugh
for years to come at Uncle Charlie's taste?
</P>
<P>
   OK, an attic can have too much Uncle Charlie in it. But even a
hideous candy dish has a unique memory and some humanity clinging
to it.
</P>
<P>
   Can a stock certificate ever feel the same? That probably
depends on the eye of the investor _ or maybe it's the ear.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care too much for money
</P>
<P>
   Money can't buy me love
</P>
<P>
   Can't buy me love. Everybody tells me so.
</P>
<P>
   Can't buy me love. No, no, no no!

   ``WALL''
</P>
<P>
   By Andy Goldsworthy
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $35)
</P>
<P>
   The work of British artist Andy Goldsworthy is a wonderful
collaboration between man and nature, based in a vision that takes
eccentric liberties with ordinary things - leaves, rocks, thorns,
icicles, even raindrops. Goldsworthy has written other books, but
none more appealing than this one about a sculpture he created at
New York's Storm King Art Center during 1997 and 1998. Called Wall
that went for a walk, (CORRECT: Wall that went for a walk) it is a
2,278-foot stone wall that swirls voluptuously around trees and
juts across fields, plunging, at one point, into a lake and
reemerging on its far shore. At places on the wall, Goldsworthy has
set huge boulders in the stone - they seem to levitate, odd gems in
unlikely settings. Also here are photos of the many ``ephemeral''
artworks (the shelf life is brief, when you're working with wet
leaves) Goldsworthy created as the wall progressed. If you've never
seen his work, go to a bookstore and look at this, then take a
walk. You'll never see nature in quite the same way again.

   ``ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY''

</P>
<P>
   At New &AMP; Notable, we pride ourselves on our decorum, so we blush
to tell you that we started chuckling on Page 6, and were howling
and weeping by Page 24. This admission will come back to haunt us,
of course, but there you have it. We'll even say straight out that
David Sedaris is one of the funniest writers working today. It's
true that the pieces in this book are not as edgy (his critics
would say ``profane'' or ``vicious'') as those in his previous
collections, ``Naked'' and ``Barrel Fever.'' Some of his fans will
be disappointed by that, but we were not, nor were we put off by
the fact that Sedaris writes almost exclusively about himself - his
droll, often beleaguered persona is the ticket to the biggest
laughs. Best of all, Sedaris is a writer, not a comedian. He tells
stories, and you'd be hard pressed to pull one-liners from them
because there is humor in every word. If you read this book and
don't think it's funny, we do not want to hear about it. Now excuse
us while we reread page 24.

   ``REFLECTIONS IN BLACK''
</P>
<P>
   By Deborah Willis
</P>
<P>
   (Norton, $50)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our history,'' Richard Wright said, ``is far stranger than you
suspect, and we are not what we seem.'' His words take on meaning
when you see the early images in this handsome volume, a history of
Black photographers from 1840 to the present. African-Americans
produced photographs in the earliest days of the daguerreotype
process, creating an important ``counterimage'' to the exaggerated
features and demeaning situations often seen in depictions of Black
people. Black photographers were entrepreneurs, and many of their
clients were accomplished Black citizens and families. This volume
moves from the portraits of the 1800s and early 1900s to the
photojournalism of the 1930s and '40s, the social and artistic
movements of the 1950s and '60s and finally the social and cultural
content of contemporary photography. Willis is curator at the
Center for African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.

<P>
   ``IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE''
</P>
<P>
   By Lance Armstrong
</P>
<P>
   (Putnam, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong does things in a big way. Other people write
books about the long road back from cancer, or the physical and
emotional trauma of infertility, or the experience of growing up
without a father, or the determination it takes to win the most
important bicycle race in the world. Armstrong lays claim to ALL of
it, and the result is a pretty terrific book. Its appeal is due
largely to Armstrong's candor and tough, no-nonsense voice - there
will be no doubt in your mind why he won the 1999 Tour de France.
He's willing to let us wonder - because he wonders himself - why he
lived through the testicular cancer that spread to his lungs and
brain and left him with almost no chance of survival. Armstrong's
book is both inspiring and entertaining. He doesn't whine, doesn't
sugar-coat the tough parts and doesn't forget to thank the good
people who helped him most along the way.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy delivers a dense speech on
health care policy to the hundreds of students graduating Bentley
College.
</P>
<P>
   At the Berklee College of Music's commencement ceremony, John
Sykes, the president of the music video channel VH1, spends a good
chunk of his speech reciting the channel's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   And after receiving his first honorary degree from a US
university, Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams stands
before thousands graduating the University of Massachusetts at
Lowell and briefs them on the latest intricacies of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   Commencement speeches have long been the realm of inspiration,
including exhortations for graduates to fulfill their potential,
advice on the dos and dont's of adulthood, and other wisdom to chew
on as students depart the shelter of ivory towers.
</P>
<P>
   But not every student is graced by such rousing rhetoric. Most
colleges even prefer prominent people, such as a president or a
Nobel laureate, to make memorable policy announcements, as did
former secretary of state George C. Marshall in 1947 when he
announced the Marshall Plan at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, commencement speeches, all too often miss the point,
students say, with scientists detailing arcane theories,
politicians promoting party platforms, and corporate executives
touting products.
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy outlined the proposed ``Paycheck Fairness Act,''
one graduate said, ``It felt like this was just another chance for
him to get before a microphone.'' At Berklee, after Sykes's speech,
a student groused: ``Did he have to sell his product to us during
the ceremony?'' And at UMass Lowell, the friend of a graduate
wondered why politicians are invited to speak at commencements,
``It's about them and their cause, not the students.''
</P>
<P>
   In attacking ``trite, empty, long-winded orations'' in the
introduction of his new book ``Onward! Twenty-Five Years of Advice,
Exhortation, and Inspiration From America's Best Commencement
Speeches,'' Northampton writer Peter J. Smith spells out clear
rules of such addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches, he says, should be no longer than 15 minutes. They
should be witty and amusing. They should avoid the minutiae of
policy as well as ``then-now'' statements, including, ``When I
graduated the price of milk was . . . and now you all have webs to
deal with . . .''
</P>
<P>
   A speech should not be a screed, advertisement, recycled by the
insertion of a few current references or one better delivered on
the floor of the Senate, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many speeches deserve their crummy reputation,'' he said. The
political cartoonist Garry Trudeau, Smith writes in his book, once
said, commencement speeches ``were invented largely in the belief
that outgoing college students should never be released into the
world until they have been properly sedated.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, a now famous Chicago Tribune columnist felt
students' pain. So, she decided to offer her own advice. In an
attempt to sum up her life's lessons, Mary Schmich wrote a mock
speech advising students, among other things: ``Wear Sunscreen.''
After someone credited the speech to Kurt Vonnegut, it quickly
gained fame on the Internet. Now, people call Schmich for advice
before speaking at graduations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I wrote that, I never gave commencement speeches much
thought,'' she said. ``I just put myself in the place of the
listener. The last thing I would want is to be instructed on some
arcane topic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside every adult,'' she wrote in her 1997 column, ``lurks a
graduation speaker dying to get out, some world-weary pundit eager
to pontificate on life to young people who'd rather be
Rollerblading.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Schmich is one of the pundits, preparing for her first
live graduation speech this week at a community college outside
Chicago, she is trying to figure out how to rise above the pomp and
circumstance to hold the attention of an antsy crowd of caps and
gowns. Learning from the mistakes of others, she says, she'll talk
to students directly, not as a generic crowd. Also, she hopes to
impart some wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, you want to give people some thoughts that they will
take out of that room and carry with them the rest of their
lives,'' she said. ``It's just a thought or two that might come
back to them on a hard day.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many students have to suffer through long,
abstract speeches that have little to do with celebrating their
academic achievements. In protest, or out of boredom, large beach
balls can often be found bouncing through the rows of seated
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison Keillor, the author, culture critic, and veteran
commencement speaker, is harsh in his criticism.
</P>
<P>
   He compares most speakers to a ``small, dark cloud passing
through'' an otherwise joyous public occasion. And he believes
``the large cheeses and gray eminences and gasbags who go around
and get hooded'' should stay home and leave the day to the
graduates and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The function of the speaker is similar to that of the harpist
at the wedding reception: It's not a performance, it's to provide
atmosphere,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ``About nine out of 10
speakers forget this, and what you get is an elephantine ego coming
up and doing headstands. The audience is high as a kite and most
speakers take the excitement personally and talk a little longer.
They shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his thoughts, Noam Chomsky, the outspoken MIT
linguist, also responded in an e-mail: ``I am often invited to give
commencement speeches, but refuse when I can _ sometimes it's
uncomfortable to do so. It's not the sort of thing I like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether students would rather be Rollerblading, or anywhere else
not sweating under a June sun wearing a black gown, John C. Hoy,
president of the New England Board of Higher Education, says
commencement speakers have a duty to convey certain ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the last rite of passage that young Americans go
through,'' said Hoy, also a commencement veteran. ``It should
welcome them into the mature society as full-blooded adults. The
pitch should be: Life is more than making money, shouldn't be
confined to a narrow specialization, and should be lived fully.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the neoclassical columns at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology on Friday, Carly S. Fiorina, the CEO of Hewlett
Packard Co., delivered a version of that message.
</P>
<P>
   But before stepping to the podium, she was careful to consult
the graduates. After exchanging e-mails with scores of students,
she said, she learned some wanted her to address the future of
technology, women in the workplace, and the direction of Hewlett
Packard, while others said they preferred she didn't discuss those
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she said, the students made several things clear:
``You wanted this address to be based on my life experience, not
esoteric theory. You wanted to know the best way to make the
decisions you'll need to live life . . . and on one point there was
complete unanimity: Please don't run over your time.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hampshire College in Amherst last month, George Plimpton,
editor of the ``Paris Review'' and veteran of more than 20
commencement speeches, delivered an itinerant speech, laden with
humor, advice, and curious anecdotes about everything from the Earl
of Chesterfield to the woes of the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the best advice I've giv en,'' Plimpton said, ``is
telling students: `Go back to your rooms and unpack.' ''

   ``WALL''
</P>
<P>
   By Andy Goldsworthy
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $35)
</P>
<P>
   The work of British artist Andy Goldsworthy is a wonderful
collaboration between man and nature, based in a vision that takes
eccentric liberties with ordinary things - leaves, rocks, thorns,
icicles, even raindrops. Goldsworthy has written other books, but
none more appealing than this one about a sculpture he created at
New York's Storm King Art Center during 1997 and 1998. Called Wall
that went for a walk, (CORRECT: Wall that went for a walk) it is a
2,278-foot stone wall that swirls voluptuously around trees and
juts across fields, plunging, at one point, into a lake and
reemerging on its far shore. At places on the wall, Goldsworthy has
set huge boulders in the stone - they seem to levitate, odd gems in
unlikely settings. Also here are photos of the many ``ephemeral''
artworks (the shelf life is brief, when you're working with wet
leaves) Goldsworthy created as the wall progressed. If you've never
seen his work, go to a bookstore and look at this, then take a
walk. You'll never see nature in quite the same way again.

   ``ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY''
</P>
<P>
   By David Sedaris
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   At New &AMP; Notable, we pride ourselves on our decorum, so we blush
to tell you that we started chuckling on Page 6, and were howling
and weeping by Page 24. This admission will come back to haunt us,
of course, but there you have it. We'll even say straight out that
David Sedaris is one of the funniest writers working today. It's
true that the pieces in this book are not as edgy (his critics
would say ``profane'' or ``vicious'') as those in his previous
collections, ``Naked'' and ``Barrel Fever.'' Some of his fans will
be disappointed by that, but we were not, nor were we put off by
the fact that Sedaris writes almost exclusively about himself - his
droll, often beleaguered persona is the ticket to the biggest
laughs. Best of all, Sedaris is a writer, not a comedian. He tells
stories, and you'd be hard pressed to pull one-liners from them
because there is humor in every word. If you read this book and
don't think it's funny, we do not want to hear about it. Now excuse
us while we reread page 24.

   ``REFLECTIONS IN BLACK''
</P>
<P>
   By Deborah Willis
</P>
<P>
   (Norton, $50)
</P>
<P>
   ``Our history,'' Richard Wright said, ``is far stranger than you
suspect, and we are not what we seem.'' His words take on meaning
when you see the early images in this handsome volume, a history of
Black photographers from 1840 to the present. African-Americans
produced photographs in the earliest days of the daguerreotype
process, creating an important ``counterimage'' to the exaggerated
features and demeaning situations often seen in depictions of Black
people. Black photographers were entrepreneurs, and many of their
clients were accomplished Black citizens and families. This volume
moves from the portraits of the 1800s and early 1900s to the
photojournalism of the 1930s and '40s, the social and artistic
movements of the 1950s and '60s and finally the social and cultural
content of contemporary photography. Willis is curator at the
Center for African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.

   ``IT'S NOT ABOUT THE BIKE''
</P>
<P>
   By Lance Armstrong
</P>
<P>
   (Putnam, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong does things in a big way. Other people write
books about the long road back from cancer, or the physical and
emotional trauma of infertility, or the experience of growing up
without a father, or the determination it takes to win the most
important bicycle race in the world. Armstrong lays claim to ALL of
it, and the result is a pretty terrific book. Its appeal is due
largely to Armstrong's candor and tough, no-nonsense voice - there
will be no doubt in your mind why he won the 1999 Tour de France.
He's willing to let us wonder - because he wonders himself - why he
lived through the testicular cancer that spread to his lungs and
brain and left him with almost no chance of survival. Armstrong's
book is both inspiring and entertaining. He doesn't whine, doesn't
sugar-coat the tough parts and doesn't forget to thank the good
people who helped him most along the way.

   DINOBASE
</P>
<P>
   http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/dinobase/dinopage.html
</P>
<P>
   OK, here's a chance to impress your kids - maybe - while talking
dinosaurs are heavy on their minds. This site contains a treasury
of serious information about those beloved monsters that should
quickly acquaint you with some of the lore and lingo.
</P>
<P>
   On site, a big carnosaur (read: meat eater) welcomes you with
gaping jaws. Dinobase is packed with technical information, such as
names of species and genera. One unusual feature is a list of
dinosaur finds by year from the 1700s to 2000 {ndash} now you can
brag about what dino was found in the year you were born, if it
helps.
</P>
<P>
   One link includes ``101 Crazy Theories about Dinosaur
Extinctions,'' capsule summaries of about every possible
explanation that's been put out to explain the demise of the dinos,
ranging from mammals brunching on their eggs to slipped disks to
constipation to increasing stupidity due to a shrinking brains -
the ultimate in dumb and dumber.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the catastrophic explanations that are the
current favorites: meteorite impact and world-class volcanism. This
kind of end seems apt for the great beasts - and is a bonus for the
moviemakers. The site is put together by the University of Bristol
in England.

   ``FORBES''
</P>
<P>
   Cover story coaches millionaires on how to avoid raising spoiled
children. Upshot seems to be like, ``Hey, don't give them
everything they want without making them do a lick of work.'' But
(beginitalic)Forbes (enditalic)makes it sound better than that. And
longer. Waaay longer. The story is part of
(beginitalic)Forbes'(enditalic) huge ``Annual Investment Guide,''
which could come in pretty handy, especially if you're dabbling in
the stock market these days. One story talks about tax-smart
investing, while another warns how expensive divorce is becoming
these days. In the boring old British television section of the
magazine, two leading investment experts debate the market's
direction. This is basically the same tired bout: the value-based
old economy vs. the Internet-crazed new economy, which as you
recall, drew slightly less than Tyson-Holyfield on pay-per-view the
last time out. Another piece examines the scores of companies that
are lining up to host Web sites these days. Trouble is, their
profits might end up at www.pieinthesky.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``SMITHSONIAN''
</P>
<P>
   Magazine calls the repopulation of the bighorn sheep in the West
a ``conservation success story,'' noting that the population has
rebounded to 70,000 from a low of 23,000 around 1960. Article notes
that bighorn have benefited from ``better science, better
conservation and management practices'' and financial support. So
maybe they'll stop bonking their heads together in frustration.
Another article informs us that the mustard seed is the world's
most heavily traded spice. We'll tuck that away for that day we
finally make it on to (beginitalic)Jeopardy(enditalic)! ``No doubt
about it, mustard's on a roll in America,'' the article cracks.
Ouch. There's another piece that profiles Seattle's new Experience
Music Project, a 140,000-square-foot, $100 million museum and
general tribute to rocking out. In a wise move, they're calling it
EMP for short. As you might imagine, they've got a lot of guitars
there, including a fragment of one owned by Jimi Hendrix that was
smashed and burned at the 1967 Monterey festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``PSYCHOLOGY TODAY''
</P>
<P>
   Includes pretty interesting Q&AMP;A with Park Dietz, a top forensic
psychiatrist who has interviewed many of America's most infamous
criminals, including Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) and serial
killer, necrophiliac and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer. Dietz, who
consults for movies and the television show (beginitalic)Law &AMP;
Order(enditalic), said of Dahmer, ``I really liked him. He's one of
the few killers I've met who seemed to genuinely want to understand
himself.'' Yecch. Dietz also subscribes to the theory that, ``With
rare exceptions, people are responsible for what they do.''
Magazine also includes a story about the latest buzz diagnosis for
people who find themselves in pain all the time - fibromyalgia,
which has no known cause, no simple diagnostic test and no easy
treatment or cure. Hmm. Could be trouble. And in something we've
always suspected, a short Q&AMP;A says the stomach is the body's
``second brain.'' Hence the intense craving for a brat.
</P>
<P>
   ``SPIN''
</P>
<P>
   This magazine always gives the uninitiated the feeling that
they've walked in about halfway through the movie. For the most
part, if you don't know what the stories are about, you won't know
much more when you've finished. To wit, from a story about Moby, a
former DJ turned pop star: ``After (beginitalic)Go(enditalic), his
(beginitalic)Twin Peaks(enditalic)-sampling kick-drum anthem, was a
U.K. Top 10 hit in the rave blowup of 1991, he gradually morphed
into an agitprop, Jesus-thanking, disco-punk pariah with a penchant
for flinging off his shirt.'' Oh thanks. That clears everything
right up. There is an equally turgid piece on Trance, a new form of
rave dance music sweeping the world and involving all things
fluorescent. When we say our music's pretty, we mean it's pretty
loud. They also catch up with Hanson, the boy band who drove
everyone nuts with their big hit, ``MMMBop.'' Apparently, Ike, Zac
and Tay are growing up. Tay?

GIRL'S DEATH SPOTLIGHTS THERAPIES OF DESPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERGREEN, Colo. _ Like all the parents who bring their children
here for treatment, Jeane Newmaker was desperate.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, the North Carolina nurse practitioner looked for
one conventional solution after another _ through therapy, drugs
and counseling _ to control her daughter's explosive behavior.
Maybe something, Newmaker prayed, could make Candace a happier
person, well enough that the 10-year-old would, for the first time,
let her adoptive mother hold her.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked. And so, a couple of months ago, Newmaker
traveled to this mecca of attachment disorder clinics, a serene
Rocky Mountain town where for three decades hundreds of troubled
children like hers had been treated.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Newmaker is awaiting trial on charges of criminal
negligence child abuse for standing by as Candace died while
undergoing a controversial technique called ``rebirthing.'' In that
procedure, Candace was wrapped in a blanket to simulate the birth
canal, and four people pushed against pillows surrounding her to
imitate contractions. Those four, two therapists and a couple of
office workers who were asked to assist, are charged with felony
child abuse resulting in death.
</P>
<P>
   This case is far more than a personal tragedy for those
involved, however. It also opens a door into the rarely examined
world of American families riven by their efforts to deal with
children who cannot connect emotionally or physically with their
parents, and into the sometimes extreme remedies they are willing
to try. Mental health specialists believe there may be tens of
thousands of such children nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm most concerned because there are people across the country
doing bizarre, nonproductive, nonsensical sorts of witchcraft like
this rebirthing that took place in Evergreen, and passing it off as
therapy,'' said Ronald Federici, a psychologist who specializes in
neural development and is a leading authority on attachment
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the therapeutic, adoption, and child-welfare
communities nationwide are also abuzz about the implications of
Candace's death. They say that parents are becoming wary of seeking
aid for children who need it, and that too many adoptive parents
may assume their children suffer from attachment disorder when the
problem is often a different condition or just a matter of
readjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worrisome on a big scale for all those reasons
and more,'' said Federici. ``There's going to be a lot of fallout
across this country as a result of this.''
</P>
<P>
   A court in Colorado has sealed the videotape that the clinic in
Evergreen, Connell Watkins &AMP; Associates, made of the procedure that
ended Candace's life. But a police report based on an
investigator's viewing, as well as his interviews with the
participants, provides a vivid picture of what took place.
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, as the culmination of an intensive two-week
treatment program for which Newmaker paid $7,000, Candace began her
rebirthing. The fourth-grader was told to curl into a fetal
position on a flannel blanket in the office of Connell Watkins, a
therapist who has accumulated both ardent fans and harsh critics
during two decades of dealing with attachment disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The blanket was wrapped around Candace, gathered at the top, and
surrounded by four pillows. Connell and a fellow therapist, Julie
Ponder, ran the session; they were assisted in simulating
contractions by the office's business manager, Brita St. Clair, and
an intern, Jack McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to push hard if you want to be born, or do you want to
stay in there and die?'' one of the therapists replied when Candace
said she could not breathe, a complaint she repeated seven times
during the first 24 minutes of the 70-minute videotape. At another
point, after the girl insisted she wanted to die, the response was:
``OK, then die. Die right now.''
</P>
<P>
   When Watkins and Ponder unrolled the blanket, more than a
half-hour after Candace had stopped talking, they found her lying
motionless in her own vomit. She was taken to a local hospital,
where she was declared brain dead the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins's defenders, particularly parents who say her methods
have helped their sons and daughters, assert that the words to
Candace about dying weren't meant literally but were intended to
prod the child _ in a ``tough love'' way _ to confront her fears so
she could work through them.
</P>
<P>
   The rebirthing, in principle, is meant to induce such an intense
emotional experience that the child undergoes a catharsis and forms
new emotional and physical bonds with its parents, who have shared
the experience with them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the boys and girls with attachment disorders have
endured a combination of abuse, neglect, and neurological, genetic,
or developmental problems. About 90 percent are adoptees from
orphanages overseas and from the US foster care system; while only
a minority in these categories need more than routine help, such as
counseling or medication, mental health specialists say the overall
number of those with serious attachment disorders has risen
steadily in recent years as the rate of foster and foreign
adoptions has soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents who come here are usually demoralized,
disgruntled, and at wit's end with children who are angry, defiant,
and sometimes violent,'' said Terry Levy, codirector of Evergreen
Consultants in Human Behavior and the author of two books on
attachment disorders. Attachment therapists in Evergreen ``are the
last stop; if we don't succeed, the adoptions disrupt and the
children go back to foster care, to institutions, to somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Few mental health or child-care professionals consider
rebirthing to be a legitimate technique, but dozens of therapists
are thought to be practicing it around the country in various
forms. Douglass Gosney, a therapist in California who taught Ponder
the procedure, told police he had undergone rebirthing himself and
had performed it on 300 to 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Many specialists familiar with the issue blame the US medical
establishment, as much as they do the practitioners involved, for
the apparent proliferation of unorthodox and even potentially
dangerous therapies. They say parents often turn to alternative
treatments _ which are increasingly easy to find as a result of the
Internet _ because traditional therapists and doctors seldom
receive specific training on how to deal with attachment disorders
and other adoption-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absolutely a major, major problem,'' said Federici.
``These parents are looking for a rescue . . . and most of the
medical community doesn't know how to provide it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   While nearly everyone interviewed for this story decried
rebirthing as invasive and coercive, even some therapists who
disagree with Watkins's methods described her as a well-meaning
professional who wanted nothing more than to help her young
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Connell was always known as the therapist who took the worst
of the worst kids,'' said Forrest Lien, clinical director of the
Attachment Center at Evergreen. The center was the first facility
to specialize in attachment disorders when it opened almost in
1972; a handful of similar operations have opened here since, most
begun by people who, like Watkins, had worked for the center or
been trained by its personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would do anything to reach one of these kids,'' added
Lien. ``But this way of doing it was really bizarre, and look what
it caused. Now I'm afraid it's going to drive off other people who
really need help. I already see that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins's lawyer did not return phone calls, but he has publicly
described Candace's death as ``a tragic accident'' and not a crime.
The only lawyer in the case who agreed to be interviewed by the
Globe was H. Michael Steinberg, who represents St. Clair, the
office business manager.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg said St. Clair had only been following instructions in
an effort to help a girl who clearly needed it. ``She has dedicated
her life to . . . caring for children the world has discarded,''
said Steinberg, who added that his client is a longtime foster
mother who has adopted two children with severe attachment
disorders and one who is blind.
</P>
<P>
   All the defendants are free on bond, with court appearances
scheduled for September. Watkins and her colleagues face 16 to 40
years imprisonment if convicted, while the potential prison time
for Newmaker is 4 to 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Colorado Mental Health Grievance Board banned
Watkins and Ponder from practicing in the state.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the board said that, whatever the final
disposition of the criminal charges against them, Watkins and
Ponder had been practicing illegally because neither had licenses,
nor had they registered with the state as psychotherapists.
</P>
<P>
   Both have registered in the past, so their failure to do so may
have been an oversight. But Colorado is one of the few states that
permit people to work as therapists simply by registering, without
any formal qualifications or monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Critics cite that as one reason so many set up shop here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous, what's happening here in Colorado,'' said
Michael Orlans, who runs Evergreen Consultants with Levy. ``When
you don't have licensing or monitoring, anything can happen.''

   Cover story coaches millionaires on how to avoid raising spoiled
children. Upshot seems to be like, ``Hey, don't give them
everything they want without making them do a lick of work.'' But
(beginitalic)Forbes (enditalic)makes it sound better than that. And
longer. Waaay longer. The story is part of
(beginitalic)Forbes'(enditalic) huge ``Annual Investment Guide,''
which could come in pretty handy, especially if you're dabbling in
the stock market these days. One story talks about tax-smart
investing, while another warns how expensive divorce is becoming
these days. In the boring old British television section of the
magazine, two leading investment experts debate the market's
direction. This is basically the same tired bout: the value-based
old economy vs. the Internet-crazed new economy, which as you
recall, drew slightly less than Tyson-Holyfield on pay-per-view the
last time out. Another piece examines the scores of companies that
are lining up to host Web sites these days. Trouble is, their
profits might end up at www.pieinthesky.com.

   Magazine calls the repopulation of the bighorn sheep in the West
a ``conservation success story,'' noting that the population has
rebounded to 70,000 from a low of 23,000 around 1960. Article notes
that bighorn have benefited from ``better science, better
conservation and management practices'' and financial support. So
maybe they'll stop bonking their heads together in frustration.
Another article informs us that the mustard seed is the world's
most heavily traded spice. We'll tuck that away for that day we
finally make it on to (beginitalic)Jeopardy(enditalic)! ``No doubt
about it, mustard's on a roll in America,'' the article cracks.
Ouch. There's another piece that profiles Seattle's new Experience
Music Project, a 140,000-square-foot, $100 million museum and
general tribute to rocking out. In a wise move, they're calling it
EMP for short. As you might imagine, they've got a lot of guitars
there, including a fragment of one owned by Jimi Hendrix that was
smashed and burned at the 1967 Monterey festival.

   ``PSYCHOLOGY TODAY''

   Includes pretty interesting Q&AMP;A with Park Dietz, a top forensic
psychiatrist who has interviewed many of America's most infamous
criminals, including Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) and serial
killer, necrophiliac and cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer. Dietz, who
consults for movies and the television show (beginitalic)Law &AMP;
Order(enditalic), said of Dahmer, ``I really liked him. He's one of
the few killers I've met who seemed to genuinely want to understand
himself.'' Yecch. Dietz also subscribes to the theory that, ``With
rare exceptions, people are responsible for what they do.''
Magazine also includes a story about the latest buzz diagnosis for
people who find themselves in pain all the time - fibromyalgia,
which has no known cause, no simple diagnostic test and no easy
treatment or cure. Hmm. Could be trouble. And in something we've
always suspected, a short Q&AMP;A says the stomach is the body's
``second brain.'' Hence the intense craving for a brat.
</P>
<P>
   ``SPIN''
</P>
<P>
   This magazine always gives the uninitiated the feeling that
they've walked in about halfway through the movie. For the most
part, if you don't know what the stories are about, you won't know
much more when you've finished. To wit, from a story about Moby, a
former DJ turned pop star: ``After (beginitalic)Go(enditalic), his
(beginitalic)Twin Peaks(enditalic)-sampling kick-drum anthem, was a
U.K. Top 10 hit in the rave blowup of 1991, he gradually morphed
into an agitprop, Jesus-thanking, disco-punk pariah with a penchant
for flinging off his shirt.'' Oh thanks. That clears everything
right up. There is an equally turgid piece on Trance, a new form of
rave dance music sweeping the world and involving all things
fluorescent. When we say our music's pretty, we mean it's pretty
loud. They also catch up with Hanson, the boy band who drove
everyone nuts with their big hit, ``MMMBop.'' Apparently, Ike, Zac
and Tay are growing up. Tay?

<P>
   Imagine you're in business to sell a product. But before you can
sell it, you need to find out whether people want it. If it meets
their needs and fits their lives.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, any smart marketer needs to know how to find the
folks who might want what he or she's selling.
</P>
<P>
   Should the church really be any different?
</P>
<P>
   Percept Group, Inc., is a Costa Mesa, Calif.-based firm that
provides demographic-based data to churches, regional
denominational groups and religious organizations. And no, says
president and co-founder Mike Regele, the company isn't mixing God
and mammon. Rather, using tangible research, it helps churches get
a handle on esoteric matters like the soul and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The goal? To get mainline Christian denominations {ndash} whose
membership losses are well documented these days {ndash} moving and
growing.
</P>
<P>
   The method? Finding out the values, mores and religious
attitudes of people in pre-defined geographical spaces and selling
this data to religious bodies hungry for ways to reach the
unchurched.
</P>
<P>
   ``In times past,'' said Regele, ``when you knew your neighbor
and your community, you knew who those people were. So what
demographics do is give you a first-order picture of the people
among who you live.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church's role in North American culture has shifted from
the center to the fringes. As the churches begin to face that, they
realize their vulnerability is very real,'' and they must either
adapt or die.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks criticize these modern marketing methods, believing
the Church survived and thrived for centuries using old-fashioned
ways of spreading the Word. Regele, a Presbyterian minister and
congregational mission planner, begs to differ. Despite running the
numbers and studying sociological data, Regele says that
ultimately, Percept's 170 clients' success depends on the personal
touch. His company's research, he says, simply points the way.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Protestants {ndash} United Methodists, Episcopalians,
Presbyterians and Lutherans {ndash} are Percept's bread and butter.
But these days, even some Southern Baptist churches, Catholic
dioceses and non-denominational groups are using the firm's data to
retain and grow memberships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really rooted in a theological conviction,'' said Regele,
48, ``that the church is the sign and foretaste and instrument of
the mission of God in the world. Our whole evaluation is that the
church needs to be for others, not itself.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what prompted First United Methodist Church of Tempe,
housed on the main drag of Arizona State University, to check
Percept out. The 100-year-old church was stagnant, its pews filled
with 55- to 60-year-olds and very few of the college kids who
stroll past its doors each day.
</P>
<P>
   The church needed to know ``what kind of worship service the
community was looking for, and what we were providing,'' says the
Rev. David McPherson, senior pastor. ``We also know we're not
visible enough, so we're trying to find out what we can do with our
facilities to make us more visible.''
</P>
<P>
   So after investing $700 in Percept's survey of its own members
and a five-mile radius surrounding it, First United launched an 11
a.m. contemporary service a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   It features video clips from popular movies. Slide shows using
Microsoft PowerPoint, displayed on a big screen in front. Lively
bands jamming gospel tunes. And occasional skits that share the
Word with in-your-face style.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson admits that at first, all his older members weren't
with the program, but ``they do see that it's worth giving it a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It [helped] people get more focused on what Christ wants us to
do, rather than what (beginitalic)I (enditalic)want to do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true at St. Luke's at the Mountain, a small
Episcopal mission church near Phoenix's South Mountain. The
surrounding area was becoming largely Hispanic, although none
belonged to the congregation. Following a Percept survey, the
Episcopal Diocese of Arizona's Hispanic missioner, the Rev. Modesto
Mursuli, went knocking on doors, inviting residents to the church's
brand-new Spanish worship on Sunday evenings. Attendance now
averages about 60.
</P>
<P>
   `` I just looked at it as another way of spreading the gospel,''
Episcopal Archdeacon Bill Greeley said. ``You can no longer take
for granted people are coming. Out here, the Church has got to be
asking the questions the people are asking. `What's the meaning of
life? How can I make it to the next paycheck? How do I live in a
troubled marriage?'''
</P>
<P>
   Using two years' worth of Percept data, the Episcopal Diocese
hopes to plant three new churches in Phoenix, two in Tucson, and
one in Payson over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   And hopefully, help aging ones like St. Peter's in Litchfield
Park revitalize themselves as they reached out to new members and
searched for a new pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to go into the next millennium,'' Greeley said,
``they needed to reach out to young families with children. They
had to call someone who had that passion, because the face of the
congregation would change.''
</P>
<P>
   So, St. Peter's is upgrading its buildings, adding
family-friendly amenities to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do Percept customers learn about the community around
them, but also rediscovering some truths about their own
congregations in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' Regele says, ``the church is about a
story, has been telling that story for 2,000 years, and that's the
core of what it is.''

<P>
   Ice cream was once only an experience for the tastebuds of the
nobility, because of the difficulty in keeping foods frozen.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1600, ice cream was served in the first Parisian cafe. A
century later, ice cream was a unique dessert savored by the very
rich on special holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Early hand-turned bucket-sized ice-cream makers produced a
gallon or more at a time. But since Nancy Johnson of New Jersey
invented the first compact, hand-cranked ice-cream freezer in 1845,
new, more convenient models have been whipped up.
</P>
<P>
   The frozen treat became readily available in 1874 with the debut
of the soda fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Rich homemade ice cream was made from fresh cream, milk, sugar,
ice and salt, a process that required five or more hours of muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Today's electric ice-cream makers come in a variety of sizes
that are much smaller than early crank bucket models. You can still
purchase the earlier models, however. New space-saving devices can
also be left out on the counter, next to the toaster and
breadmaking machine.
</P>
<P>
   Electric models freeze with either salt and ice; an electrical
refrigeration unit; or a sealed chemical coolant. They make one and
a half to six quarts of fat-free sorbet, low-fat frozen yogurt or
ice cream in 20 to 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Making ice cream yourself is a great way to control calories and
dietary contents and eliminate preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some models even have a handy spout that lets you add nuts,
chips, crumbled cookies, candy, fudge or chopped fruit without
interrupting the freezing cycle.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain quality of taste and texture, do not freeze homemade
ice cream for more than two to three days. One quart of ice cream
serves approximately eight people.
</P>
<P>
   Cost ranges from $39 to $300 or more. Hand-cranked models cost
about $100. Ice-cream makers are not sold in all appliance
departments, so either call ahead first or shop the Web for
availability and bargains.

BUCHANAN CONFLICT COULD HERALD END OF REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are staking out town dumps, suburban malls,
and city supermarkets, collecting signatures to place the Reform
Party's presidential candidate on the Massachusetts ballot in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, no one is certain who the candidate will be. Or
if there will even be a national Reform Party worthy of the name in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Roiled by a divisive power struggle, the party that Texas
billionaire H. Ross Perot created is in danger of self-destructing
as newcomer Patrick J. Buchanan grapples for control of the
movement with Perot loyalists and other party regulars.
</P>
<P>
   Less than eight months after Reform leaders cheered Buchanan's
defection from the Republican ranks and his bid to succeed Perot as
the party's presidential contender, some party members and leaders
at state affiliates across the country are angrily pulling the
welcome mat from under the conservative commentator.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Buchanan prevails, the party is dead,'' said Jim Mangia,
national secretary of the Reform movement, reflecting the view of
many party regulars.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Buchanan sentiment has so mushroomed that some Reform
leaders are proposing such radical notions as bypassing the 2000
presidential elections altogether rather than entrusting Buchanan
with the party's political future.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, California Reform Party members rejected a move by Ross
Perot loyalists to keep presidential hopeful Patrick Buchanan off
the ballot in the nation's most vote-rich state, the Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   By a show of credentials, Buchanan's opponents joined his
supporters Sunday to kill a watered-down version of the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, which had been approved Saturday by eight of 13
members of the California party, originally called for the state's
organization to split from the national party after the convention,
unless Buchanan agreed to ``affirm'' the party's practice of
electing a vice presidential candidate at the national convention,
rather than leaving it up to the presidential candidate; to apply
no ``litmus tests'' to any running mate; and to make no attempt to
change the national party's platform to reflect his social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan got word of the California vote minutes after speaking
to about 50 people at the Rhode Island Reform Party Convention in
Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you're seeing is sort of last ditch efforts by
people who are unreconciled to my nomination to derail it, even if
it causes damage to the party, and they've failed at every stop so
far,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some longtime party members have not given up blocking him.
The Reform Party in Minnesota has already broken ties with the
national party and other state parties are considering the move.
</P>
<P>
   Other top Reform activists are pleading with Perot to rush to
the rescue. Some want Ralph Nader to jump in. But many are asking
Buchanan simply to go away and take with him his socially
conservative agenda that clashes with the Reform Party's generally
libertarian social platform.
</P>
<P>
   The tempest is like no other in the party's brief, tumultuous
history. And the stakes are great, not only for the Reform Party,
which wields a war chest of $12.6 million in federal matching funds
for the 2000 election. Both Republican and Democratic leaders fear
the possibility that a resurgent Reform movement could sway the
election's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is expected to escalate until the Reform Party
chooses a presidential nominee at its national convention Aug.
10-13 in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan advocates see the opposition as driven by hard-liners
reluctant to share the power they accumulated in the party's
formative years or miffed that Buchanan has overshadowed their
preferred candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is different elements of the party that
wanted candidates other than Pat but were unable to compete as well
as Pat,'' said Bay Buchanan, her brother's campaign manager.
``We're talking about a handful of disgruntled individuals who are
unhappy with their choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuck in the midst of the conflict are activists such as Andy
Lizotte, the Massachusetts Reform chairman who is mobilizing the
petition drive to ensure a spot on the Massachusetts ballot for
whoever emerges from the convention in Long Beach as the party's
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure how this is all going to unfold,'' Lizotte
said. ``It's one of those stay-tuned situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Turmoil has never hovered far from the Reform movement, from
Perot's mercurial quest for the presidency in 1992 to Minnesota
Governor Jesse Ventura's attempt to seize control of the party
apparatus in 1999. But nothing has shaken the party like the
Buchanan brouhaha.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are Buchanan's social agenda and his campaign to stack
state committees with his delegates to the national convention.
Buchanan's foes accuse him of trying to hijack the party to promote
his opposition to abortion, homosexuality, and more lenient
immigration policies, among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Several state committees recently adopted anti-Buchanan
resolutions, ranging from Colorado's proposal to forgo the 2000
presidential election to Connecticut's call for Buchanan to ``cease
and desist'' from ``demeaning and demoralizing'' statements about
the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to save this party, we have to take drastic
action,'' said Victor Good, chairman of the Colorado Reform Party.
``We need somebody who will be a leader of all the people, not a
divisive messenger of intolerance. We would just as soon have
nobody run for president and forfeit our matching funds than have
someone like Pat Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut resolution blasted Buchanan for publicly
describing the Reform Party as ``a dysfunctional `run-down
mansion,' '' for vowing to ``append'' his social views to the
party's platform, and for trying ``to take over state Reform Party
organizations or establish competing organizations in a number of
states, including Georgia, Wisconsin, California, and Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Donovan, the party chairwoman in Connecticut and the
organization's national press secretary, said the Reform movement
has reached a crossroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very serious, and it's going to take a real rising up of
a lot of the old-timers in the party to say, `Time out, this isn't
where this party was intended to go,' '' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan backers said they are not trying to give the party a
conservative makeover, and they described their push for delegate
support simply as a requisite step in securing the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Under party rules, primary ballots will be sent to about 1
million Reform members this month and the results will be announced
at the convention in August. However, the results could be
overturned by two-thirds of the convention delegates, so Buchanan
has gone after and captured the support of more than a third of the
delegates, enough to block an override if he wins the mail-in
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling very good about the delegate count,'' Bay
Buchanan said. ``We're very enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Perot, his top political adviser, Russell Verney, said
many party leaders and longtime loyalists were initially eager to
join ranks with Buchanan. Perot has said nothing publicly about the
chaos in the party or Buchanan's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a golden opportunity for the Buchanan camp to come
in and make a whole lot of friends,'' Verney said. ``I'm perplexed
because they have done exactly the opposite. Rather than come in
and cooperate, they have tried to coopt the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said many Reform members are concluding that Buchanan is
less intent on winning the presidency than he is on ``creating a
right-to-life party he can use as a fund-raising vehicle in 2001
and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan said her brother is focused solely on winning the
presidency, and she attributed Verney's criticism to his diminished
role in the party he served for several years as national chairman.
``He realizes the party is moving on,'' she said, ``and he is
having trouble with it.''

POMP AMID SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Normally, the best show on the bill at a federal
courthouse is not a trial but a ceremony welcoming new American
citizens. For inspiration, renewal of an old idea, and sheer drama,
you can't top it.
</P>
<P>
   But in Boston this Friday evening, you can. The place to be is
the US courthouse for the commencement exercises of the Urban
College, possibly the most unheralded &UR;  &LR; successful experiment in
higher education today.
</P>
<P>
   The college still doesn't have its own building, much less a
nickname or a football team, but the 76 adults getting associate
degrees in human services management, early-childhood education,
and general studies are arguably more important to this country's
future than any 76 graduates of Harvard, and I have more than a
suspicion that they have more on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Most are parents working low-wage jobs under heroic
circumstances and have spent years earning their degrees a course
or two at a time. Most are over 30, half haven't been near a school
for 10 years, and nearly half have been on welfare at some point.
Every one of them understands the value of his achievement against
all odds.
</P>
<P>
   Urban College has been around for seven years, but this year's
commencement is a special occasion for two reasons that represent
the official validation of its special niche in an educational and
political universe that is comically slow to recognize innovation.
The college is a place that stands all conventional wisdom about
``credentials'' on its myopic head.
</P>
<P>
   The first reason is the receipt last month of a federal grant
that will enable the college to expand its all-important services
to its unique student body. To most big-shot schools, $925,000 is
chump change, but tutorials, an information lab, links to available
social services, and the like are everything for an adult trying
like crazy to juggle kids, poverty, and school. Dr. Lee Hines, the
school's president, told me that the grant is a ``pivotal move,''
which strikes me as an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, more than 70 percent of those who enter Urban College
graduate, a retention rate that most places with mostly low-income
student bodies would die for. Motivation and curiosity, the most
important raw material for a good education, are a given there; but
the right blend of services can make its success even greater. It
should come as no surprise that the politician who cajoled his
fellow pols, harassed the federal bureaucracy to help nail down the
dough, and had the vision to get involved in the first place was US
Senator Edward M. Kennedy. For somebody used to dealing in
billions, there is no better example of the impact he has on
poverty fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason this Friday is special involves another key
higher education center for the people who count most in
Massachusetts _ Lesley College, a go-to place for those lucky
enough to be interested in child care and education. Last month
Lesley and Urban College became partners, and Lesley will recognize
its partner's courses for full credit. That means that those with
the guts to enter the associate degree program can look at a clear
path to a college degree if they stick with it. And Lesley will
take them in as juniors.
</P>
<P>
   For the 76 graduates _ indeed, for all 500 students at Urban
College _ this is life itself. All of the differences between
low-wage jobs and life above the median can be attributed to
education and training. A year or two of something after high
school makes a difference; a college degree makes all the
difference. The lessons Urban College's students teach the rest of
us are that for the roughly 7.5 million Americans working full time
in poverty, a return to school (along with a living wage) can work
wonders and that it is never too late.
</P>
<P>
   Urban College exists because of Action for Boston Community
Development's longtime head, Bob Coard. Unlike nearly every
population center in America, community action, the core of the
original War on Poverty, still exists in Boston because Coard has
kept it young and innovative. ABCD had always had an adult high
school program, and Coard first expanded it by feeding people into
participating colleges in the area.
</P>
<P>
   It was Coard who shepherded it through the long tunnels of the
higher education and State House systems, stole Dr. Hines from
Chicago and kept the focus on low-income, older adults. As always,
the very nature of ABCD's operation _ built on outreach, aimed at
those most in need, and using its existing programs like adult high
school and welfare-to-work, makes that possible. As Coard told me
last week, the ideal Urban College recruit is someone who under
normal circumstances would not even have a shot at community
college.
</P>
<P>
   This Friday, however, is about accomplishment, not obstacles.
With a lease on life and overdue recognition, the next challenge
for Urban College is to get its own building. And name it after Bob
Coard.

4.4 PERCENT SAVINGS RATE WON'T PRODUCE POSH RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I am contributing $166 a month to my Roth IRA. Do my
investments sound like good ones to you? I do not have an
employer-sponsored pension plan. How much will I need to save per
year to have a comfortable retirement?
</P>
<P>
   A.P., El Cajon, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  The short, unpleasant answer is: a whole lot more than you
are saving now.
</P>
<P>
   If you continue fully funding your IRA and achieve 10 percent
average annual investment gains for 29 years, you would amass
$868,734. But if inflation averages 3.5 percent, that pool would
have the buying power of about $320,000 in today's money; the buck
of 2029 would have the buying power of 37 cents of today's money.
</P>
<P>
   Let's approach it from another angle. Many people figure they
can live in retirement on about two thirds of what they need during
their working years. Thus if you retire at age 65, you would need
the 2029 equivalent of $30,000, basing the calculation on the
midpoint of your salary range. When you adjust that number for 3.5
percent inflation, the unhappy result is $81,356. You would then
need about $1.25 million to support withdrawals at that level
without depleting the principal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's take a third tack on the problem. Your current
savings rate, again using the midpoint of your earnings estimate,
represents a 4.44 percent savings rate. That might be acceptable if
you were also earning a pension, but that's not your situation. I
think you should adopt a strategy of saving 10 percent of your
earnings. If you were to save $375 a month, the pool would be
$1,292,627 at the end of 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since your income is likely to increase more or less
in line with the rate of inflation _ and ideally, faster than
inflation _ if you maintain the 10 percent discipline rather than
the $375 monthly payment you would have a considerably greater
amount saved. That would be a good thing, given that you will want
to have both a savings pool to provide an income stream and another
savings pool that can be left in growth investments to protect you
against post-retirement inflation.
</P>
<P>
   I did not factor Social Security into any of these calculations;
the time you are retiring is about the time, based on many
calculations, that pessimists say the Social Security system will
begin breaking down if nothing is done to shore it up. Some form of
Social Security is likely to survive. I just wouldn't want to base
my retirement security on the bet that it will.
</P>
<P>
   I have no problem at all with your choice of investments. The
one change I would suggest is that you concentrate your most
aggressive investments, such as the T. Rowe Price Science and
Technology holding, in your tax-deferred accounts, and your most
conservative (and those least likely to make major distributions)
in the taxable accounts. Since index funds tend to meet those
characteristics, the position in Vanguard Index Growth is
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   You probably won't want to move your current position in the
Price fund, given that there are probably adverse tax consequences,
but you should follow the idea of putting your most aggressive
investments in tax-deferred accounts when you are making further
investments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I am divorced and debt-free and plan to retire in 10 years.
I need to have an income of at least $2,000 a month after retiring.
How can I more productively invest my money for retirement? Am I on
target to meet my monthly income needs after retirement? How much
should I be saving each month?
</P>
<P>
   S.M., Sherwood, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  It seems to me you can afford very little risk, so I would
suggest nothing more aggressive than seeking a higher return from a
government-insured savings instrument. The nation's best rate on a
five-year CD entering last week was 8.11 percent. If you invested
your $27,000 at such a rate for 10 years, you would have $60,580
upon retirement (although there would be no assurance you would
enjoy the same rate after the first five years ends).
</P>
<P>
   The chief bugbear that faces you is inflation. Although it would
seem the interest from the CD would take you nicely above $2,000 a
month in 10 years, that picture is illusory. If inflation averages
3.5 percent for the next decade, you will need $2,821 to buy what
$2,000 buys today. Thus, you would be 21 percent shy of the
equivalent of $2,000 in today's buying power.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to suggest how much to save, given your fairly
limited income stream. If your projection that you would need
$2,000 a month for living expenses in retirement is based on the
fact that you are spending $2,000 a month now, this would mean you
currently have the ability to save $800 a month. If that is the
case, you would be in pretty good shape. Such a savings program
could build an account of $147,245 after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But since the effects of inflation would be steadily mounting as
those years elapsed, you probably could not maintain that savings
rate and hold your current standard of living. So my suggestion is
simply to save as much as you can.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I believe that the existing law involving IRAs requires
minimum withdrawals within six months after reaching age 70 1/2. My
intent is to continue working past that age. I believe I read
somewhere that if one is still actively employed after reaching 70
1/2, that person is not required to make withdrawals and can make
contributions. Is this indeed a viable option?
</P>
<P>
   T.F., Santa Ana, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  I'm sorry, but there is no way around the rules for
mandatory withdrawals from a traditional IRA after age 70. The
withdrawal schedule is a little more complicated than what you
outline. The first withdrawal must be made by April 1 of the year
following the year in which you reach age 70 1/2. Thus, you could
delay your first withdrawal until April 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a snag. If you waited until that date, the first
withdrawal would be for 2002 but would appear on your tax return
for 2003. Then you would also, during calendar 2003, be required to
take a withdrawal for the year 2003; effectively, you would face
two withdrawals on one tax return. For that reason, most people in
your situation would take their first withdrawal in late 2002 and
the second in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   As for contributions to a traditional IRA after age 70 1/2, the
answer is no _ it simply can't be done. But there are two wrinkles.
First, if you are married and your spouse is not yet 70 1/2, you
can contribute to an IRA in her name, provided you meet the earned
income requirements. Second, you can contribute to a Roth IRA after
age 70 1/2, provided you earn enough to qualify for the
contribution and don't earn too much to qualify for a Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q. &LR;  I have about $100,000 in a 401(k) plan that I want to
transfer to a rollover IRA. I realize my proposed allocation is a
fairly aggressive portfolio, but I am willing to incur some risk as
I do not plan to touch this money for at least 20 years. What do
you think?
</P>
<P>
   L.C., North Andover, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  I would suggest only one small change. Although the
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index holds 3,362 stocks, the portfolio
is market weighted, meaning the holdings are in proportion to the
market capitalization of the stocks in question. The effect of this
is that it is dominated by the large-cap domestic stocks _
substantially duplicating the position in Index 500.
</P>
<P>
   Since you would already have exposure to the small- and mid-cap
markets, why not boost the Index 500 position to 35 percent, and
put 10 percent in either Vanguard European Stock Index fund or
Vanguard Total International Stock Index?

<P>
   While surfing Web investing sites a couple of years ago, Stephen
Lepley came across some investing strategies promising to beat the
Dow Jones industrial average, with the offbeat names Dogs of the
Dow and the Foolish Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were starting to hear things on the Internet about the
Dogs of the Dow. I researched it a little bit. You knew you weren't
going to go broke if you're doing this,'' said Lepley, 43, of
Greenfield, Mass., who monitors investing sites from his home
computer and posts his own investing Web page.
</P>
<P>
   So, like hundreds of thousands _ if not millions _ of other
investors, Lepley jumped on board, attracted by the chance to beat
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   These contrarian strategies invest in the most beat-up stocks of
the 30 big-name companies that make up the Dow, with the
expectation that they'll turn around within a year and outperform
the index as a whole. The Dogs invest in the 10 stocks with the
highest dividend yields, often the lowest priced of the 30. The
Foolish Four chooses four stocks using a yield and price ratio.
</P>
<P>
   But the popular Dogs of the Dow severely lagged the index the
last two years, and isn't showing much more life this year.
Meanwhile, the related Foolish Four slightly trailed the Dow two
out of the last three years and is in its third revision since it
was first described several years ago by the Motley Fool in books
and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dogs and the Foolish Four _ it was a fad. And there are
other fads today,'' said Lepley, who works for ISO New England, the
region's independent electrical system operator. Although his
Foolish Four account made a double-digit profit the year he was in
it, it lagged the index, so he stopped following the strategy last
year. He now has his low-six-figure portfolio only in mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Waters, 32, of Newton, Mass., almost bought into the Dogs of
the Dow himself last year after receiving a ``very slick marketing
piece'' from Charles Schwab about its new offering following the
strategy. But when he sought advice on an online discussion board
at Morningstar.com, ``the responses I got from people were kind of
pessimistic,'' said Waters, a salesman for an Internet start-up.
``For a long time now, it's been kind of underperforming.''
</P>
<P>
   Are the Dogs permanently in the dog house, and are the Foolish
Four little more than fool's gold? Some critics say the Dow Dogs
are too popular a strategy for their own good or are doomed at the
bottom of the heap because they're old-economy stocks. Others say
the Foolish Four are nothing more than a statistical trick known as
data mining.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of these strategies say the Dogs will have their
day again. The stakes are high, with billions of dollars invested
in these and other Dow dividend-based strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding and tapping into the interest:
</P>
<P>
   --Big financial services companies including Merrill Lynch,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Charles Schwab, which now offer
ways to invest in the Dogs of the Dow strategy through so-called
unit investment trusts and individual stock brokerage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   --The Motley Fool, which touts the Foolish Four on its Web site
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   --Popular books that highlight some form of a Dow dividend
strategy, with such titles as ``Beating the Dow,'' ``How to Retire
Rich,'' and ``Investing Secrets of the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   --Mutual fund companies, which sell products with names such as
the Leveraged Dogs fund.
</P>
<P>
   --Web sites with such addresses as www.dogsofthedow.com and
www.topthedow.com.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy began with the book ``Beating the Dow,'' first
published a decade ago by Michael B. O'Higgins and John Downes. In
it, money manager O'Higgins and financial writer Downes describe a
beat-the-market method of identifying the 10 Dow stocks with the
highest dividend yields, and then buying equal dollar amounts of
the five lowest-priced of those 10. Hold them for a year and repeat
the process.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale behind the strategy, also known as a contrarian or
value-oriented approach: By investing in the highest-yielding,
lowest-priced Dow stocks, you're buying out-of-favor big-name
companies in the hopes they'll come back into favor during the year
in which you hold the portfolio. (Since the yield is a result of
dividing a stock's cash dividend into the stock price, a high yield
suggests a beaten-up stock price.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``Beating the Dow'' strategy became so well known among
investing circles that Barron's financial weekly newspaper
popularized the phrase ``Dogs of the Dow'' to describe it and
regularly updates readers on the strategy's performance. Although
O'Higgins and Downes focused on buying the five lowest-priced of
the 10 highest-yielding Dow stocks, most followers of the strategy
buy the 10 highest-yielding stocks.
</P>
<P>
   O'Higgins, a Miami-based money manager, now thinks the Dogs
don't have any legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became too popular,'' he said, plus the strategy currently
features what he calls ``some real dogs,'' such as International
Paper and DuPont, each down more than 20 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, O'Higgins has a new strategy, described in his latest
book, ``Beating the Dow with Bonds.'' The new strategy's indicators
have led him to put his O'Higgins fund 100 percent into long-term
Treasury zero-coupon bonds. His fund is up around 11 percent so far
this year while the Dow is down about 8 percent. (Last year, the
fund was down more than 20 percent, he said, while the Dow was up
more than 20 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Also critical of the Dogs of the Dow, but for other reasons, is
the co-author of another new book, ``Investing Secrets of the
Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that's raised against the Dogs of the Dow these
days: The universe of stocks on the Dow has a lower yield than in
the past,'' said William Donovan, a Massachusetts-based financial
journalist who co-authored the book with money manager Charles
Babin. ``The argument is the yield has shrunk because of the
turnover of companies in the Dow. I think that's a valid
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the relatively high-yielding stocks recently booted out of
the Dow: Sears, Chevron, and Goodyear. Replacing them were
low-yielding Home Depot and Intel, and no-dividend Microsoft. Since
the Dogs of the Dow strategy is based on buying high yields, some
critics say these changes in the Dow have caused the Dogs' recent
dismal performance.
</P>
<P>
   In their book and on the Web site topthedow.com, Donovan and
Babin describe another Dow dividend-based approach they say isn't
affected by such changes, and which they say has historically
outperformed both the Dogs and the Dow. The ``Total Return
Portfolio'' approach uses both growth in dividend payments and
yield to come up with the 15 Dow stocks to own.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of critics of these investing approaches.
But there are still plenty of others who continue to carry the
banner.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Mahoney, chief investment officer for Merrill Lynch's
Defined Asset Funds, which include the Select Ten unit investment
trust that holds the Dogs of the Dow, said ``Select Ten is a valid
and good strategy'' that can be an important part of a diverse
portfolio, representing the value investing style.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early part of the year, certainly you'd say value
stocks had not done very well. In 1999, growth outperformed value.
But look at it now,'' he said, explaining that the Nasdaq is off
more than 30 percent from its high. Now, ``value has been
outperforming growth,'' in the sense that value stocks are down
less than growth stocks since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch is the main sponsor of Select Ten, but other
companies including Salomon Smith Barney and PaineWebber also offer
it. The minimum investment is $250. Fees amount to 2.75 percent.
Select Ten now has about $9 billion in assets, down from $12
billion the end of last year, largely as a result of redemptions,
according to Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   Another diehard Dogs fan: Pete Grosz, founder of the
dogsofthedow.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a value investment strategy. I think a portion of your
investment would do well by it. It's good for diversification,''
said Grosz, a California-based online publisher who has personally
invested using the strategy since the early 1990s and launched the
Web site in 1995. The free site has grown to more than 20,000
subscribers, and Grosz just launched another investing site,
chartoftheday.com.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Dogs' recent poor performance, Grosz said: ``As we
say on the Web site, there will be some years that the Dogs will
underperform. Right now, with the market's attention turned toward
tech stocks, it's flowing away from value stocks. But we wouldn't
expect that would last forever. So that's why we stay put, and the
value stocks have just become a greater value relative to the tech
stocks and high-growth stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Once just a slight variation of the five high-yielding,
low-priced Dow stocks strategy, the Foolish Four now uses a ratio
that takes into account low price and high yield, by dividing the
yield by the square root of the price.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Coleman, portfolio manager for the Foolish Four, said the
four stocks selected using this formula are ``beating the market
right now, minus 1 percent vs. minus 3 percent,'' as of late May.
While that's ``not really something to write home about,'' she
added, the historical data going back to the 1960s show the stocks
fitting this formula each year do substantially better on average
than the overall Dow, the original Foolish Four, and the Dogs of
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1999 article in the Financial Analysts Journal entitled
``Mining Fool's Gold,'' and in an article this year in the American
Association of Individual Investors journal, Brigham Young
University associate professors Grant R. McQueen and Steven R.
Thorley criticized the Foolish Four for being nothing more than a
statistical trick known as data mining.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sort by yield, then by price, take the four lowest, then
throw out the second highest, and when the moon is full and you tap
three times on your chin. . . . If you look hard enough, you'll
find it,'' said McQueen in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for fun, we played that game,'' he said. ``We created
what we called the Fractured Four. The Foolish Four (an earlier
version) outdid the Dow on odd years, not even years. So tongue in
cheek, we tweaked the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The result: The Fractured Four trounced the overall Dow, the
Dogs of the Dow, and an earlier version of the Foolish Four, up by
34.82 percent on average between 1973 and 1996. ``Obviously, it's
absurd,'' McQueen said. He also said he was suspicious about the
way the Foolish Four has been redefined three times.
</P>
<P>
   Portfolio manager Coleman defended the latest Four, saying it is
not a result of data mining but a refinement in response to the
historical data.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the changes were a result of more data, better data to
look at,'' said Coleman, who has been a journalist, technical
writer, and Motley Fool publications and customer service manager.
He also studied finance for a year.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen remains unconvinced. Whether it's the Foolish Four or
some other variation of a Dow dividend approach focusing on five,
10, or 15 stocks, ``my common-sense advice is watch out, they're
not very diverse, they force you to trade a lot, and they don't
always manage your taxes very well.''

BALLOT INITIATIVES KEEP DEMOCRACY ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Winston Churchill suggested in 1945 that a referendum be
held to decide whether to extend the all-party government that had
led Britain during the war, Clement Attlee was appalled.
Referendums, the Labor Party leader spat, were an ``instrument of
Nazism and fascism.''
</P>
<P>
   David Broder doesn't go quite that far. But in a new book,
``Democracy Derailed,'' he makes it clear that he regards ballot
initiatives _ proposed laws that are submitted to a vote of the
people _ as a cancer on American democracy. The initiative process,
he writes, is ``alien to the spirit of the Constitution.'' It is a
``favored tool of millionaires and interest groups.'' It
``threatens to challenge or even subvert the American system of
government.'' And that's just on the first page.
</P>
<P>
   Broder is a highly respected political journalist, and his book
surveys the lively world of ballot campaigns with the careful
reporting and amiable tone for which he is known. He reviews the
history of initiatives, which grew out of the Progressive and
Populist movements around a century ago, and describes in some
detail how the ``initiative industry'' operates today. It is fair
to say he doesn't like what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   Ballot campaigns, Broder argues, undermine the republican form
of government the Founding Fathers created. On a vast array of
public issues, they bypass the very officials who were elected to
make public policy. ``Indications'' are that initiatives can be
deployed to hurt minorities. They are peddled to voters in
``blitzes of distortion and half-truths.'' Worst of all, the
initiative process allows powerful interests simply to buy the laws
they want. Is any of this really true?
</P>
<P>
   Take the tidal wave of initiatives that Broder says is flooding
American ballots. ``From 1976 through 1998, the average has been an
astonishing 61 initiatives'' per election cycle, he writes. ``In
1997-98, the number was 66.'' It is a theme he has pressed in
recent columns. ``Everyone knows it rains a lot here,'' he wrote
from Oregon in April, ``but lately it has been raining ballot
initiatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't reach for your umbrella just yet. On the legislative
weather map, ballot issues amount to little more than scattered
clouds. To begin with, initiatives aren't even allowed in 26
states. While that leaves 24 that do permit citizen-lawmaking, 56
percent of all ballot activity has occurred in just five:
California, Colorado, North Dakota, Arizona, and, yes, Oregon. Even
there, initiatives generally fail. Most never make it to the
ballot; of those that do, most usually go down to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Consider California, often thought of as a state in which ballot
politics is running amok. In the 89 years since California adopted
the initiative process, 1,043 ballot measures have been submitted.
Only 272 _ 26.1 percent _ qualified for the ballot. Only 87 _ 8.3
percent _ actually became law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the recent ``flood'' of initiatives crested,
voters in the 24 initiative states considered a total of 102
proposed laws. Of those, 45 passed. ``By contrast,'' says Dane
Waters, president of the Initiative and Referendum Institute in
Washington, D.C., ``the legislatures in those 24 states adopted
over 17,000 laws that same year.'' Voters may think ill of state
legislators, but they are not remotely close to displacing them as
the dominant makers of law in America.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, laws passed at the ballot box can be unfair. But for real
cruelty and injustice, you need a legislature. (It wasn't ballot
activists who segregated Southern drinking fountains.) And sure,
campaigns for and against ballot initiatives sometimes resort to
deceptive slogans and alarmist ads. The same can be said of every
other type of campaign in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Broder's greatest concern is that special interests with deep
pockets will hijack the initiative process for their own purposes,
spending whatever it takes to change public policy as they see fit.
He writes, for example, about the ``well-coordinated and richly
financed effort'' by three millionaires _ New York financier George
Soros, Cleveland insurance executive Peter Lewis, and Phoenix
businessman Joh Sperling _ to legalize the medical use of
marijuana. That effort met with spectacular success; of the five
``medical marijuana'' initiatives on state ballots in 1998, five
carried.
</P>
<P>
   It would indeed be cause for worry if initiatives were routinely
exploited by rich insiders for their own purposes. But they aren't.
Political scientist Elisabeth Gerber, surveying 168 ballot
campaigns in eight states, concluded that economic interest groups
``are severely limited in their ability to pass new laws by
initiative.'' Only 31 percent of intiatives backed chiefly by
special interests passed, while those put forward by broad-based
citizen groups succeeded 50 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the disadvantage is even more lopsided: 40
percent of all initiatives on the ballot in 1986-96 were adopted,
but only 14 percent of initiatives promoted by wealthy interests.
The pattern is the same in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy derailed?'' On the contrary, ballot measures keep
democracy on track. Representative government is not always
representative. When legislatures refuse to heed the voters,
initiatives can set them straight.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN K. LUDWIG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Blanketed with snow until midsummer, Mount Shasta's Upper
Panther Meadow was warm early last September and bright with Indian
paintbrush, yarrow and cliff penstimon.
 &HT;    From the trailhead at around 7,600 feet, my husband, Karl, and I
had walked gently uphill along a grassy creek to the source spring
considered sacred by Indians, who still conduct ceremonies there.
It is a small sandy pool rimmed by flowers and rocks, with lovely
cold water bubbling out.
 &HT;    After tasting the spring water we joined several others who sat
nearby meditating. Then we climbed a bit higher for another view of
the snowy slopes rising above us.
 &HT;    At 14,162 feet, Mount Shasta towers above the surrounding hills
and dominates the Northern California landscape for hundreds of
miles. It has long exerted an almost mystical pull on climbers,
philosophers and naturalists.
 &HT;    On his first view of it, the naturalist John Muir wrote, ``my
blood turned to wine,'' and in 1888 he proposed preserving the
region as a national park. It was an idea whose time never came,
although a fraction of the originally proposed acreage was finally
added to the National Wilderness Preservation System in 1983.
 &HT;    By the time of the Wilderness designation, the pristine rivers
that burst from mountain springs in the area and still make it a
prime fishing destination had long been harnessed by Shasta Dam
about 50 miles to the south near Redding, Calif.
 &HT;    Completed in 1945, the dam created Shasta Lake, whose placid
waters and 365 miles of shoreline offer tamer alternatives to
fishing and boating enthusiasts as well as providing water and
hydroelectric power for an area stretching 500 miles south,
including Sacramento.
 &HT;    Fortunately for preservation, the mountain itself is far from a
large urban area, though the region is served by a major
north-south highway, Interstate 5.
 &HT;    In all of surrounding Siskiyou County there are fewer than
50,000 people; the City of Mount Shasta has only about 3,600
inhabitants. The other small towns that skirt the mountain, Weed,
McCloud, and Dunsmuir, also offer dramatic views of the dual-cone
peak and the curious lens-shaped cloud formations that gather above
it.
 &HT;    All four towns, which grew out of the region's early lumber and
railroad-based economy, now enjoy clear air and clean water; they
also assume the risks of living beneath a volcano that is currently
dormant but fully capable of erupting again.
 &HT;    Although Mount Shasta's last reported eruption was around 200
years ago, bubbling sulfurous springs near the summit are a
reminder of the mountain's turbulent inner life. Historically,
eruptions have occurred on average every 600 years, but today
careful seismic monitoring of the peak offers the prospect of early
warning.
 &HT;    Unfazed, or perhaps attracted, by the risks, thousands of
climbers annually attempt the ascent. However, fewer than a third
of them reach the summit, according to the United States Forest
Service, often because they've failed to train and acclimate or to
inform themselves about route and weather conditions.
 &HT;    A few years ago my husband, Karl, and I spent several days near
the City of Mount Shasta while he prepared to climb the mountain.
(He succeeded.) Charmed by the area, we returned early last
September for a more leisurely four-day stay.
 &HT;    After savoring Mount Shasta's presence from the other historic
and picturesque towns, we paid a brief visit to Lake Shasta where
we toured ancient Shasta Caverns and Shasta Dam, whose completion
transformed the region.
 &HT;    This mountain is extraordinarily buoyant and powerful. Not
surprisingly, many Indians view it as a spiritual center, and
traditionally considered it the Great Spirit's teepee or the
gateway to the inner earth.
 &HT;    The magic of the setting has also attracted strange myths that
have the mountain inhabited by ancient civilizations or UFO-flying
aliens.
 &HT;    After checking in at the popular Strawberry Valley Inn on the
main street of the City of Mount Shasta _ challenging because the
reservation system was as quaint as the setting _ we walked to
Village Books nearby.
 &HT;    Over an espresso we scanned books about the mysterious races
said to live within the mountain, the Lemurians and Yaktayvians,
and recalled that in August 1987, the mountain was one of the
gathering sites for the Harmonic Convergence, a worldwide event
marking a particular planetary alignment. In the store, notices of
services and events were evidence of the metaphysical and
alternative-healing community drawn to the mountain.
 &HT;    After breakfast at the inn, based in a 1920s stone house that
has a lovely terrace with a mountain view, we were off to City Park
to see the spring that supplies the headwaters of the Sacramento
River.
 &HT;    A man was balancing on the mossy rocks filling plastic water
bottles with the freshest of water, which flows in a gushing stream
out of the hillside and tumbles down an incline past picnic tables
and sports fields.
 &HT;    Our next destination was a contemporary war memorial outside the
nearby town of Weed, and apparently one of its chief attractions.
To reach the Living Memorial Sculpture Garden, we drove a dozen
miles northeast of Weed on Highway 97 alongside desolate black
mesas of lava flow.
 &HT;    The sculptor and Vietnam veteran Dennis Smith has dedicated to
all veterans his 10 works in metal (he is finishing the 11th),
groups of larger-than-life human figures with vaguely alien
features, including ``The Refugees,'' ``POW-MIA'' and ``Coming
Home.'' They stand in an austere but pleasingly laid-out garden of
Ponderosa pine, manzanita and chaparral with an exhilarating view
of the glacier-covered north side of Mount Shasta. No one else was
there.
 &HT;    Later that afternoon, back in the City of Mount Shasta, we drove
up the mountain's Everitt Memorial Highway about 14 miles to the
Upper Panther Meadow trailhead to visit the sacred spring. At
around 7,600 feet, it is just half a mile from the highest point
accessible by car.
 &HT;    The next day we turned our attention from the natural world to
humans' impact on it. The Mount Shasta Fish Hatchery stocks many of
the streams and lakes of Northern California with catchable trout.
One of the oldest operating fish hatcheries west of the
Mississippi, it began production in 1888.
 &HT;    An original hatchery building now houses the Sisson Museum, the
local history and ecology museum named for the town founder, Justin
Sisson. Photographs and artifacts chronicle the early climbing
history of Mount Shasta, and working models reflect the importance
of the Southern Pacific Railroad that was an essential lifeline
from San Francisco to the north.
 &HT;    The nearby historic lumber mill town of McCloud was our
destination for the night. Founded more than 100 years ago, it
ceased being a company town in 1965, and the Champion International
Mill closed in 1979.
 &HT;    However, the McCloud Railway Company and the McCloud Hotel have
been rejuvenated to take advantage of its picturesque setting and
its proximity to fine fishing and winter sports. Layoffs at the
remaining mill, P&AMP;M Cedar Mill, which processes cedar for pencils,
had just been announced, a reminder of the lumber economy's
fragility.
 &HT;    The McCloud Hotel is a handsome three-story building, yellow
trimmed in forest green. From its front porch bordered with pansies
and garlanded with wisteria, we could see Mount Shasta. Our
attractive and comfortable standard room combined two original
rooms and provided an up-to-date bathroom.
 &HT;    Though our schedule didn't permit it, many hotel guests cross
the street to board either an open-air excursion train or the
Shasta Sunset Dinner Train.
 &HT;    Before moving on the next day, we drove about seven miles east
of town to see McCloud Falls. Accessible by car, the three-stage
falls and river provide inviting swimming and fishing holes, but in
September we saw only a few other people.
 &HT;    On a hike from the lower to the middle falls we saw a fisherman
catch a nice trout, lending credence to the McCloud River's
reputation. Back in town we made a short stop at the Heritage
Junction Museum, whose eclectic, well cared for collection of
community artifacts, displayed in one large room, includes logging
equipment, sporting goods and household items.
 &HT;    Back on Interstate 5, it is only five miles south to Dunsmuir, a
town built in the 1880s to serve the Central Pacific Railroad.
Originally called Pusher, it was named for the helper engines that
boosted trains over daunting grades along the Sacramento River
Canyon.
 &HT;    The small, old-fashioned downtown, listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, retains much of the 1920s architecture
of its heyday, and the trains (mostly freight) still roll through
the railyard almost hourly.
 &HT;    Just off the main street, Dunsmuir Avenue, are the visitors
center and the Enchanted Forest Porcelain Doll Factory. Here the
proprietor, Marian Anderson, produces collector-quality dolls with
some 650 faces and various ethnicities. Her not-for-children dolls
range in price from $169 to $2,000.
 &HT;    In the spirit of this historic railroad town, we spent the night
in a converted caboose. One exit south of Dunsmuir is the Railroad
Park Resort, where we checked into the Caboose Motel, where 22
cabooses and one boxcar, each an individual room, encircle a pool
and hot tub. We climbed aboard attractively decorated No. 17,
``Southern Pacific'' emblazoned on its side.
 &HT;    Our brass king-sized bed just left passage to the bathroom and
cupola, to which we climbed to enjoy our view of the towering
granite formations in nearby Castle Crags State Park.
 &HT;    After a smooth night on board our caboose, we headed to Lake
Shasta, about 35 miles south. The wild forested canyon and rushing
Sacramento River give way to the serene lake which forms arms and
fingers stretching into the neighboring hills.
 &HT;    Our first destination, Shasta Caverns, required a short boat
ride across the lake and a bus ride uphill. Even in September the
cool damp interior of the cave was a welcome relief from
temperatures in the '90s. We had to earn it on the tour, however,
by climbing up and down stairs, a total of 650 steps.
 &HT;    I'm not much of a spelunker, so I was happy that lighting was
good and stairs and paths well maintained. The limestone cave, long
known to Wintu Indians, was first explored by a white man, James
Richardson, with a Wintu guide, Charles Morton, in 1878 and opened
to the public in 1964.
 &HT;    Our hourlong tour refreshed our memories of stalactites and
stalagmites and unloosed our imaginations. Surrounding us were
dreamlike formations resembling popcorn and broccoli, or graceful
drapery and columns, and, directed by the guide's flashlight, a
tiger, pipe organ and castle.
 &HT;    Continuing on about 15 miles to 55-year-old Shasta Dam, the
second largest dam in mass in the United States, we parked right on
top. Down the 487-foot high spillway, three times the height of
Niagara Falls and the largest manmade waterfall in the world, only
a trickle of water flowed. Our guide explained that the lake was
down about 43 feet; in spring, with the winter rains and runoff, it
would probably be around eight feet from the crest.
 &HT;    He described construction of the dam from 1938 to 1945, a story
that is astonishing, both statistically and in human terms. For
instance, first a diversion tunnel 1,821 feet long had to be built
for the main line track of the Southern Pacific Railroad; then
workers labored for five and a half years pouring concrete 24 hours
a day to create the wall of the dam.
 &HT;    The tour included an echo chamber, the old railway tunnel that
later served to divert the river, and a view of osprey nests on a
power plant tower. A good tour, perhaps even, as the guide
maintained, ``the best dam tour in the USA.''
 &HT;    Leaving the area, we stopped at the vista point about a mile
from the dam, where we could see three Shastas: the dam and the
lake in the foreground and gleaming regal Mount Shasta in the
distance. While the dam was a powerful example of man's ability to
transform nature for better or worse, we were thankful for Mount
Shasta's mighty and humbling presence.

gathering sites for the Harmonic Convergence, a worldwide event
marking a particular planetary alignment. In the store, notices of
services and events were evidence of the metaphysical and
alternative-healing community drawn to the mountain.
 &HT;    After breakfast at the inn, based in a 1920s stone house that
has a lovely terrace with a mountain view, we were off to City Park
to see the spring that supplies the headwaters of the Sacramento
River.
 &HT;    A man was balancing on the mossy rocks filling plastic water
bottles with the freshest of water, which flows in a gushing stream
out of the hillside and tumbles down an incline past picnic tables
and sports fields.
 &HT;    Our next destination was a contemporary war memorial outside the
nearby town of Weed, and apparently one of its chief attractions.
To reach the Living Memorial Sculpture Garden, we drove a dozen
miles northeast of Weed on Highway 97 alongside desolate black
mesas of lava flow.
 &HT;    The sculptor and Vietnam veteran Dennis Smith has dedicated to
all veterans his 10 works in metal (he is finishing the 11th),
groups of larger-than-life human figures with vaguely alien
features, including ``The Refugees,'' ``POW-MIA'' and ``Coming
Home.'' They stand in an austere but pleasingly laid-out garden of
Ponderosa pine, manzanita and chaparral with an exhilarating view
of the glacier-covered north side of Mount Shasta. No one else was
there.
 &HT;    Later that afternoon, back in the City of Mount Shasta, we drove
up the mountain's Everitt Memorial Highway about 14 miles to the
Upper Panther Meadow trailhead to visit the sacred spring. At
around 7,600 feet, it is just half a mile from the highest point
accessible by car.
 &HT;    The next day we turned our attention from the natural world to
humans' impact on it. The Mount Shasta Fish Hatchery stocks many of
the streams and lakes of Northern California with catchable trout.
One of the oldest operating fish hatcheries west of the
Mississippi, it began production in 1888.
 &HT;    An original hatchery building now houses the Sisson Museum, the
local history and ecology museum named for the town founder, Justin
Sisson. Photographs and artifacts chronicle the early climbing
history of Mount Shasta, and working models reflect the importance
of the Southern Pacific Railroad that was an essential lifeline
from San Francisco to the north.
 &HT;    The nearby historic lumber mill town of McCloud was our
destination for the night. Founded more than 100 years ago, it
ceased being a company town in 1965, and the Champion International
Mill closed in 1979.
 &HT;    However, the McCloud Railway Company and the McCloud Hotel have
been rejuvenated to take advantage of its picturesque setting and
its proximity to fine fishing and winter sports. Layoffs at the
remaining mill, P&AMP;M Cedar Mill, which processes cedar for pencils,
had just been announced, a reminder of the lumber economy's
fragility.
 &HT;    The McCloud Hotel is a handsome three-story building, yellow
trimmed in forest green. From its front porch bordered with pansies
and garlanded with wisteria, we could see Mount Shasta. Our
attractive and comfortable standard room combined two original
rooms and provided an up-to-date bathroom.
 &HT;    Though our schedule didn't permit it, many hotel guests cross
the street to board either an open-air excursion train or the
Shasta Sunset Dinner Train.
 &HT;    Before moving on the next day, we drove about seven miles east
of town to see McCloud Falls. Accessible by car, the three-stage
falls and river provide inviting swimming and fishing holes, but in
September we saw only a few other people.
 &HT;    On a hike from the lower to the middle falls we saw a fisherman
catch a nice trout, lending credence to the McCloud River's
reputation. Back in town we made a short stop at the Heritage
Junction Museum, whose eclectic, well cared for collection of
community artifacts, displayed in one large room, includes logging
equipment, sporting goods and household items.
 &HT;    Back on Interstate 5, it is only five miles south to Dunsmuir, a
town built in the 1880s to serve the Central Pacific Railroad.
Originally called Pusher, it was named for the helper engines that
boosted trains over daunting grades along the Sacramento River
Canyon.
 &HT;    The small, old-fashioned downtown, listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, retains much of the 1920s architecture
of its heyday, and the trains (mostly freight) still roll through
the railyard almost hourly.
 &HT;    Just off the main street, Dunsmuir Avenue, are the visitors
center and the Enchanted Forest Porcelain Doll Factory. Here the
proprietor, Marian Anderson, produces collector-quality dolls with
some 650 faces and various ethnicities. Her not-for-children dolls
range in price from $169 to $2,000.
 &HT;    In the spirit of this historic railroad town, we spent the night
in a converted caboose. One exit south of Dunsmuir is the Railroad
Park Resort, where we checked into the Caboose Motel, where 22
cabooses and one boxcar, each an individual room, encircle a pool
and hot tub. We climbed aboard attractively decorated No. 17,
``Southern Pacific'' emblazoned on its side.
 &HT;    Our brass king-sized bed just left passage to the bathroom and
cupola, to which we climbed to enjoy our view of the towering
granite formations in nearby Castle Crags State Park.
 &HT;    After a smooth night on board our caboose, we headed to Lake
Shasta, about 35 miles south. The wild forested canyon and rushing
Sacramento River give way to the serene lake which forms arms and
fingers stretching into the neighboring hills.
 &HT;    Our first destination, Shasta Caverns, required a short boat
ride across the lake and a bus ride uphill. Even in September the
cool damp interior of the cave was a welcome relief from
temperatures in the '90s. We had to earn it on the tour, however,
by climbing up and down stairs, a total of 650 steps.
 &HT;    I'm not much of a spelunker, so I was happy that lighting was
good and stairs and paths well maintained. The limestone cave, long
known to Wintu Indians, was first explored by a white man, James
Richardson, with a Wintu guide, Charles Morton, in 1878 and opened
to the public in 1964.
 &HT;    Our hourlong tour refreshed our memories of stalactites and
stalagmites and unloosed our imaginations. Surrounding us were
dreamlike formations resembling popcorn and broccoli, or graceful
drapery and columns, and, directed by the guide's flashlight, a
tiger, pipe organ and castle.
 &HT;    Continuing on about 15 miles to 55-year-old Shasta Dam, the
second largest dam in mass in the United States, we parked right on
top. Down the 487-foot high spillway, three times the height of
Niagara Falls and the largest manmade waterfall in the world, only
a trickle of water flowed. Our guide explained that the lake was
down about 43 feet; in spring, with the winter rains and runoff, it
would probably be around eight feet from the crest.
 &HT;    He described construction of the dam from 1938 to 1945, a story
that is astonishing, both statistically and in human terms. For
instance, first a diversion tunnel 1,821 feet long had to be built
for the main line track of the Southern Pacific Railroad; then
workers labored for five and a half years pouring concrete 24 hours
a day to create the wall of the dam.
 &HT;    The tour included an echo chamber, the old railway tunnel that
later served to divert the river, and a view of osprey nests on a
power plant tower. A good tour, perhaps even, as the guide
maintained, ``the best dam tour in the USA.''
 &HT;    Leaving the area, we stopped at the vista point about a mile
from the dam, where we could see three Shastas: the dam and the
lake in the foreground and gleaming regal Mount Shasta in the
distance. While the dam was a powerful example of man's ability to
transform nature for better or worse, we were thankful for Mount
Shasta's mighty and humbling presence.

SHOPPING AROUND: WEEKEND DEALS IN AMERICAN CITIES  
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use
this article only by special arrangement. For purchase information,

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Let's hear it for the big-city weekend trip. Maybe the agenda is
to sleep late and breakfast in the room. Or spend the day wandering
through museums and shops before working out in the hotel health
club. Or dine well and see a show. But whether it's San Francisco,
Chicago or New York (or Atlanta, Minneapolis or Boston), the
two-nighter in the big city is a time-tested formula for
stimulation and restoration.
 &HT;    Weekend city deals are often a good buy because business
travelers are a Sunday-to-Thursday phenomenon. Come Friday and
Saturday, those giant Hyatts and Hiltons have rooms to spare. But
shop around to make sure that a big-city weekend doesn't add up to
credit-card shock a month later.
 &HT;    Thanks to the Internet, hotels have the ability to calculate
occupancy and sell rooms much faster and more efficiently than ever
before. This means that there are many room rates floating around
out there.
 &HT;    Sure, a low rate may sound good, but the extras can be painful.
The $20-a-day parking fee, the $15 continental breakfast and the
$8-per-person fee to use the health club are how hotels derive a
significant amount of their revenue. So try to get a low rate and
as many perks as possible up front.
 &HT;    The first step: Do your research. This is crucial for first-time
visitors to a city, but since hotels open, close and get renovated
all the time, it's essential for returning visitors to do as well.
A good city guidebook from Fodor's or TimeOut is fine, as are
Internet city guides such Digital City (www.digitalcities.com) and
Citysearch.com (www.citysearch.com).
 &HT;    Hotel brokers can be a good way to find affordable big-city
lodging. The best, nationally known ones, such as Quikbook (381
Park Ave. South, New York, N.Y. 10016; 800-789-9887;
www.quikbook.com) and Hotel Reservations Network (8140 Walnut Hill
Lane, Suite 800, Dallas, Texas 75231; 800-96-HOTEL;
www.180096hotel.com), offer discounts from 15 percent to 40 percent
off the so-called ``rack'' or published room rates in dozens of
cities around the country.
 &HT;    Other brokers, such as Express Reservations (3825 Iris Ave.,
Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-356-1123; www.express-res.com), work only
with New York and Los Angeles, while companies such as Washington
D.C. Accommodations (2201 Wisconsin Ave. N.W., Suite C-110,
Washington, D.C. 20007; 800-554-2220; www.dcaccommodations.com)
specialize in a single city _ in this case our nation's capital.
 &HT;    The advantages to working with a hotel broker are
straightforward. They promise to save a traveler money. Period.
Hotels are grouped by price range, and there's no charge for their
services. But not every hotel is available through a hotel broker,
and smart travelers call a property directly to check the price.
Because room inventory fluctuates, hotels sometimes have a lower
price rate than discounters in order to sell off empty beds.
 &HT;    Another good source for weekend deals are the major lodging
chains, which frequently have lots of empty rooms on weekends.
Again, smart travelers call a property directly, call the chain's
toll-free number, visit the chain's Web site and see if the
property is available through a hotel broker. That may sound
time-consuming, and even overkill, but the room rates can vary
widely for the same room at the same property.
 &HT;    Some rates may include breakfast or parking privileges, while
others may be cheap, bare-bones room prices that can jump
dramatically once extras such as parking and breakfast are added
on.
 &HT;    Some hotel Web sites, like Marriott International
(www.marriott.com), require consumers to go through a
trial-and-error process for the best rates. Others are easier to
navigate and advertise their deals. Hilton Hotels (www.hilton.com)
has ``Hilton Value Rates'' for its properties _ rates that can also
be e-mailed to travelers every week.
 &HT;    Both Westin Hotels &AMP; Resorts (www.westin.com) and Sheraton
Hotels &AMP; Resorts (www.sheraton.com) have ``Hot Rates'' _
Internet-only specials that provide up to 20 percent discounts on
weekends.
 &HT;    Hyatt Hotels and Resorts' Web site (www.hyatt.com) features
``Special Offers,'' with rates for ``Value,'' ``Getaway Next
Weekend'' and ``Packages.'' For a given property, the prices and
perks can greatly differ.
 &HT;    The two on-line giants, Travelocity.com (www.travelocity.com)
and Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), are also sources for weekend
deals. The latter recently purchased Travelscape.com, which gives
it a base of thousands of hotel rooms around the country. They also
send out periodic discount hotel e-mailings.
 &HT;    For those who are flying, yet another source of weekend hotel
deals are offered by the airlines. Although the number of cities is
limited in nature, virtually all of the major carriers offer such
deals, often through their Web sites, including Delta
(www.delta-air.com), American (www.aa.com) and Continental
(www.continental.coml).
 &HT;    Delta Vacations, for example, has Standard, Preferred and
Ultimate air/hotel/transfers-inclusive vacations, based on hotel
categories. The cost obviously depends on the city chosen. But
because of the highly changeable nature of airfares between major
American cities, this convenient way of booking a city weekend may
not yield the best price.
 &HT;    For those who are flying, free spirits can let their trip be
dictated by the e-fares that the airlines post every week and which
Smarter Living.com (www.smarterliving.com) collates and sends out.
Just remember that most of these last-minute fares are only good
from Saturday to Monday or Tuesday.

D.C. Accommodations (2201 Wisconsin Ave. N.W., Suite C-110,
Washington, D.C. 20007; 800-554-2220; www.dcaccommodations.com)
specialize in a single city _ in this case our nation's capital.
 &HT;    The advantages to working with a hotel broker are
straightforward. They promise to save a traveler money. Period.
Hotels are grouped by price range, and there's no charge for their
services. But not every hotel is available through a hotel broker,
and smart travelers call a property directly to check the price.
Because room inventory fluctuates, hotels sometimes have a lower
price rate than discounters in order to sell off empty beds.
 &HT;    Another good source for weekend deals are the major lodging
chains, which frequently have lots of empty rooms on weekends.
Again, smart travelers call a property directly, call the chain's
toll-free number, visit the chain's Web site and see if the
property is available through a hotel broker. That may sound
time-consuming, and even overkill, but the room rates can vary
widely for the same room at the same property.
 &HT;    Some rates may include breakfast or parking privileges, while
others may be cheap, bare-bones room prices that can jump
dramatically once extras such as parking and breakfast are added
on.
 &HT;    Some hotel Web sites, like Marriott International
(www.marriott.com), require consumers to go through a
trial-and-error process for the best rates. Others are easier to
navigate and advertise their deals. Hilton Hotels (www.hilton.com)
has ``Hilton Value Rates'' for its properties _ rates that can also
be e-mailed to travelers every week.
 &HT;    Both Westin Hotels &AMP; Resorts (www.westin.com) and Sheraton
Hotels &AMP; Resorts (www.sheraton.com) have ``Hot Rates'' _
Internet-only specials that provide up to 20 percent discounts on
weekends.
 &HT;    Hyatt Hotels and Resorts' Web site (www.hyatt.com) features
``Special Offers,'' with rates for ``Value,'' ``Getaway Next
Weekend'' and ``Packages.'' For a given property, the prices and
perks can greatly differ.
 &HT;    The two on-line giants, Travelocity.com (www.travelocity.com)
and Expedia.com (www.expedia.com), are also sources for weekend
deals. The latter recently purchased Travelscape.com, which gives
it a base of thousands of hotel rooms around the country. They also
send out periodic discount hotel e-mailings.
 &HT;    For those who are flying, yet another source of weekend hotel
deals are offered by the airlines. Although the number of cities is
limited in nature, virtually all of the major carriers offer such
deals, often through their Web sites, including Delta
(www.delta-air.com), American (www.aa.com) and Continental
(www.continental.coml).
 &HT;    Delta Vacations, for example, has Standard, Preferred and
Ultimate air/hotel/transfers-inclusive vacations, based on hotel
categories. The cost obviously depends on the city chosen. But
because of the highly changeable nature of airfares between major
American cities, this convenient way of booking a city weekend may
not yield the best price.
 &HT;    For those who are flying, free spirits can let their trip be
dictated by the e-fares that the airlines post every week and which
Smarter Living.com (www.smarterliving.com) collates and sends out.
Just remember that most of these last-minute fares are only good
from Saturday to Monday or Tuesday.

GORE'S GOT SOMETHING TO LEARN FROM HIS RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this stage of the presidential campaign, everything seems to
be going Texas Governor George W. Bush's way, and nothing seems to
be going right for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's too early to stick a fork into Gore and say he's
done, it may be time for him to find out why Bush is hot and he's
not.
</P>
<P>
   It is early in the campaign season, but not so early that Gore
can afford to let things slide. The impressions candidates make in
the spring and summer stay with voters in the fall. Usually, voters
are more attracted to candidates who are closer to, or move to, the
political center on most issues, as did President Clinton during
his last election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it appears that Bush has been more successful than Gore
in in making this shift to center.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, Bush made a decision that helped him
appear the ``compassionate conservative'' he has long claimed to be
(although he certainly did not resemble one during his battles with
Arizona Senator John R. McCain, when both men staked out
conservative ground.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Thursday suspended a Death Row inmate's execution for 30
days so DNA tests can be conducted to prove whether he raped and
killed his 12-year-old stepdaughter. If DNA proves that Ricky Nolen
McGinn is not guilty, he will not qualify for the death penalty in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It was Bush's first reprieve in a capital case, and comes after
approving 131 executions as governor. Still, it helps to soften his
image, at least temporarily. And it echoes the new concerns about
use, and misuse, of the death penalty _ concerns that prompted
Ilinois Governor George Ryan in January to impose a moratorium on
executions in his state.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, according to reports, granted McGinn's reprieve less than
a half hour before the scheduled execution. With that last- minute
decision, Bush showed he can make the right move when the
opportunity presents itself.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Gore hurt his campaign when he tried to take
advantage of the Elian Gonzalez saga by publicly siding with the
Cuban-American families who wanted to keep the boy in Miami, with
relatives, rather than return him to his father in Cuba. Gore won
few, if any, converts among the Cuban-American families with what
critics called his ``pandering'' to a select if powerful group of
Florida voters, and he angered most of his African-American and
other Democratic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is still recovering from the political damage done when he
declared that a family court in Florida should decide Elian's fate.
Meanwhile, Bush _ whose conservative credentials allowed a similar
stand _ emerged unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush himself could be accused of pandering to moderate
voters with this Death Row reprieve, very few Republicans, or even
Democrats, will likely criticize him for giving a man a last chance
to prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Gore's woes with his constituency is his support of
the bill that would give Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to
China over strong objections by labor unions, who predict the
measure will cost workers' jobs. After passing the House of
Representatives two weeks ago, the bill is expected to be easily
passed in the Senate in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There are other issues, such as health care, Social Security,
and education, as well as other labor issues that could bring
Democrats, and even independent voters, back to Gore's candidacy.
But he will have a hard time overcoming the damage done by the
Elian issue, because it gave some credence to critics' argument
that Gore will do or say virtually anything to get elected. That
goes right to the core of questions about Gore's character.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal court's ruling in Atlanta last week that Elian
would not be granted asylum to stay in the United States, and with
some court-watchers predicting that no other court, not even the US
Supreme Court, will overturn the lower court's decision, it may be
wise for Gore to turn matters around on the Elian issue.
</P>
<P>
   One way would be for Gore to have, as Atlanta-based political
pollster Harry Ross suggested, a summit meeting. The meeting would
include key Democrats, including African-Americans, Hispanics, and
liberals who would discuss their feelings over Gore's Elian opinion
and provide a rationale to put the issue behind them.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Democrats want to get Gore elected in November. If he
stumbles along the way, they must pick him up, dust him off, and
get him moving forward again _ even if he is headed toward the
political center. As recent history has shown, the presidential
candidate who gets to the center first, and holds it right up to
election day, has a good chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is to get to the political center before Bush, he has to
do less stumbling and more running _ with clear vision and a
purpose. And he had best begin now.

HORSE SENSE PREVAILS IN THIS MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any day now I may be faced with the choice of buying food for
the horses or groceries for Michael and me. I suppose we can aways
forage for food. I need to lose weight, so it might even be a good
thing. And I'm already getting some practice foraging because
Michael has me combing the neighborhood for dandelion greens, for
the horses.
</P>
<P>
   At first I was a little reluctant to pitch in and help. What
would the neighbors think? But Michael assured me the neighbors
would be glad to get rid of the dandelions. Most people think of
dandelions as weeds, although they cost $1.49 a bunch at Bread &AMP;
Circus. Those are the organic ones, unsullied by pesticides. The
horses like the $1.49 greens, but they like the foraged variety
too. They don't seem to notice the difference, not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The other day we were picking dandelions in the park and I heard
myself say, ``Oh, there's a big one over there,'' and I realized
that once again I'd been sucked into the vortex of Michael's horse
madness. Not that I needed to be reminded.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Michael started spending time on the backside of
Suffolk Downs, working for the trainer Carlos Figueroa, mucking out
stalls, hot-walking the horses, doing whatever needed to be done.
It was strictly volunteer work. Michael wanted to learn the
business from the ground up, and Figueroa agreed to teach him.
``You are a student at Figueroa University,'' he told Michael,
``and you are on scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael's original plan was to write a book. I happen to know
that he has accumulated enough notes to write something roughly the
size of the Oxford English Dictionary, but the book is never quite
finished. There's always another story on the backside. And the
stories are like horses: One inevitably leads to another.
</P>
<P>
   The first horse was Fly McGrew. Michael and some friends bought
Fly and invested more than $11,000 in his training and upkeep. Not
long after Fly returned from a vacation _ six weeks of aqua
aerobics at a New Hampshire training center _ it became clear that
the horse simply didn't want to run. These days he has a new career
as a show horse, and is doing nicely, winning ribbons right and
left.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Michael's investors understandably dropped out. The
faithful few invested in another horse, Invigorate, then another,
Summer Attraction. Luis Arzola, Figueroa's nephew, trains the
horses. Michael is in charge of pampering them. He buys 100 pounds
of carrots a week and cuts them into dainty pieces. He picks
dandelion greens for them, with some help from me. Last week, he
brought home their dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   There are feed bills, vet bills, farrier bills, trainer bills.
The horses get regular rubdowns from Gina Smythe, their massage
therapist. At one point there was talk of consulting a horse
psychic, but that hasn't come to pass, not yet. All these things
cost lots of money. Both horses have been doing well. They're
supporting themselves, more or less, for the moment. But in racing,
you can't be sure of anything, except more bills.
</P>
<P>
   When we met, Michael had yet to become interested in horses.
When we married it was for better or for worse. I don't recall
anything being said about horses. Occasionally I remind him that
one of my aunts was married to a trainer, for a while. My ex-uncle
is a lovely man. I never understood why she left him, until now. In
those old Westerns, when a man has to choose between a horse and a
woman, the horse always wins. I used to think that was a joke. It's
not. But you know, dandelion greens don't taste all that bad in a
salad.

A CLASH OF CULTURES AND COUPLES

   Le Mariage &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Diane Johnson. Dutton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   322 pp. $23.95. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Le Mariage'' is the story of a marriage about to commence in
France, and another that is headed for the skids. But its main
attractions are social satire and a string of wonderfully
interconnected crime capers, and only in a roundabout way is this
novel about marriage itself.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Diane Johnson's last novel, ``Le Divorce,'' a funny,
first-person story of the thrills of Paris through the wide eyes of
a college-age California woman who has just arrived there, ``Le
Mariage'' takes a while to warm to. In fact ``Le Mariage'' is a
delight and a frustration to read _ delightful for its amusing
insights on the clash of French and American cultures, frustrating,
at least for the first 100 or so pages, for its jaded outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, mostly cagey veterans of Parisian life, are
self-centered and naive, the French narrow and class-conscious. The
women eye one other as rivals, alliances among the men are far from
easy, and no one's motives are the least bit noble.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway through, though, the story picks up steam with the
arrest of Clara, an American and former film actress who lives in a
Paris suburb with her filmmaker husband, Serge Cray. She faces the
trumped-up charge of destroying a historic monument, i.e.,
remodeling her house, though the real beef against her and her
husband is that they won't allow hunting on their property.
</P>
<P>
   As Clara languishes in jail, a national scandal in the French
tradition ensues. Though their neighbors are incensed at being
barred from land they've hunted for years, French sentiment in
general is against hunting. It is the charges connected with their
house that finally make the Crays unpopular. Newspapers on the
right and left weigh in, and television commentators ponder the
American erosion of French traditions. Much of the book's humor and
misunderstandings are generated by this clash of cultures; the
Americans often wind up on the losing end for trying to live in a
country they cannot fully understand.
</P>
<P>
   As the characters' lives unexpectedly collide, the book achieves
a lively balance between their actions and their inner reflections.
Johnson inhabits each one through fine stream-of-consciousness in
which a character's voice comes through as the focus shifts.
</P>
<P>
   She starts with Clara, whose perfect life seems in jeopardy well
before she lands in jail. Her beauty and distress attract a young
American journalist, Tim, who becomes a highly-paid aide to the
Crays. Their French neighbor, Antoine de Persand (who made his
first appearance in ``Le Divorce'' as the brother of a runaway
husband), also falls in love with Clara and offers to intercede on
her behalf in the battle over hunting.
</P>
<P>
   There are some obvious ironies _ Tim's attraction to Clara, for
example, grows as his wedding to the very French, somewhat snobbish
antiques dealer Anne-Sophie looms. But the book also offers
surprises. One of the funniest scenes happens just after one of the
scariest. Clara, who's become a pariah over the hunting question,
is harassed by a bunch of local Frenchmen. Her unintentional
revenge comes as she flees them: ``The hunters, half laughing, half
angry, crowded the car but made no effort to impede them as they
started up. Then Clara shifted into the wrong gear, first instead
of reverse. As it lurched forward into the crowd of men, she
slammed on the brakes and killed the motor. The men pulled back
from this dangerous display of inept driving, except for one who
screamed, `Mon pied, mon pied! Madame!' She had stopped on his
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has a gift for comedy and surprise. We're led to think
that an American tourist, Delia, whose desires seem commonplace,
wants to go to the Louvre to see the art; later she's suspected of
going there to have a liaison with her lover, Gabriel, who's on the
lam in connection with a stolen manuscript. The real reason for
Delia's Louvre trips is one of the book's many comic twists.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson exploits the naivete of American characters who would
never describe themselves that way, especially Tim, who thinks he
knows the score because he is clever enough to write for both a
left-leaning publication and one on the right, while simultaneously
tracking down the stolen manuscript for a police friend and trying
to arrange for Serge to buy it. The French characters _ for
instance Anne-Sophie, who is about to marry an American without any
understanding of American life _ are skewered mainly for their
ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the plot that makes for eager reading: Will Clara be
found guilty, finally, and sentenced for the crime? Will
Anne-Sophie and Tim make up before they venture down the aisle?
Will Serge find out about the attraction between Antoine and Clara?
</P>
<P>
   If ``Le Divorce'' looked at what can happen when a couple splits
up and the families start squabbling, ``Le Mariage'' gives us what
happens when people's lives converge. The joke is that many of the
same things happen _ people fall in love, betray each other, or
cause some other kind of catastrophe _ around both occasions.

THE SEASON OF ADVENTURE FOR THE ARMCHAIR TRAVELER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hedgehog was abject. Having stumbled into the bookstore
without his reading glasses, he saw only miles of shelves before
him _ titles he could barely ascertain, colors of vivid but
indistinguishable promise, seas of text that offered the mysteries
of the deep but no map by which to navigate. ``Whatever shall I
do?'' he asked the wise old owl, who, having singular vision, had
already taken up a familiar perch in the corner and was immersed in
E. O. Wilson's ``The Ants.'' ``I have misplaced my glasses and
neglected to make a reading list,'' said the hedgehog, wretchedly.
``What shall I read? How shall I choose?''
</P>
<P>
   The owl, accustomed to plaintive inquiries from creatures great
and small, paused only for effect. ``That all depends, my dear
fellow,'' he told the hedgehog, ``on where you want to go. Or,
perhaps more to the point, who it is you want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Diligent readers of this writer may recall the little hedgehog
from summers past, as he only emerges from his long hibernation
(much of it spent reading Goethe) to comment upon fair-weather
reading. But the old owl's point is well-taken. All of us read, at
some subliminal level, in order to venture to another realm, be it
the icy tundras of 19th-century Russia or the hot prospects of
Silicon Valley. Stupefied by commutes and commitments and the daily
tedia of modern life, we gravitate toward a biography of Mozart or
Lincoln _ and, for a few hours or days, see before us the streets
of Paris or feel the moral weight of American battlefields.
Literature provides an infinite itinerary that nonreaders may
respect but cannot fully appreciate; we can go anywhere, at any
time, for as long as we like _ without having to pack or worry
about the traffic. Like Tanglewood for the classical music buff or
London's West End for the theater maven, reading affords us flights
of fancy that elevate the senses, however fleetingly, to a higher
plane. There the world is richer and simpler both; there, the
prison of self that dictates much of real-time experience is, for a
little while, exchanged for a day pass to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that we gaze upon this year's vacation fare as vistas
of possibility, offering transport to foreign lands, and even
temporary foreign identities, for the armchair traveler. The genre
that may accomplish this fastest is that of adventure or expedition
literature _ what Brookline Booksmith has wonderfully titled its
``Oh No!'' section. Soon enough George Clooney will be starring as
Sebastian Junger's ``The Perfect Storm'' reaches the screen, taking
that last great wave on the Andrea Gail; a newer maritime entry in
Oh-No lit is Nathaniel Philbrick's ``In the Heart of the Sea: The
Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex,'' the story of the 1820 Nantucket
whaler calamity that inspired ``Moby-Dick.'' Kevin Patterson
describes a less eventful but more literary voyage in his account
of sailing to Tahiti, ``The Water in Between: A Journey at Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   If hypothermia is your thing, you'll appreciate the
calorie-by-calorie horror of this year's Everest bounty, the best
of which are probably ``The Lost Explorer: Finding Mallory on Mount
Everest'' by Conrad Anker and David Roberts, and ``Lost on Everest:
The Search for Mallory &AMP; Irvine'' by Peter Firstbrook. John Balzar
went the distance at lower altitudes, though scarcely less arduous,
in his thousand-mile sled-dog run across the Canadian Yukon;
``Yukon Alone'' isn't always true to its title (there were other
madmen and women on the Quest race), but his account is pleasurably
grueling to read, and you don't have to don his 13-pound bunny
boots to feel the victory _ or the cold.
</P>
<P>
   On to even harder climes. Those of us who appreciate war stories
do so for myriad reasons, but the most universal (or so I like to
believe) is that godly ascent of the senses afforded by the darkest
of conflicts. This summer's ``Cold Mountain'' wannabe is Howard
Bahr's ``The Year of Jubilo,'' about a Civil War soldier returning
home. Other recent fiction has approached the subject sideways:
Chang-Rae Lee's ``A Gesture Life,'' about an elderly
Japanese-American man living in upstate New York, has the Second
World War buried somewhere in its dark heart, while Michael
Ondaatje's ``Anil's Ghost'' encompasses the civil war in Sri Lanka
by relaying its individual losses. Colum McCann's brief but
iridescent ``Everything in This Country Must'' casts glances at the
Troubles in Northern Ireland through the sad specificities of its
characters.
</P>
<P>
   But the turf battles fought in American fiction this year have
been mostly over the groves of academe and the virtual premises of
cyberspace. Saul Bellow's roman a clef, ``Ravelstein,'' concerns a
brilliant, dyspeptic political philosopher whose name isn't Allan
Bloom, but might as well be; gossip connoisseurs will flock to his
tale, though Bellow purists will be disappointed. Philip Roth has
given his Zuckerman the role of tragic satirist in ``The Human
Stain,'' an oxymoronic narrative job that only Roth could envision
and achieve. Francine Prose's ``Blue Angel'' hits a lighter note;
its sendup of dour academicians will amuse everyone but its
targets, who will be too busy reading Lacan to notice.
</P>
<P>
   And bitheads may be too busy writing code to care, but the rest
of us, straddling worlds between the Web and old-fashioned text,
have been given a bridge to the other side in Richard Powers's
``Plowing the Dark'' _ a round-trip ticket to virtual reality, and
never mind that it's all pixels and mirrors. Caroline Preston is
less dazzled in ``Lucy Crocker 2.0,'' which trades in its graphics
cards and scanners for the canoes and lakes of backwoods Wisconsin
and finds romance in real life. If you must have the real unreal
thing, go to Michael Lewis's nonfiction spellbinder, ``The New New
Thing: A Silicon Valley Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the geographical cure is what some readers require, and
this year's fictional road map will get you far indeed. Zadie
Smith, pyrotechnic newcomer to the stars, has delivered a big,
multicultural Londontown in ``White Teeth,'' which spans more than
a century and shows off a zeitgeist talent. Anchee Min, who gave us
``Red Azalea,'' takes poetic license with the story of Mao Zedong's
widow in ``Becoming Madame Mao.'' Our own Diva of Ideas, Susan
Sontag, fictionalized the life of Polish actress Maryna Zalezowska
for the historical fiction of ``In America''; Joyce Carol Oates,
who knows a good Gothic subject when she sees it, went to Marilyn
Monroe for the protagonist of ``Blonde.''
</P>
<P>
   Less action-packed but more word-by-word sensual is the rural
Ireland Edna O'Brien rewardingly delivers in ``Wild Decembers.'' In
``The Barbarians Are Coming,'' David Wong Louie takes a decidedly
American theme _ immigrants and their efforts for their children _
and makes it vividly, hilariously, his own, moving between the
sting of Connecticut WASPs and the pain of Chinese-American
immigration in mid-century. Charles Baxter stayed home in Michigan
for ``The Feast of Love,'' giving us the lyrical essence of ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' in his reimagining of a realm of love and
community. Sometimes time travel can take you further: Scottish
writer A. L. Kennedy has her protagonist in ``So I Am Glad''
falling in love with Cyrano de Bergerac. If the melodies and dirges
of ``Hamlet'' still fill your soul, you can return there by way of
John Updike's fiercely imagined ``Gertrude and Claudius.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps you prefer to strut and fret upon someone else's
stage for a while: Memoir and biography can accomplish that task
nicely and still get you home in time for dinner. The most
exhilarating contribution to memoir to appear in ages is Dave
Eggers's hardly hyperbolic ``A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering
Genius,'' which tap-dances across the conventions of the genre and
leaves you breathless. More conventional (and providing a tug of
the literary past) are Martin Amis's self-portrait and ode to his
father, Kingsley, in ``Experience: A Memoir,'' and Shirley
Hazzard's fond remembrance of Graham Greene in ``Greene on Capri: A
Memoir.'' National Public Radio cultists are already queueing up
for David Sedaris's just-released autobiographical essays, ``Me
Talk Pretty One Day.'' In the subgenre of Fabulous People You
Wouldn't Want to Be: Judith Thurman's ``Secrets of the Flesh: A
Life of Colette,'' which goes far in explaining why posterity loves
the French writer more than her children could ever manage. A
different kind of tragedy unfolds in British writer Hermione Lee's
``Virginia Woolf,'' which begins with a famous defining quote from
the great novelist's diary: ``I meant to write about death, only
life came breaking in as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick, on to happiness! Most of us read domestic dramas _
a.k.a., Gee, I Thought My Family Was Nuts _ for the literary
schadenfreude they provide: Nice to know that other people's
nuclear-unit meltdowns can translate into Art. Well, you still
can't do better than ``Anna Karenina.'' But this year has seen a
charmingly creepy story of a psycho marriage in Margot Livesey's
``The Missing World.'' Alice Elliott Dark's stories, ``In the
Gloaming,'' are mannered and elegant; George Saunders, in
``Pastoralia,'' sought the opposite effect by going dark and
allegorical. Two substantial recent novels from beloved
practitioners of the form are Rosellen Brown's ``Half a Heart'' and
Jayne Anne Phillips's ``MotherKind.'' For the latest nonfiction
popular treatise on Everybody's Miseries, including your own, go to
neurologist Frank T. Vertosick Jr.'s cringingly satisfying ``Why We
Hurt: The Natural History of Pain.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, if being somebody else _ Count Vronski, Ophelia,
Colette _ seems too ephemeral or transient a notion, there's always
the journey of becoming someone else. Jay Gatsby tried this, as did
a host of other half-tortured protagonists, and it didn't work, so
you'll be given no false encouragement here. But a true sojourn
into consciousness itself awaits readers of neurologist Antonio R.
Damasio's ``The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the
Making of Consciousness,'' which will help tell you who you are and
how you got that way. In which case, a next obvious step might be
Accepting Who You Are: See David Brooks's ``Bobos in Paradise,''
and hold on to those stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The last word must go to our presbyopic hedgehog, who has been
patiently burrowing and foraging through piles of books since we
began, arriving at this rough list for his own reading pleasures:
Marc D. Hauser's ``Wild Minds: What Animals Really Think,''
Elizabeth Marshall Thomas's ``The Social Lives of Dogs,'' and _
even hedgehogs love a good horse race _ Jane Smiley's triumphant
novel, ``Horse Heaven.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   While most salsa/Caribbean music is known for its spicy rhythms
and danceable grooves, the music on Ruben Blades' recent CD
``Tiempos'' is meant for the mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The instrumentation is different. There's no emphasis on
strident horn sections or fiery percussion solos,'' Blades said in
a recent interview. ``The lyrics seek to provoke thought and this
means to confront issues. Generally, salsa music serves as a way to
escape reality through dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiempos'' was nominated for a Grammy this year but it went to
Tito Puente's ``Mambo Birdland.'' Blades is a three-time Grammy
winner, most recently for ``La Rosa De Los Vientos'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   The Panamanian singer/songwriter said ``Tiempos'' is a mix of
sounds and influences.
</P>
<P>
   ```Tiempos' is an effort to integrate different sounds from
Latin America to serve as a background for stories related to our
everyday life. The songs were written by me and another Panamanian
singer-songwriter named Romulo Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three instrumental songs by Costa Rican composers _
Walter Flores, Fidel Gamboa and Carlos Vargas. The range of themes
goes from the coldness of hired killers (`Sicarios') to the hope
for a better future (`Encrucijada').''
</P>
<P>
   The 14-track CD is contemplative, thoughtful and enchanting.
Blades is in his familiar stance _ decrying social decay in
``Hipocresia,'' then questioning personal faith in ``Creencia'' and
aching for a lost love in ``Dia a Dia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bladesalso lightens up, kicking in fiery dance rhythms in
``Mar del Sur'' and the saxophone-driven R&AMP;B/funk grooves on the
title track. And he also offers optimism, as in the
acoustic-leaning ``Encrucijada,'' where he offers a hopeful message
of deliverance in a corrupt world.
</P>
<P>
   All 14 tracks were written by Blades in the style he long ago
called ``music journalism.'' And he supplements the traditional
salsa instruments of percussion and horns with violins, violas and
cellos to produce new textures. He's been called a salsa singer,
but a more apt description of his music, especially on this CD, is
political and philosophical folk/salsa ballads.
</P>
<P>
   But he dislikes labels and formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the songs on `Tiempos' are descriptive of everyday
realities, some of which are difficult to confront by society as in
`Sicarios.' I refuse to be labeled because it locks you into a
specific category and prevents growth.''
</P>
<P>
   His music is reflective of his varied earliest musical
influences.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation began to participate in music through rock 'n'
roll. It was young, different and exciting. Frankie Lymon and the
Teenagers, Orquesta Aragon and Frank Sinatra were early influences,
as diverse as they are. ... My first concert was when my father
took me to see Ismael Rivera and Cortijo y su Combo when I was
about 12 years old, in Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades eventually obtained his law degree. He teamed up with
Hector Lavoe and later Colon, with whom he collaborated on the
landmark album ``Siembra,'' which produced Blade's biggest hit,
``Pedro Navaja.'' In 1984, Blades released ``Buscando America,''
another influential album whose title track focused on search for
truth and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Blades also worked in movies, most notably ``Crossover Dreams''
and in 1988, ``The Milagro Beanfield War.'' More recent roles
include the famed muralist Diego Rivera in the 1999 film ``Cradle
Will Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1994, Blades expanded his interests to the political field,
declaring his candidacy for the president of Panama. And despite
losing, he felt he accomplished his goal of spotlighting the
growing social and democratic movement in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   ``My desire was always to serve my country. Politics is,
ideally, the way to do so under a democracy. In the future it is
very possible that once again I'll participate in the process. The
biggest lesson learned was that in order to be effective in the
political arena I must be residing in Panama full time, 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year. My absences hurt my credibility there. Only
when I can move permanently to Panama can it work.''

AT LAST, FROM THE US, A SEAFARING SAGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For New Englanders, the problem with the Hornblower saga and the
Aubrey-Maturin novels is that their legendary sea warriors are
Brits. C. S. Forester did write one book with an American hero _
``The Captain from Connecticut,'' which some buffs consider better
than all the Hornblowers _ but that aside, the naval adventure is a
genre dominated by British writers and British captains.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the balance is being reversed, the seas swept
clear, with the arrival of ``All the Brave Fellows,'' the fifth in
James L. Nelson's ``Revolution at Sea'' series, featuring Captain
Issac Biddlecomb of the struggling Continental Navy (Pocket Books,
$25.95). Biddlecomb is a New Englander, as is his creator: Nelson
lives in Harpswell, Maine, and writes with the authority of a
former director of education aboard the sail training vessel HMS
Rose, a replica of a British frigate from the time of the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   In ``All the Brave Fellows,'' Biddlecomb runs his overmatched
brig aground on the Jersey shore to prevent its capture by the
British, with his wife on board tending to the wounded (she takes
part in the fighting in earlier books). Then he runs the British
blockade of Philadelphia to take command of a new Continental
frigate. The Biddlecomb stories are closer in spirit to Forester
than to Patrick O'Brian _ more action and less wit, and definitely
no chamber music _ which makes for spirited adventure and great
reading.
</P>
<P>
   Among other new books with New England settings by New England
authors, there is adventure of a happier sort in ``Logs of the Dead
Pirates Society'' by Russell S. Peffer (Sheridan House, $23.95).
It's a charming account of a summer's cruising in Buzzards Bay on a
marine research schooner crewed by high school students. Peffer,
their captain, teaches literature at Phillips Academy in Andover
and fills out the days' adventures with nicely integrated lessons
in history and science.
</P>
<P>
   But the youngsters are the heroes. A squall hits on a final
day's run into Marion, with a teenage girl at the helm. ``You need
me on deck?'' calls Peffer from below, where he is monitoring the
radar. ``No!'' she replies. ``We got this covered.'' And after a
moment's consideration, Peffer shouts back, ``It's your boat. Stir
it up!'' (Regrettably _ and inexcusably, at the price _ the book
lacks photographs or a nautical chart of Buzzards Bay.)
</P>
<P>
   Local history provides a point of entry for an impressive study
of broader historical issues in ``Suffering Soldiers: Revolutionary
War Veterans, Moral Sentiment and Political Culture in the Early
Republic'' (University of Massachusetts Press, $40). The author,
John Resch, teaches history at the University of New Hampshire,
lives in Peterborough, and draws on the men from that town who
served in the Continental Army for his case study. In the immediate
postwar years, the ``citizen-soldiers'' of the Colonial militias
were regarded as the true heroes of a ``people's war,'' to the
detriment of the ``professional soldiers'' of the Continental Army
who had generally served longer _ and often far from home.
</P>
<P>
   The professionals' postwar readjustment was difficult, promised
pensions were not forthcoming, and by the early 1800s many were
seeking relief. Public attitudes changed in response to the image
of these ``suffering soldiers'' and passage of a pension bill in
1818, Resch writes, ``honored them as virtuous republican
warriors'' and ``became a catalyst for legitimizing the Continental
Army as a republican institution.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``High-Minded and Low-Down'' (University of Massachusetts
Press, $20 paperback), Nicholas E. Tawa explores the role music
played in American life in the first half of the 19th century. His
interest, writes Tawa, professor emeritus of music at the
University of Massachusetts at Boston, ``is what people have to say
about themselves and their relation to music,'' seeing in their
comments a way to understand the period when American culture was
being formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men and women,'' Tawa writes, ``stated repeatedly that to make
themselves better and to profit by the sentiments of the soul, they
turned to music. Clarifying this predilection further, they said
that they prized music because it was the native tongue of the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   A chapter on music at parties and ``frolics'' provides a
delightful collection of anecdotes. A frequent destination during
rural winters was a tavern, where there would be supper and ``a
local fiddler . . . able and willing to supply the music for
dancing and singing.'' In Wiscasset, Maine, Pardon Bowers's Tavern
was a popular destination until he decided to charge admission.
``The sleighing parties refused to continue going there'' and a
local farmer made his living room available _ ``but suggested that
they bring their own fiddler.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to fiction with a New England setting: Rarely does a
town meeting produce so fine a short story as ``What Counts in Bogs
Harbor'' by Elizabeth Elder. The story appears in ``Watching a
River Freeze,'' a collection of stories, nonfiction pieces, and a
novella (Puddingstone Publishing, $21). The reader can guess that
some story Elder covered for The Coastal Journal, a weekly
newspaper in Bath was the genesis for this tale. Tyler C. Tyler had
been town clerk for so long that ``most people had the courtesy not
to mention his being late for town meeting'' _ and in
development-pressured mid-coast Maine, he owns a farm that's no
longer worked. His childhood friend, Lem Clemsey, no longer walks
into town by the shore road, ``not since the north shore property
had been developed and the new houses started to go up. `Them
cliffs wasn't never meant for houses,' Lem would snarl if anyone
asked his opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge in the early 1980s is the locale and inspiration for
Anne Whitney Pierce's ``Rain Line'' (Hardscrabble/University Press
of New England, $24.95). A drunken Harvard hockey star drives his
car off a bridge and into the Charles River. He dies but his
girlfriend, a violin student, survives _ not yet aware she is
pregnant with his child. He is working-class Irish, she is poor but
genteel old family, and Pierce has a fine eye and ear for the two
societies. The opening line _ ``To this day, I wonder if Danny knew
he was going to die'' _ suggests that there is guilt and coping
aplenty here, but it is firmly handled.
</P>
<P>
   Author J. P. Polidoro reports that ``Rapid Descent: Disaster in
Boston Harbor'' (Longtail Publishing, $16.95) is selling well at
local airports _ to people who have already landed, one hopes.
Suffice to say that in this thriller, anything that could possibly
go wrong with a commuter flight out of Logan Airport _ over the
harbor, in the harbor, even under the harbor _ does.

MAKING INDIVIDUALS OF SIAMESE TWINS

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
CHANG AND ENG 
By Darin Strauss 
Dutton, 323 pp., $23.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a January morning in 1874, Eng Bunker awoke to find himself
alone for the first time in his life.
</P>
<P>
   In the stillness of dawn, his twin brother, Chang, lay dead
beside him _ meaning Eng's own death was imminent, as close as his
next breath. Wrapping his arms around his brother, Eng says, ``This
is the end I have feared since we were a child.''
</P>
<P>
   With this beguiling, mysterious line, Darin Strauss begins his
sublime historical novel, ``Chang and Eng,'' based on the lives of
the men for whom the term ``Siamese twins'' was coined. Born in
Thailand in 1811, the brothers Bunker (a name adapted after they
moved to America) lived their 63 years conjoined at the chest, and
became famous as a caged sideshow attraction for such showmen as P.
T. Barnum. They would eventually marry two sisters, settle as
farmers in North Carolina, and father 21 children.
</P>
<P>
   While many people are at least vaguely familiar with the famous
photograph of the brothers that adorns the book's dust jacket, time
has eroded their deeper lives, reducing them to little more than
freakish oddities. Yet in this ambitious, assured first novel,
Strauss imagines these men in full. They are given voice, their
fears, hopes, and dreams made vital; most important, Strauss
establishes for each man a vivid, poignant personality.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated in deathbed flashbacks by Eng, the story ping-pongs
between the various periods in the brothers' lives. Born on the
Mekong River, they are first believed by their parents to be twin
boys. It is not until a midwife tries to bathe them that the truth
is revealed. Their father screams, and the horrified midwife drops
them to the floor. Even though each child has a full, distinct
body, all that is noted is the ligament binding them at the
breastbone _ ``not two children, but one curse on the family,'' Eng
says. Only their mother first approaches her children without
trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother, knowing my brother and me for more than one child,
kept her calm,'' Eng says. ``The glimmer of two thousand years of
Siamese superstition left her dark eyes in an instant. She cooed
into my face and patted our cheeks.'' News of the ``double-child''
spread quickly, bringing curiosity-seekers and any number of
medicine men suggesting various methods of separation. None would
work, though that's fine with Chang, who is content fastened to his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Eng, who craves a life alone. The contrast is
particularly sharp when as boys they first encounter other
children. Chang sees the boys as ``half-formed,'' while his brother
views them as ``lovely'' and ``liberated.'' And it's not the only
difference between the brothers. Chang is more fun-loving,
gregarious, and freely enjoys _ perhaps too much _ alcohol. Eng, on
the other hand, is reserved and scholarly; as for alcohol, he won't
touch it, although he feels its ill effects whenever his brother
indulges.
</P>
<P>
   At its simplest, ``Chang and Eng'' is a tale of siblings living
under most uncommon circumstances. But Strauss understands all of
this story's angles and curves, uses them as an exploration of
prejudice _ whether in Siam, where the king, fearing the the
``double-boy'' represents a bad omen, wants them executed; or in
pre-Civil War America. And then there is their exploitation by
various hucksters eager to get rich from what one newsman calls
``the unholy, double-freak show.''
</P>
<P>
   As a novel, ``Chang and Eng'' is never a freak show, and
Strauss's elegant prose soars in the chapters where the brothers
meet Sarah and Adelaine Yates, two sisters who are first fascinated
by Chang and Eng, then fall in love with them. Chang is instantly
smitten, but Eng is more reticent. ``Rather than a flood of
passion, love came to me as a curious and distant spectacle,'' Eng
says. ``But I shared my brother's resolve to marry like ordinary
human beings, to experience the matrimonial joy less deserving men
relished.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Strauss writes about the brothers' intimate lives with
their wives, but he does so with restraint, even beauty. How the
brothers respect each other's privacy becomes an almost-spiritual
undertaking, as when Chang spends his first night with Adelaine,
and Eng passes ``into the highest loftiness of trance, trying to
raise my spirit out of our bodies, like a mist to circle the world
and vapor toward Siam.''
</P>
<P>
   Because there is no definitive record of Chang and Eng's lives,
their history, Strauss writes, has largely comprised ``a confusion
of legend, sideshow hyperbole, and editorial invention.'' This, of
course, works to the author's advantage, since he is not shackled
by niggling facts and details. Still, Strauss neither plays fast
and loose with this freedom, nor uses the opportunity only to
conjure answers to our most puerile questions. He memorably
accomplishes through fiction something that history has long denied
to Chang and Eng. He takes these so-called freaks and again makes
them men.

   GREENFIELD, Mass. _ Nicky Grenoble, 12 and intrepid, is cruising
the virtual world she has created on the Internet. ``That's my
house,'' she says, as a large unfinished white edifice swims into
view. She points to two red cars parked in the garage and says
proudly, ``That's my friend's car and that's mine.'' Then she zooms
down a blacktop highway and a small black-and-white cow pops into
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the cow I named after a kid in my class. Idon't like
him,'' Nicky says. ``That's why he's in the middle of the road as a
cow.''
</P>
<P>
   Move over J. K. Rowling, author of the best-selling Harry Potter
series. Out in the bucolic hinterland of Western Massachusetts,
right down the road from Butynsky's Farm Stand, lives a
freckle-faced sixth-grader who is so adept at putting the fruits of
a gifted imagination into words that she recently won a national
writing contest for young authors. Like Rowling, she weaves
material from real life into tales of mythical places peopled by
wizards, dragons, and sprites. But in a 21st-century twist, Nicky
also populates her stories with futuristic creatures she has
gleaned from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write about stuff I'm thinking about and I can insult people
as much I want to do without them
</P>
<P>
   knowing it,'' Nicky says. ``But I don't like real life much. I
like science fiction and fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Timekeeper,'' the short story she submitted to the Trumpet
Book Club Young Authors of America contest, is about a wizard who
looks through a mirror (yes, ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''
is one of Nicky's favorite tales) and decides to lure a 12-year-old
girl named Tory into his mystical kingdom. The Tory Nicky describes
in her story looks a lot like her, with ``red-gold hair,'' a
``spray of light freckles'' across her nose, and eyes that ``change
color with her mood.'' The judges for Scholastic Inc., which
sponsored the contest, honored Nicky's entry as one of 20 selected
from 1,500 entries.
</P>

   ``The quality of the entries this year was really good, so this
is a real kudo,'' says Betsy Howie, manager of contests and
promotions for Scholastic. ``The judges were impressed with the way
she combined a 12-year-old kid and a Merlin-like timekeeper. Her
story was a sophisticated blend of the ultramodern and the ancient
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicky (short for Nicole) lives with her younger sister, Monique,
a precocious 6 1/2-year-old whose book of the moment is Roald
Dahl's ``Matilda,'' and her parents in a modest Cape house on the
rural outskirts of Greenfield. She takes a yellow school bus every
day to a public elementary school, practices her piano, and rides
bicycles with her next-door neighbor, Erik. She bites her
fingernails, and leaves them painted blue long after the polish has
chipped. She wears denim capri pants and tames her bouncy auburn
hair with a green scarf.
</P>
<P>
   She has no time for Britney Spears or the Backstreet Boys
(``Their songs all sound the same''), but jumps to sing lyrics
(``C'mon, c'mon, come tell me'') by her favorite group, Smash
Mouth. Her mind is a castle of fanciful ideas, plucked from hours
of reading and roaming the Internet on the computer in her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Nicky's ``absolute favorite'' book is ``The Golden Cat'' by
Gabriel King. ``He's a genius, you know,'' she says. She has two
pet cats, Shawnee and Angel, and her room is filled with fluffy
white stuffed cats, bronze cat figurines, and, behind her bed, a
poster of five angelic-looking white cats and one mischievous
charcoal cat with red horns. ``I think cats have more free will
than dogs,'' she says. ``They don't come when you call them. I
think that's really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Nicky's passion for felines and the Net that
combined to inspire her first foray into fiction. A devoted fan of
``Cats,'' the Broadway musical, Nicky had already discovered the
fan fiction on the ``Cats'' Web site when her sixth-grade teacher
assigned the class to write a story using their spelling words.
``Fan fiction,'' Nicky explains, ``is where people take the
characters of one story and make up other characters to go with
that story, or make up other stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicky's story, now posted on the ``Cats'' Web site under the
pseudonym Aria, is ``about these two girls and they saw one of
their cats leave the house and they followed it and it ended up in
a junkyard based on the Jellico cats' junkyard, and the two girls
saw their teacher in a cage and the cats bared their teeth and
started to chase them and they ran back to their house,'' she says.
``And one of the cats had a human voice and a human Cheshire-like
smile and when the girl woke the next day, she thought it was all a
dream, but then she saw one of her cats smiling at her with human
lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the kitchen table, eating a lunch of instant noodle
soup, Nicky says she is angry at Andrew Lloyd Webber, the producer
of ``Cats,'' because he's shutting down the longest-running musical
in Broadway's history. ``I forced all the kids in my class to sign
a petition,'' she says. ``They had no idea what they were
signing.'' She giggles. ``It could have been a contract to make
them my slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   The cell phone on the table rings and Nicky grabs it. ``Hi,''
she says. ``I'm kinda busy right now. Go away!'' She hangs up.
``That was Erik,'' she says. ``If I answer the phone and say `go
away' you know it's Erik. He wanted to go for a bike ride in the
rain. He's going to get himself kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicky explains that she likes to ``torture'' Erik. ``I just have
this reputation for not being right in the head. I had a contest
once to get strange looks from people. I think I got about 200
strange looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicky's mother, Suzanne, who is also sitting at the table,
smiles at her daughter. ``Nicky is just irreverent,'' she says.
``She's got my twisted sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   And her mother's love of words. Suzanne Grenoble is a former
literature teacher who now stays home with the children while her
husband, Robert, works as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Grenoble is writing a novel aimed at the young adult
market, but it looks like her elder daughter will be published
before she is. Scholastic is planning to include Nicky's winning
short story in a special anthology, due out in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe I won,'' Nicky says. ``I never thought it
would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rings again. Nicky disappears. In a minute she is
back. ``Can Emily come over, puhleeze?'' she cajoles her mother.
The answer is yes and Nicky is gone for good this time, to gab on
the phone with her friend.

HOLLYWOOD EXPERIMENTS WITH IMAGES, TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Time Code,'' ``Hamlet,'' and, in a different way, ``Dinosaur''
remind us that we've just begun to write the first few pages of the
first chapter of the new book on image delivery. There are
technical, psychovisual, aesthetic, and political consequences
built into this new horizon. ``Time Code'' and ``Hamlet,'' both
shot digitally, hit the ground running with a new aesthetic arising
from the new tools. Both are propulsive in ways that few studio
films ever were. Part of the excitement of watching them is seeing
this aesthetic take shape before your eyes as they jettison the
traditional composed look of classic studio films for the hurtling,
provisional open-endedness of breaking TV news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In each, the action we're watching is resourcefully hitched to
the new style. In ``Time Code,'' Mike Figgis splits the screen in
four and runs each of four story lines simultaneously. The
characters from each quadrant are connected, but this doesn't
become apparent until later. What they have in common is that
they're all in crisis and they're all on the move as they
breathlessly converge on the Sunset Boulevard office of a
production company in which each character is, or wants to be, a
player. An ambitious actress, a jilted lover, an unraveling
filmmaker, a tense woman on the verge of divorce, a security guard
snorting coke while scoping out a masseur, an auditioning director
_ even before the characters begin migrating from one quadrant to
another, the screen is boiling over with agendas.
</P>
<P>
   While there's nothing new about split screens or, for that
matter, digital cameras, Figgis makes us feel the urgency of their
overwound lives. The in-your-face immediacy he brought to ``Leaving
Las Vegas'' and the little-seen but urgent ``Miss Julie'' here
escalates in spades. Even before we've worked out who's up to what,
and with whom, we're struck by a sense of rightness about the way
Figgis has merged the story he's telling with the way he's telling
it. So it is with Michael Almereyda's ``Hamlet,'' starring Ethan
Hawke. But it's the kind of star turn not often experienced in a
``Hamlet,'' even in the '60s, when sullen Hamlets were the rule.
While it's apparent that Almereyda is working fast and rough, it's
equally apparent that he's actually bringing off a solution to the
problem of shooting a contemporary ``Hamlet'' on a shoestring in
Manhattan. While each seems chaotic, each is the sum of hundreds of
aesthetic decisions _ many made on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke is invested in Hamlet's speeches, but he never stands
around declaiming them. This is a ``Hamlet'' that forgoes spoken
poetry for an imagistic equivalent. One of the features of the
world of this ``Hamlet'' is its surfeit of images and image
delivery systems. The play-within-a-play in which Hamlet nails the
usurping king who murdered Hamlet's father is a video Hamlet made _
presumably at NYU's film school (Hawke is a downtown grunge Hamlet,
in contrast with the cold glam uptown world of the court of the
Denmark Corporation ruled by his mother and uncle). The ``What a
piece of work is man'' soliloquy comes from a laptop. And the
camcorder-toting Hamlet delivers ``to be or not to be'' from the
action film aisle of a Blockbuster Video store.
</P>
<P>
   This restless ``Hamlet'' is more than ambitious and audacious.
It draws us into what we feel is the camera's race to keep up with
what's being detonated by the pain and anger behind the language.
It's a situational ``Hamlet'' that mirrors the prince's existential
disgust with an overload of images and sounds that inundate him
like a downpour. One speech is drowned out by an overhead jet.
Movie Fone drowns out another. His turning against Julia Stiles's
Ophelia is made to seem less cruel and arbitrary than usual when he
discovers her wearing a wire planted by her snooping father,
Polonius. And Ophelia's suicide is made more poignant than usual by
Stiles coming on like a downtown kindred spirit to Hamlet, if he
would allow her to be _ which, of course, he doesn't. Not all of
Almereyda's devices work. But he and the convincingly alienated
Hawke catch us up in this ``Hamlet,'' persuade us that we're on a
chase after the play's existential core.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Time Code'' and ``Hamlet'' become one with overloaded
go-go styles that reinforce a sense of each film being snatched
from the raw stuff of life itself, Disney's new ``Dinosaur''
represents the opposite extreme. It devises new frontiers in
artifice. Not just in its way of blending computer-generated
dinosaurs with real landscapes from around the world (tweaked with
the occasional computer-added river or cloud bank), but in its way
of making the big beasts more sophisticatedly lifelike than in
previous incarnations. When the herbivorous dinosaur protagonists
open their mouths to bellow at a ravaging carnosaur, we see their
cheeks vibrate with the sound. When they lumber across a desert,
the flesh sways on their massive bones (a move borrowed from
elephants the animators studied).
</P>
<P>
   A different order
</P>
<P>
   Also, the eyes are more lifelike than ever before. To see how
far dinosaur-crafting has come in just a few years, check out the
eyes on the T-Rex in ``Jurassic Park.'' This is a different order
of artifice than that of ``Toy Story'' and its sequel, where part
of the fun was seeing that entire computer-generated world goof on
itself with details like obviously programmed nicks and mars on
what would have been the otherwise sterile and perfectly flat
baseboards in the toys' room. ``Dinosaur'' was a movie Disney had
to make to renew itself and keep up, or at least not be perceived
as having fallen behind.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the digital world is coming immediately. There still
are kinks to be worked out. Something like 10 million pixels are
needed to capture a film image. Current digital cameras are nowhere
near this. Also, the possibility of clearer, crisper digital images
could be compromised if the increased bandwidth requirement of
these images brings about a compression, for reasons of economy,
and a consequent loss of detail. Nor are theaters nearly ready to
begin projecting the new digital imagery to any great degree. Last
year when he released ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' George Lucas complained that most theaters were
unequipped to adequately project his film. Prototype digital
screens exist, but the necessary massive investments in projection
and screen equipment have not yet been rolled out in any
significant way by theater chains. Lucas is shooting his new film
digitally, but it's a tossup whether more than a handful of
theaters will be able to project everything he shot.
</P>
<P>
   Gearing up
</P>
<P>
   So there must be an extensive refinement and changeover of
equipment. This will take at least a few years. The digital world
comes closer and closer. But it hasn't taken over yet. This may
play into the most exciting possibility atached to the new world of
image-making and image delivery, namely the increasing
democratization it will foster. Lighter, faster, cheaper digital
videocams have only just begun to democratize filmmaking and expand
its possibilities. A few years ago, when I asked Francis Ford
Coppola who he thought the interesting filmmakers of the next
generation might be, he thought a moment, then said that he didn't
know, that it would probably be a girl filming something in her
garage in Ohio that very moment, or a boy using a camcorder in his
backyard in a California suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about ``The Blair Witch Project,'' the thing
that shook up Hollywood, was the way it came out of nowhere and
made $200 million and the studios not only weren't in control of
it, but didn't even know about it until it was heading toward its
first $100 million. Where the Internet fits into the new equation,
nobody is prepared to say, but everybody knows it's in there
somewhere. Already, the Internet is shaping up as a calling card
for filmmakers. It has created new visibility for short films.
People aren't likely to watch feature films on the Internet, but
they may use it to download them and put video rental stores out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood isn't going away. It's going to control the big-bucks
aspect of what we call film for some time to come. A lot of
so-called independents, on the Internet or elsewhere, ask for
nothing more than studio deals. But not everyone. A lot of stuff on
the Internet, most of it maybe, is drivel. But not all of it is.
It's a new avenue, a new image-delivery system, a natural home for
mavericks. No longer do you have to max out a credit card to make a
film. Anybody can do it. Cheap new equipment and the Internet are
all that are needed for a new populism. The interesting battle in
the next few decades will be between the new digital guerrillas and
the new giant media agglomerates. Hollywood and the new media
barons have lost control of the image-making business and it's
driving them nuts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Herring, associate professor of linguistics at the
University of Texas-Arlington, has been studying correspondence
from the Internet since before it was the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The computer network was initially called the ARPANET. Estimated
date of birth: 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Herring acquired transcripts of ARPANET
discussion groups from the 1970s and began to study them to see how
e-mail has influenced language.
</P>
<P>
   With that research, she launched the field of computer discourse
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Herring was looking at several factors in network and e-mail
language: etiquette, formality/informality, grammatical complexity,
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Her findings include:
</P>
<P>
   Sentence structure is simple but has not devolved into
fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Slang has become more prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discourse markers'' usually found only in the spoken word are
common: ``oh,'' ``hey.''
</P>
<P>
   Errors decreased slightly over time.
</P>
<P>
   Herring found distinctions between the writing used in chat-room
discussions and that in e-mail. The former is less formal and
contains more typographical errors, abbreviations and simple
sentences as people type quickly to keep up with real-time
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail writers take more time to review their messages and clean
up errors. Formality depends on the recipient and purpose of the
message.
</P>
<P>
   In general, correspondence over the computer is a hybrid of
traditional writing and the spoken word. Chat rooms fall closer to
speech, while e-mail is more like writing.
</P>
<P>
   New words are being invented rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer technology is the biggest supplier of (new)
vocabulary,'' Herring says.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen how many of those words seep into
common usage. Some have already come and gone - ARPANET, ``FTP''
(file transfer protocol) and gopher. The latter two are file
retrieval terms that predate the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend Herring has noted is the evolution of spelling as
words fall into common usage. Upper case is abandoned, hyphens drop
out. In many circles, Internet is no longer capitalized. E-mail is
often spelled ``email.''
</P>
<P>
   Old words take on new meaning. ``Spam'' once referred only to
the Hormel processed meat product. Now it denotes unwanted,
``junk'' e-mail and is both noun and verb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flame'' once referred to actual fire or was a slang term for
flamboyant homosexuality. In computer talk, it now means a message
sent with hostile content. &QL;

<P>
   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ When the Supreme Court allowed a New
York photographer to take a public group shot of 152 naked models
lying in a street this weekend, it reinforced our First Amendment
rights to freedom of expression. It also encouraged a trend toward
nudity, particularly female toplessness. British matrons posed nude
for a best-selling calendar. A female Ohio rugby team took off the
bras for a bare-breasted photo shoot. Women have sued for the right
to go topless in public places. Is this good fun or an alarming
decline in moral standards? By MARIANNE MEANS.

&HT;     BOOK STRUGGLE PAYS OFF FOR WORLD WAR II RAIDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than half a century ago, Gerry West and Bob Addison took
part in seven critical, bloody battles under the canopied rain
forests of the Solomon Islands.
</P>
<P>
   West and Addison were Marines, members of the battalion known as
Edson's Raiders in honor of their commander, Merritt A. ``Red
Mike'' Edson. They were part of the United States' first offensive
at Guadalcanal Island in the Pacific war, and their brigade took on
legendary status within the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   They epitomized valor in the jungle's killing fields.
Twenty-four Raiders, mostly enlisted Marines and Navy corpsmen,
fought with such noteworthy bravery that they had U.S. Navy ships
named in their honor, all but one posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   West, a former corporal who lives in Fort Edward, N.Y., and
Addison, retired athletic director at Adirondack Community College
in Queensbury, N.Y., had for years worried that the heroic saga of
their unit would be relegated to a footnote in the annals of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Edson's Raiders have met annually since 1948 in
Quantico, Va., at Marine Corps headquarters. A decade ago, West and
Addison were instrumental in the formation of a book committee in
the Edson's Raiders Association. The goal was to get their story
into print.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different kind of battle altogether for the ex-Marines,
but it required the same determination and self-reliance that
helped them survive two long years in the South Pacific. Striking
gold with the fourth writer, the committee worked to detail the
account of their battalion, and the 345-page hardcover book
``Edson's Raiders'' came off the presses earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   They hired Joseph Alexander, a retired Marine Corps colonel and
the author of five books, who is probably best known as a
celebrity-host on cable television's the History Channel, to
research and tell the story of their battles. His fee: $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders really took matters into their own hands once
Alexander was finished. They published the book themselves, under
the imprimatur Edson's Raiders Assoc. Inc., in a limited edition of
just more than 3,000 copies. That cost $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, we're really proud to have this book in
print,'' said West, 80. ``It was a real effort. We wanted to have
it in our hands before too many more of our guys passed on.''
</P>
<P>
   They are primarily selling the book (listed at $32) themselves
and by classified ads placed in Leatherneck magazine, a monthly
publication of the Marine Corps. West and Addison as of last week
had sold 1,115 copies at $19.95, which, after all of their
expenses, gives them a $6 profit per book. Copies are also being
sold at the Marine Corps headquarters for $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nearly 2,000 copies of ``Edson's Raiders'' are in
boxes in a storage facility or piled high in West's home. They may
eventually sell the majority of them at cost to a national
bookstore chain, because their goal all along was to break even
with this project.
</P>
<P>
   By convincing Alexander to write the story of Edson's Raiders,
the association was able to separate itself from the pack of
self-published books. Alexander, historian and author of the 1997
book, ``The Battle History of the U.S. Marines: A Fellowship of
Valor'' (Naval Institute Press), brought instant credibility to
their project.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who has copyright ownership of the book ``Edson's
Raiders,'' is working with the Naval Institute Press to publish an
edited version of the book later this year. This was the first book
Alexander was commissioned to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rough for any veteran to write about his own memoirs,''
said Alexander, who retired from the Marines in 1989 after 29
years. ``Even if you are a first-rate writer, what you lack with
self-publishing is the national-level marketing and distribution
systems. Taking care of the sales can be a full-time job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can market a book yourself, but the key is to get it on
Amazon and get someone to review it there,'' he added. ``Then I
think you have a chance to break even.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Edson's Raiders'' has yet to appear on the electronic catalog
at Amazon.com. That's because Edson's Raiders Association, the
book's publisher, is also the book's primary seller.
</P>
<P>
   West says he and Addison believe that most of the surviving 300
or so members of Edson's Raiders (of the 2,800 Marines, Navy
medical personnel and chaplains who served with the 1st Marine
Raider Battalion between Feb. 16, 1942, and Feb. 1, 1944) are aware
of the book and have had a chance to purchase copies.

<P>
   PLETHORA OF MILITARY BOOKS
</P>
<P>
   ``Edson's Raiders'' may then join the shelves teeming with
self-published military memoirs and accounts of particular
campaigns. At a time when only a minimal investment is required to
publish a relatively high-quality book, the number of new books of
military history grows by quantum leaps seemingly every day.
</P>
<P>
   These are books that are well outside the radar of best-seller
lists, unlike the recently released ``Flags of Our Fathers''
(Bantam) by James Bradley with Ron Powers, or NBC anchor Tom
Brokaw's megaselling tributes to the World War II generation. These
are books with neither aspirations nor dreams of being a financial
success.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Keene, managing editor at Leatherneck magazine, says his
office is constantly receiving unsolicited self-published stories,
which he describes as vanity press books.
</P>
<P>
   Explained Keene: ``We get so many books we can't even mention
them all. Some former lance corporal who was alive in World War II
will decide he wants to write about himself, and he pays a lot of
money to get it published.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can read some of them and tell it's a terrible book, and
some aren't very accurate,'' Keene said. ``Every once in a while
there's a diamond in the rough. But a majority of the ones that
come through these vanity presses aren't that good. I think the
majority are done with good intentions, but most aren't well
researched or well-edited or well-written.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To purchase a copy of ``Edson's Raiders, send a check (made out
to Edson's Raiders Association) for $19.95 to Gerald V. West, 65
County Rte. 42, Fort Edward, NY 12828.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - While fighting to
</P>
<P>
   keep from being split in two by the federal government,
Microsoft Corp. is also suddenly under siege by about 150 lawsuits
demanding refunds for millions of buyers of its Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   Class-action attorneys have beaten paths to courthouses
nationwide since a federal judge declared on Nov. 5 that the
world's largest software company was using monopolistic power to
crush competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also gouged consumers in pricing Windows and its
entwined Internet Explorer browser, according to the onslaught of
private lawsuits. The company denies overcharging for any of its
products.
</P>
<P>
   Because the federal antitrust action won by the Justice
Department and 20 states did not seek monetary damages from
Microsoft, private consumers, including five in Arizona, have been
filing lawsuits at the rate of more than one every weekday in the
past six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are simply a bunch of attorneys trying to make money,''
Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said at the company's headquarters
in Redmond, Wash. ``This is not for the benefit of consumers in any
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Four lawsuits filed since December by Phoenix law firms are
seeking class-action status, several in conjunction with nationally
recognized firms that have represented consumers in
multimillion-dollar cases involving tobacco, breast implants, the
fen-phen diet drug and numerous other pandemics.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are a Phoenix law firm, a Scottsdale employment
agency that bought 13 computers loaded with Windows, two individual
Phoenix residents described as ``typical'' computer users and a
bowling-alley owner in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   If the lawsuits are successful, virtually anyone in Arizona who
bought one or another type of Windows could qualify to collect
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The awards could be three times the amount Microsoft is judged
to have overcharged for Windows _ minus substantial lawyers' fees
and other costs of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the lawsuits are the findings of fact issued in
November by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in the
government's antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said a Microsoft study showed that the company could
have charged $49 instead of $89 for an upgrade to Windows 98, and
``there is no reason to believe that the $49 price would have been
unprofitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words gave attorneys visions of winning as much as $120,
or three times the $40 price differential cited by the judge, for
every unit of Windows bought by millions of individuals and
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, claims could total in the ``tens of billions of
dollars,'' according to the Consumer Federation of America. In
fiscal 1999 alone, Windows sales totaled $8.5 billion, accounting
for more than 40 percent of Microsoft's total revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of Microsoft's vulnerability and wealth has
attracted many of the biggest names in class-action litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's literally coast to coast,'' said Michael Flannery, an
attorney in the San Diego of the nation's largest firm specializing
in class actions. The Milberg Weiss firm is no stranger to Arizona,
having won $240 million for investors bilked by the collapse of
Charles H Keating Jr.'s American Continental Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Flannery said the firm is handling at least a dozen lawsuits
against Microsoft, including two in conjunction with the Phoenix
firm of Bonnett Fairbourn Friedman &AMP; Balint.
</P>
<P>
   Another Arizona lawsuit was filed by the Phoenix office of a
Minneapolis firm associated with the Cincinnati practice in which
class-action icon Stanley Chesley is a nameplate member. That firm
also is handling at least 12 Microsoft lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the lawsuits are baseless,'' Microsoft's Cullinan said.
``There was nothing in . . . the Department of Justice case that
ever suggested that Microsoft was overcharging customers. In
actuality, the government found the exact opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan said the $89 vs. $49 cost cited in Jackson's findings
of fact was based only on Microsoft's marketing survey of what
consumers thought Windows 98 might be worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most consumers considered $89 a fair price and have shown so
since,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that a $49 price could have produced an adequate
profit is ``kind of weird,'' Cullinan said, because the cost of
developing an operating system ``is hundreds of millions, if not
billions, of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that's just an erroneous finding from the court,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   All four Arizona lawsuits started in Maricopa County Superior
Court because the state's antitrust and consumer protection
statutes are seen as hospitable to such actions. But two were
transferred to U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   In federal court, nearly identical Microsoft lawsuits from
around the country are likely to be merged into one, and ``cases
tend to go on forever,'' said Marty Harper, an attorney at the
Goodwin Raup firm in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the Phoenix cases moved to federal court was sent
to Maryland for likely consolidation, prompting the plaintiff's law
firm to start over in state court by filing a slightly different
action on behalf of a new plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Harper said the lawsuit his firm filed was carefully crafted to
be ``unremovable'' from state court.
</P>
<P>
   Class-action lawyers deny they are motivated by greed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say they are basically a private attorney general'' for
consumers' interests, attorney Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They bring to justice large corporate wrongdoers with large
amounts of wealth who might otherwise escape that justice because
individual consumers who are hurt can't take them on by
themselves,'' he said. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ When U.S. President Bill Clinton meets with Russian
President Vladimir Putin beginning June 4, he will propose to amend
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to allow limited
land-based defenses against a limited missile attack, not from
unthreatening Russia, but from hostile regimes, such as North
Korea's. Clinton and Putin should look to their defenses in a
spirit of cooperation, rather than confrontation. It is too big a
decision to be rushed. &QL;

But since May 19, when Speight and other rebels took the Fijian

Speight expelled from Fiji. In the longer term, a solution is
needed for the underlying dispute between Fijians and Indians,
which is over land. Whatever happens, Speight must not be
rewarded. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ What can Al Gore do to lift himself out of his

the ante on last October's Alpha-male makeover? Replace Naomi Wolf
with Tina Brown? Appear on Oprah Winfrey? A more modest strategy
would be to sit back and reflect on the campaign of the last
Democrat to lose. Michael Dukakis's 1988 defeat at the hands of
George Bush senior provides a perfect playbook of how to destroy
George junior. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The only way that George W. Bush's presidential

one of the lasting ironies of the 2000 campaign may prove to be
that the ``lightweight'' Bush grabbed the intellectual edge from
the ``heavyweight'' Gore. &QL;

   KFAR KILA, LEBANON _ As a procession of helicopters swept in to
land, loudspeakers blasted Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries'' over
the hillsides southern Lebanon. The U.N. peacekeepers' noisy
display was a deliberate reference to the Vietnam War, as depicted
in the film ``Apocalypse Now.'' Pundits had predicted an apocalypse
in Lebanon if Israel made good its promise to withdraw from the
country's southern fringes even without a peace deal with Syria.
But the Israeli-Lebanese border has remained remarkably quiet since
Israel's army retreated to its side on May 24, ending a 22-year
occupation. &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Even in the democratic heyday of post-communism, Russia
was a tough place for greens. Where the right laws existed, they
were hard to enforce. A combination of abundant natural wealth,
plenty of space and careless habits meant that few Russians took
environmental housekeeping seriously. Now, a mix of business
interests, criminal activity and government paranoia threatens to
make matters far worse. On top of all this, the new government of
Vladimir Putin announced ambitious plans on May 25 to build 40 new
fast-breeder nuclear-power station in Russia over the next 30
years. &QL;

Much of Latin America tacitly agreed, So too, loudly, did the
United States. But what were they all to do about the result? And
more importantly, perhaps, how will Fujimori reckon with the new
political activism that his electoral shenanigans have unleashed? &QL;

   RICHMOND, VA. _ Once, America's trucking industry was a cozy,
regulated semi-cartel, with a few big companies dominating most
regions. CB radio and the call of the open road made every boy
dream of one day driving his own 18-wheel rig. But when
deregulation hit in the 1980s, the business quickly lost its charm.
Yet a radical transformation of the trucking industry is now under
way, thanks to e-business. CB radio has given way to e-mail, GPS
tracking and wired hubs. Who knows? As e-commerce restores
trucking's glory days, a new generation of kids might even dream of
being truckers again. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ An etymology researcher has discovered that the
ubiquitous computer term ``software'' was coined way ahead of its
time _ though in a quite different context. Back in 1850,
``soft-ware'' and ``hard-ware'' were terms used by trash-can
scavengers to distinguish compost from non-biodegradable matter. So
a Victorian would have been baffled by the modern use of the
term.... Garbage in, garbage out, as computer programmers like to
say. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ When U.S. President Bill Clinton meets with Russian
President Vladimir Putin beginning June 4, he will propose to amend
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to allow limited
land-based defenses against a limited missile attack, not from
unthreatening Russia, but from hostile regimes, such as North
Korea's. Clinton and Putin should look to their defenses in a
spirit of cooperation, rather than confrontation. It is too big a
decision to be rushed. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Offense, the saying goes, is often the best form of defense.
Since the destructive force of the atom gave mankind the power to
blow up the world, this military dictum has been elevated to high
moral principle and guaranteed by treaty.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 30 years, America and Russia have agreed to leave
themselves vulnerable to attack by limiting their use of defenses
that could protect them from each other's most destructive weapons:
long-range missiles carrying nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of such mutually assured destruction _ MAD, for short
_ required both to renounce an effective missile shield, since its
owner might be tempted to attack the other in the belief that it
would be safe from a counterstrike.
</P>
<P>
   This ``balance of terror'' gives America and Russia the
confidence to go on cutting their huge nuclear arsenals. But U.S.
President Bill Clinton now wants to persuade his Russian
counterpart, Vladimir Putin, starting at their summit on June 4, to
rewrite the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposes to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty to allow limited land-based defenses against a limited
missile attack, not from unthreatening Russia, but from hostile
regimes, such as North Korea's.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the start of an easy shift to a defense-dominated world?
Or are America's proposed national missile defenses (NMD) destined
to cause new offense all around?
</P>
<P>
   To judge by recent rhetoric, they already have. Russia's Duma
threatens to tear up the Start-2 arms-cutting treaty it belatedly
ratified in April if America abandons its ABM vows. China would
review its (minimal) participation in arms control.
</P>
<P>
   Some Europeans at first pooh-poohed NMD as another wacky idea
out of Washington _ like the 1980s ``star wars'' plan for an
(unachievable) impenetrable shield over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans are pressing on. Can their harshest critics
and their closest friends all be wrong? Or is nostalgia for a MAD
world a relic of Cold-War thinking?
</P>
<P>
   The ABM treaty, though it has been amended several times
already, was indeed written for a different world. Its core
proposition, however, still holds: in the nuclear age, an attempt
by America or Russia to make itself uniquely invulnerable to the
other's rockets would fundamentally upset the strategic balance.
</P>
<P>
   Even short of that, it would be folly for America to build
defenses against one set of limited threats only to unleash a new
arms race with Russia whose likely result was reduced security for
all.
</P>
<P>
   Whether NMD spells No More Disarmament therefore depends on
whether America strikes out alone or manages to do a
stability-preserving deal with Russia: a ``grand bargain'' that
preserves both the essentials of the ABM treaty and the hope for
deeper weapons cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says he will decide later this year whether to start
building the limited anti-missile shield his officials have
devised. And, though technology and timing are still controversial
even in America, many of NMD's critics, including many Russians and
Europeans, acknowledge that the threat it has been designed to
defend against is real; it is numerically smaller than in Cold-War
times, but also less predictable.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's launch in 1998 of a far-flying rocket showed that
the big-power monopoly over such weapons had been broken. Within
the next decade, several other countries _ Iran and Iraq are the
main suspects _ are likely to develop similar rockets, thanks to
the Russian, Chinese or North Korean technology they have already
been given.
</P>
<P>
   Some, if not all, of these countries have a history of
belligerence against America. So, with allies to defend in
dangerous parts of the world, American officials worry that they
may soon find themselves squaring off against an aggressive regime
with the capacity to threaten New York or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that America was unprotected, that country might
calculate _ or miscalculate _ that aggression was easier to get
away with.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as NMD's advocates point out, Russia has long kept an
anti-missile shield around Moscow. Shorter-range systems are
already in service, and regional ones _ theatre missile defenses _
are being discussed. These are not limited by the ABM treaty,
because they do not call into question the Russian or American
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's NMD plan would not do that either, since it would
defend against just a few warheads, not the hundreds Russia could
muster in minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened to good old deterrence, ask skeptical
Europeans _ the trigger-blocking threat to respond to any attack on
America or its close allies with massive retaliation? They worry
that in a crisis America might just hunker down under its shield,
decoupling its security from that of its friends.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans respond that their proposed defenses could at best
complement deterrence, not substitute for it. And America's first
resort would still be diplomacy, arms limits, export controls and
sanctions to prevent or contain such threats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the allies worry that Clinton's plan, if achieved, would
not be the end of the matter: grander schemes would follow.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. Putin knows that, though Clinton's plans
offend the letter of the ABM treaty, not its spirit, many other
Americans would like much more ambitious, treaty-busting
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Putin also wants deeper cuts in nuclear weapons, since
Russia cannot keep up those it has. He would rather negotiate a cut
in numbers _ hence the possibility of a bargain _ than be at a
unilateral disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing America does will mollify China, though, since its
deterrent is small (albeit expanding), and it objects particularly
to America's plans for regional missile defenses: what can protect
American forces in Japan from North Korean missiles could one day
protect Taiwan from China.
</P>
<P>
   After all China, which has often been ready to provide missiles
to dodgy regimes, has repeatedly threatened Taiwan. Yet, if America
can do a deal with Russia, China might be persuaded to trade upper
limits on its nuclear forces and proper export controls in return
for an American pledge to keep defenses limited.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly a risk, however, that China will build lots
more weapons, prompting others, such as India and then Pakistan, to
do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   As threats change, so the balance of offense and defense may
need to change too, and missile defenses could have a role to play.
But they are no magic fix, and could provoke a destabilizing arms
race, leading to general proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   So if America is to go ahead with them, it should proceed
cautiously, in cooperation with others, not just on a technological
whim and a timetable set by its election calendar.
</P>
<P>
   America's Democrats and Republicans need to agree that such a
controversial decision should be for a new president to make.
</P>
<P>
   Though America and Russia can probably agree that the ABM treaty
is worth preserving, Russia needs to accept that its preservation
may involve its modification. That would give time to weigh the
technologies available against their shortcomings, costs and
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If subsequent talks with Russia produced no agreement, both
countries would have the right they have always had to withdraw
from the ABM treaty and defend themselves as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   Far better, though, that they should look to their defenses in
cooperation, rather than in confrontation. And far better, too, if
all those affected _ America, Russia and their allies _ have more
time to consider the implications of NMD.
</P>
<P>
   At best it will offer some protection against only one way of
delivering a nuclear bomb. It is too big a decision to be rushed. &QL;

<P>
   It is little wonder that George Speight is known as a ``failed
businessman.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundations of Fiji's economy are its citizens of Indian
descent, who farm the sugar and own many of the country's trading
and tourism businesses. Before a military coup in 1987, Indians
made up over half the country's population.
</P>
<P>
   Since that coup stripped them of many political and other
rights, tens of thousands left for more welcoming climes. The
economy foundered, and the remaining Indians' rights were restored
in a new, 1997 constitution _ which, last year, gave rise to the
election of Fiji's first ethnic-Indian prime minister, Mahendra
Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
   So on May 19 Speight and other rebels took the government
hostage, in a bid to drive more Indians away and to hurt the
economy further. The trouble is, he is proving to be a successful
terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   The Fijian authorities are in a terrible bind. Solving just a
hostage crisis would be hard enough, with many ministers among
those held, including the daughter of the country's venerable
president, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the man who led Fiji to
independence from Britain in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   But this two-week-old crisis is also a constitutional one,
because Speight has demanded the scrapping of the 1997 document and
has support from some other indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The indigenous Fijians' Great Council of Chiefs, which is mainly
a symbolic body, has not supported the terrorists but has felt
unable to condemn them outright.
</P>
<P>
   Speight keeps changing his demands, but the authorities _ even
the army, which has nominally taken power _ keep giving into them.
The 1997 constitution has been scrapped, Sir Kamisese has resigned
as president, prime ministers have been suggested and withdrawn,
amnesties have been offered to all and sundry, including the
egregious Speight.
</P>
<P>
   But still the standoff goes on. What can be done?
</P>
<P>
   The first answer is that Speight's bluff must be called. The
concessions must cease. The Fijian army has already gone too far in
scrapping democracy and thereby sanctioning the rebels' efforts to
strip the Indians of their rights.
</P>
<P>
   A line must be drawn, and Speight expelled from Fiji. In the
longer term, a solution is needed for the underlying dispute
between Fijians and Indians, which is over land.
</P>
<P>
   A colonial-era compromise, confirmed by Sir Kamisese's
post-independence government, reserved the ownership of 80 percent
of Fiji's land to the indigenous race, but granted long leases to
Indian farmers.
</P>
<P>
   These will soon expire, and suspicions over the terms of
renewal, under an Indian prime minister, have stoked the racial
fires.
</P>
<P>
   The proper answer would be to abolish racial preference. The
practical answer may well be new long leases, with cash for ethnic
Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   The onus to solve this peaceably must lie on the Fijian elders,
for only they can persuade their fellows to live harmoniously with
the Indians. And if they cannot? There will be further riots. Those
Indians with skills and money will rightly leave.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders, notably Australia, New Zealand and the wider
Commonwealth, should use sanctions to pressure the Fijians to reach
a democratic solution. As in Zimbabwe, aid money could help ease
the land issue, as long as the political structure is there.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Speight must not be rewarded. &QL;

   De Beer's nightmare has shifted from a flood of diamonds to
blood on diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   For decades the diamond giant has manipulated the supply of the
earth's hardest but most overrated natural substance, successfully
keeping it one of the most valuable.
</P>
<P>
   It has survived slumps by stockpiling and booms by keeping
prices ahead of inflation, all the while telling consumers that, in
the words of its long-running advertising slogan, ``a diamond is
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers has run its cartel by buying diamonds, whether from the
Soviet Union or anybody else _ no questions asked. That is now its

</P>
<P>
   At least three wars in Africa are ``fuelled'' by diamonds. In
two, rebel movements control mines and sell diamonds to buy
weapons.

agreements and committing atrocities. The United Nations wants to
cut off their source of cash: diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign, partly financed by Britain, is seeking to alert
consumers to ``conflict diamonds.'' Seeing what animal-rights
campaigners did to fur, this has terrified the whole industry.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer campaign that broke the De Beers cartel and created a
free market in gem diamonds would be a splendid idea. But there is
a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   America is the only country that has tried any serious antitrust
action against the company. Europe, where De Beers's Central
Selling Organization is based, could do far more.
</P>
<P>
   Even if trust-busters fail, however, the cartel is under
pressure, not just from conflict diamonds, but also from newly
discovered deposits mined by companies that do not work with De
Beers.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take years for such a cartel to unravel. And there
is a risk that the process might temporarily raise prices of
conflict diamonds if big mining houses, finding their huge deep
mines uneconomic, were to close them down _ for that would mean a
better price for rebels, scratching around river beds for alluvial
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The question is what else to do in the short run to cut off
rebels' diamond income. De Beers claims to have stopped scooping up
loose gemstones on the open market that might have come from
African war zones.
</P>
<P>
   It has withdrawn buyers from these areas, promised not to buy
diamonds from war zones at source or in Antwerp, the main market
for diamonds, and is offering guarantees that the diamonds it sells
have no ``blood'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers also says it has leaned on wholesale purchasers who buy
from its stockpile, but also buy diamonds on the open market, to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good _ if also, rather obviously, good for De Beers's
own interests. The firm is now considering ways of marketing
diamonds as branded luxury goods, marked with the De Beers
guarantee of quality and untainted origin.
</P>
<P>
   But even if most conflict diamonds no longer sail unchecked
through Antwerp or London, the evidence is that many are merely
diverted to Tel Aviv and Mumbai. The rebels might get lower prices;
but if their trade is to be dented any further, more concerted
international action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is that all rough diamonds should be certified,
with the certification made open to outside scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers has long maintained that this is impossible: that
diamonds are harder to police even than drugs, because once cut and
polished, their origin is impossible to determine. But experts can
tell the origin of a packet of rough diamonds, even if individual
stones or mixed parcels are harder to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Until now the diamond trade has been barely regulated. Most
smuggled diamonds, stolen or illegally mined, have turned up in
Antwerp, where both the Belgian government and the EU have turned a
blind eye. Other countries, including Israel and India, have been
worse.
</P>
<P>
   That must change. Customs officers should be trained to ensure
that all diamonds are declared on entry, with certificates of
origin provided (not just the country of shipment) and values
registered.
</P>
<P>
   If De Beers and other big companies want to keep their business
blood-free, they must help to police these measures.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, whose troops are facing the rebel movement in Sierra
Leone, is particularly keen to stem the trade from that country,
where at present the government controls not a single diamond. But
Britain, where De Beers holds its stockpile, has itself done
little.
</P>
<P>
   Acceding to De Beers's requests for secrecy, it refuses to
disclose figures on the import and export of rough diamonds, their
origin or their value.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the sort of complicity that must stop if conflict
diamonds are to be curbed and a proper market established. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The only way that George W. Bush's presidential
campaign could go any better these days would be for Al Gore to
announce that, as well as smoking a little dope as a student, he
also joined the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The election is being fought on Democratic issues (education,
health care and welfare) at a time of extraordinary prosperity. Yet
Bush is dominating the policy debate, sounding exciting Republican
variations on familiar Democratic themes.
</P>
<P>
   The latest opinion polls show Bush ahead by between six and ten
percentage points. He is ahead among almost every important
demographic group _ men and women, Catholics and Northeasterners,
married couples and independent voters and, in all probability,
among married swingers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Gore's constituency seems to be shrinking to what
might be unkindly described as geezers and losers: the over-65s and
people earning $20,000-40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   There are still good reasons for thinking that the vice
president is a much more powerful candidate than he currently
appears. But, at the very least, Bush has justified some of the
hopes that the Republican establishment invested in him.
</P>
<P>
   He has not only made far better use of the two months following
the major primaries than Gore; he has also outperformed him on what
ought to be Gore's strongest ground, policy wonkery.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Gore is being deafened by criticisms from his fellow
Democrats, while Bush basks in the praise of the Republican
faithful.
</P>
<P>
   The public face of Bush's makeover has been a series of
well-choreographed press conferences. More interesting has been
what has gone on behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has established a friendly relationship with the press
corps, a group that he initially tried to micromanage and
spoon-feed.
</P>
<P>
   Within his own party, he has cleverly used his struggle with
Senator John McCain to silence the right-wingers who have often
seen the Bushes as unsound Rockefeller Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   And he has proved a master of using the full range of his
party's resources _ from policy intellectuals such as Steve
Goldsmith and Larry Lindsey to clean-scrubbed young activists. A
party that threatened to fall apart during the McCain insurgency is
now pulling in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   The main aim of all this activity has been to eliminate Bush's
two big negatives. The most obvious is the fear that he is a
prisoner of the far right. This is always a risk if you are
governor of a state that executes more people than most countries
do.
</P>
<P>
   But the risk became a serious political liability when Bush
aligned himself with Ralph Reed, the former head of the Christian
Coalition, and Bob Jones III, the head of a university that banned
interracial dating, in order to crush McCain in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then Bush has tried to rebrand himself as ``a
different kind of Republican.'' He regularly boasts that he won the
support of 50 percent of Hispanic voters and 25 percent of blacks
in his last election as governor.
</P>
<P>
   He has perfected an aggressive new form of affirmative action
relating to photo opportunities: he is always surrounded by
minorities, even when he is in the whitest of suburbs. And he has
also belatedly made friends with the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay
pressure group.
</P>
<P>
   This might look like gesture politics. Gore's aides talk about
Bush going on a ``Bob Jones Redemption Tour.'' But the tour is
currently selling out most of the arenas.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush has been busy burnishing his ideology as well as his
image.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not only marched happily into Democratic territory such
as schools, housing and, in the next few weeks, family policy. He
has borrowed a clutch of bright ideas from Bill Clinton's favorite
think-tank, the Democratic Leadership Council, and endorsed
Medicare reforms suggested by one of the Democratic Party's
brightest luminaries, Louisiana's John Breaux.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to dismiss somebody as a right-wing nut if they spend
more time talking about education than anything else _ and if they
steal many of their best ideas from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Whittman, a political analyst at the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think-tank, points out that this policy
offensive is also eroding Bush's second big negative: his
reputation as a lightweight.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will never entirely escape from his frat-boy image _ indeed
his very likeability may be one of his strongest weapons against
the cold Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the flurry of policy initiatives is meant to suggest that
young George sometimes kept a copy of the latest Brookings policy
paper concealed inside his Playboy, and that he also knew who to
call when the homework assignment was due.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps not surprising that Bush has closed the gravitas
gap on issues such as education. But he has also notched up more
unexpected victories. One such is foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was a leading architect of the Clinton administration's
Russian policy. Bush, by contrast, was until recently best known
for referring to Greeks as ``Grecians'' and having trouble naming
the leaders of large countries. Yet Bush's team has been working
hard to close this gap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the China-trade bill, which the House of
Representatives passed last week, was something of a gift for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore, conscious of his union supporters, held back a
little in his support for permanent trading relations with China,
Bush, who comes from the free-trading, pro-immigration side of his
party, was more effusive about globalization.
</P>
<P>
   He also seized on the opportunities to appear both bipartisan
and statesmanlike _ praising Bill Clinton as well as the House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Missile defense, by contrast, is one of Gore's specialities. Yet
on May 23, Bush put forward the case for substantially reducing
America's stockpile of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was a little vague on details, but Bush surrounded
himself with some of the mightiest members of his party's
foreign-policy establishment _ Henry Kissinger, Brent Scowcroft,
General Colin Powell and George Shultz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Excited talk about both Colin Powell and John McCain finding
their way into a Bush cabinet is also helping to close the gravitas
gap.
</P>
<P>
   Put all these things together and it is clear that over the past
two months Bush's team has done more than just downplay negatives.
They have begun to substantiate Bush's often-repeated claim to be a
``leader.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes leadership to suggest radical reform of the
Social-Security system, something that even a retiring politician
like Clinton is loth to do. Indeed, the Bushites have thoroughly
colonized a territory that Gore has bizarrely decided to leave
empty: that of intelligent social reformer.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Bush has begun to put more flesh on the bones of
``compassionate conservatism,'' positioning it as more cautious
than Gingrichism but more pro-market than his father's Country Club
Republicanism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 375 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,150) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   On education, he offers a mild form of school choice and teacher
accountability. (Pupils who are trapped in persistently dismal
schools will be given vouchers to leave.)
</P>
<P>
   On Social Security, he wants younger workers to be able to
invest a small portion of their payroll taxes on their own.
</P>
<P>
   On welfare, he supports a bigger role for voluntary
organizations, particularly those that try to change people's
character, not just tide them over from day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   All this has forced Gore onto the defensive. The vice president
seems forever to be objecting to ``risky schemes'' but never
advancing any interesting ideas of his own. (``If Al Gore would
have been around in Philadelphia when they were signing the
Declaration of Independence,'' Tom Ridge, the governor of
Pennsylvania and a possible Bush vice president has quipped, ``he
would have refused to sign it because it was a risky document.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gore seems increasingly allied with the most stick-in-the-mud
elements in the Democratic coalition _ the people who think that
New Deal liberalism is too perfect to need redesigning. And he is
alienating the brighter elements in his Party.
</P>
<P>
   New Democrats such as Bob Kerry, the senator for Nebraska, and
Will Marshall, the head of the Progressive Policy Institute, worry
that Gore's liberal fundamentalism will condemn their party to
defending entitlement programs (particularly for the old) that eat
up an ever-greater share of federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the pages of the New
York Times to argue the case for retirement saving accounts. Brian
Lunde, a sometime executive director of the Democratic National
Committee, has even announced that he is supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   All this suggests that, if he is elected in November, Bush will
be able to form working links with the New Democratic Coalition _ a
group of 65 pro-business Democrats in Congress who regularly
champion high-tech issues and who broke with their party last week
to secure the passage of the trade deal with China.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a Gore administration might squander one of the
greatest opportunities in modern politics: the chance to redesign
the welfare state at leisure, while the coffers are full, rather
than being forced to redesign it by a crisis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,600) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Polls can change. But the battle for ideas is usually a
slower-moving process. Whatever the result, one of the lasting
ironies of the 2000 campaign may prove to be that the
``lightweight'' Bush grabbed the intellectual edge from the
``heavyweight'' Gore.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any such thing as a ``vital center,'' it now belongs
to the Republicans rather than the Democrats. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ By the zany sartorial standards that prevail on the
Santa Monica boardwalk, a man wearing a cardboard box daubed with
the words ``Big Hotel'' barely merits a second glance.
</P>
<P>
   The pantomime staged outside one of Los Angeles' ritzier hotels
by left-wingers protesting against the low wages paid to
chambermaids was passionate enough. But it did not distract the
muscle-heads swinging on the nearby parallel bars.
</P>
<P>
   When Ralph Nader, the Green Party's probable presidential
candidate, rose to speak, the most conspicuous outsider he
attracted was a heckling drunk.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly scruffy sideshow is just what left-wing activism
looks like to the political establishment in Washington at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton ushered the China trade bill through
Congress by a surprisingly large majority of 40 votes, despite
relentless opposition from the AFL-CIO, the country's largest
trade-union organization and one of the building blocks of the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Even the rowdier forms of activism that wrecked the Seattle
trade talks last year look as if they are running out of steam: the
repeat performance in Washington in April failed to close down the
joint meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the perspective of Southern California, the idea that
the left is on the march again looks a little less zany.
</P>
<P>
   The body builders might have paid scant attention, but the
campaign to institute a minimum ``liveable wage'' for workers in
Santa Monica's hotels and restaurants has so rattled local business
owners that they have started their own petition for a rival
``living wage'' law.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this week's demonstration was to point out that this
was not good enough: there were too many loopholes for the
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, labor activism is on a roll in Southern
California _ galvanized by the union bosses dropping their
opposition to immigration.
</P>
<P>
   This year has already seen one big success: a popular strike for
better wages by janitors, 98 percent of whom were Latinos. Mexico
has a strong union tradition in which noisy strikes and
demonstrations are routine.
</P>
<P>
   Last year home-care workers in the region became unionized,
proving that unions can reach out to a highly dispersed work force.
</P>
<P>
   The cheering chambermaids of Santa Monica were joined at their
rally by placard-waving comrades from the Screen Actors Guild,
currently striking over pay for commercials reshown on cable
television (a strike that is costing the entertainment industry $1
million a day).
</P>
<P>
   And there is Nader. A craggy figure in a battered suit, the
perennial hero of consumer-rights crusades is also on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party is scoring about 5 percent in nationwide polls,
but 9 percent in California. A pool-side fund-raising party after
the union rally pulled in a string of $2,000 contributions from a
Hollywood crowd, edging the campaign a little closer to its goal of
$5 million.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Nader seemed something of a relic _ the man who
made cars safer and then seemed to go slightly bonkers about trade.
</P>
<P>
   Now he seems ahead of the curve _ one of the first people, for
instance, to argue that Microsoft was a monopoly and needed to be
broken up; one of the strongest supporters of wide-scale
campaign-finance reform; and, from some perspectives, the godfather
of all the nongovernmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Another California maverick, Jerry Brown, sounded some of these
themes in 1992. So far Nader can claim slightly more success in
terms of the great challenge of the left in America _ bringing the
movement together.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the 1960s, when the Vietnam demonstrations pitted
blue-collar workers against university radicals, who not only
wheedled their way out of fighting for their country, but even spat
on returning heroes, the left has had a class problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, tree-hugging environmentalists marched alongside car
workers. John Sweeney, the head of the AFL-CIO, did his bit by
sending out organizers to college campuses to fan the flames of
protest against ``sweatshop'' employers. But most of the
organization for Seattle seemed to come from the NGOs _ and from
the Naderite Public Citizen organization in particular.
</P>
<P>
   For Nader, this new coalition is a logical result of money
politics. When money alone buys access to politicians, he says,
civil society starts to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph of global capitalism over social equity is creating
an alliance between all sorts of people who have previously been at
odds.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative for voters is ``the pro-life corporate party or
the pro-choice corporate party,'' ``George W. Bush, he of the oil
industry,'' or ``Albert Gore, he who doesn't know his own
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's immediate challenge is to clinch the Green Party
nomination at its convention on June 24. (His rivals are Jello
Biafra, a punk rocker campaigning to abolish the Army and introduce
a maximum wage, and Stephen Gaskin, a hippie campaigning to
legalize marijuana.)
</P>
<P>
   Providing he can overcome this little local difficulty, his next
target is to secure 5 percent of the vote in the presidential
election, thus winning federal funding for a campaign in 2004, and
thereby laying the foundation for a viable third party.
</P>
<P>
   Not a large target _ yet one that could have a profound effect
on Al Gore's chances. Nader says that he attracted only three
Democrats for every two Republicans in the 1996 race (when he did
not actively campaign). That looks far too balanced a split.
Already Democrat bosses are waking up to the idea that, in a tight
race, Green votes could swing some states for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Even in California, strong support for the Greens in the latest
polls means that Gore's lead over Bush has narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least Nader could force Gore to throw money at races
which he would otherwise take for granted. This presents a problem
for the Democrats. But it also presents a problem for Nader's new
left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Nader says that ``we owe Gore nothing,'' reeling off the
subjects on which the environmentalist left feels betrayed by the
Clinton-Gore administration, from automobile safety and fossil
fuels to biotechnology and forestry. But the labor unions in
particular want Gore to win.
</P>
<P>
   If Nader delivers victory to the party least sympathetic to the
left, it is hard to believe he will not run into all sorts of
problems with Sweeney _ not to mention Biafra and Gaskin. &QL;

 From The Economist magazine

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What can Al Gore do to lift himself out of his
current doldrums? Change from earth tones to black leather, to up
the ante on last October's Alpha-male makeover? Replace Naomi Wolf
with Tina Brown? Appear on Oprah Winfrey?
</P>
<P>
   A more modest strategy would be to sit back and reflect on the
campaign of the last Democrat to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dukakis's defeat at the hands of George Bush senior not
only stands as a warning against reading too much into early
opinion polls. It also provides, courtesy of George senior, a
perfect playbook of how to destroy George junior.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1988 Dukakis was beating George senior by as
much as 17 percentage points in the polls. The governor of
Massachusetts had a reputation for being a pragmatic liberal _
``this election is not about ideology; its about competence,'' he
told the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   George senior, on the other hand, was regarded as an awkward
holdover from the previous regime.
</P>
<P>
   And the result of the election in November? The ``wimp, wasp,
weenie'' and ``every woman's first husband'' trounced ``the
architect of the Massachusetts miracle'' by eight points.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president can draw three big lessons from the Dukakis
debacle. The first is that being the governor of a freak state can
be a huge liability.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts and Texas are both well outside the American
mainstream. In the 1980s Massachusetts was famous for liberal
Northeastern public policies that struck most Americans as utterly
crazy, such as buying a modern art sculpture for a prison.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Texas is often seen as a redneck state, famous for
public policies that strike most Americans as utterly barbaric,
from allowing people to carry guns in houses of worship (unless
signs specifically forbid the practice) to letting oil firms
dictate environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   The second lesson is that attack politics can work. As the older
Bush's negative rating topped 40 points, twice that of his
opponent, the reluctant patrician took the decision to go negative.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign aide, Lee Atwater, famously told his sidekick,
James Pinkerton, ``We're gonna have to use research to win this
campaign. You get me the stuff to beat this little bastard and put
it on this three-by-five card.'' A relentless series of attacks on
the Dukakis record followed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is much happier with attack politics than George senior, as
Bill Bradley, for one, can testify.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is busy presenting Texas as the Appalachia of the
Southwest, a place where you cannot breathe without choking, where
preachers carry guns while delivering sermons, and where children
drop dead at a Third-World rate.
</P>
<P>
   The third lesson is that incumbents almost always win when the
economy is doing well. In 1988 people asked themselves whether they
were doing better than they were under the last Democratic
president, and pulled the lever for Reagan's chosen heir.
</P>
<P>
   The five academic forecasters who have got the best track
records of predicting election results (usually based on a
combination of the state of the economy and public opinion) predict
that Gore can expect to win 53-60 percent of the two-party vote in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between 1988 and 2000 are far from perfect. Gore
is more likely to take a book on Swedish land planning on vacation,
as Dukakis once did.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Dukakis tried to dispel her husband's reputation as a
robotic calculating machine by dubbing him her ``passionate
partner''; now Tipper gore loyally boasts about the sexual tiger
lurking within her own besuited automaton.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, the number of Americans who say that the country
is on the right track has been steadily slipping since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore is also finding it surprisingly hard to attract
contented voters, either because they give him little credit for
the ``Greenspan boom,'' or because they do not see Bush as a threat
to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   All these things should be enough to guarantee an exciting race.
But in the end the smart money is still in the same place that it
was this time 12 years ago: on the luckless vice president rather
than the governor. &QL;

   KFAR KILA, LEBANON _ As a procession of helicopters sweeps in to
land, loudspeakers blast Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries'' over
the hillsides of southern Lebanon. The U.N. peacekeepers' noisy
display is a deliberate reference to the Vietnam War, as depicted
in the film ``Apocalypse Now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pundits had predicted an apocalypse in Lebanon if Israel made
good its promise to withdraw from the country's southern fringes
even without a peace deal with Syria. The angry Syrians, it was
said, would send mercenaries to fire over the border, and the
Israelis would respond with unparalleled severity.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israeli-Lebanese border has remained remarkably quiet
since Israel's army retreated to its side of it on May 24, ending a
22-year occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The most persistent sound on the border these days is not
Wagner's martial bombast but the plonk and tinkle of vans bringing
ice cream to merrymakers.
</P>
<P>
   At the former crossing at Kfar Kila, where the last Israeli
tanks rolled out of the country, curious Lebanese buy
vanilla-chocolate swirl in waffle cones before strolling to the
border fence for their first glimpse of Israel _ or Palestine, as
many of them call it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many Palestinian families, separated by the conflict,
have met at the border fence to reacquaint themselves for the first
time in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The only disturbers of the peace are the hotheads shouting
insults under the noses of the po-faced Israeli sentries standing
just three meters (ten feet) across the barbed-wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days after the evacuation, gun-toting youths threw
stones and tried to rush the flimsy barricade. The Israelis turned
them back with warning shots, injuring a couple. But these, along
with several Lebanese civilians killed or wounded by land mines,
have been the main casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, too, is celebrating the fact that the withdrawal,
however hasty and sloppy, was carried out without any Israeli
casualties at all.
</P>
<P>
   The approval rating of the prime minister, Ehud Barak, has
soared, and he is now turning his attention to the Palestinians in
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even the embarrassment of the army's unsentimental abandonment
of its Lebanese allies is quickly dissipating as the government
offers cash handouts and resettlement promises to the mercenaries
and their families who straggled in as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese army has now reimposed restrictions on travel to
the former occupied zone, making it difficult for troublemakers to
get near the border.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government, in deference to its ally Syria, refuses
to send troops to ``guarantee Israel's security,'' it has filled
the border area with policemen. And Hezbollah, the guerrilla group
that spearheaded resistance to the Israeli occupation, is also
behaving responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen who swarmed through the area in the first days after
liberation have disappeared. Instead, bulldozers bearing Hezbollah
banners are building earth barricades to keep cars away from the
most sensitive spots along the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's leader, insists that the struggle
against Israel will go on until Lebanese prisoners are freed from
Israeli jails, and a disputed patch of land, the so-called Shibaa
farms, is returned to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, it seems, is not to restart any fighting straightaway,
but to reserve the right to make mischief in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Locals are busy adjusting to life in Lebanon. One Christian
shopkeeper announces that the Shia Muslim guerrillas of Hezbollah
are his ``cousins,'' as he hides his last cases of Israeli beer.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some looting, and one or two reports of beatings,
especially in the Christian villages considered most sympathetic to
the Israeli occupation. But most residents profess astonishment at
the prevailing peace.
</P>
<P>
   The situation seems so calm, in fact, that several hundred of
the 5,500 Lebanese who fled with the departing Israelis have now
announced that they want to return. Heartened by the peaceful
atmosphere and the absence of a pogrom against supposed
collaborators, they have started trickling back across the
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. says that it is close to setting its seal on the
proceedings by certifying Israel's full withdrawal. Teams of
soldiers, cartographers and mine-sweepers have worked their way
along the front-line, trying to chart the old international
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army, eager to earn the inspectors' approval, has
been demolishing fortifications that straddle the border. It blew
up a communications mast that stood a few meters inside Lebanon on
May 29, and other minor salients are due to get similar treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet things could still turn sour. The Lebanese government, like
Hezbollah, disagrees with the U.N. about the Shibaa farms, at the
eastern end of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   If, as expected, the U.N. tries to defer this question and
endorses the withdrawal, the Lebanese government may refuse to
accept its findings.
</P>
<P>
   At best, that would mean the continued threat of cross-border
attacks by Hezbollah. At worst, Lebanon could refuse to allow U.N.
peacekeepers to patrol the disputed border. Without their
checkpoints, a Lebanese with a grudge, or any of the hundreds of
thousands of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, could take a potshot
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing could easily happen in reverse. The Israeli
government has started handing out machine guns to residents of
border villages, along with stern but unenforceable warnings to use
them only in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the governments on both sides intend to frighten, not
fight, one another, the distinction may be lost on some of their
more lawless citizens. &QL;

   RICHMOND, VA. _ In a corner of a big warehouse in rural
Virginia, Bobby Thompson spends his days, amidst stacks of
Teletubbies and incontinence products, waiting for e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   When the PC dings with a message, he follows its instructions,
picking some product off the shelf, then boxing and labelling it to
be picked up. This is a new venture and still quiet, with hours
between messages, so Thompson fills in time by sweeping the floor
and tidying up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this sleepy scene lie the seeds of a radical
transformation of the trucking industry, one that is catapulting it
to the forefront of e-business.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thompson's employer, Great Coastal Express, is a
mid-sized regional trucking firm, the goods on the shelves around
him belong to small Internet retailers and business-to-business
(B2B) firms from as far away as Canada.
</P>
<P>
   They pay Great Coastal's GCX logistics subsidiary to handle
their order fulfillment, its bricks complementing their own clicks.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing particularly novel about that. After all,
mail-order retailers have been outsourcing fulfillment to ``pick
and pack'' logistics firms for years, and e-tailers, which are even
more virtual, have adopted the model with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   More telling is how Great Coastal and companies like it got into
the business in the first place: as a fortuitous outgrowth of the
desperate measures they were forced to employ to stay alive in an
increasingly tough trucking business.
</P>
<P>
   Once, America's trucking industry was a cozy, regulated
semi-cartel, with a few big companies dominating most regions. CB
radio and the call of the open road made every boy dream of one day
driving his own rig; the 18-wheel-culture boom created a bottomless
pool of available drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But when deregulation hit in the early 1980s, the business
quickly lost its charm. Hundreds of thousands of small firms
sprouted (there are now 450,000 trucking firms in America, compared
with 10,000 two decades ago), creating vicious price competition
that forced drivers to spend sleepless weeks at a time on the road
merely to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Burnout took its toll on experienced drivers, while drug testing
and a requirement that drivers be at least 21 years' old limited
the inflow of new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lost mystique, the industry continued to grow fast,
doubling and tripling in capacity even as prices dropped. The
result was that trucks grabbed the lion's share of the transport
market from trains, and now account for more than 80 percent of the
nation's freight bill.
</P>
<P>
   But an ever-growing call for trucking services has combined with
the diminishing appeal of the job to create an increasingly tight
market for drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Today the industry is short of an estimated 50,000-80,000
drivers (out of 3 million). And the average firm has to replace the
equivalent of its entire work force every year, a turnover rate
five times as big as in the fabled tight job market in technology.
</P>
<P>
   This has forced the trucking firms to take desperate measures to
attract and keep employees. Carriers now have to pay well _ the
best drivers make more than $80,000 a year _ and to offer such
perks as chiropractors, in-cab e-mail and special encouragement to
husband-and-wife (and even pet) teams.
</P>
<P>
   But the most effective way to make the job more attractive has
been to reduce the length of most trips to 300-400 miles, so that
drivers can spend more time with their families.
</P>
<P>
   As drivers defected from long-haul firms to short-haul ones to
recover a home life, trucking firms of all sorts had to change the
way they worked to stem the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Many responded by setting up ``terminals'' and regional
warehouse hubs at which one driver could hand over to another,
Pony-Express style, or loads could be redistributed, both to limit
the distance travelled and to avoid the bane of the industry,
trucks carrying half-empty trailers for part of their journey.
</P>
<P>
   Once they had built these warehouses, trucking firms found new
ways to use them, moving upstream into the logistics market that
was rising to meet demand from manufacturers looking for ways to
save money by outsourcing their warehousing and shipping.
</P>
<P>
   GCX, for instance, warehouses inventory for KB Toys and DuPont.
Although owning and operating warehouses is expensive, it is also
lucrative, allowing trucking firms to forge lasting relationships
with manufacturers and to move beyond the cutthroat commodity
business of basic freight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, despite the trends of just-in-time
manufacturing and shortening supply chains, total warehouse space
in America has increased by 700 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the increase was in the third-party logistics industry,
as it is known, which grew by nearly 17 percent to $45 billion last
year, according to Armstrong &AMP; Associates, a consulting firm based
in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by sheer coincidence, along came e-commerce. Suddenly the
value of those warehouses became glaringly obvious. Few of the
thousands of new e-businesses wanted the expense and trouble of
building their own fulfillment operations.
</P>
<P>
   If FedEx can package and ship computers for Dell (and the
customer is none the wiser), surely the average
trucking-turned-logistics firm can do the same for online firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor shortages changed the industry, forcing us to move
toward warehouses,'' says Emmett Williamson, GCX's president. ``It
just so happened that this plays well to e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, reckons Armstrong, there are about 250 successful
e-commerce fulfillment and logistics firms in America, of which
around 25 have come out of the trucking industry. But it expects
that number to grow, as more trucking firms capture the obvious
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some of the larger trucking and logistics firms, such
as Schneider National, are building dedicated B2B e-commerce
fulfillment operations.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when a buyer clicks on the ``ship now'' button on
paperloop.com, a bulk paper distributor, the order goes directly to
Schneider, which fills it from its own warehouses on its own
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is a paradigm shift much more dramatic than
deregulation was in 1980,'' proclaimed David Stubblefield,
president of ABF Freight System, a big trucking and logistics
company, at a recent conference. ``It will change all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereas deregulation turned a cozy and profitable business into
a thin-margin snakepit, e-commerce could restore trucking's glory
days
</P>
<P>
   CB radio has given way to e-mail, GPS tracking and wired hubs.
With all that seductive technology, a new generation of kids might
even dream of being truckers again. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   LIMA _ ``Democracy is dead,'' declared President Alberto
Fujimori's defeated challenger, Alejandro Toledo, to 50,000
supporters in Lima's central San Martin Square after the polls had
closed in the May 28 presidential run-off. ``Fujimori, murderer,''
chanted the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Latin America tacitly agreed. So, loudly, did the United
States. But what were they all, Peruvians or others, to do about
the result: a president re-elected to power, however bogus the
count, in a sovereign country and with a firm grip on its election
authorities, media, judiciary and, it appears, soldiery _ and this
in a continent with a historic dislike of foreign intervention?
</P>
<P>
   That was less clear. After a first-round count plagued with
irregularities (though it credited Fujimori with a fraction less
than 50 percent), Toledo had refused to take part in the run-off
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Election observers from the Organization of American States then
proposed a face-saving way out: postpone the vote for at least ten
days, while they checked new counting software.
</P>
<P>
   Private opinion polls showed Fujimori's lead growing, so this
might have favored him. But, after some negotiations, the electoral
board said no.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, Fujimori won, polling about 51 percent, against
17 percent for Toledo, whose name remained on the ballot. But
nearly a third of the voters spoiled their ballot papers, after
Toledo had urged them to write ``No to fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   That protest and opposition rallies on election night _ the Lima
meeting was the biggest in the capital in a decade _ are
significant. In the past, many Peruvians inclined to opposition
have been afraid of being labelled ``terrorists,'' like the
guerrillas whom Fujimori crushed in the early 1990s. Now he must
reckon with a new readiness for political activism.
</P>
<P>
   How will he react? He has never been a man of compromise:
witness his ``self-coup'' in 1992, when, with army support, he sent
Congress packing. But then he had wide public backing.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Peru is split roughly down the middle between those who
back him and those who have had enough. Despite his post-election
message to the nation promising conciliation and more democracy,
Fujimori today looks a lonely man.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police had to disperse demonstrators in Lima and several
provincial cities; violence may not be far off. The generals and
the intelligence-service boss, Vladimiro Montesinos, may well
foresee their already large role in the state growing larger still.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, Fujimori's style of government, unravelling what feeble
institutions Peru had, has tried the patience even of former
ex-admirers.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans called the election invalid, and Fujimori's
response to complaints about it ``a serious threat to the
inter-American system and its commitment to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, however, they drew back: a ``flawed'' election was now
the word. One can guess why. Though the OAS mission did much to
expose the flaws, Latin American countries do not like to meddle,
or see the United States do so, in each other's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The election was rigged, but it was within Peruvian law; ``the
business of Peruvians,'' said Mexico's foreign minister. The
Venezuelans, whose President Hugo Chavez has no wild esteem for the
formalities of democracy, are swayed by Fujimori's argument that
half of those who voted his way.
</P>
<P>
   When OAS ministers met this week, the United States won no
agreement even to condemn the election, let alone apply sanctions.
It will have to twist arms hard to do better at a fuller OAS
meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo has vowed to go on campaigning until Fujimori steps down.
But without an organized political party structure, he may be
hard-pressed to keep the momentum of opposition going, even if
resentment continues.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will be reluctant to cut aid off altogether:
Peru is a major ally in its war on drugs. And even Toledo thinks
that the sort of halfhearted sanctions that might drag on, slowing
Peru's economy without bringing down its president, would hurt
those Peruvians who are worst off already.
</P>
<P>
   One option that Toledo claims has been discussed within
government circles is that the vice-president, Francisco Tudela,
might take over from Fujimori after a few months.
</P>
<P>
   That might offer a convenient way out for foreign governments
anxious to see any sign of official penitence. But the result might
merely be a change of face, as in the old days of everlasting
one-party rule in Mexico. It certainly would not satisfy Toledo:
Fujimori and Tudela alike, he says, are both illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   More important, perhaps, would the notion satisfy Fujimori? He
had to work hard _ not least on the judiciary _ to get the
constitutionally questionable right to run for a third term at all.
His friends had to rig the electoral machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Has he really gone through all that just to step down, without
being pushed? &QL;

   MOSCOW _ Even in the democratic heyday of post-communism, Russia
was a tough place for greens.
</P>
<P>
   Where the right laws existed, they were hard to enforce. A
combination of abundant natural wealth, plenty of space and
careless habits meant that few Russians took environmental
housekeeping seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a mix of business interests, criminal activity and
government paranoia threatens to make matters even worse.
</P>
<P>
   Last month President Vladimir Putin abolished the main agency
for environmental protection, handing over its central functions to
its chief bureaucratic rival, the Ministry for Natural Resources.
Environmentalists say that this amounts to putting an alcoholic in
charge of the vodka store.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is true that, like many of its other laws, Russia's
environmental rules (and the bureaucrats who enforce them) can be
maddeningly pedantic, contradictory and susceptible to corruption,
abolishing the agency that monitors them seems an unhelpful
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists believe that the agency was axed under
pressure from powerful business interests, which argue that green
regulation is blocking development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people now in power think that ecology is for rich
countries,'' says Alexei Yablokov, president of the Center for
Environmental Policy, a pressure-group.
</P>
<P>
   Gangsters who profit hugely from illegal logging and fishing are
another powerful force. Their activity contributes to a largely
invisible environmental catastrophe in the remoter parts of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Natural resources are plundered on a stupendous, unsustainable
scale. The ministry now in charge at once announced that it would
``simplify'' the environmental rules governing industry, suggesting
a further relaxation of controls that have already proved
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The government has made a few rhetorical nods to the
environmental cause, for example by promising to protect the
embattled sturgeon, the fish that produces caviar. It has also
allowed Russia's best-known environmental campaigner, Alexander
Nikitin, to leave the country after his acquittal on charges of
treason.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little sign that Putin cares about the environment.
Last year, when he was still head of the security service, he
accused ecological groups of providing a ``convenient cover'' for
foreign spies.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's greens have been squawking. They hope their American
friends can help them put the issue on the agenda for Bill
Clinton's visit to Moscow this weekend. And the main green groups
have called an emergency joint congress for June 13.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, the government has been increasingly treating
environmental campaigners as a subversive menace. Some have been
arrested, and then released, on drug and terrorism charges.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups have been subject to threatening financial audits,
allegedly ordered by the federal prosecutor's office. A spokeswoman
for that office has said that a number of green groups are indeed
being checked for ``confidential'' reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Greenpeace's Moscow office briefly faced closure this year on
flimsy-sounding bureaucratic grounds. ``It looks as though they
have organized an attack on the environmental movement as the
avant-garde for civil society,'' says a worried Yablokov.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists fear that later this year they will face
new legal obstacles, especially if they receive grants from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all this, the new government announced ambitious plans
on May 25 to build 40 new fast-breeder nuclear-power stations in
Russia over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   And it is considering another alarming project: the export of
floating nuclear-power plants to Asia. Just the sort of thing for
environmentalists to shout about _ if the government will let
them. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ As the Euro 2000 championship looms and the
continent again becomes football-crazy, an old question is being
asked once more: will Americans ever learn to love football _
European football, that is _ or are the rhythms of the world's most
popular game somehow out of sync with the American spirit?
</P>
<P>
   Soccer is the fourth most popular game in American playgrounds
after basketball, volleyball and softball, and the fastest-growing
recreational activity among schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   America has hosted two hugely successful World Cups and is
rapidly emerging as an international force.
</P>
<P>
   Football's place alongside more traditional American pastimes
would seem assured. But when it comes to a professional league of
their own, Americans remain blissfully indifferent to this variety
of football.
</P>
<P>
   Currently in its fifth season, Major League Soccer (MLS), the
long-awaited successor to the North American Soccer League (NASL),
is still playing mostly to empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Los Angeles Galaxy and the defending champions, DC
United, have cultivated small but deeply loyal followings. And the
calibre of play has clearly improved. Seamus Malin, America's
foremost football analyst, reckons the MLS is now a credible
second-tier league and believes some of its clubs could well hold
their own against many European sides.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, although the MLS drew 17,000 spectators a match during its
inaugural season, the average attendance is now just 14,000. The
league does even worse on television; its games barely register a
rating.
</P>
<P>
   Selling football to Americans requires patience, say MLS
executives. Above all, they want to avoid repeating the experience
of the NASL, which folded in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The NASL, they say, depended too much on one star-studded team,
the New York Cosmos, and its free-spending owner, Warner
Communications. The Cosmos fielded a lineup that included Pele,
Franz Beckenbauer, Carlos Alberto and a host of other legends who,
though no longer in their prime, were still highly entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   But when Warner lost interest in football it pulled the plug on
the Cosmos _ and on the entire league. Given the money top
internationals now command, the MLS does not have the option of
importing superstars.
</P>
<P>
   The league has a few big-name foreigners, but it believes that
Americans generally prefer to watch Americans and that its main
purpose is to serve as a showcase for home-grown talent. Keeping
the talent at home is a headache for these very reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of world-class competition diminishes the league's
appeal and the pay is uncompetitive. To help contain costs (or at
least limit the bleeding: the MLS reportedly lost over $100 million
in its first four seasons), the league caps team payrolls at $1.73
million and salaries at $270,000, though exceptions are
occasionally made for high-profile imports.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some of America's finest, among them Joe-Max Moore,
Claudio Reyna and Tony Sanneh, have taken their studs abroad.
Up-and-coming stars are also defecting. Landon Donovan, named
player of the tournament at last year's under-17 world championship
in New Zealand, has joined Bayer Leverkusen, a German club.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising junior, DaMarcus Beasley, Donovan's runner-up
in New Zealand, is, for the moment, sticking with the Chicago Fire.
But several European clubs, including Arsenal, Barcelona, and PSV
Eindhoven, are said to be interested in the 17-year-old midfielder,
and it may be just a matter of time before he too departs for
greener pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly, the inferior quality of the MLS is keeping fans away.
More likely, though, Americans just find football too slow and
maddening.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas basketball guarantees 48 minutes of slam dunks, football
threatens 90 minutes of dashed hopes. Americans, not always known
for their patience, seem to prefer more gratification _ that is,
more scoring _ from their pastimes. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Databases are becoming increasingly important
research tools in scientific fields from astronomy to genetics. But
they can also have other, more surprising uses _ in etymology, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Shapiro of Yale Law School, who is the editor of the
forthcoming ``Yale Dictionary of Quotations,'' has been using a
database of academic journals called JSTOR to track down the
origins of new words and expressions.
</P>
<P>
   His latest finding, announced in a note in the current issue of
the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, is of the earliest
known published use of that now-ubiquitous word, ``software.''
</P>
<P>
   This word was, he found, used in 1958 by John Tukey, a
mathematician at Princeton University, in an article published in
the American Mathematical Monthly. Tukey was a major figure in
20th-century statistics and, says Shapiro, he also had a fondness
for coining new words and phrases.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest contribution to the vocabulary of computing was
previously thought to be his invention, in 1946, of the word
``bit,'' short for binary digit.
</P>
<P>
   But it now seems that he is also responsible for introducing the
term ``software,'' in the following sentence: Today the
``software'' comprising the carefully planned interpretive
routines, compilers, and other aspects of automative programming
are at least as important to the modern electronic calculator as
its ``hardware'' of tubes, transistors, wires, tapes and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ``software'' and ``hardware'' appear in inverted
commas suggests that Tukey expected these words to be unfamiliar to
his readers. Previously, the first recorded appearance of the word
``software'' in print was in 1960. So this sentence may well be the
original source of the term.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that Shapiro has used JSTOR to push
back the first known use of a particular word. The database
consists of over 100 scholarly journals in multiple fields, going
back many years, and in some cases over a century.
</P>
<P>
   Journal pages are scanned in at high resolution, and the text is
extracted using optical character-recognition software. It is then
possible to retrieve journal pages that match particular search
terms. (JSTOR is operated by a not-for-profit organization and is
available online by subscription.)
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro has previously uncovered uses of words and phrases
including ``double standard,'' ``post-modern'' and ``racist'' that
predate the earliest-known uses listed in the ``Oxford English
Dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   But the OED could yet have the last word on ``software.''
Shapiro says that a member of the OED staff has uncovered an
example of the word dating back to 1850, though in a rather
different context.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, ``soft-ware'' and ``hard-ware'' were terms used by
trash-can scavengers to distinguish compost from non-biodegradable
matter. So a Victorian would have been baffled by the modern use of
the term.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage in, garbage out, as computer programmers like to say. &QL;

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, June 6:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GRAND-CANYON (Grand Canyon) _ The mysteries of Grand
Canyon's formation continue to amaze geologists. This week more
than 80 of them will gather in Grand Canyon Village to compare
notes and work toward a unified theory of how and when the canyon
formed. The last time a similar group of experts met to discuss the
evolution of the Colorado River was in August 1964, before modern
theories of plate tectonics revolutionized geophysics with the
notion that continents could drift, slam into one another and alter
entire landscapes the size of the American Southwest. Not
surprisingly, the favorite theories from the previous era are now
on the table for serious revision. By Sandra Blakeslee. (2100
words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT3, and a graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Denver) _ Gene therapy burst into the news
like a bolt of lightning last fall, when a teenager from Tuscon
died in an experiment at the University of Pennsylvania. But while
politicians and the press have spent the year focusing on
allegations of lax government oversight and shoddily-run clinical
trials, the science of gene therapy has been making quiet, steady
progress. Little by little, researchers say, they are finding new
and better ways to deliver genes to their target cells. By Sheryl
Gay Stolberg. (1780 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CORN-BUTTERFLIES (Undted) _ The first field study of corn
genetically engineered to produce pesticides finds that the pollen
does not have adverse effects on black swallowtail butterflies.
However, the results do not bear directly on monarch butterflies,
which were found in an earlier laboratory study to be harmed by
such pollen. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SOLAR-HILLS (Undated) _ As predicted by theoreticians, the
Sun's surface is pockmarked by a grid of short hills that are
similar to long-lived, slow-moving bumps that travel across the
Earth's oceans, scientists have shown. By Kenneth Chang. (715
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BLACK-HOLES (Undated) _ By the latest count, astronomers
have detected massive black holes at the centers of more than 30
galaxies. The numbers are now sufficient, scientists say, to
recognize patterns and understand where, when and how the most
powerful black holes typically develop. The discoveries of several
are being announced this week. By John Noble Wilford. (775 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLAT-SPACE (Undated) _ Nothing in the entire course of human
history would have been noticeably different if the universe were
not flat. Yet precisely for this reason there is poetry in the
recent discoveries that are worth celebrating, even if one is not a
cosmologist. They represent on the one hand a triumph of the human
imagination, and on the other a valuable reminder that science can
never be purely cerebral. An essay by Lawrence M. Krauss. (1575
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on gas
beneath the floor of the mid-Atlantic, the lack of fossils of
butterflies and insects and lingering insecticides. By Henry
Fountain. (680 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOCTORS-TESTS (Undated) _ Doctors' experiences can often
lead them to the wrong conclusion and cause problems in the end. A
vivid example of why controlled double-blind testing in the end
makes for better science. (800 words) By Abigail Zuger, M.D.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PERON-HEALTH (Undated) _ New discoveries about the life of
Eva Peron show that she was never told about her cancer, that a top
New York surgeon was flown in to treat her without her knowledge
and that she never knew the seriousness of her cancer. Like many
others of that era, her illness was hidden from her. And as still
occurs today, the illnesses of public officials can still be hidden
from the public. By Lawrence K. Altman. (1340 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Morning
sickness may be troublesome, but science shows that it has many
health benefits, including protection the fetus and the mother. By
Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ORBACH-DIANNA (Undated) _ Conversation with Susie Orbach,
the psychotherapist who treated the Princess of Wales. By Claudia
Dreifus. (1320 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT1.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SAILING-YOUTH (Undated) _ Sailing is used as therapy to help
troubled youths learn discipline and teamwork. By Alison Hendrie.
(650 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT2.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on health and
fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ Considering how hard it is for many people to remember what
they did even the day before, it is remarkable that so many
childhood memories remain intact. But now a new study shows that
many of those memories may be, at best, suspect. (265 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ A new study, however, suggests that one sign of the future
cocaine addict is if he plunges headlong into cocaine use from the
very beginning. (290 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers say they have been able to measure brain changes
in dyslexic children who have been taught to read with a newly
developed technique. (290 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ An article in The Annals of Internal Medicine suggests there
may be merit to an alternative form of medicine known as distance
healing. This can include anything from therapeutic touch _ in
which a practitioner, without touching the patient, tries to alter
his energy field _ to simply praying for someone who is ill. But
there's no explanation. (260 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DYING (Undated) _ Short update on the work sheet used to
determine what end-of-life treatment people may prefer. By Denise
Grady. (150 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: Whatever
happened to seeding clouds to make it rain? By C. Claiborne Ray.

PROBLEM IS, `M.Y.O.B.' DOESN'T MIND ITS OWN BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``M.Y.O.B'' spends so much time talking about other television
shows that it seems to have forgotten it has its own characters to
contend with. And that's just one of the problems to doom an
otherwise promising premise that places adoption and the search for
identity at the heart of its comedic possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Riley Veatch (Katharine Towne) is a 16-year-old whose search for
her birth mother has landed her on the doorstep of her aunt, a
conservative, uptight high school principal (Lauren Graham).
</P>
<P>
   But locating her biological mother quickly takes a back seat to
Riley's limitless supply of snappy comebacks, pop culture
references and verbal assaults, all of which are designed to make
her seem hip, cool and edgy for bucking authority, yet merely make
her seem like a bitter, unhappy malcontent.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually unclear whether Aunt Opal's sister is the birth
mother, particularly after Opal and Riley receive a fax from her
(she joined a cult and moved to Finland) that simply says, ``I've
never been pregnant. You're being had.''
</P>
<P>
   Opal, whose life is tied up in the school and a girlfriend who
phones her every evening, lets Riley stick around anyway, enrolling
her in school and slowly easing her into the small town's life,
which includes a nightly dose of ``Law &AMP; Order'' (must be the
reruns on A&AMP;E).
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship is cemented in Tuesday's premiere when Riley
uses her skills of manipulation (''lead with the breasts,'' is her
advice) to first get Opal the promotion she was in line for and, in
next week's episode, to save her from the horrible ordeal of firing
her one and only friend for romancing a student.
</P>
<P>
   ``M.Y.O.B,'' which means mind your own business, comes from Don
Roos (''The Opposite of Sex''), who uses the single-camera format
that gives Fox's ``Malcolm in the Middle'' its unsitcom look. But
that's about the extent of the positives coming out of the first
two episodes. The real issue is that even for a sitcom that wants
to derive some of its comedy from the drama of an adopted teen-ager
searching for her biological family, the humor is tired and the
drama that could fuel it is acknowledged only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   But most annoying is how ``M.Y.O.B'' is full of TV references,
with most of them being supplied by Riley's voiceover.
</P>
<P>
   On the town: ``I was hoping for `Melrose Place.' But it was more
like `Green Acres.'''

   In the midst of big changes at the online investment firm Wit
Capital Group(WITC:Nasdaq), its co-chief executive unexpectedly
resigned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Readmond, who joined New York-based Wit in 1998, will
remain a director and is returning to private life to devote time
to personal matters, Wit said. Robert Lessin, the company's
chairman, is assuming the role of sole chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the completion of our acquisition of SoundView Technology
Group earlier this year, the pending acquisition of EOffering, and
our strategic alliance with ETrade Group(EGRP:Nasdaq), I felt that
it was the right time to transition to the next generation of
leaders,'' Readmond said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company is trading its retail brokerage with ETrade in
exchange for EOffering, an online investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Wit also named Russell Crabs and Mark Loehr co-presidents. Crabs
was previously president, chief executive and director of research
at SoundView, while Loehr was head of investment banking at Wit.
</P>
<P>
   Wit's stock dropped 13/32, or 4 percent, to 9 around midday
Monday.

THOMSON TO BUY PRIMARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Stock quote in last graf does not reflect close)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Canadian publisher Thomson said Monday that it will buy Primark
(PMK:NYSE), a provider of financial, economic, and market research
information, for about $842 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as Thomson, a traditional print publisher,
focuses more on providing information online and through CD-roms
and computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, Toronto-based Thomson will pay
$38 for each share of Primark stock, a 31 percent premium over
Primark's closing price Friday. The transaction is expected to be
completed in the second half of the year. Thomson will also assume
$235 million in Primark debt.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kasputys, chairman and chief executive of Primark, will
become the chairman of Thomson Financial, the company's financial
publishing arm.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Thomson recorded $5.8 billion in revenue and Thomson
Financial recorded $1.44 billion. The majority of the company's
revenue is derived from specialized legal, financial and medical
information, as well as textbooks. Thomson also has substantial
North American newspaper assets, which it plans to sell, though it
won't sell Toronto's The Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
   Primark, based in Waltham, Mass., posted $495 million. The
company offers information in print, online and other electronic
media.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday midday trading, shares of Primark neared Thomson's
offer price, soaring 29 percent, or 8 5/16, to 37 5/16, after
reaching a 52-week high of 37 1/2. Meanwhile, shares of Thomson
fell 60 Canadian cents, or 1 percent, to C$50.40 on the Toronto
Stock Exchange.

COURTESY? RESPECT? DON'T MISS THE POINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I always liked hearing the story about how I got my name. It was
given to me, my mother told me, by the midwife who helped bring me
into the world.
</P>
<P>
   My daughters are the same way about their names. They can listen
to my stories over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   But this column isn't about names. Not exactly. It is about
common courtesy. Respect.
</P>
<P>
   Which gets me to Miss Hale.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Harold Hale was just a child when he made a
vow that whites would never be able to address his daughter without
due and proper respect, like they did his mother.
</P>
<P>
   To guarantee it, he'd name her Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Miss Hale is a 26-year-old graduate student at Morgan
State University in Baltimore. Everybody calls her Miss. It's her
name.
</P>
<P>
   I always liked that story, liked the way Miss shared it with me,
liked the pride in her brown eyes and in her voice.
</P>
<P>
   But I hadn't much thought about it again until the other day
when I read about yet another effort by school officials to teach
students manners and morals.
</P>
<P>
   I shrugged when I read last year how Louisiana lawmakers had
decided to legislate courtesy in the state's schools. Students had
to address their teachers respectfully or face detention. Well,
maybe I gave it more than a shrug. I do remember thinking God
always has a way of getting our attention.
</P>
<P>
   The idea caught on briefly with legislators in other states. As
the nation tried to come to grips with school violence, governors
in Alabama and South Carolina began pushing ``yes, sir; no, ma'am''
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just fluff,'' state Rep. John Rogers of Alabama was
quoted as saying in an Associated Press story.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Rogers had a different approach: He preferred to
improve the climate in our schools with better pay and training for
teachers. The proposed bill in Alabama was killed.
</P>
<P>
   But I was struck by his belief that the ``yes ma'am'' proposal
brought back uncomfortable reminders of slavery and Jim Crow.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't say `yes, sir' or `no, sir,' you were going to
get 40 lashes,'' Rogers said. ``It's the wrong message to send to
kids at school, especially black kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching children common courtesy is hardly damaging to them,
even to African-Americans. My parents taught me to respond to my
elders that way. I still do, and it hasn't hurt me.
</P>
<P>
   And not once did it make me feel beneath anyone. In fact, it
elevates me to a place that a simple yes or no, or nod of the head,
never could.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Hale was living in a different time when he vowed to name
his daughter Miss. It was a time when black men had to address
white boys as ``sir,'' when they themselves were called ``boys.''
He couldn't conceive of a world like the one we enjoy these days.
</P>
<P>
   And so when his daughter was born in 1973, he kept his promise
to himself. That says as much about the time he was living in as it
does his character.
</P>
<P>
   He believed his mother deserved to be addressed with the proper
title, even by white children. I suspect that's how he addressed
his elders.
</P>
<P>
   Not saying ``yes, sir'' or ``no, sir,'' could get you 40 lashes,
especially in Alabama, where Hale grew up. But if you were a child
addressing an adult with any less respect, you deserved it.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same punishment white children who called Hale's mother
Pearlie deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring students to address teachers this way won't stop
violence in the schools. It won't even deter drug use. But it will
restore a common courtesy that can't help but lift us all.

<P>
   Toysrus.com, the online offshoot of Toys R Us (TOY:NYSE), said
Monday that it will expand, opening new offices in New Jersey and
the San Francisco Bay area by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as other Internet-based toy retailers have
shuttered their operations.
</P>
<P>
   The new East Coast office of Toysrus.com will be located in Fort
Lee, N.J., a short distance from New York City, while Toys R Us,
the second-largest toy retailer behind Wal-Mart Stores (WMT:NYSE),
is based further from New York City, in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Lee facility will occupy 46,000 square feet and hold up
to 240 employees by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A lease in San Francisco will be finalized in the next few
weeks, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Toysrus.com comes in the face of recent industry
downsizing, as some Internet companies aim for those rare
commodities of profitability and continued funding. For instance,
just last month, toysmart.com, an online retailer of educational
games and toys majority-owed by Disney (DIS:NYSE), closed its
three-year-old operation after using up much of its cash without a
source of replenishment. Also in May, Viacom's (VIA:NYSE)
RedRocket.com, another Web-based toy store, went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Toys R Us were up 2 percent, or 5/16, to 16 3/4 in
midday Monday trading.

PATHOGENESIS RISES ON HIRING OF GOLDMAN SACHS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of PathoGenesis (PGNS:NASDAQ) climbed Monday after the
biotechnology company said it had hired Goldman Sachs to seek out
``strategic options'' to raise its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company also said it was on track to meet Wall
Street's expectations for its financial results this year.
Analysts' estimates range from a gain of 2 cents per share to a
loss of 6 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   The company develops drugs to treat infectious diseases --
particularly lung infections -- including those common in cystic
fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for the company, said no
timetable has been set. She would not comment on whether
PathoGenesis is seeking a merger partner or an outright sale of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in PathoGenesis traded as high as 59 3/8 before beginning
a steep descent May 1999, following the release of a disappointing
set of first-quarter earnings, said Ajay Bansal, an analyst at
Mehta Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Bansal has a hold rating for the stock and his company has not
performed any underwriting. Mehta, a research and asset management
firm, had owned shares of PathoGenesis on behalf of its clients,
but sold its position last fall, Bansal said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that PathoGenesis is ``a one-product company,''
referring to its cystic fibrosis drug, and it achieved rapid market
penetration following its release in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are saying, 'where is the upside now?''' he said.
``We had liked the company, but what we found out was that the
volume is not good. If I were an individual investor and could get
a few shares here and there, I would. But if I were an
institutional investor looking to establish a position, it would be
very difficult to in this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his figures, Bansal said PathoGenesis shares are fairly
valued at around $20 a share.
</P>
<P>
   PathoGensis was lately up 1 3/4, or 10 percent, to 19 7/8.

CLINTON ASSURES RUSSIANS OF U.S. GOOD WILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON with ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the first appearance by a Western leader before
Russia's parliament, President Clinton on Monday sought to assure
its deputies that the United States wants Russia to become a strong
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Russians still suspect that America does not wish you
well,'' Clinton said. ``The United States wants a strong Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   While he is only the second world leader to address the
parliament _ Alexander Lukashenko, the autocratic president of
Belarus, was the first _ Clinton received only a polite and muted
reception. Some deputies skipped the session, partly because they
were confused about when it was supposed to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a full hall,'' said Nikolai Kharitonov, the leader
of an agrarian faction that generally supports the Russian
president, Vladimir Putin. ``But it was not a bad speech. Let's
hope it is realized constructively.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Clinton's task was a difficult one. NATO expansion,
the Western alliance's war with Yugoslavia and, more recently, the
Clinton administration's plans to build a limited missile defense
have created the impression here that Washington revels in its role
as the world's only superpower and is determined to thwart the
emergence of new powers, including Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton struggled, with limited success, to put those suspicions
to rest. The parliament he addressed is no longer a
Communist-dominated legislature, reflexively opposed to U.S.
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   It is a varied and sometimes fractious body, which is broadly
supportive of Putin but that also includes tycoons, a small cluster
of reform-minded democrats and nationalists as well as a stubborn
left-wing opposition.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an institution that will vote on Putin's plans for
economic reform, regulatory issues of interest to U.S. business and
future arms control treaties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of the Red parliament, Clinton goes to the Duma that
is loyal to the Kremlin,'' the newspaper Sevodnya observed. ``But
like the previous parliament it is not that friendly to the U.S.
president.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   U.S. security agents and White House sound engineers prowled the
parliament building, part of which served as the old State Planning
Agency during Soviet times. Their presence produced resentment from
some of the deputies, who complained that the event was being
turned into a White House production.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the lectern, Clinton declared that ``Russia's future
is very important to others because it is among the most important
journeys the world will witness in my lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   On security issues, Clinton insisted that his administration's
plan for limited missile defense was not a drive for military
superiority. And he underscored that he wanted to preserve the
principles of nuclear deterrence.
</P>
<P>
   On the economy, Clinton backed Russia's bid to join the World
Trade Organization, a bid that requires Moscow to change some of
its economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia should not be the only major industrialized country
standing outside this global trading system,'' Clinton said. ``We
will support you, but you must know the decision to join the WTO
requires difficult choices that only you can make.''
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, he criticized the prosecution of
Russia's war in Chechnya, insisting that he was speaking more in
sorrow than in anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question on Chechnya was an honest one, the question of a
friend,'' he said. ``And that is whether any war can be won that
requires large numbers of civilian casualties and has no political
component bringing about a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then launched into a discussion about how he sought to
negotiate peace in Northern Ireland as a kind of model for Russian
efforts in the North Caucasus. More generally, however, Clinton
insisted that he had not come to Moscow to preach to the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans have to overcome the temptation to think that we
have all the answers,'' Clinton said. ``You will choose what your
interests clearly demand and what your people democratically
embrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approach impressed some Russian politicians, even
those who underscored that the U.S. president's term was coming to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clever lecture,'' said Andrei Kokoshin, a deputy in
the Fatherland-All Russia party and a former national security
adviser to President Yeltsin. ``I think Clinton is still
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Boris Gryzlov, the leader of the Unity Party, which supports
Putin, objected to Clinton's discussion of Chechnya but said that
the Clinton administration's arms control position indicated that
it has listened to Moscow's concerns about the importance of the
anti-ballistic missile treaty signed by Russia and the United
States in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The communists and nationalists, the old masters of the
parliament, however, were sharply critical of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should not come here and tell us that Russia should be part
of Europe,'' said Alexander Kuvayev, one of the leading Communists
in the parliament. ``Russia can decide itself which way to go. And
what he said about Chechnya is none of his business.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky created a row,
screaming ``Shame! Shame!'' as Clinton spoke. Zhirinovsky plays the
part of an ardent nationalist, but many Russians see him as a kind
of clown on the political fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whom is he teaching how to live?'' Zhirinovsky yelled. ``It's
profane! We are not going to do what America commands!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After visiting the parliament, Clinton received the warmer
welcome he was more accustomed to during his previous four trips to
Russia as president. He visited Boris Yeltsin, the former Russian
president, at his residence outside Moscow before boarding a plane
for Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin had a sense of comradeship clearly lacking
in the president's business-like meetings with Putin. And Clinton
seemed to look back on the old meetings wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all just had a nice visit, just like old days,'' Clinton
said. ``He's got a beautiful place.''

   JOHANNESBURG _ Tom Boardman had a frustrating trip. As head of
an influential South African financial house, he had gone to
Britain and the United States in mid-May seeking investors. But
every meeting started the same way _ with concerns about
instability in Zimbabwe, where a land grab has marred an election
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appetite for buying into South Africa has been tempered by
Zimbabwe,'' said Boardman, chief executive of the Cape Town-based
Board of Executors, a banking and asset-management group. ``They
all asked the same question: What makes you think South Africa
won't go the same way?''
</P>
<P>
   Western pessimism about Africa is nothing new, but more and more
people across the continent find it hard to take. Sure, they
concede, Africa has serious troubles. But writing it off as
``hopeless,'' as one influential British magazine did recently, is
too much of a generalization.
</P>
<P>
   From Ghana to Botswana, politicians, intellectuals, and
corporate captains assert that their continent has passed into a
new era, where good governance and economics are gradually becoming
the norm.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of this ``African renaissance'' lies a fundamental
change in the way Africans see themselves _ less as helpless
recipients, more as capable partners. After a century of foreign
exploitation and homespun mischief, Africans are knocking at the
doors of richer nations with briefcases rather than beggars' bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most essential factor of an African renaissance is our
perception of ourselves in relation to the global community,'' said
Malegapuru Makgoba, a prominent South African academic. ``Before
you can drive human rights, before you can drive economic
development, you have to be conscious of who you are and what you
want to be. We are becoming conscious of our own dignity and
self-respect.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the year, Africans heralded what they
enthusiastically called ``the African century,'' the dawn of an era
in which Africa would emerge as a vibrant marketplace in the global
village, rather than its festering ghetto. Gone were colonialism,
the Cold War, apartheid, and dictatorial Zaire. For the first time,
democratic governments ruled South Africa and Nigeria, the
continent's two most important hubs, at the same time. Africa, it
seemed, captured the millennium's spirit of new beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   But things fell apart, again. The government of Zimbabwe,
challenged by a surging opposition movement after two decades of
uninterrupted rule, let loose ax-wielding thugs against its rivals.
Mobs invaded white-owned farms under the pretext of land reform,
but then turned the occupied lands into ``re-education camps,''
beating black farm workers into allegiance to the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Floods devastated Mozambique. Rwanda and Uganda, two allies in
the multinational war in Congo, turned their guns on each other.
Famine struck arid Ethiopia, which then attacked its seaside
neighbor, Eritrea. And a ragtag rebel movement of boy-soldiers that
terrorized Sierra Leona a year ago by hacking the limbs off
children with machetes took 500 international peacekeepers hostage,
violating a peace accord that made its leader vice president of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The crises tapped a deep well of ink as the international media
cried for a hopeless continent. ``Brutality, despotism, and
corruption exist everywhere,'' the Economist magazine stated two
weeks ago, ``but African societies, for reasons buried in their
cultures, seem especially susceptible to them.''
</P>
<P>
   African intellectuals find such condemnations sweeping and
wrong, but not surprising. As late as 1987, Margaret Thatcher, then
prime minister of Britain, declared that ``anyone who thinks that
the ANC is going to run the government of South Africa is living in
Cloud Cuckooland.'' Just seven years later, African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela was sworn in as state president.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Mandela's successor, Thabo Mbeki, who spent
the latter part of May urging political and business leaders in
Britain and the United States to help developing nations combat
poverty, is that Africa's Western critics fail to distinguish one
African country from another. No one has said, Mbeki noted during a
recent fireside chat with a few foreign journalists, that the
Balkan crises of the past decade proved all Europe was culturally
barbaric. Yet, Africa is repeatedly seen as one entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of which, of course, is that when war erupts
between Eritrea and Ethiopia, it's Africa; when Foday Sankoh,'' the
rebel leader of Sierra Leone, ``and his people kidnap UN
peacekeepers, that's Africa; instability around Zimbabwe around the
land question, that's Africa,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela signaled two years ago that Africans wanted a new set of
rules. Standing alongside President Clinton at a news conference in
Cape Town, he chided the West for questioning his choice of
friends. Libya's Moammar Khadafy and Syria's Hafez Assad may be
international pariahs, Mandela said, but they supported black
liberation struggles.
</P>
<P>
   That tone may sound arrogant, said Mandela's longtime friend,
Mac Maharaj, but it derives from the decades of struggle against
oppression, and it still applies as Africans demand a new place at
the world's table.
</P>
<P>
   As the country that epitomizes Africa's positive shift, South
Africa is the moral and intellectual midwife of the renaissance
ideal. But the call for renewal resonates across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade, Strive Masiyiwa, arguably Zimbabwe's most
successful businessman, has battled official corruption. As the
generation that fought against colonialism fades, he said, Africans
are rapidly shifting their view.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great challenges . . . revolves around this very
issue that, `Let's not wash our dirty linen in public.' That
mind-set has led to a lot of our greatest minds turning a blind eye
to a rising demagoguery in our society. That's what we have to
break. Comradeship must not be a refuge for lies and intellectual
dishonesty,'' Masiyiwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Makgoba said he sees a kind of second flowering of black
consciousness. In the 1970s, a dynamic young South African named
Stephen Biko argued that blacks needed to find their own self-worth
before they could find peace with their white oppressors. That same
ideal, Makgoba said, shapes Africa's emerging assertiveness. ``What
we are trying to say is, `Don't dictate to us.' That's an important
development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologist Themba Sono said fellow Africans shouldn't get
carried away with a renaissance ideal, particularly when children
are forced into soldiering, people sold into slavery, and
governments brutalize their people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a new man, prove it,'' said Sono, of the University
of Pretoria. ``Our priority should be to correct what's wrong, to
see that the thugs are brought to book and find humanity for
African people.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, Mbeki said, is to build a more constructive
partnership between Africa and the West. Africa is rebuilding, he
said. South Africa is helping its neighbors to build aluminum
smelters and regional natural-gas pipelines. Nigeria has offered to
send election monitors to Zimbabwe. More and more leaders are
pressing their peers to adhere to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we looked at some detail at what is happening in Africa, it
is possible to isolate the bad things that are happening,'' Mbeki
said. ``What then do we do about Africa, not to deny the bad things
that are happening, but also not then to allow that those bad
things overshadow the very important work that is being done? I
would like us to have a look at this question.''

IN THE WAKE OF THE BLAIR WITCH, HEATHER DONAHUE GOES FOR LAUGHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly

 (Includes a color slide of Heather Donahue in a scene from ``Boys
and Girls.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``The Blair Witch Project'' scared audiences silly last summer,
but the hit horror film's success proved even more terrifying for
Heather Donahue.
 &HT;    Donahue starred as Heather, one of three documentarians stalked
by strange forces in the eerie Maryland woods. The unheralded film
took off, and the actress was catapulted from unknown to overnight
sensation.
 &HT;    ``It sort of opened my eyes and made me reconsider what I really
wanted,'' Donahue says. ``All of a sudden I was in the public eye,
and that was frightening to me.
 &HT;    ``It didn't have anything to do with the work aspect of what I
do, which is what I love,'' she hastens to add. ``I was dealing
with this whole other full-time job that was just not what I had in
mind.''
 &HT;    After the fact, and in the midst of the ``Blair Witch'' hoopla,
Donahue looked hard in the mirror, picked the brains of family and
friends, and conferred with her agents. After having spent her
career perfectly happy performing in regional stage productions and
independent features, she wanted to take control of her suddenly
blossoming options.
 &HT;    ``I want to work on stuff I like,'' the refreshingly
straightforward actress says by telephone from the Los Angeles home
she shares with her longtime boyfriend, writer/photographer Gregor
Hrynisdak. ``I don't want to limit myself because something's not a
big-budget production, and I don't want to do something crappy
because it will make a lot of money. I don't want that to become my
criteria for choosing a project.
 &HT;    ``It's all very complicated,'' Donahue says. ``It was good for
me to remember what my values were and what my goals were, and then
to see how they could fit into the bigger picture that my agents
helped me to see.
 &HT;    ``I'm still figuring it out,'' she admits. ``Everybody has his
or her own path, and sometimes that's not always immediately clear.
I think if you stay true to yourself you have a better chance of
staying on the correct path that will be satisfying to you in the
long run.''
 &HT;    Donahue's post-``Blair Witch'' path is a perfect example of her
attempt to hang onto her past while looking to her future. Making
two films simultaneously, she accepted a supporting role in the
high-profile feature ``Boys and Girls,'' which will open nationwide
on June 16, while co-starring in the indie feature ``Seven and a
Match,'' which is currently seeking a distributor.
 &HT;    ``My character in `Boys and Girls' is a slightly off-kilter
woman who's a combination of Betty Crocker and an electrical
engineer,'' Donahue says. ``She's completely obsessed with Ryan,
who is Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character.
 &HT;    ``She's quite awkward, but very confident in her awkwardness,''
Donahue adds. ``Megan ultimately snags Ryan when his friend
Jennifer, Claire Forlani's character, puts him up to it. And our
relationship continues until the big surprise.''
 &HT;    ``Boys and Girls'' is only one of several recent hormone-driven,
high-school- or college-based romantic comedies, however, and
Donahue is hard-pressed to say what will distinguish it from
``She's All That'' (1999), ``Down to You'' (2000) and ``Road Trip''
(2000). Asked to do so, the actress turns silent, then dissolves
into laughter, and finally stammers.
 &HT;    ``What will set it apart?'' she asks. ``OK, hang on. Give me a
second. Aaaaah. Hmmm. Well. It's got a great supporting cast. It's
a lot of fun. It's about how you can't hide from your own fate, as
much as you try.
 &HT;    ``How's that? Not bad under pressure.''
 &HT;    Donahue's role in the film may be a glorified cameo, but she
relished the experience, both for the chance to play a lighter role
and for the perks that come with big-budget filmmaking.
 &HT;    ``It was such a great opportunity to do something that had
nothing in common with `The Blair Witch Project' or my `Blair
Witch' character,'' she says. ``It was cute and light and fun, and
we shot it in San Francisco. And there's nothing like San Francisco
with a per-diem.
 &HT;    ``For everybody else on the set it was sort of a low-budget
studio movie,'' she adds, ``but for me it was big-time. At lunch
there were four different salads to choose from on the
craft-service table. I was like, `All right. This I can do.'
 &HT;    ``In my journal it is actually written in capital letters and
underlined: `I HAVE A TRAILER!''' the actress says, laughing. ``It
was so nice to have my own space, to have a VCR and a radio and my
own bathroom. I especially felt that way because I was going back
and forth between San Francisco and Fishers Island, off the coast
of Connecticut, where I was shooting `Seven and a Match,' which was
a low-budget, indie film where we were doubling up in dressing
rooms.''
 &HT;    Whit, Donahue's character in ``Seven and a Match,'' represents
another departure. She's a wunderkind at W, a top-drawer fashion
magazine for women.
 &HT;    ``Whit is short for Whitney, and she's a character removed from
me in so many ways,'' Donahue says happily. ``She's incredibly
stylish and witty and quick and sort of closed off. She's sexual,
but chilly at the same time.
 &HT;    ``The movie is basically an ensemble `dramedy,' as it were,
about friends from college,'' the actress says. ``They meet up a
few years after graduation, and try to find their place with each
other again.''
 &HT;    Donahue's current good fortune is a direct result of ``The Blair
Witch Project,'' which she ``never in a million years'' expected to
take off. She appreciates everything the film has done for her
career, but can't deny a lingering frustration at the fact that she
and her two co-stars received no share of the film's box-office
windfall.
 &HT;    ``It's never beneficial to look back,'' the actress says as the
conversation draws to a close. ``I think any financial issue that
has to do with `Blair Witch' is also something that, like
everything else, required adaptation and an understanding of the
business.
 &HT;    ``I obviously have a better understanding of the business now
than when I was just an eager little beaver,'' Donahue says.
``There are lessons to be learned from everything. And I learned a
lot of very valuable, important lessons _ artistically and
business-wise _ from being a part of `Blair Witch.'''

 KYLE MacLACHLAN: THE JOY OF `SEX AND THE CITY'  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Kyle MacLachlan with Kristin Davis in a
scene from ``Sex and the City.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It takes a tough guy to play a sexy hunk on HBO's ``Sex and the
City.''
 &HT;    The 41-year-old actor Kyle MacLachlan is spending every morning
lifting weights and running his buns off. He doesn't dare take even
a single day off, because he knows the stakes are high.
 &HT;    ``In a few days, I shoot my first love scene,'' MacLachlan says
by telephone from his New York apartment, still breathing hard from
an early-morning workout. ``I don't want there to be any love
handles or flab on my body.''
 &HT;    Image matters. Just ask Chris Noth, who plays Mr. Big, the
object of Sarah Jessica Parker's affections on the hit series.
 &HT;    ``My heart goes out to Kyle,'' Noth says. ``You truly do feel
like one of the girls before those love scenes. You look in the
mirror and think, `Gosh, my butt does look a little big.'''
 &HT;    MacLachlan admits to jitters as he approaches his ``Sex and the
City'' debut.
 &HT;    ``What if one of the women on the show says, `Kyle, did you have
to eat garlic for lunch?''' MacLachlan says. ``I can imagine doing
a bedroom scene on the show and Kristin Davis turning to me and
saying, `Um, buddy, have you ever heard of Altoid mints?'''
 &HT;    MacLachlan is the new guy in the big city this year, joining the
story of four single women living and loving in Manhattan. He plays
a surgeon who gets involved with the uptight, sexually naive art
dealer Charlotte, played by Davis.
 &HT;    ``We meet in a dramatic fashion on the street,'' MacLachlan
says, breaking a key ``Sex and the City'' rule: Don't talk about
upcoming plots. ``Her character almost gets hit by a cab, and I
come to her rescue.
 &HT;    ``It's a very Prince Charming moment,'' he says. ``In fact, the
rest of the girlfriends come in and immediately give me the
thumbs-up.''
 &HT;    But on this series, happiness in relationships is always
short-lived.
 &HT;    ``Just when everything seems perfect, they are going to throw in
some serious monkey wrenches,'' MacLachlan says. ``I can't tell you
what, because they write the scripts as we go. I am just told what
I need to know.''
 &HT;    You can count on seeing plenty of love scenes, however, which
doesn't faze the actor, who has appeared in such risque feature
films as ``Blue Velvet'' (1986) and ``Showgirls'' (1995).
 &HT;    ``You know, love scenes are weird to do, because you don't
really know the other person well,'' he says. ``It's actually so
difficult to act scenes of intimacy. It's almost like a one-night
stand, but filmed. You're just jumping into bed with a stranger.
 &HT;    ``The good thing is that people in this business are usually
pretty cool,'' he adds. ``Everyone is in the same boat. Everyone is
nervous.''
 &HT;    MacLachlan has been in that business for nearly two decades,
starring in films from ``Dune'' (1984) to ``One Night Stand''
(1997). He is best known, however, as FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper
in David Lynch's television series ``Twin Peaks'' (1990-1991),
which is now enjoying a successful second run on the Bravo and FX
cable networks.
 &HT;    To this day, MacLachlan gravitates to the weird and the
unpredictable. His most recent film was Mike Figgis' ``Time Code''
(2000), in an improvised role.
 &HT;    ``It was a whole different kind of challenge,'' the actor
recalls. ``I basically improvised for 90 minutes and he filmed it.
I really enjoyed the process.''
 &HT;    The just-wrapped ``Perfume,'' a movie set in the fashion world,
offered a similar challenge.
 &HT;    ``It was all improvisation again,'' MacLachlan says. ``I worked
with Paul Sorvino _ we're fashion designers. Jeff Goldblum is also
involved in our scenes. Basically, I did the movie as a favor. It's
four short stories blended into one tale. It was shot on a low
budget.''
 &HT;    Also shot on a shoestring budget is the new film ``Hamlet,'' an
updated version of the Shakespeare classic that's set in modern-day
New York. MacLachlan plays the evil Claudius, opposite Ethan Hawke
as Hamlet and Bill Murray as Polonius.
 &HT;    ``I was thrilled to get the role, because I had never done
`Hamlet,''' MacLachlan says. ``Initially I thought that someone
called me for the wrong role _ Claudius traditionally is played by
an older actor. But the idea this time was to make him younger and
more of a threat to the Ethan Hawke Hamlet character.''
 &HT;    MacLachlan plays Claudius as a young CEO who has Hamlet's mother
on his expensively suited arm.
 &HT;    ``He's very evil, but with this cool detachment,'' he says. ``My
Claudius also has this look in his eyes that screams he will stab
you in the back at a moment's notice. But he's more than just the
bad guy _ he's tormented about what he has done.
 &HT;    ``He isn't a man but an image,'' the actor adds, ``which leaves
him feeling completely empty. Even though he seems at ease, I saw
him as a man who is not secure in his skin when you peel the layers
away.''
 &HT;    A long career of steady work, if never A-list stardom, has left
MacLachlan financially secure enough to choose his projects as he
sees fit.
 &HT;    ``It's never been about money for me,'' he says, ``so I can
happily say that this one was pretty low. The entire movie cost
less than a million dollars. But I think it's just so creative.
 &HT;    ``We filmed in New York and took advantage of what the city has
to offer,'' the actor says. ``It was so rich and risky _ most of
the scenes you see of me walking outside in a crowd were the result
of running outside and catching the moment.''
 &HT;    MacLachlan grew up in Yakima, Wash., as the eldest of three
brothers. He found acting as a student at the University of
Washington in Seattle, then hit the pavement in both New York and
Los Angeles, where early rejection nearly made him quit the
business.
 &HT;    ``I remember being turned down for the Charlie Sheen role in
`Platoon' (1986), and it was quite devastating,'' MacLachlan says.
 &HT;    It was director David Lynch who finally gave him his ticket to
success, first casting him in ``Dune'' and following that with
``Blue Velvet,'' which made the actor a star.
 &HT;    It was also Lynch who made MacLachlan into an offbeat sex symbol
by casting him as Special Agent Cooper in ``Twin Peaks.''
 &HT;    ``All of a sudden, people began staring at me in the street with
this quizzical look on their faces,'' MacLachlan says. ``What's
great is that a whole new generation of people are now discovering
`Twin Peaks.' We did the series a little over 10 years ago, but it
seems to still intrigue people.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he denies persistent rumors of a new ``Twin Peaks''
movie.
 &HT;    ``From what I understand,'' he says, ``any thoughts of reviving
the project are impractical. There were so many people involved,
who own a portion of `Twin Peaks,' and to make them all agree on
something is impossible.
 &HT;    ``It's pretty much done forever.''
 &HT;    But the memories live on. Remember, Special Agent Cooper loved
``cherry pie and a damn fine cup of coffee.''
 &HT;    ``I'm still identified with that catch phrase,'' MacLachlan
says, laughing. ``It's funny, because when I go into a diner I
always get sent a complimentary piece of pie and a big cup of java.
 &HT;    ``I love the coffee _ but, to tell you the truth, I never liked
cherry pie!''

AFTER THE OSCARS, SAMANTHA MORTON RETURNS TO THE DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Samantha Morton with Billy Crudup in a
scene from ``Jesus' Son.'') 
 By SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    She may be British, but Samantha Morton didn't have any trouble
coming up with an American accent for Woody Allen's Jazz Age
comedy, ``Sweet and Lowdown'' (1999).
 &HT;    She didn't need one _ her character was mute. But her
performance was compelling enough to earn an Academy Award
nomination as Best Supporting Actress.
 &HT;    Now she needs that accent, however, for her latest role, as a
heroin addict in ``Jesus' Son,'' based on Denis Johnson's cult
collection of drug-culture short stories. The powerful, often
darkly comic drama is set in 1970s middle America, and Morton
admits to having fretted over how she'd sound in the role.
 &HT;    ``When I auditioned, I think my accent was terrible,'' Morton
says with a laugh, ``but I believed I could make it work. I went
through some intensive dialect training with the same voice coach
who worked with Kenneth Branagh on `Celebrity' (1998), but I
couldn't bring myself to try to sound American off the set.
 &HT;    ``I got into a taxi in New York and started speaking with my
Yank accent,'' she recalls, ``and I felt like a total fraud. I
realized I had to be hiding behind a character, and then I could go
to town with it.''
 &HT;    In ``Jesus' Son,'' Morton plays Michelle, a junkie drawn into a
self-destructive love affair with a wayward druggie (Billy Crudup).
There are several scenes in which her character mainlines heroin.
 &HT;    ``They hired an ex-drug addict to work with me,'' she says,
``but at the beginning I was the most pathetic drug user
imaginable. I would sit in my hotel room every night, practicing
with all the paraphernalia and hoping I wouldn't drop something.
When I got on the set, I just crossed my fingers and went for it.
 &HT;    ``When it came to simulating a heroin high, I didn't do much
research,'' she adds. ``Denis Johnson has the most amazing
descriptions of what it's like in his book. You read those and it
doesn't take much imagination to understand why Lou Reed, in his
song `Heroin,' has the lyric `I feel just like Jesus' son.'
 &HT;    ``That's what was in my mind when I was doing the drug scenes.''
 &HT;    The result is a wrenching portrait of the druggie subculture,
directed by New Zealander Alison Maclean _ best known for ``Crush''
(1993) _ with echoes of Gus Van Sant's ``Drugstore Cowboy'' (1989)
and ``My Own Private Idaho'' (1991).
 &HT;    ``Actually, I think it's more character-driven than either of
those films,'' Morton says. ``It may have some of the same
bleakness, but we certainly didn't have Gus on our minds when we
did `Jesus' Son.'''
 &HT;    Michelle's world is a couple of decades and a continent away
from Morton's own teen years in working-class England, but the
22-year-old actress says that nonetheless she identified with her
character.
 &HT;    ``It was the '70s and she was in the middle of nowhere,'' Morton
says. ``What sort of freedom do you have, and what kind of life do
you have to look forward to? It must have been incredibly
frustrating, and she was searching for something more. In that kind
of situation, drugs become a release.
 &HT;    ``But Michelle also sees the danger in it, and she finally makes
a clear decision to try to stop.
 &HT;    ``I think I was the only actress that auditioned who really
understood Michelle,'' she continues reflectively. ``I was the only
person who really knew her _ I can't tell you why.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes that happens to me,'' she says. ``I'm a girl, but
when I read `Catcher in the Rye' I totally understood Holden
Caulfield, and I could play him. Michelle was clear to me in the
same way.''
 &HT;    Though she has played her share of period roles _ most notably
in two television movies, in the title role of the BBC's ``Jane
Eyre'' (1997) and as Harriet Smith in ``Emma'' (1997) _ Morton has
done her best work in darker contemporary stories. She first caught
the public eye as a teen-age prostitute in the television
miniseries ``Band of Gold'' (1995), and made her American debut as
Iris, a girl who immerses herself in promiscuous sex as a defense
against loneliness and loss, in ``Under the Skin'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``I do seem more comfortable with tormented characters who go to
dark places,'' she says. ``I find it much harder to do happy
things. Maybe that's why people seem to remember the roles I've
played as women who weren't exactly ordinary _ but they're not me.
 &HT;    ``You can't put too much of your own life in a role or it
becomes therapy,'' she says. ``You'd be going crazy every time you
made a film. I leave those characters behind on the set. There's no
point in acting all the time _ I love my job, but I have to be
careful that I don't take it home. You could drive your family and
friends mad.''
 &HT;    Offscreen, in fact, Morton is in particularly good spirits
lately. She recently had a baby daughter _ the father is British
actor Charles Creed-Miles _ and seems delighted by motherhood.
 &HT;    ``It's wonderful to think of yourself as just a mother,'' she
says. ``I quite like it.
 &HT;    ``Actually, I've already felt that being a mom might influence
my choice of roles,'' she adds. ``I got a script the other day that
was pure trash, and I thought of my daughter when I turned it down.
Obviously, I want her to be proud of me, to look at my work when
she grows up and know I did it for the right reasons.
 &HT;    ``I dread the thought of playing another character like Iris or
Michelle,'' she admits. ``It's so daunting. I don't know whether
I'm ready for it again, at least not yet.''
 &HT;    Morton reports that, so far, her Oscar nod hasn't led to
anything approaching Hollywood stardom.
 &HT;    ``But I'm not driven by that,'' she adds. ``I'd rather be known
for my roles than what I wore to a premiere. I'd hate to be
remembered for the dress I had on. Right now, I can get on a bus
and come home from town without even being recognized _ I would
never like to have that taken from me.''
 &HT;    Her lifestyle isn't very compatible with the Hollywood party
circuit, anyway.
 &HT;    ``I like going walking,'' she says. ``I like the sunshine, which
we haven't had much of in Britain lately. I have a lovely garden,
and I like to sit and listen to the breeze play my wind chimes.
 &HT;    ``I just like the peaceful life.''
 &HT;    All in all, she concludes, she's happy with her career as it is.
 &HT;    ``I was watching the telly tonight,'' she recalls, ``and `Scent
of a Woman' (1992) was on. There was a scene where Philip Seymour
Hoffman is waddling along behind Chris O'Donnell _ he was just one
more actor in that film. Isn't that strange? Now he's a huge star,
and people revel in his work.
 &HT;    ``I've been a bit like that,'' Morton says. ``I've been sort of
staggering along, and things have worked out great for me. I think
if you set out to be a big star, you can really mess up your head.
 &HT;    ``I just think you should live life fully and don't regret
anything,'' she concludes. ``Just keep moving forward. I think you
get what you're meant to have in life. I always knew I'd get what
was meant for me.''

OLD TIRE FACTORY STOKES A NEW ENGINE IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YAROSLAVL, Russia _ This could be what hell looks like.
</P>
<P>
   Gaunt, sweating men heft massive metal and rubber objects onto
huge metal hooks, while others struggle with steaming, hissing
machines in 120-degree heat. The roar of machinery drowns out all
other noise; the infernal green steam blots out all sight.
</P>
<P>
   These are the first impressions created by a visit to the old
production line at the Yaroslavl Tire Factory, where they still
make tires the way they did when the place was built in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   But first impressions in Russia are often misleading. This is
not hell. Nor is it another example of Russia's descent into
post-Soviet industrial blight.
</P>
<P>
   If the long lines of job-seekers that form outside Yaroslavl
Tire are any indication, this is one of the most desirable
workplaces in this city of 600,000 on the Volga River, 120 miles
northeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavl Tire, which employs 8,000 workers, is also a prime
example of how Russia's crumbling, old smokestack industries,
neglected under years of socialist stagnation and post-Soviet
blight, could be on the verge of revival.
</P>
<P>
   A chat with the company's youthful general director, Nikolai
Tonkov, provides an intriguing look at the mixture that makes for
success in Russia's still-developing market economy. Agile
management, new ideas, and good timing are no doubt important. But
it helps quite a bit to have the financial backing of one of
Russia's oligarchic superconglomerates, in Yaroslavl Tire's case
the natural gas monopoly Gazprom. And the support of political
heavyweights is absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a good relationship with the authorities, you can
work,'' said Tonkov, who enjoys close ties with Yaroslavl's
Governor Anatoly Lisitsyn, and who served as a representative in
Yaroslavl for the recent election campaign of President Vladimir V.
Putin. ``I'll always try to be with the party that runs the
country. I'll never be in the opposition, because I realize that is
useless in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonkov, 33, received a reporter in Yaroslavl Tire's tastefully
remodeled front offices, which provide a first impression more in
line with the company's recent successes.
</P>
<P>
   A former tire salesman who had expanded his retail network to
100 stores across Russia before taking the top job at Yaroslavl
Tire two years ago, Tonkov has doubled company sales to $12 million
to $14 million per month. Workers, who used to receive their pay
several months late, and in tires that they had to resell, now get
paid on time and in cash. In a country where many companies have
been threatened with layoffs, Tonkov is expanding his operation.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tonkov's leadership, Yaroslavl Tire has changed its
mentality from a Soviet-style behemoth that mass-produced huge
amounts of unwanted tires to a smart player that is aiming for
Russia's growing market of motorists driving imported cars and
trucks. Gradually, the factory has begun replacing the 1930s-era
technology with new, automated machinery that pumps out the
steel-belted radials consumers want with a fraction of the labor
needed to produce the older lines.
</P>
<P>
   This leap into modernity has brought new challenges. Convincing
workers to embrace the new technology has not been easy. Stanislav
Pismarev, during a tour of the old production line, the roof of
which is still scarred by Nazi bombs from World War II, said
workers prefer the more familiar 1932 line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to teach people new skills,'' Tonkov said. ``The old
habits die hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge has been financing new equipment. No Russian
factory produces the latest machinery, so the company had to look
for expensive alternatives abroad. To afford them in an economic
environment where there is little interest in long-term investment,
Yaroslavl Tire had to tighten spending and cut corners on the heavy
tax burden placed on Russian enterprises, which Tonkov said totals
87 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This is one area where the relationship with Lisitsyn, the
governor, comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to help with taxes,'' Lisitsyn said in an interview. He
said large employers like Yaroslavl Tire do not pay rent for their
premises. Lisitsyn caused a small uproar recently when he reduced
local taxes for manufacturers, then made up for the money by
introducing a trade tax paid by consumers. This is technically
illegal _ governors do not have the right in Russia to introduce
taxes _ but Lisitsyn defends his moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still forming the market in Russia, and we have to
protect our own producers,'' he said. ``Some day there will be
equal rules for everyone and governors here will have a reduced
role, like governors in the United States, but for now Russia has
89 regions with 89 different economies . . . we have to lobby the
interests of our manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisitsyn's lobbying has brought Yaroslavl Tire and another
rubber-products factory Tonkov recently acquired purchase orders
from government agencies for such equipment as tents for refugees,
medical supplies, and components for naval and military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Russian governors like Lisitsyn will be able to retain
such powers is one of the questions raised by Putin's recent
attempts to tighten federal control over the regions.
</P>
<P>
   The political pact with Lisitsyn also came in handy last year,
when Yaroslavl Tire was up for sale. Tonkov was able to fend off
buyers who were hostile to the idea of him staying on as general
director, and with the governor acting as an intermediary, was able
to come to an agreement with Siburo, the Gazprom subsidiary that
eventually bought the factory.
</P>
<P>
   Close relationships between businessmen and politicians are
nothing new in Russia. But generally these ties have been exploited
in ways that benefit individual bureaucrats and factory managers,
not the public. A group of directors earned personal fortunes by
privatizing factories at ridiculously low prices, often through the
banks run by politically connected insiders. Then the best assets
were gradually siphoned away to offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Tonkov says he tries to explain to American businessmen _ and
potential investors _ that ``in Russia, there is not only
corruption, but also the development of competitive business.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task, and Tonkov knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows that there are directors who can't earn profits
by manufacturing, so instead they incur millions of dollars of
losses while making a fortune in bribes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dishonesty at the workplace had a trickle-down effect in Soviet
factories that has been hard to overcome. One of Tonkov's reforms
was to hire a 700-member security detail for the industrial complex
to help crack down on rampant theft that had been crippling the
factory. (``We catch all the thieves,'' Tonkov said.)
</P>
<P>
   Tonkov is not hoping to make Yaroslavl Tire the next Michelin
anytime soon. A more realistic target is Matador, a Slovak tire
manufacturer that has made inroads in European markets after
overcoming decades of industrial stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   Even that seemed an ambitious goal two years ago, when Tonkov
was invited by Yaroslavl Tire's owners to take on the job of
commercial director, with the understanding that he would
eventually take over as general director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that the whole place was a mess,'' he said. ``They were
making one size of tire, no one bought them, no one knew how to buy
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonkov replaced the old management with people from his tire
sales company, VVSh, and began restructuring Yaroslavl Tire.
</P>
<P>
   He was inadvertently helped by the August 1998 crash of the
Russian currency, the ruble, which actually helped Yaroslavl Tire
by temporarily making imports far too expensive for Russians to
buy. Tonkov's response included using a new, patriotic-sounding
slogan, ``Russian Tires for Russian Roads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Russian economy is stuck in the 1970s,'' he said.
``I hope the president looks at the successful companies, the ones
that have changed, and says, that's the way we should do it.''

 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before June 19. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Who could have predicted the just-completed television season?
 &HT;    If you'd told any television critic last summer that the year's
biggest hit would be a prime-time game show _ hosted by the
unctuous Regis Philbin, no less _ they'd have laughed in your face.
 &HT;    And things were just as strange further down the ratings ladder.
Here's a look back at some of the highlights and lowlights. 
 -0- 
 THE GOOD  
 &HT;    + ``The West Wing.''
 &HT;    NBC's weekly Oval Office drama is perhaps the best-written
ensemble drama ever to have graced network television, courtesy of
creators Aaron Sorkin and John Wells.
 &HT;    Of course, it helped tremendously to have an A-list cast, headed
by Martin Sheen as the definitive television president and backed
by the likes of Rob Lowe, John Spencer and Alison Janney.
 &HT;    It's rare that a television show measures up to its prelaunch
hype, but ``The West Wing'' was even better than we expected.
 &HT;    + ``Popular.''
 &HT;    After an inauspicious beginning as yet another zits-'n'-cliques
teen drama, WB's ``Popular'' somehow morphed into the quirkiest,
best-written teen show on television.
 &HT;    Delta Burke as multibillionaire mom Cherry Cherry, a slew of
wacky guest stars from 1980s television and consistently knowing
scripts ensure that adult viewers are more than entertained.
 &HT;    ``After School Specials'' were never this cool. Or this crazed.
 &HT;    + ``Futurama.''
 &HT;    With ``The Simpsons'' stuck in a creative rut _ how many times
can we see Homer fail while the more interesting Springfield
secondary characters cry out for story lines? _ viewers are finding
solace in Fox's ``Futurama.''
 &HT;    Like ``The Simpsons,'' ``Futurama'' was immediately subversive
in its cast: The star of the series, Frye (voice of Billy Fox), is
a certified slacker whose best pal is Bender, a drunken,
malfunctioning robot. Big points for originality.
 &HT;    + ``Sex and the City.''
 &HT;    The second season of HBO's ``Sex and the City'' actually
improved on the first, as it matured into a well-rounded ensemble
dramedy, with the relationships between the girls and their men
providing some substance for the weekly sexfest.
 &HT;    Carrie's torturous relationship with Mr. Big and Miranda's
touching affair with the sweet-but-unsuitable Steve tugged at
heartstrings, even while our funnybones were being lasciviously
stroked.
 &HT;    + ``Malcolm in the Middle.''
 &HT;    A family sitcom about an average family without a last name _
just two oddball parents and four misbehaving sons.
 &HT;    It doesn't sound like much on paper, but on screen Fox's
``Malcolm in the Middle'' blossomed into an affectionately wry and
genuinely hilarious sitcom, winning huge ratings along the way.
 &HT;    Creator Linwood Boomer's nostalgia for his own early life shines
through in the show's trademark mix of delirious desperation and
the joys of a sweetly dysfunctional home.
 &HT;    + David Letterman's bypass.
 &HT;    Who'd have thought that a health scare could turn a crotchety
old talk-show host, one whom many thought had had his day, into a
national darling?
 &HT;    Indeed, that Letterman even had a heart was startling to some.
 &HT;    His return to his CBS desk after five weeks away broke ratings
records for ``The Late Show,'' and permitted him to beat Jay Leno's
``Tonight Show'' for the first time in years.
 &HT;    + ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.''
 &HT;    What's wrong with this picture: A slow-paced game show, hosted
by Kathie Lee's smarmy sidekick, beating ``ER'' in the ratings?
 &HT;    It's a mystery. Yet ABC's ``Millionaire'' has turned into a
ratings juggernaut that leaves all other programs foundering in its
wake.
 &HT;    The celebrity series was an improvement on the show's usually
glacial pace _ especially Tea Leoni's answer to husband David
Duchovny's phone-a-friend question. When the question stumped her,
she told him, ``Oh, honey, you're so screwed!''
 &HT;    + ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks.''
 &HT;    NBC's ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' is proof that being both a critics'
darling and a grassroots cult hit can't save a well-written show
from an early death.
 &HT;    So, like ``My So-Called Life'' before it, ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks''
bloomed only for a single season, and will live most fondly in the
memories of those who loved it.
 &HT;    Also like ``My So-Called Life,'' look for ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' to
be the springboard for some major talent, most notably Linda
Cardellini.
 &HT;    + Nurse Hathaway's departure on ``ER.''
 &HT;    When George Clooney turned up on ``ER'' to settle Carol
Hathaway's doubting heart, it took many fans by surprise. Where was
the big network ballyhoo over Clooney's return?
 &HT;    Clooney did the role for $596 _ as well as for the fans and for
the legacy of his character. The beautiful, sweet cameo tied up a
favorite story line perfectly, without any unnecessary hype.
 &HT;    The fact that Julianna Margulies, who played Nurse Hathaway,
turned down an astounding $27 million offer from NBC to stick with
the show somehow made the farewell even fonder. 
 -0- 
 THE BAD  
 &HT;    + ``God, The Devil &AMP; Bob.''
 &HT;    The animated ``God, The Devil &AMP; Bob'' never even sounded like a
good idea.
 &HT;    The protests from conservative religious groups were also
predictable, but for once the controversy failed to translate into
high ratings.
 &HT;    Then came the lawsuit from Jerry Garcia's estate, alleging that
the God character resembled the dead Head Deadhead, and NBC finally
banished the show to the television afterworld.
 &HT;    + ``The Tenth Kingdom.''
 &HT;    Besides being a waste of videotape and viewers' time, ``The
Tenth Kingdom'' was an interminable, bad-effects-strewn fairy tale.
 &HT;    Offbeat casting _ Camryn Mannheim as Snow White? _ and a
promising premise were not enough to turn NBC's poisoned apple into
a glass slipper.
 &HT;    + Post-haircut ``Felicity.''
 &HT;    Never before have the creators and producers of a show dared to
blame a ratings slide on their star's haircut. But when
``Felicity'' star Keri Russell's long, curly locks fell to the
floor, the WB show's ratings followed suit.
 &HT;    Rather than a season of continuous ``Ben or Noel?'' dilemmas and
uninspired writing, Felicity's follicular folly was named as the
culprit.
 &HT;    Guys, if that's the case, may we suggest a wig?
 &HT;    + ``Dawson's Creek,'' post-Kevin Williamson.
 &HT;    After a whip-smart two seasons under the watchful eye of
pop-culture auteur Kevin ``Scream'' Williamson, WB's ``Dawson's
Creek'' fell victim to Williamson's expanding empire when he left
to work on the mercifully brief run of ``Wasteland.''
 &HT;    Without Williamson, our favorite tortured-teen foursome found
themselves up the ``Creek'' without a paddle, as story lines veered
from dull to flat-out stupid.
 &HT;    A late-season reinvigoration suggests that the ``Creek'' may not
yet have run dry. 
 -0- 
 THE UGLY  
 &HT;    + ``Who Wants to Marry A Multimillionaire.''
 &HT;    When Fox was denied permission to stage a disaster special _
they wanted to crash an empty passenger plane into the desert _
they retaliated by staging a disaster of another kind: ``Who Wants
To Marry A Multimillionaire.''
 &HT;    In it, an allegedly wealthy bachelor (Rick Rockwell) was
actually wed to a nurse, Darva Conger, on live television _ a
concept that somehow managed simultaneously to degrade the
contestants, the audience and the institution of marriage.
 &HT;    Note to the newlyweds: After an annulment, you're supposed to
disappear. Instead Rockwell is trying to use the hype to revive his
standup-comedy career, while Conger is appearing nude in Playboy.
 &HT;    + JonBenet Ramsey TV movies.
 &HT;    As if it weren't horrible enough to live through the media
circus surrounding the grisly murder of JonBenet Ramsey, both Fox
and CBS felt that it was necessary to bring the still-unsolved
murder to the screen.
 &HT;    Neither adaptation offered any enlightenment, since the truth is
not yet known, and neither showed a shred of respect for the little
girl whose life and murder they sensationalized.

IN THE WAKE OF THE BLAIR WITCH, HEATHER DONAHUE GOES FOR LAUGHS

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Heather Donahue in a scene from ``Boys

 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``The Blair Witch Project'' scared audiences silly last summer,
but the hit horror film's success proved even more terrifying for
Heather Donahue.
 &HT;    Donahue starred as Heather, one of three documentarians stalked
by strange forces in the eerie Maryland woods. The unheralded film
took off, and the actress was catapulted from unknown to overnight
sensation.
 &HT;    ``It sort of opened my eyes and made me reconsider what I really
wanted,'' Donahue says. ``All of a sudden I was in the public eye,
and that was frightening to me.
 &HT;    ``It didn't have anything to do with the work aspect of what I
do, which is what I love,'' she hastens to add. ``I was dealing
with this whole other full-time job that was just not what I had in
mind.''
 &HT;    After the fact, and in the midst of the ``Blair Witch'' hoopla,
Donahue looked hard in the mirror, picked the brains of family and
friends, and conferred with her agents. After having spent her
career perfectly happy performing in regional stage productions and
independent features, she wanted to take control of her suddenly
blossoming options.
 &HT;    ``I want to work on stuff I like,'' the refreshingly
straightforward actress says by telephone from the Los Angeles home
she shares with her longtime boyfriend, writer/photographer Gregor
Hrynisdak. ``I don't want to limit myself because something's not a
big-budget production, and I don't want to do something crappy
because it will make a lot of money. I don't want that to become my
criteria for choosing a project.
 &HT;    ``It's all very complicated,'' Donahue says. ``It was good for
me to remember what my values were and what my goals were, and then
to see how they could fit into the bigger picture that my agents
helped me to see.
 &HT;    ``I'm still figuring it out,'' she admits. ``Everybody has his
or her own path, and sometimes that's not always immediately clear.
I think if you stay true to yourself you have a better chance of
staying on the correct path that will be satisfying to you in the
long run.''
 &HT;    Donahue's post-``Blair Witch'' path is a perfect example of her
attempt to hang onto her past while looking to her future. Making
two films simultaneously, she accepted a supporting role in the
high-profile feature ``Boys and Girls,'' which will open nationwide
on June 16, while co-starring in the indie feature ``Seven and a
Match,'' which is currently seeking a distributor.
 &HT;    ``My character in `Boys and Girls' is a slightly off-kilter
woman who's a combination of Betty Crocker and an electrical
engineer,'' Donahue says. ``She's completely obsessed with Ryan,
who is Freddie Prinze Jr.'s character.
 &HT;    ``She's quite awkward, but very confident in her awkwardness,''
Donahue adds. ``Megan ultimately snags Ryan when his friend
Jennifer, Claire Forlani's character, puts him up to it. And our
relationship continues until the big surprise.''
 &HT;    ``Boys and Girls'' is only one of several recent hormone-driven,
high-school- or college-based romantic comedies, however, and
Donahue is hard-pressed to say what will distinguish it from
``She's All That'' (1999), ``Down to You'' (2000) and ``Road Trip''
(2000). Asked to do so, the actress turns silent, then dissolves
into laughter, and finally stammers.
 &HT;    ``What will set it apart?'' she asks. ``OK, hang on. Give me a
second. Aaaaah. Hmmm. Well. It's got a great supporting cast. It's
a lot of fun. It's about how you can't hide from your own fate, as
much as you try.
 &HT;    ``How's that? Not bad under pressure.''
 &HT;    Donahue's role in the film may be a glorified cameo, but she
relished the experience, both for the chance to play a lighter role
and for the perks that come with big-budget filmmaking.
 &HT;    ``It was such a great opportunity to do something that had
nothing in common with `The Blair Witch Project' or my `Blair
Witch' character,'' she says. ``It was cute and light and fun, and
we shot it in San Francisco. And there's nothing like San Francisco
with a per-diem.
 &HT;    ``For everybody else on the set it was sort of a low-budget
studio movie,'' she adds, ``but for me it was big-time. At lunch
there were four different salads to choose from on the
craft-service table. I was like, `All right. This I can do.'
 &HT;    ``In my journal it is actually written in capital letters and
underlined: `I HAVE A TRAILER!''' the actress says, laughing. ``It
was so nice to have my own space, to have a VCR and a radio and my
own bathroom. I especially felt that way because I was going back
and forth between San Francisco and Fishers Island, off the coast
of Connecticut, where I was shooting `Seven and a Match,' which was
a low-budget, indie film where we were doubling up in dressing
rooms.''
 &HT;    Whit, Donahue's character in ``Seven and a Match,'' represents
another departure. She's a wunderkind at W, a top-drawer fashion
magazine for women.
 &HT;    ``Whit is short for Whitney, and she's a character removed from
me in so many ways,'' Donahue says happily. ``She's incredibly
stylish and witty and quick and sort of closed off. She's sexual,
but chilly at the same time.
 &HT;    ``The movie is basically an ensemble `dramedy,' as it were,
about friends from college,'' the actress says. ``They meet up a
few years after graduation, and try to find their place with each
other again.''
 &HT;    Donahue's current good fortune is a direct result of ``The Blair
Witch Project,'' which she ``never in a million years'' expected to
take off. She appreciates everything the film has done for her
career, but can't deny a lingering frustration at the fact that she
and her two co-stars received no share of the film's box-office
windfall.
 &HT;    ``It's never beneficial to look back,'' the actress says as the
conversation draws to a close. ``I think any financial issue that
has to do with `Blair Witch' is also something that, like
everything else, required adaptation and an understanding of the
business.
 &HT;    ``I obviously have a better understanding of the business now
than when I was just an eager little beaver,'' Donahue says.
``There are lessons to be learned from everything. And I learned a
lot of very valuable, important lessons _ artistically and
business-wise _ from being a part of `Blair Witch.'''

 KYLE MacLACHLAN: THE JOY OF `SEX AND THE CITY'  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Kyle MacLachlan with Kristin Davis in a
scene from ``Sex and the City.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It takes a tough guy to play a sexy hunk on HBO's ``Sex and the
City.''
 &HT;    The 41-year-old actor Kyle MacLachlan is spending every morning
lifting weights and running his buns off. He doesn't dare take even
a single day off, because he knows the stakes are high.
 &HT;    ``In a few days, I shoot my first love scene,'' MacLachlan says
by telephone from his New York apartment, still breathing hard from
an early-morning workout. ``I don't want there to be any love
handles or flab on my body.''
 &HT;    Image matters. Just ask Chris Noth, who plays Mr. Big, the
object of Sarah Jessica Parker's affections on the hit series.
 &HT;    ``My heart goes out to Kyle,'' Noth says. ``You truly do feel
like one of the girls before those love scenes. You look in the
mirror and think, `Gosh, my butt does look a little big.'''
 &HT;    MacLachlan admits to jitters as he approaches his ``Sex and the
City'' debut.
 &HT;    ``What if one of the women on the show says, `Kyle, did you have
to eat garlic for lunch?''' MacLachlan says. ``I can imagine doing
a bedroom scene on the show and Kristin Davis turning to me and
saying, `Um, buddy, have you ever heard of Altoid mints?'''
 &HT;    MacLachlan is the new guy in the big city this year, joining the
story of four single women living and loving in Manhattan. He plays
a surgeon who gets involved with the uptight, sexually naive art
dealer Charlotte, played by Davis.
 &HT;    ``We meet in a dramatic fashion on the street,'' MacLachlan
says, breaking a key ``Sex and the City'' rule: Don't talk about
upcoming plots. ``Her character almost gets hit by a cab, and I
come to her rescue.
 &HT;    ``It's a very Prince Charming moment,'' he says. ``In fact, the
rest of the girlfriends come in and immediately give me the
thumbs-up.''
 &HT;    But on this series, happiness in relationships is always
short-lived.
 &HT;    ``Just when everything seems perfect, they are going to throw in
some serious monkey wrenches,'' MacLachlan says. ``I can't tell you
what, because they write the scripts as we go. I am just told what
I need to know.''
 &HT;    You can count on seeing plenty of love scenes, however, which
doesn't faze the actor, who has appeared in such risque feature
films as ``Blue Velvet'' (1986) and ``Showgirls'' (1995).
 &HT;    ``You know, love scenes are weird to do, because you don't
really know the other person well,'' he says. ``It's actually so
difficult to act scenes of intimacy. It's almost like a one-night
stand, but filmed. You're just jumping into bed with a stranger.
 &HT;    ``The good thing is that people in this business are usually
pretty cool,'' he adds. ``Everyone is in the same boat. Everyone is
nervous.''
 &HT;    MacLachlan has been in that business for nearly two decades,
starring in films from ``Dune'' (1984) to ``One Night Stand''
(1997). He is best known, however, as FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper
in David Lynch's television series ``Twin Peaks'' (1990-1991),
which is now enjoying a successful second run on the Bravo and FX
cable networks.
 &HT;    To this day, MacLachlan gravitates to the weird and the
unpredictable. His most recent film was Mike Figgis' ``Time Code''
(2000), in an improvised role.
 &HT;    ``It was a whole different kind of challenge,'' the actor
recalls. ``I basically improvised for 90 minutes and he filmed it.
I really enjoyed the process.''
 &HT;    The just-wrapped ``Perfume,'' a movie set in the fashion world,
offered a similar challenge.
 &HT;    ``It was all improvisation again,'' MacLachlan says. ``I worked
with Paul Sorvino _ we're fashion designers. Jeff Goldblum is also
involved in our scenes. Basically, I did the movie as a favor. It's
four short stories blended into one tale. It was shot on a low
budget.''
 &HT;    Also shot on a shoestring budget is the new film ``Hamlet,'' an
updated version of the Shakespeare classic that's set in modern-day
New York. MacLachlan plays the evil Claudius, opposite Ethan Hawke
as Hamlet and Bill Murray as Polonius.
 &HT;    ``I was thrilled to get the role, because I had never done
`Hamlet,''' MacLachlan says. ``Initially I thought that someone
called me for the wrong role _ Claudius traditionally is played by
an older actor. But the idea this time was to make him younger and
more of a threat to the Ethan Hawke Hamlet character.''
 &HT;    MacLachlan plays Claudius as a young CEO who has Hamlet's mother
on his expensively suited arm.
 &HT;    ``He's very evil, but with this cool detachment,'' he says. ``My
Claudius also has this look in his eyes that screams he will stab
you in the back at a moment's notice. But he's more than just the
bad guy _ he's tormented about what he has done.
 &HT;    ``He isn't a man but an image,'' the actor adds, ``which leaves
him feeling completely empty. Even though he seems at ease, I saw
him as a man who is not secure in his skin when you peel the layers
away.''
 &HT;    A long career of steady work, if never A-list stardom, has left
MacLachlan financially secure enough to choose his projects as he
sees fit.
 &HT;    ``It's never been about money for me,'' he says, ``so I can
happily say that this one was pretty low. The entire movie cost
less than a million dollars. But I think it's just so creative.
 &HT;    ``We filmed in New York and took advantage of what the city has
to offer,'' the actor says. ``It was so rich and risky _ most of
the scenes you see of me walking outside in a crowd were the result
of running outside and catching the moment.''
 &HT;    MacLachlan grew up in Yakima, Wash., as the eldest of three
brothers. He found acting as a student at the University of
Washington in Seattle, then hit the pavement in both New York and
Los Angeles, where early rejection nearly made him quit the
business.
 &HT;    ``I remember being turned down for the Charlie Sheen role in
`Platoon' (1986), and it was quite devastating,'' MacLachlan says.
 &HT;    It was director David Lynch who finally gave him his ticket to
success, first casting him in ``Dune'' and following that with
``Blue Velvet,'' which made the actor a star.
 &HT;    It was also Lynch who made MacLachlan into an offbeat sex symbol
by casting him as Special Agent Cooper in ``Twin Peaks.''
 &HT;    ``All of a sudden, people began staring at me in the street with
this quizzical look on their faces,'' MacLachlan says. ``What's
great is that a whole new generation of people are now discovering
`Twin Peaks.' We did the series a little over 10 years ago, but it
seems to still intrigue people.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he denies persistent rumors of a new ``Twin Peaks''
movie.
 &HT;    ``From what I understand,'' he says, ``any thoughts of reviving
the project are impractical. There were so many people involved,
who own a portion of `Twin Peaks,' and to make them all agree on
something is impossible.
 &HT;    ``It's pretty much done forever.''
 &HT;    But the memories live on. Remember, Special Agent Cooper loved
``cherry pie and a damn fine cup of coffee.''
 &HT;    ``I'm still identified with that catch phrase,'' MacLachlan
says, laughing. ``It's funny, because when I go into a diner I
always get sent a complimentary piece of pie and a big cup of java.
 &HT;    ``I love the coffee _ but, to tell you the truth, I never liked
cherry pie!''

AFTER THE OSCARS, SAMANTHA MORTON RETURNS TO THE DARK SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Samantha Morton with Billy Crudup in a
scene from ``Jesus' Son.'') 
 By SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    She may be British, but Samantha Morton didn't have any trouble
coming up with an American accent for Woody Allen's Jazz Age
comedy, ``Sweet and Lowdown'' (1999).
 &HT;    She didn't need one _ her character was mute. But her
performance was compelling enough to earn an Academy Award
nomination as Best Supporting Actress.
 &HT;    Now she needs that accent, however, for her latest role, as a
heroin addict in ``Jesus' Son,'' based on Denis Johnson's cult
collection of drug-culture short stories. The powerful, often
darkly comic drama is set in 1970s middle America, and Morton
admits to having fretted over how she'd sound in the role.
 &HT;    ``When I auditioned, I think my accent was terrible,'' Morton
says with a laugh, ``but I believed I could make it work. I went
through some intensive dialect training with the same voice coach
who worked with Kenneth Branagh on `Celebrity' (1998), but I
couldn't bring myself to try to sound American off the set.
 &HT;    ``I got into a taxi in New York and started speaking with my
Yank accent,'' she recalls, ``and I felt like a total fraud. I
realized I had to be hiding behind a character, and then I could go
to town with it.''
 &HT;    In ``Jesus' Son,'' Morton plays Michelle, a junkie drawn into a
self-destructive love affair with a wayward druggie (Billy Crudup).
There are several scenes in which her character mainlines heroin.
 &HT;    ``They hired an ex-drug addict to work with me,'' she says,
``but at the beginning I was the most pathetic drug user
imaginable. I would sit in my hotel room every night, practicing
with all the paraphernalia and hoping I wouldn't drop something.
When I got on the set, I just crossed my fingers and went for it.
 &HT;    ``When it came to simulating a heroin high, I didn't do much
research,'' she adds. ``Denis Johnson has the most amazing
descriptions of what it's like in his book. You read those and it
doesn't take much imagination to understand why Lou Reed, in his
song `Heroin,' has the lyric `I feel just like Jesus' son.'
 &HT;    ``That's what was in my mind when I was doing the drug scenes.''
 &HT;    The result is a wrenching portrait of the druggie subculture,
directed by New Zealander Alison Maclean _ best known for ``Crush''
(1993) _ with echoes of Gus Van Sant's ``Drugstore Cowboy'' (1989)
and ``My Own Private Idaho'' (1991).
 &HT;    ``Actually, I think it's more character-driven than either of
those films,'' Morton says. ``It may have some of the same
bleakness, but we certainly didn't have Gus on our minds when we
did `Jesus' Son.'''
 &HT;    Michelle's world is a couple of decades and a continent away
from Morton's own teen years in working-class England, but the
22-year-old actress says that nonetheless she identified with her
character.
 &HT;    ``It was the '70s and she was in the middle of nowhere,'' Morton
says. ``What sort of freedom do you have, and what kind of life do
you have to look forward to? It must have been incredibly
frustrating, and she was searching for something more. In that kind
of situation, drugs become a release.
 &HT;    ``But Michelle also sees the danger in it, and she finally makes
a clear decision to try to stop.
 &HT;    ``I think I was the only actress that auditioned who really
understood Michelle,'' she continues reflectively. ``I was the only
person who really knew her _ I can't tell you why.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes that happens to me,'' she says. ``I'm a girl, but
when I read `Catcher in the Rye' I totally understood Holden
Caulfield, and I could play him. Michelle was clear to me in the
same way.''
 &HT;    Though she has played her share of period roles _ most notably
in two television movies, in the title role of the BBC's ``Jane
Eyre'' (1997) and as Harriet Smith in ``Emma'' (1997) _ Morton has
done her best work in darker contemporary stories. She first caught
the public eye as a teen-age prostitute in the television
miniseries ``Band of Gold'' (1995), and made her American debut as
Iris, a girl who immerses herself in promiscuous sex as a defense
against loneliness and loss, in ``Under the Skin'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``I do seem more comfortable with tormented characters who go to
dark places,'' she says. ``I find it much harder to do happy
things. Maybe that's why people seem to remember the roles I've
played as women who weren't exactly ordinary _ but they're not me.
 &HT;    ``You can't put too much of your own life in a role or it
becomes therapy,'' she says. ``You'd be going crazy every time you
made a film. I leave those characters behind on the set. There's no
point in acting all the time _ I love my job, but I have to be
careful that I don't take it home. You could drive your family and
friends mad.''
 &HT;    Offscreen, in fact, Morton is in particularly good spirits
lately. She recently had a baby daughter _ the father is British
actor Charles Creed-Miles _ and seems delighted by motherhood.
 &HT;    ``It's wonderful to think of yourself as just a mother,'' she
says. ``I quite like it.
 &HT;    ``Actually, I've already felt that being a mom might influence
my choice of roles,'' she adds. ``I got a script the other day that
was pure trash, and I thought of my daughter when I turned it down.
Obviously, I want her to be proud of me, to look at my work when
she grows up and know I did it for the right reasons.
 &HT;    ``I dread the thought of playing another character like Iris or
Michelle,'' she admits. ``It's so daunting. I don't know whether
I'm ready for it again, at least not yet.''
 &HT;    Morton reports that, so far, her Oscar nod hasn't led to
anything approaching Hollywood stardom.
 &HT;    ``But I'm not driven by that,'' she adds. ``I'd rather be known
for my roles than what I wore to a premiere. I'd hate to be
remembered for the dress I had on. Right now, I can get on a bus
and come home from town without even being recognized _ I would
never like to have that taken from me.''
 &HT;    Her lifestyle isn't very compatible with the Hollywood party
circuit, anyway.
 &HT;    ``I like going walking,'' she says. ``I like the sunshine, which
we haven't had much of in Britain lately. I have a lovely garden,
and I like to sit and listen to the breeze play my wind chimes.
 &HT;    ``I just like the peaceful life.''
 &HT;    All in all, she concludes, she's happy with her career as it is.
 &HT;    ``I was watching the telly tonight,'' she recalls, ``and `Scent
of a Woman' (1992) was on. There was a scene where Philip Seymour
Hoffman is waddling along behind Chris O'Donnell _ he was just one
more actor in that film. Isn't that strange? Now he's a huge star,
and people revel in his work.
 &HT;    ``I've been a bit like that,'' Morton says. ``I've been sort of
staggering along, and things have worked out great for me. I think
if you set out to be a big star, you can really mess up your head.
 &HT;    ``I just think you should live life fully and don't regret
anything,'' she concludes. ``Just keep moving forward. I think you
get what you're meant to have in life. I always knew I'd get what
was meant for me.''

 By the staff of TV GUIDE CANADA  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before June 19. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Who could have predicted the just-completed television season?
 &HT;    If you'd told any television critic last summer that the year's
biggest hit would be a prime-time game show _ hosted by the
unctuous Regis Philbin, no less _ they'd have laughed in your face.
 &HT;    And things were just as strange further down the ratings ladder.
Here's a look back at some of the highlights and lowlights. 
 -0- 
 THE GOOD  
 &HT;    + ``The West Wing.''
 &HT;    NBC's weekly Oval Office drama is perhaps the best-written
ensemble drama ever to have graced network television, courtesy of
creators Aaron Sorkin and John Wells.
 &HT;    Of course, it helped tremendously to have an A-list cast, headed
by Martin Sheen as the definitive television president and backed
by the likes of Rob Lowe, John Spencer and Alison Janney.
 &HT;    It's rare that a television show measures up to its prelaunch
hype, but ``The West Wing'' was even better than we expected.
 &HT;    + ``Popular.''
 &HT;    After an inauspicious beginning as yet another zits-'n'-cliques
teen drama, WB's ``Popular'' somehow morphed into the quirkiest,
best-written teen show on television.
 &HT;    Delta Burke as multibillionaire mom Cherry Cherry, a slew of
wacky guest stars from 1980s television and consistently knowing
scripts ensure that adult viewers are more than entertained.
 &HT;    ``After School Specials'' were never this cool. Or this crazed.
 &HT;    + ``Futurama.''
 &HT;    With ``The Simpsons'' stuck in a creative rut _ how many times
can we see Homer fail while the more interesting Springfield
secondary characters cry out for story lines? _ viewers are finding
solace in Fox's ``Futurama.''
 &HT;    Like ``The Simpsons,'' ``Futurama'' was immediately subversive
in its cast: The star of the series, Frye (voice of Billy Fox), is
a certified slacker whose best pal is Bender, a drunken,
malfunctioning robot. Big points for originality.
 &HT;    + ``Sex and the City.''
 &HT;    The second season of HBO's ``Sex and the City'' actually
improved on the first, as it matured into a well-rounded ensemble
dramedy, with the relationships between the girls and their men
providing some substance for the weekly sexfest.
 &HT;    Carrie's torturous relationship with Mr. Big and Miranda's
touching affair with the sweet-but-unsuitable Steve tugged at
heartstrings, even while our funnybones were being lasciviously
stroked.
 &HT;    + ``Malcolm in the Middle.''
 &HT;    A family sitcom about an average family without a last name _
just two oddball parents and four misbehaving sons.
 &HT;    It doesn't sound like much on paper, but on screen Fox's
``Malcolm in the Middle'' blossomed into an affectionately wry and
genuinely hilarious sitcom, winning huge ratings along the way.
 &HT;    Creator Linwood Boomer's nostalgia for his own early life shines
through in the show's trademark mix of delirious desperation and
the joys of a sweetly dysfunctional home.
 &HT;    + David Letterman's bypass.
 &HT;    Who'd have thought that a health scare could turn a crotchety
old talk-show host, one whom many thought had had his day, into a
national darling?
 &HT;    Indeed, that Letterman even had a heart was startling to some.
 &HT;    His return to his CBS desk after five weeks away broke ratings
records for ``The Late Show,'' and permitted him to beat Jay Leno's
``Tonight Show'' for the first time in years.
 &HT;    + ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.''
 &HT;    What's wrong with this picture: A slow-paced game show, hosted
by Kathie Lee's smarmy sidekick, beating ``ER'' in the ratings?
 &HT;    It's a mystery. Yet ABC's ``Millionaire'' has turned into a
ratings juggernaut that leaves all other programs foundering in its
wake.
 &HT;    The celebrity series was an improvement on the show's usually
glacial pace _ especially Tea Leoni's answer to husband David
Duchovny's phone-a-friend question. When the question stumped her,
she told him, ``Oh, honey, you're so screwed!''
 &HT;    + ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks.''
 &HT;    NBC's ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' is proof that being both a critics'
darling and a grassroots cult hit can't save a well-written show
from an early death.
 &HT;    So, like ``My So-Called Life'' before it, ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks''
bloomed only for a single season, and will live most fondly in the
memories of those who loved it.
 &HT;    Also like ``My So-Called Life,'' look for ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' to
be the springboard for some major talent, most notably Linda
Cardellini.
 &HT;    + Nurse Hathaway's departure on ``ER.''
 &HT;    When George Clooney turned up on ``ER'' to settle Carol
Hathaway's doubting heart, it took many fans by surprise. Where was
the big network ballyhoo over Clooney's return?
 &HT;    Clooney did the role for $596 _ as well as for the fans and for
the legacy of his character. The beautiful, sweet cameo tied up a
favorite story line perfectly, without any unnecessary hype.
 &HT;    The fact that Julianna Margulies, who played Nurse Hathaway,
turned down an astounding $27 million offer from NBC to stick with
the show somehow made the farewell even fonder. 
 -0- 
 THE BAD  
 &HT;    + ``God, The Devil &AMP; Bob.''
 &HT;    The animated ``God, The Devil &AMP; Bob'' never even sounded like a
good idea.
 &HT;    The protests from conservative religious groups were also
predictable, but for once the controversy failed to translate into
high ratings.
 &HT;    Then came the lawsuit from Jerry Garcia's estate, alleging that
the God character resembled the dead Head Deadhead, and NBC finally
banished the show to the television afterworld.
 &HT;    + ``The Tenth Kingdom.''
 &HT;    Besides being a waste of videotape and viewers' time, ``The
Tenth Kingdom'' was an interminable, bad-effects-strewn fairy tale.
 &HT;    Offbeat casting _ Camryn Mannheim as Snow White? _ and a
promising premise were not enough to turn NBC's poisoned apple into
a glass slipper.
 &HT;    + Post-haircut ``Felicity.''
 &HT;    Never before have the creators and producers of a show dared to
blame a ratings slide on their star's haircut. But when
``Felicity'' star Keri Russell's long, curly locks fell to the
floor, the WB show's ratings followed suit.
 &HT;    Rather than a season of continuous ``Ben or Noel?'' dilemmas and
uninspired writing, Felicity's follicular folly was named as the
culprit.
 &HT;    Guys, if that's the case, may we suggest a wig?
 &HT;    + ``Dawson's Creek,'' post-Kevin Williamson.
 &HT;    After a whip-smart two seasons under the watchful eye of
pop-culture auteur Kevin ``Scream'' Williamson, WB's ``Dawson's
Creek'' fell victim to Williamson's expanding empire when he left
to work on the mercifully brief run of ``Wasteland.''
 &HT;    Without Williamson, our favorite tortured-teen foursome found
themselves up the ``Creek'' without a paddle, as story lines veered
from dull to flat-out stupid.
 &HT;    A late-season reinvigoration suggests that the ``Creek'' may not
yet have run dry. 
 -0- 
 THE UGLY  
 &HT;    + ``Who Wants to Marry A Multimillionaire.''
 &HT;    When Fox was denied permission to stage a disaster special _
they wanted to crash an empty passenger plane into the desert _
they retaliated by staging a disaster of another kind: ``Who Wants
To Marry A Multimillionaire.''
 &HT;    In it, an allegedly wealthy bachelor (Rick Rockwell) was
actually wed to a nurse, Darva Conger, on live television _ a
concept that somehow managed simultaneously to degrade the
contestants, the audience and the institution of marriage.
 &HT;    Note to the newlyweds: After an annulment, you're supposed to
disappear. Instead Rockwell is trying to use the hype to revive his
standup-comedy career, while Conger is appearing nude in Playboy.
 &HT;    + JonBenet Ramsey TV movies.
 &HT;    As if it weren't horrible enough to live through the media
circus surrounding the grisly murder of JonBenet Ramsey, both Fox
and CBS felt that it was necessary to bring the still-unsolved
murder to the screen.
 &HT;    Neither adaptation offered any enlightenment, since the truth is
not yet known, and neither showed a shred of respect for the little
girl whose life and murder they sensationalized.

&HT;     HERO OF MIDWAY RECALLS THE TRAUMA OF DECISIVE BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOUNTVILLE, Calif. _ On a hot, hellish day 58 years ago, Art
Lewis dived into Pacific waters _ a roiling death stew of oil,
sharp-edged debris, sharks and the corpses of his comrades _ and
swam toward a big sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   He hauled a rope behind him so that desperate men who had leaped
from that burning ship ahead could be towed to his destroyer.
Lewis, then a 19-year-old seaman, saved 35 lives that day. By all
accounts, he should have lost his own, but somehow he was still
breathing when darkness fell at the Battle of Midway.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, the U.S. Navy is treating the
Battle of Midway as one of its two most important historical events
(after Oct. 13, 1775, the day the Navy was born).
</P>
<P>
   Lewis felt no overwhelming emotion at the time those days in
early June 1942, or during any of the other sea battles with names
that echo in the memories of his generation: Guadalcanal, the
Solomon Islands, the Marquesas, Wake.
</P>
<P>
   Now he thinks about all that and he chokes up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   He cries, for example, at the thought of his father, a tough man
who showed no love to his sons, waiting for the mail every day for
three months, not knowing whether Art was dead or alive.
</P>
<P>
   And he gulps down a sharp hiccup of sentiment when he rereads a
2-year-old proclamation from the Yountville City Council that
begins with these words: ``Whereas Art Lewis, American hero . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, now a 78-year-old resident of the California Veterans
Home near Yountville, said he never thought about heroism when his
destroyer, the USS Balch, steamed toward the center of the Pacific
in the first week of June 1942. Only six months earlier, Japanese
warplanes had sunk two battleships and killed more than 2,000
military personnel in a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were going to have a big battle in two or three
days,'' recalled Lewis, who has Parkinson's disease, as he rode his
wheelchair across the well-tended grounds of the veterans' home on
a recent morning.
</P>
<P>
   As a bosun's mate, he did not know they were going up against
the four Japanese carriers that had launched the raid on Pearl
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Contact was made June 4. Within three days, American forces
would sink those carriers and permanently turn the tide in the
battle for Pacific dominance. Though less well-remembered today,
the Battle of Midway was as crucial to Allied forces as D-day, and
much less certain to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Americans have forgotten how important Midway was
to their eventual victory against Japan has long rankled some in
the military establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad thing because the Battle of Midway (anniversary)
comes in the wake of Memorial Day, and many news organizations
don't cover it as well as they should,'' said Fred Gorell, a
retired Navy public information officer and vice president of the
San Francisco Navy League, best known for its annual co-sponsorship
of Fleet Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the defining sea battle in the Pacific, and historians
call it one of the greatest sea battles of all times,'' he said.
``The Battle of Midway was psychologically and strategically huge
in value, because one day the Japanese had the pride of their fleet
steaming toward Midway to occupy the island, to take it over, to
make it a base from which they could further attack, and the next
day they had three aircraft carriers sunk and the next morning a
fourth. They lost their power in the Pacific and it stunned them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Battle of Midway has not been implanted in the American
consciousness like D-day, in part, because it took place at sea,
said Navy Capt. Jim Kudla, spokesman for Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of
naval operations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``With armed battles, fought on land, there is a place you can
go to,'' Kudla said. ``You can go to the cemeteries where people
who fought and died are buried. With naval battles, by their very
nature, everything is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, noted undersea explorer Robert Ballard _ who had
discovered and photographed the sunken Titanic _ managed to send
remote-control submarines to the site of the USS Yorktown, 1,650
feet deep. The Yorktown was the only American aircraft carrier to
sink in the Battle of Midway.
</P>
<P>
   It was Yorktown sailors whom Lewis saved. He and another sailor,
who Lewis believes was attacked by sharks, volunteered to swim out
from their own ship with ropes to pull escaping Yorktown sailors to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that day, he talks about the men he saved _ and those
he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were too far gone (with injuries), I'd leave them,''
he said. ``It's a tough situation, playing God, I'll tell you.''

   SCI-GRAND-CANYON (Grand Canyon) _ The mysteries of Grand
Canyon's formation continue to amaze geologists. This week more
than 80 of them will gather in Grand Canyon Village to compare
notes and work toward a unified theory of how and when the canyon
formed. The last time a similar group of experts met to discuss the
evolution of the Colorado River was in August 1964, before modern
theories of plate tectonics revolutionized geophysics with the
notion that continents could drift, slam into one another and alter
entire landscapes the size of the American Southwest. Not
surprisingly, the favorite theories from the previous era are now
on the table for serious revision. By Sandra Blakeslee. (2100

   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Denver) _ Gene therapy burst into the news
like a bolt of lightning last fall, when a teenager from Tuscon
died in an experiment at the University of Pennsylvania. But while
politicians and the press have spent the year focusing on
allegations of lax government oversight and shoddily-run clinical
trials, the science of gene therapy has been making quiet, steady
progress. Little by little, researchers say, they are finding new
and better ways to deliver genes to their target cells. By Sheryl
Gay Stolberg. (1780 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CORN-BUTTERFLIES (Undted) _ The first field study of corn
genetically engineered to produce pesticides finds that the pollen

However, the results do not bear directly on monarch butterflies,
which were found in an earlier laboratory study to be harmed by

   SCI-SOLAR-HILLS (Undated) _ As predicted by theoreticians, the

   SCI-BLACK-HOLES (Undated) _ By the latest count, astronomers

</P>
<P>
   SCI-FLAT-SPACE (Undated) _ Nothing in the entire course of human
history would have been noticeably different if the universe were
not flat. Yet precisely for this reason there is poetry in the
recent discoveries that are worth celebrating, even if one is not a
cosmologist. They represent on the one hand a triumph of the human

   SCI-PERON-HEALTH (Undated) _ New discoveries about the life of
Eva Peron show that she was never told about her cancer, that a top

others of that era, her illness was hidden from her. And as still

SUPREME COURT RULES AGAINST GRANDPARENTS IN VISITING RIGHTS CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case of keen interest to grandparents across
the United States, the Supreme Court on Monday struck down a
Washington state law that had allowed not only grandparents but
also non-relatives to petition for the right to visit children.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision overturned the Washington law as
``breathtakingly broad.'' But the justices left open the
possibility that less extreme laws upholding the rights of
grandparents might withstand their scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have adopted grandparents' rights law, permitting
grandparents and sometimes others to seek court-ordered visiting
rights under various circumstances. The high court recognized the
importance of those rights Monday as it acknowledged the role that
many grandparents play in the lives of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998, approximately 4 million children _ or 5.6 percent of
all children under age 18 _ lived in the household of their
grandparents,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The case decided Monday, Troxel vs. Grandville, No. 99-138, drew
briefs from the 30-million member AARP, an advocacy group for
middle-aged and older Americans, as well as dozens of organizations
interested in the definition of family, from gay groups that
recognize same-sex unions to fundamentalist Christians with a
Norman Rockwell-like vision of home and hearth.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor noted that ``the demographic changes of the past
century make it difficult to speak of an average American family.''
But the ruling Monday was sufficiently nuanced, and the underlying
issues are so broad that Monday's action in this area of law was
almost surely not the last.
</P>
<P>
   The case produced six different opinions from the nine members.
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer joined O'Connor, while Justices David H.
Souter and Clarence Thomas wrote concurring opinions that took
somewhat different tacks.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.
Kennedy each wrote dissenting opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 plurality upheld the Washington state Supreme Court,
which declared in 1998 that the state law violated a parent's
constitutional right to rear his or her children without state
interference. The nation's high court on Monday cited not only that
overriding principle but the individual circumstances of the case
before them.
</P>
<P>
   The grandparents in this case are Gary and Jenifer Troxel, whose
son Brad fathered two daughters with his girlfriend, Tommie
Granville. Brad Troxel and Granville separated, and Brad Troxel
went to live with his parents before committing suicide in 1993.
Granville married a man who adopted her two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Jenifer Troxel wanted to see their granddaughters more
often than Granville and her new husband would allow, so the
grandparents brought suit and initially won a court visitation
order.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor placed considerable importance on the fact that no
court has ever found _ and the grandparents have never alleged _
that Granville was an unfit parent. Moreover, the justice noted,
Granville never sought to cut off visitation entirely; the mother
and her husband simply wanted to allow less of it than the
grandparents wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In his dissent, Stevens said the high court need not have
reviewed the Washington law but might better have left it to the
state legislature to revamp. He noted, too, that a parent's rights
regarding his or her child have ``never been regarded as
absolute.''

&HT;     LEGENDS ABOUT EARTHLY `GIANTS' NOW SEEN AS EARLY SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fossil-hunting scientists are raving over
evidence that some ancient legends about monsters are based on
discoveries of dinosaur bones made by nomads hundreds of years
before the time of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The myth of the griffin, a winged lion with a birdlike beak, was
apparently inspired by the nomads' discoveries of fossilized bones
of the protoceratops, an animal that existed more than 65 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, according to ``The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in
Greek and Roman Times'' by Adrienne Mayor, folk tales about a
vanished race of giant humans stemmed from ancient discoveries of
huge fossil thigh bones.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, paleontologists trace those same thigh bones _ some of
them 3 to 4 feet long _ to prehistoric elephants and other large
mammals, not to Goliath-sized humans.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor's 344-page book has drawn enthusiastic reviews.
</P>
<P>
   In the May 19 issue of Science magazine, Mott T. Greene, a
leading American historian of science, praises the book as ``a
historical and scientific detective story of the first rank . . .
(a) rich, spirited, and eminently readable book.''
</P>
<P>
   The book has thrilled paleontologists, researchers who study
fossils, by showing that their science dates from ancient times,
much older than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Most historical accounts of paleontology begin a few centuries
ago, when scientists puzzled over fossilized fish and seashells
found on mountains, some of them thousands of feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   As Mayor shows in her book, ancient Greek and Roman researchers
thousands of years ago collected numerous fossils of large extinct
mammals, measured their size and displayed them in temples and
museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``There they identified fossils as the relics of giants, heroes
and monsters of myth,'' the classical folklorist said in a
telephone interview from her home in Princeton, N.J. Some ancient
writers argued that the enormity of the supposed ``human'' remains
proved the human race had become smaller and weaker.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor ``has uncovered a barely noticed source for many of the
myths of the Old World, and for the first time has assembled in an
orderly way the evidence for early man's discovery of and
explanations for fossil remains,'' said Sir John Boardman, a
classical art historian at Oxford University in England. Because of
Mayor's analysis, he said, many ancient ``texts, sites, and
pictures will never seem quite the same again.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact of the ancient bones was on popular culture.
For example, many ancient Greek vases of the seventh through fifth
centuries B.C. depict griffins.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor said she would never forget the moment when she began to
suspect that the ancient images of griffins were based on reports
of the discovery of protoceratops bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the Greek island of Samos, not too far from the coast
of Turkey. I was visiting the archaeological museum there, where I
saw hundreds of bronze griffins that had been excavated from the
temple on Samos,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earliest depictions of griffins looked really gnarly and
brutish. It looked as if the artist were trying to portray
something real rather than mythological,'' she said. ``And then in
a flash, I realized that they looked like modern reconstructions of
dinosaurs in a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Protoceratops, which lived in the twilight of the dinosaur age
more than 65 million years ago, had a beak like a bird. At
maturity, it was typically 8 feet long, about the size of a lion.
It also had a bony frill at the back of the neck that the ancients
could have mistaken for the roots of wings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   What came next was 10 years of research into modern
paleontological records and ancient writings such as those archived
at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. She not only
found strong evidence that the ancients were aware of prehistoric
fossils, but that they depicted them artistically. She also found
archaeological evidence of fossil collecting in antiquity.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``all ancient philosophers ignored these big bones. If
they had not, they might have come up with the idea of evolution
long before Darwin,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Were the ancient images of griffins based on dinosaur bones from
the island of Samos? That was not possible, she realized, because
geological forces did not form the island until long after the
dinosaurs became extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she learned, the Greeks heard about the bones from
illiterate Scythian nomads who prospected for gold in the
westernmost regions of the Gobi Desert (in present-day China). They
found the bones in that area, specifically in deserts below the
foothills of the Altai Mountains.

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That same region was visited by a noted American explorer of the
1920s, Roy Chapman Andrews, the author of the engaging book ``On
the Trail of Ancient Man,'' which described his adventures in the
exotic desert lands of China and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
   One of Andrews' most celebrated finds was a complete
protoceratops skeleton. ``I was paging through the book and found a
photo of the skull of a protoceratops, partly embedded in the
ground. It looks just like a griffin,'' Mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   To learn what the Greeks knew about prehistoric fossils in their
own lands, she analyzed numerous historical narratives from more
than 30 different ancient authors, ranging from the historian
Herodotus of the fifth century B.C. to Augustine in the fifth
century A.D.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, classical scholars assumed that ancient accounts
of the bones of giants and monsters were ``just fantasy or
travelers' tales or superstition,'' she said. But Mayor's work
indicates that ancient reports of giant fossils contained grains of
truth.

LOW-TECH WORDS FIND HIGH-TECH MEANINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great American counterspook, Paul Redmond, left a word-news
tip in the dead drop that is my answering machine: ``Check out
 &UR; bundling &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers remember that word fondly from their spooning days.
`` &UR; Bundling &LR;  was originally courting in bed,'' noted an 1874
British slang dictionary, ``the lovers being tied or bundled up to
prevent undue familiarities. The practice still obtains in Wales.''
</P>
<P>
   This 1781 term for an early form of what is now called ``safe
sex,'' apparently pioneered by the prudent Welsh, was derived from
the Old English  &UR; bindan &LR; , ``to bind together,'' and was later
applied to ``men and women sleeping together, where the divisions
of the house will not permit of better or more decent
accommodation, with all their clothes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to the Arizona Legislature in 1956, which
prohibited `` &UR; bundling &LR;  or combining various limited benefit
insurance policies.'' The pejorative connotation grew when the
Justice Department in 1975 accused IBM of charging anti-competitive
prices for  &UR; bundling &LR;  hardware and software services.
</P>
<P>
   The European Community repeated the complaint in 1981, when John
Tagliabue defined the word in The New York Times: ``the practice of
what is called  &UR; bundling &LR;  _ selling the elements of a computer
system as a package to prevent competitors from supplying them at
perhaps better conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the term obtains, to use the archaic verb, in the
Microsoft case, as a federal judge ruled that the company illegally
 &UR; bundled &LR;  its Web browser with its Windows software. In my
legal-etymological interpretation, the company is appealing on the
grounds that separate divisions wrapped up in bed together, fully
clothed, are not making love.
</P>
<P>
   Thus do old terms find new uses in the brave new wide Web world.
The trade name  &UR; Spam &LR; , for example _ which was created in 1937 by
Hormel Foods out of the first and last letters of ``spiced ham'' _
has, when uncapitalized, come to mean ``junk e-mail,'' with a
second sense of ``the random posting of advertisements on computer
bulletin boards.''
</P>
<P>
   A fanciful speculation about the metaphoric reason for the
adoption of  &UR; spamming &LR;  by the computer world can be found in the
excellent Newton's Telecom Dictionary, 16th edition: ``The term is
derived from a brand of pink, canned meat that splatters messily
when hurled.'' (A spokesman for Hormel vociferously denies this,
and tests run at the Safire Semantic Kitchens confirm that uncanned
Spam, when hurled against a wall at a normal speed, bounces rather
than splatters.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cache &LR; , pronounced ``cash,'' from the French verb  &UR; cacher &LR; ,
``to hide,'' came to mean ``a hiding place for valuables''; it was
especially applied to holes dug to conceal provisions and
ammunition. (One reason given by the Pentagon for the U.S.
incursion into Cambodia in 1969 was to capture buried arms, causing
the Nixon aide Len Garment to ask, ``Can you check a  &UR; cache &LR; ?'')
</P>
<P>
   In usage by the new lingo, information is  &UR; cached &LR;  when it is
placed closer to the user to make it more accessible, which also
places less strain on limited computer and network resources. The
meaning has changed from the sinister ``hiding place'' to a more
positive ``nearby holding place.''
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; cookie &LR;  originated as a small Dutch cake and became the term
for a baked morsel to be passed around after the canapes have been
devoured. The metaphoric origin of  &UR; cookie &LR;  in computerese is
obscure (send speculation to onlanguage(at)nytimes.com), but its
meaning is ``a text file placed on a computer's hard disk by an
Internet server to track the client's habits and tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketers say it provides convenience and unexpected choices to
clients; privacy guardians warn that a  &UR; cookie &LR;  can follow a
customer's movements around the Web to create an invasive profile.
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; cookie-pusher &LR;  was a term coined in World War II to be a
derogation of diplomats who attended too many receptions; now it is
an exponent of ``targeted marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Attendant &LR;  began as ``one who waits upon or accompanies,'' as
in Milton's ``Lest sin Surprise thee, and her black  &UR; attendant &LR; ,
Death.'' After adoption by airlines of ``flight  &UR; attendant &LR; '' when
 &UR; stewardess &LR;  was taken as sexist, the word was snapped up by
technologists and now has two meanings. The first is ``an
inexpensive computer that leans heavily on its connection to more
sophisticated computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The second meaning bothers me. ``An  &UR; attendant &LR;  is an operator
of a phone system console,'' lexicographer Harry Newton tells me.
``Typically, it's the first person in a company to answer an
incoming call. That person  &UR; attends &LR;  the phone system; when the
company's phone is answered by a machine, that's an  &UR; automated
attendant &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   What's the matter with  &UR; operator &LR; ? My mother was a telephone
 &UR; operator &LR;  and proud of it. An  &UR; operator &LR;  suggests an active,
purposeful, hands-on person engaging with a device or system; an
 &UR; attendant &LR;  is more passive, sometimes just hanging around ``in
waiting.'' The machine, or system, that is  &UR; operated &LR;  is secondary
to the human in charge, but the phone system that is merely
 &UR; attended &LR;  is the master.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, Central?
</P>
<P>
   OF WIMPS AND MUSH
</P>
<P>
   In an aside (watch out for those asides) in an article last
month, I recalled a 1980 headline over an editorial in The Boston
Globe that read ``Mush From the Wimp,'' which I presumed a
prankster substituted for the cliche ``All Must Share the Burden.''
I am now informed by David Greenway, who retired last month as
editor of The Globe's editorial page, that it was not sabotage but
a self-inflicted wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the late Kirk Scharfenberg, editorial writer and later
editor of the page,'' writes Greenway, ``who wrote `Mush From the
Wimp' over his editorial on President Carter's economic plan. He
wrote it as a joke, never thinking that the headline would ever see
print.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, the copy editors write the headlines,'' continues
my colleague Greenway, ``but in this case the copy editors let it
through. The night editor caught it in midrun, and the headline was
hastily changed to the cliched `All Must Share the Burden' as a
last-minute sub for the rest of the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years later, when Greenway became editor of The Globe's
editorial page, the paper criticized animal rights advocates who
wanted to close down dog-sled racing in Alaska. The headline chosen
for its historic resonance: ``More Wimps for the Mush.''

SCIENCE QUESTION AND ANSWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By C. CLAIBORNE RAY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Whatever happened to seeding clouds to make it rain?
</P>
<P>
   A. Cloud-seeding experiments and government programs continue,
but in this country at least, they are not regarded as a panacea
for drought. The programs are usually subject to strict controls.
The Weather Modification Association, a clearinghouse for research
and information on all kinds of approaches to changing the weather,
says 32 states have enacted laws regulating who can practice cloud
seeding.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud seeding dates from experiments in 1946 at the General
Electric Laboratories in Schenectady, N.Y., and usually relies on
silver iodide as a seeding agent, providing nuclei for the rapid
formation of ice crystals that may eventually produce raindrops.
</P>
<P>
   There are some unknowns about effectiveness and safety. For
example, seeding at the wrong time and in the wrong place may
actually decrease rainfall. Some skeptics worry that there is a
possibility of creating severe weather like hail or floods or of
increasing rainfall in one region at the expense of another. Other
scientists say the possibilities of creating hail are remote and
that seeding can be suspended if there is danger of flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud seeding has been used for more than 25 years in parts of
West Texas and has been an important arm of water policy in Utah,
one of the driest states, since 1973. There have been recent major
programs in Florida, Thailand and Cuba.

   Although he spent the first 17 years of his life on the shores
of the Chesapeake Bay, Carl Immel had never set foot in its water.
After being jailed on assault and theft charges two years ago,
however, the court assigned Immel to Baltimore's Fresh Start
Program, which uses sailing as a therapeutic tool for troubled
teen-agers. Soon he was racing a 23-foot Rainbow sail boat in
Baltimore Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know a jib from a main sheet,'' said Immel, now 19,
who has since graduated from the program and gotten a job. ``But I
loved it the first time I raced, especially being out there away
from everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in poor urban neighborhoods is hardly the traditional
pedigree for sunset sails, but sailing is now being used to help
youths facing abuse, violence and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids come from tough backgrounds where they have a world
of issues and are products of their environment,'' said Parker
Rockefeller, director of development for Living Classrooms, a
nonprofit educational organization in Maryland that runs the Fresh
Start program, a learn-by-doing program for students who have
trouble with the law. ``When they come off the boats, they have an
incredible sense of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailing is a sport of independence, responsibility, control and
direction, the very qualities that are often lacking among youth
who have been in trouble, said Carol Miller, a child psychologist
and member of Sea Sisters, a Maryland group of women who sail. ``I
have seen teens,'' she said, ``in whose homes there was no control,
no consistency, and no one to trust.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing, she said, tackles these issues head on by getting the
teen-agers off the therapy couch and in control of a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrill, excitement and high you get from heeling over in a
high wind is very attractive to these children who often have a
high threshold for stimulation and engage in life-threatening
activities on the streets,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   It is this thrill that Dawn Riley, captain of America True, a
U.S. entry in the America's Cup race last year, wanted to share. In
1995, she began a nationwide youth sailing program, True Youth,
which pairs boat owners with at-risk children, like first-time
offenders or victims of abuse. Having spent much of her childhood
on the family sailboat, Riley, who is from Detroit, appreciates the
connection sailing makes with the young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big clique mentality, but out on the boat, the
playing field is level,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a tremendous amount of responsibility because of
strong winds and tides and cold water,'' said Paul Sidorenko, vice
commodore of Golden Gate Yacht Club in San Francisco, who runs the
club's youth sailing program. ``If you don't focus, you can die.''
</P>
<P>
   At Fresh Start, the young people run the entire ship, a schooner
called The Lady Maryland, with staff members there simply to help
out. ``Fifteen kids are lined up on the starboard side pulling up
this huge, heavy canvas mainsail,'' Rockefeller said. ``You can't
do that without working together.''
</P>
<P>
   The same self-esteem and competence sailing sometimes imparts to
troubled youths from the city can work for the suburban ones, too.
A 10-year-old from Arnold, Md., who asked that her name not be
used, struggled through her parents' divorce and sought counseling
with the Strong Girls program at the YMCA, which included sailing
with the local Women Aboard club. She said that while on the boat,
the tension she felt at home began to slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother noticed the change: ``There was a light I hadn't seen
in her eyes for quite a while. The sailing seemed to blow things
away and I was just grateful to see it.''

   PATTERNS: The Memories of Youth, Fading Fast
</P>
<P>
   Considering how hard it is for many people to remember what they
did even the day before, it is remarkable that so many childhood
memories remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   But now a new study shows that many of those memories may be, at
best, suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Northwestern University, recalling a study they
did in the '60s of 73 boys asking all manner of questions about
their lives, decided to ask them the same questions. Only this
time, the ``boys'' were an average of 48 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Journal of the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry, the researchers said they had found wide
disparities between how the boys described their teen-age years and
how the 67 men they found recalled them. On the most basic issues,
there was often no correlation between the two sets of answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our surprise,'' said Dr. Daniel Offer, a professor of
psychiatry, ``they just didn't know. They had no idea what they
said. They thought they were telling us what they felt then.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few limited areas, subjects gave similar answers, including
about their fathers' salaries and their own earning hopes. On
everything else, though, all bets were off. And no pattern seemed
apparent: on some issues, they remembered life as being better, on
others, worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, for example, 28 percent of the boys said they did
not like homework or school; later, 58 percent said they did not
like them. On the other hand, while 82 percent of the boys said
they were disciplined physically, only 33 of the men said they had
been.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted with the discrepancies between their first and
second answers, some men were skeptical. ``They argued with us,''
he said. ``They said, `No, that's not true.'''
</P>
<P>
   BEHAVIOR: Of Rats, Cocaine and Addiction Mysteries
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine is indisputably addictive, but while many fall into its
hold, others simply dabble and move on. To date, predicting how a
user will react to the drug has been anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   A new study, however, suggests that one sign of the future
addict is plunging headlong into cocaine use from the very
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Yale reached that conclusion after studying rats
that were allowed to administer cocaine to themselves. They
published their findings in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Self, an associate professor of psychology, said he
and his colleagues had wanted to test two hypotheses about cocaine
addiction: that it was more prevalent among animals inclined to
seek novelty, or among those that are more sensitized to cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Neither turned out to be true, it appeared. Instead, the best
predictor of addiction seemed to be the amount the rats took in an
early part of the study, when they were allowed to dose themselves
for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   All the rats in the study were then cut off from the drug, and
their degree of addiction was measured by how frequently they
returned to the cocaine dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   The rats that used the most cocaine, about 35 percent of the
group, were the most likely to show signs of strong addiction.
Researchers suspect a possible biological basis for the
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Self said the research could lead to a better understanding of
why some people are prone to drug addictions. ``A lot of people try
drugs, but only some of them become addicted.''
</P>
<P>
   LEARNING: Exploring Dyslexia and Brain Energy
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they have been able to measure brain changes in
dyslexic children who have been taught to read with a newly
developed technique.
</P>
<P>
   Using an imaging device known as a spectroscope, researchers at
the University of Washington examined the children before they took
part in the study and found that the dyslexic children used four
times as much brain energy to process sounds as did children
without the disorder. After about a year of training, they used
just 1.8 times as much energy.
</P>
<P>
   When children overcome part of their disability, ``they also
change in their brain-imaging parameters,'' said Todd Richards, a
radiology professor who worked on the study with Virginia
Berninger, a neuropsychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Dyslexia, a reading disorder, is described as the most common
learning disability, affecting 5 percent to 15 percent of children.
It is sometimes described as a ``wiring'' problem in the brain, and
the researchers say they have tried to develop training techniques
to make the brain more efficient at processing language.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are reported in the current issue of The Journal of
Neuroradiology. Details of the technique will not be published
until fall, but researchers said it was built on boys' interest in
science and technology by linking reading instruction to hands-on
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved 15 boys ages 10 to 13, 8 of whom were
dyslexic, and all of whom had similar IQ's.
</P>
<P>
   After the training, the researchers said, all but one of the
dyslexic boys could read age-appropriate material. But the
researchers expect them to need continued training to keep the
ground they gained.
</P>
<P>
   THERAPIES: A Cautious Nod to `Distance Healing' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Annals of Internal Medicine is not the kind of a journal
where one is likely to find advertisements in the back for healing
crystals or testimonials to the healing power of the latest herbal
craze.
</P>
<P>
   So some may be a little surprised to hear suggested that there
may be merit to an alternative form of medicine known as distance
healing. This can include anything from therapeutic touch _ in
which practitioners, without touching their patients, try to alter
their energy fields _ to simply praying for people who are ill.
</P>
<P>
   The study's author, Dr. John Aston, an assistant professor at
the University of Maryland medical school, appeared at pains not to
overstate his findings. But he said a review of 23 studies
indicated a positive effect in 57 percent of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some therapeutic benefit here,'' Aston said. Why
is another question, and he made no attempt to answer it.
</P>
<P>
   Distance healing, in which people seek to help patients simply
with the power of the mind, is part of the growing practice of
alternative medicine in this country. One of the studies reviewed
by Aston came out last year and involved about 1,000 heart
patients, 10 percent of whom appeared to be helped when people
prayed for them without their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Aston said he believed more research was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take the position, which I believe is the scientific one,
which is to stay open-minded,'' he said.

FROM THE LIFE OF EVITA, A NEW CHAPTER ON MEDICAL SECRECY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Eva Peron, the first lady of Argentina, underwent a
hysterectomy in November 1951, she did not know that her husband,
Juan, had summoned a Manhattan cancer surgeon to perform the
procedure. The surgeon, Dr. George Pack, flew to Buenos Aires,
entered the operating room after Eva was anesthetized, and left
before she awoke.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, using the same secret ritual, Pack examined an
anesthetized Eva to confirm the cervical cancer that Argentine
doctors had detected.
</P>
<P>
   The deceit was to keep the cancer secret from Eva and the public
during a presidential campaign. Eva's efforts for the poor made a
powerful political figure of a woman whose fame was later
perpetuated as Evita in a Broadway musical and movie. News that she
had a potentially fatal illness could have affected the election's
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The childless Eva underwent both procedures in the belief she
had vague female problems. She never knew she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Eva's medical ordeal began in January 1950 when she was 30. She
fainted and underwent an appendectomy. Despite persistent weakness
and anemia from vaginal bleeding, she delayed further tests. In
August 1951, Eva, much weaker, developed increasingly severe
abdominal pain and fainted again. A physical showed she had
advanced cancer of the cervix, and Argentine doctors treated her
with radium, then a standard therapy.
</P>
<P>
   After examining Eva for the first time in October, Pack flew
back to what is now the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
New York. On returning to Argentina in November, he performed
extensive surgery because the cancer had spread to adjacent pelvic
organs, and he stayed until Eva was stable.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Argentine government declined to disclose the
nature of Eva's illness. Press reports gave conflicting views as to
whether she had cancer. Peron was re-elected while Eva recuperated
from surgery. Later, she resumed limited political activities. But
when the abdominal pain returned in February 1952, Argentine
doctors confirmed, again without telling Eva, that the cancer had
recurred with striking rapidity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cancer shrank temporarily with additional
radiotherapy, the pain recurred in May 1952. Chemotherapy failed.
Eva died on July 26, never knowing that she had cervical cancer,
the same disease that had killed Juan Peron's first wife.
</P>
<P>
   In lifting Eva's medical story from obscurity and reporting it
in the June 3 issue of The Lancet, Dr. Barron Lerner, a medical
historian and ethicist at Columbia University, has added new
information to an earlier biography of Eva and a small number of
articles about her illness in Argentine newspapers and medical
journals.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner stumbled upon Park's role in the case while researching a
book on the history of breast cancer. He pursued the Peron story
because it was important to medical history and showed the radical
change in medical practice and ethics over the last 50 years, he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In the last century, patients with cancer and other fatal
conditions were rarely told what they had. Now, as paternalism has
yielded to consumerism and truth-telling in medicine, most such
patients in the United States are told of the diagnosis and who
will do their surgery. Occasionally, the diagnosis is withheld
because of cultural differences and language problems. Yet patients
in some other countries are still not told.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, secrecy about cancer has given way to
widespread publicity, and many celebrities with cancer, including
political leaders, now acknowledge it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in April Mayor Rudolph Giuliani disclosed that he
had early prostate cancer. Last month, he cited the difficulty of
choosing a therapy as a main reason for dropping out of the Senate
race. Last December, when Sen. John McCain was running for
president, he disclosed that he had a melanoma skin cancer removed
in 1993. Nevertheless, some political leaders have been less than
candid in disclosing their health problems.
</P>
<P>
   When Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts ran for president in 1992, he
and his doctors inaccurately described his condition as ``cancer
free'' when a lymphoma had recurred after a bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Mitterrand's doctor was disciplined for writing that
the French president's death in 1996 was due to prostate cancer
that he had kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Robert Casey, the former governor of Pennsylvania and
onetime presidential candidate, died, seven years after receiving a
heart-liver transplant for a rare hereditary disease known as
familial amyloidosis. After Casey's 1990 re-election campaign, his
cardiologist acknowledged that he had postponed medical tests
because he feared the results could have affected the race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the wives of two major political figures had surgery
for breast cancer. In September, Betty Ford, the first lady, had
surgery for breast cancer. Weeks later, Margaretta (Happy)
Rockefeller, the wife of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York, had
both cancerous breasts removed in separate operations. When the
second cancer was found in her right breast shortly after removal
of her left one, the governor asked doctors to delay telling her
until a week before the next surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Pack, who died in 1969, had wanted to write about his role in
Eva's case, but he could not because he was bound to protect
patient-doctor confidentiality. Pack did, however, leave records
that his widow, Helen, allowed Lerner to report because of earlier
disclosures about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The records showed that Pack did not seek to become involved in
the case, was not paid and that Ellsworth Bunker, then the
ambassador to Argentina, and other government figures approved of
Pack's actions, Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   Many famous people receive less than optimal medical care as
victims of the so-called VIP syndrome. In it, doctors deviate
incorrectly from standard practice either for perceived personal
gains of fame or out of demands from such patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some surgeons might have been tempted to try heroic measures
like a salvage operation to try to extend her life, but Dr. Pack
did not treat Evita like a VIP,'' Lerner said. ``When Eva's cancer
recurred, Dr. Pack declined to perform further surgery in the
belief that it was futile.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Eva's cervical cancer would have been
detected earlier if she had been in the United States. The Pap
smear, which can detect cervical cancer in its earliest stage, was
developed in 1942, and in 1950 it still was not standard in medical
care in the United States or Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine and the U.S. governments apparently have not
officially confirmed that Eva Peron had cervical cancer or that
Pack performed the operation without her knowledge. State
Department officials and the Argentine Embassy in Washington said
they had no knowledge about Eva's case because it occurred so long
ago. Lerner said he did not try to examine Eva's medical records or
government records.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many American hospitals cater to foreign patients,
including government officials and their families. Dr. Agu Suvari,
acting medical director of the State Department, said his office
had not been asked to arrange for care for foreign officials. With
medical information so accessible online, many foreigners arrange
care on their own or through their personal doctors. King Hussein
of Jordan flew to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for cancer
care, and Mayo doctors attended the king in Jordan until he died.
The Houston heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey has often gone abroad
to see patients, including Boris Yeltsin, when he was the president
of Russia.

SCIENCE NOTES AND NEWS

<P>
   The Belching Sea
</P>
<P>
   The sea floor off the mid-Atlantic coast has a bad case of
indigestion. Scientists have discovered that there are large
amounts of gas trapped beneath it, and there are signs that the gas
occasionally bursts through in a kind of suboceanic belch.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of the gas was confirmed last month during a
research cruise by scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution and several universities. The scientists were studying
the structure of the continental shelf, particularly the presence
of what appeared to be large cracks that could someday cause
underwater landslides, leading to tsunamis.
</P>
<P>
   They suspected that rising gas could be at least partly
responsible for the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Seismic data gathered by the researchers showed the presence of
gas beneath the top layers of sediment. But the scientists also
realized that the cracks were not really cracks at all, but rather
a series of large depressions, up to about three square miles in
size, that appeared to be the result of gas eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, the scientists suggested, is that gas builds up
under the sediments, which are relatively impermeable, until
something occurs _ the researchers do not know just what _ to cause
it to break through. The violence of the eruption essentially blows
a hole in the sea floor, leaving behind the depression.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists say this phenomenon could weaken the shelf and
contribute to the possibility of landslides. While the risk is
slight, underwater landslides are not unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Respect for Aged Insects
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fossils, moths and butterflies get far less
press than, say, dinosaurs. The lack of attention is partly due to
a lack of specimens: only about 700 moth and butterfly fossils
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are not sure whether the lack of fossils means that
these insects were not abundant millions of years ago, or that they
just do not preserve well.
</P>
<P>
   A new discovery, however, indicates that poor preservation is
the problem. In one fell swoop, a European scientist has more than
doubled the number of these fossils in existence. The researcher,
from the University of Goettingen in Germany, reports in Nature the
finding of some 1,700 moth specimens in 55-million-year-old
sediments in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   More than a thousand of the specimens are of one species, and
they were often found close together. Since the area in which they
were found was once part of the ancient North Sea, the finding
indicates that the moths undertook mass migrations over the sea, as
some species still do. And mass migration means that there must
have been masses of these insects around.
</P>
<P>
   Loitering Insecticide
</P>
<P>
   The insecticide chlordane was banned in the United States in
1988, but like other pesticides in the family known as
organochlorines, it is known to loiter in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Just how long it loiters, and what kind of trouble it gets into,
is the subject of a study by scientists at the Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven. They have shown that
even decades after use, chlordane is taken up by many common garden
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers grew test crops on a patch of land that used to
be a lawn and had been treated with chlordane in 1960. They found
that root crops like carrots, beets and potatoes had among the
highest concentrations of chlordane, which might be expected given
that it is taken up by the roots. But the pesticide was also found
in the edible parts of vegetables like spinach, lettuce and
zucchini. It was not found in the edible parts of tomatoes, corn or
peppers, however.
</P>
<P>
   Chlordane accumulates in animal tissue, and can lead to
disorders of the digestive and nervous systems. The researchers
noted, however, that the amounts in the test crops were very small.
Washing the vegetables in water will help reduce the chances of
consuming the pesticide.

<P>
   FORT KNOX, Ky. _ Staff Sgt. Harry Feyer was parking cars and
looking glum when the four platoons of Bravo Company, including his
own, came marching toward him up a long grassy hill on their way to
the winter graduation.
</P>
<P>
   They stepped smartly, 214 strong, their brass buttons gleaming
on dress greens, their black patent leather shoes buffed to a high
sheen. They displayed all the discipline and dash that Feyer, a
leader of 4th Platoon, had helped pound into them in nine weeks of
basic training.
</P>
<P>
   Striding beside them were his fellow drill sergeants, shoulders
back, chests out, their full-dress uniforms a deep green backdrop
for clusters of glinting medals and rainbows of ribbons, their
brown Smokey Bear hats cocked aggressively low on their foreheads.
Feyer, 6 feet tall and lanky, might have been among them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he stood apart in his mottled fatigues and dusty combat
boots, directing traffic outside the dingy yellow gymnasium where
the ceremony was to be held. It was a duty he had volunteered for.
It was his one-man protest.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer was angry that he had been denied an award given to the
top-performing drill sergeant at the end of each basic-training
cycle, an award he felt he deserved. True, it didn't look like much
_ just a cheap bronze-plated statue, a generic 8-inch-tall figure
of a sergeant. But in the pressure cooker that is the U.S. Army,
winning even a small award could help make the difference between
promotion and stagnation, between a better life for his family and
just scraping by.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew why he had lost out, or believed he knew: because he
is white. No white drill sergeant had won the award since the
company was founded in April 1998. Of the total of five that had
been given out, three had gone to blacks and one to a Hispanic. The
one time a white sergeant was selected, he gave the trophy back
when a group of black sergeants kicked up a fuss, saying he didn't
deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   That Feyer had lost out this time came as no surprise in Bravo
Company, particularly to the white sergeants. Everyone knew that in
Bravo, a clique of black sergeants ran things.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer said he didn't like to think that way. People make too
much of race, he said. But there were times when it did matter to
him. ``When it's a matter of something that I deserve because of my
position,'' he said, ``if I outrank a person and he gets a job
because of his color, then there's something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As Feyer stewed in the parking lot, Staff Sgt. Earnest Williams
stood erect in front of 4th Platoon, his square, muscled frame
pushing at the seams of his uniform. Williams was part of that
black coterie that ran the company, and ran it smoothly. The white
sergeants might grumble, but they acknowledged that the blacks got
things done. Yet Williams was not feeling particularly powerful
this morning. This was his last day with the company. He was being
transferred to another unit, away from his buddies, away from his
position of influence.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed unfair to him. He was a good soldier, a good leader.
His superiors _ his white superiors _ had said that there were too
many drill sergeants in Bravo Company, and not enough in others. He
did not believe them. He was convinced that he was being shipped
out because he is black. As far as he could see, the powers that be
didn't like it when the brothers were in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it for a little while,'' said one of his black
compatriots. ``But then they said, `Oh no, we can't let this be.'''
</P>
<P>
   So on a chill December morning, two soldiers _ one black, one
white, both part of an institution that has been portrayed as a
model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in the middle of
this sprawling base, each believing himself the victim of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Just then a gray Honda Accord glided into a parking space and
out popped Sgt. 1st Class Henry Reed, resplendent in his dress
greens. ``Good morning!'' he bellowed, a broad smile splitting his
dark, soft-featured face. ``It's a wonderful day!''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was going to receive the award that Feyer saw as rightfully
his; Reed would get the glory even though it had been Feyer who had
worked the late nights, who had pitched in to help other platoons
when they were short-handed, who had made sure the washers and
dryers got fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was limited by a back injury suffered in a car crash, and
it had not escaped Feyer's notice that Reed had skipped the long
days on the rifle range, that he hadn't humped a 40-pound rucksack
up and down steep, chest-busting hills on 15-kilometer marches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that Reed is broke,'' one white drill sergeant
said. ``He can't do the work anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed was also nearing retirement; at 39 he was the oldest drill
sergeant in the company. This was probably his last chance to win
the company's drill-sergeant award. So his fellow black sergeants
had decided to select him, they said, on the basis of what he had
done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   As Feyer watched his colleague stride jauntily into the field
house, he had another reason to fume. Reed had parked his car off
by itself, leaving a devil-may-care gap in the row of vehicles that
Feyer _ who finds satisfaction in rote tasks _ had meticulously
arranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ruined my parking,'' Feyer said. ``Not only did he screw me
out of my award, but he ruined my parking.''
</P>
<P>
   IDEAL? GET REAL
</P>
<P>
   The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment any more.
Integrated since 1948, it is now marbled with blacks, Hispanics and
other minority members of all ranks. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and to hear the military brass tell it, no one gives it a
second thought.
</P>
<P>
   But that is an idealized image. The Pentagon itself discovered
as much last year, when it found that two-thirds of the men and
women in the armed forces had experienced a racially offensive
encounter in the previous 12 months. Those findings more or less
mirrored the view from Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry
in the summer and fall of last year. Racial tensions abounded, but
seldom were they out in the open. Even less often did they rise to
high drama. Race-related fights were rare; the angry spitting out
of a slur was uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 sergeants in Bravo Company appeared to get along, too,
eating together in the mess hall, joshing one another about
cultural differences in food, music and sports. In part, they were
helping to fulfill the Army's goal of not so much changing racial
attitudes as altering behavior; to some extent, they were carrying
out orders _ to treat one another with respect regardless of race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like wearing seat belts,'' said Sgt. 1st Class Thomas
Ballard, a white drill sergeant from Aberdeen, Miss. ``When I was
growing up, I never wore a seat belt. But the Army says you've got
to wear them.''
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, at least, Williams and Feyer seemed good
candidates for getting beyond race. Both were 34 years old and
married. Their children _ Williams has three, Feyer two _ are of
similar ages. Both men had been in the Army 12 years and had been
``on the trail,'' as drill-sergeant duty is called, since the
company was formed. Both had had spotty academic records and both
had been worrying about their careers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They were also partners _ ``battle buddies,'' in military
parlance _ in running 4th Platoon, though Williams, as platoon
sergeant, was technically Feyer's supervisor. Their metal desks sat
three feet apart. They even lived on the same street, less than 200
yards from each other.
</P>
<P>
   But neither had ever set foot in the other's house. Williams had
a simple explanation: ``We don't have anything in common. We're
just different.''
</P>
<P>
   They were certainly different in background. Earnest Williams
had grown up poor in a fatherless household in Waco, Texas. Harry
Feyer (pronounced Fire) had led a sheltered, stable life in tidy,
middle-class, lily-white Sheboygan, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   They had also come to be drill sergeants by very different
military paths. On the wall next to Feyer's desk was a pen-and-ink
drawing of a Cobra helicopter, a memento of his days as a copter
mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, by contrast, was pure infantryman. Hanging next to his
desk was a framed drawing of a soldier carrying a rucksack and an
M-16. After he bought the sketch, in Hawaii, he had an artist erase
the white soldier's face and draw one with black features. It kind
of looked like him.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, Williams was far more comfortable with the racial
structure of Bravo Company. Though a white captain and white
lieutenant oversaw the unit, the four black drill sergeants were
unofficially in charge. Alongside Williams, Staff Sgt. Otis Thomas
ran the 3rd Platoon, Reed the 2nd and Staff Sgt. Robert Boler the
1st.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was 1st Sgt. Anthony Boles, a black man who was in
charge of day-to-day matters for the entire company. The four black
sergeants held great sway with him _ or so it appeared to some
white and Hispanic drill sergeants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I complained about something, I would get shot down quicker
than Reed or Williams would,'' said Sgt. 1st Class Rogelio Gomez, a
Hispanic drill sergeant who left Bravo Company last August. ``That
was the first sergeant's fault, because he was more comfortable
dealing with his homies.''
</P>
<P>
   Boles scoffed at the notion that he played favorites. But he and
the other black sergeants, including Williams, acknowledged that
having a company in which African-Americans were in control was a
source of racial pride. They considered it unusual, and they feared
it would not last.
</P>
<P>
   TO CLIMB, COMPETE
</P>
<P>
   Race wasn't the whole story in Bravo Company. Career and
financial pressures exist in Army life with or without racial
tensions. When race does come into play, though, it only aggravates
the stress.
</P>
<P>
   While the Army proclaims itself to be about teamwork, its
soldiers, including its sergeants, compete against one another. The
sergeants push their troops to be named honor platoon, to win
marching and marksmanship citations, to score the highest on the
PT, or physical training, test. That means doing the most push-ups
and situps, and running the fastest two miles.
</P>
<P>
   Winning is not just a matter of satisfying testosterone-fueled
egos. Any award, any citation, goes into a soldier's personnel file
and can help lift him or her to the next rank. Promotions are
everything. The raises they bring may be small, but they are the
only means of easing the financial strain.
</P>
<P>
   Like other sergeants, Harry Feyer and Earnest Williams each made
about $2,000 a month before taxes. With that they had to buy their
own uniforms, knapsacks, sleeping bags, helmets and even the
stripes they sewed on their sleeves. Meals in the company mess hall
were charged to them.
</P>
<P>
   Housing is free if soldiers live on the post. But that means
families must make do with cramped row houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have more than five bucks in my back pocket or,
sometimes, no dollars in my back pocket,'' Feyer said. ``I want to
be able to go to the ATM and not worry, `Should I do this?''' He
said he would love to move into one of those bigger, duplex houses
with attached garages. But houses like that are set aside for
sergeants first class, a rank above him.
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment there can be gnawing suspicions about why
you're not moving up, or not moving up faster. Maybe it's your
shortcomings. Maybe someone is holding you back. Or maybe, you
think, you're not getting ahead because of your race. It's hard to
tell.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell in the cases of Williams and Feyer. Williams
confided that he thought little of Feyer as a soldier and even less
of him as a leader. He felt his colleague let too many things fall
through the cracks and didn't push the privates enough. As Boler
said one day, using Williams' nickname, ``In that platoon, Will's
the daddy and Harry's the mommy.'' In the macho world of the Army,
``mommy'' is not a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   There was a Monday in July when Williams returned from the
weekend to find the barracks a mess. Feyer had had weekend duty.
Williams was worried that the first sergeant would see the scuff
marks on the floor and the scum in the showers and blame him, as
platoon sergeant. That would have stained his record at a delicate
time; his name was before the promotion board again.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unaware of Williams' disrespect, Feyer wondered aloud
why his partner didn't share more responsibility with him, why he
didn't trust him more. Why was it that Williams tended to confer
with Reed, Thomas and Boler on matters involving 4th Platoon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm his battle buddy,'' Feyer said. ``I feel he should be
discussing things with me.''
</P>
<P>
   SHOWING WHO'S THE BOSS
</P>
<P>
   Basic training had entered the hot, suffocating days of a
Kentucky August, and Feyer was angry and hurt. Williams had
undermined his authority, he said _ again.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before, as Bravo Company was finishing up on the
hand-grenade range, the sergeants had put the recruits in formation
for a ``shakedown,'' frisking them to make sure they were not
smuggling dummy grenades, a favorite souvenir, back to the
barracks. Feyer called on Pvt. David Kellar, a tough-looking black
recruit from Chicago, and got a scornful look.
</P>
<P>
   Kellar had been a problem from the start. He was big and
intimidating. He liked to bully. Once, he got into a fight and
broke another recruit's jaw. He was rebellious. When given an
order, he would often suck his teeth or cast a baleful gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Kellar's behavior unnerved Feyer. ``It wasn't like I was afraid
of him,'' he said. ``I'm sure I could take him if I had to. But it
was like he wasn't giving me any respect.'' He had never seen the
private treat Williams that way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So when Kellar gave him the look this time, Feyer decided to
show him who was boss. After patting him down, Feyer picked up the
recruit's canteen and casually tossed it into an open field. ``Go
get the canteen, Private,'' he told him.
</P>
<P>
   But Kellar wasn't about to fetch anything. He turned to another
recruit and gruffly ordered him to retrieve his canteen.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer only got angrier. He and Staff Sgt. David Hanson, a white
Californian, grabbed the rest of the recruit's gear _ helmet,
equipment belt, rucksack _ and heaved it into the field as well.
``Get your gear yourself,'' Feyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Kellar obeyed this time but then complained that his helmet was
missing an identification holder. It held not only his Army ID, he
said, but also $50. He implied the loss was the sergeants' fault.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One black drill sergeant wasn't buying it. ``Better check him,''
he said. But before anyone could touch him, Kellar patted his chest
himself. Oh, he said, it had been around his neck the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   Now Feyer wanted the private punished for lying. Back at the
barracks, he typed out papers that could have led to a fine or an
outright discharge. But to Williams that was overkill. A number of
black drill sergeants thought the white sergeants were too harsh
with black recruits, he said, and he agreed. He recalled his days
in basic training when he was a tough-talking hardhead and black
drill sergeants had cut him some slack. So Williams and the first
sergeant pressed Feyer to withdraw the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer relented, but the episode did not sit well. He saw it as
part of a pattern in which Williams would contradict him, criticize
him, ridicule him or bypass him altogether. Sometimes when they
were shooting the breeze, Williams would regale the others with
tales of a Feyer screwup. Williams knew this bothered his partner,
he said, but he hoped it would prompt him to shape up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to make him feel insufficient or not good enough,''
Williams said. ``I didn't enjoy it, but I did it to put pressure on
him to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Feyer would laugh at himself along with the rest. But inside, he
said, he seethed. He hated the way his partner embarrassed him.
</P>
<P>
   STEAMROLLER FROM WACO
</P>
<P>
   On a bright summer afternoon Williams was marching 4th Platoon
along one of Fort Knox's wooded back roads. Each drill sergeant has
his favorite cadence _ the rhythmic call-and-response chant used to
keep the privates in step. Williams was calling out one of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a steamroller, baby,'' he sang in a strong tenor, ``and
I'm rolling all over you.''
</P>
<P>
   The words fit well, physically and temperamentally. At 5 feet 10
inches and 210 pounds, Williams was a model of muscle and power.
When he had free time, he was usually pumping iron in the company's
weight room. He was careful with his diet and didn't smoke, though
he did occasionally like a beer. His desk drawer rattled with
bottles of pills labeled ``Ripped Fuel _ Metabolic Enhancer'' and
``Metaform.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a boyish smile and pointed ears that could give him
an elfin quality. But in an institution that puts a premium on
physical fitness, it was important to Williams to camouflage his
charm with sternness and to impress the privates with prowess.
</P>
<P>
   One evening they challenged him to do 50 push-ups in a minute.
He accepted, but not wanting to embarrass himself, he first
retreated to his office to see if he could pull off such a feat.
There he dropped to the floor and did 50. Naturally the effort
tired him. But he would not let himself show weakness, so he
swaggered out into the sleeping bay, slapped a stopwatch into a
private's hand and knocked out another quick 50. The men were
wide-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Army you're either a stud or a slug,'' the sergeant
said. ``You can be really intelligent. But if you can't run three
miles or hump a rucksack, then you're a slug.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams learned the necessity of toughness long before he got
to Bravo. He grew up in the central Texas flatlands, bouncing among
housing projects and running through the weeds around shacks in a
neighborhood of drugs and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Earnest Williams was the sixth of 14 children born to Shirley
Ann Hunter. Abandoned by her first and second husbands, she had
little choice other than welfare. But with so many mouths to feed,
it was never enough. Clothes came from the Salvation Army. The
family was constantly being evicted for failure to pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives offered to take in some of the children, but she
refused. ``The one thing our mother showed us was endurance,'' said
another son, Robert Bell. ``Because we had it so hard, we would
have these family group sessions. She would call all my brothers
and sisters together and tell us that the only thing we had was
each other, and the only thing we could do was endure.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the children did. The oldest brother, Greg, became a
crack addict, and a younger brother, James, was killed during a
drug deal. But Earnest stayed out of trouble, channeling into
sports the determination his mother had taught him. In high school,
he became a football and track star. Or, more precisely, he willed
himself to become a star; he could not abide the word can't. One
summer he watched people in the deep end of a public pool. Not
content at the shallow end, he watched them and mimicked them until
he had taught himself to swim.
</P>
<P>
   But he was never much of a student. ``I went all the way through
high school and I don't think I cracked a book once,'' he said one
day, looking wistfully off in the distance from a bleacher seat at
Fort Knox.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways he is the perfect soldier: strong, driven and
unquestioning.
</P>
<P>
   After enlisting he was steered into the infantry, and with his
physical abilities he found it easy. ``I felt like I'm at home
here,'' he said. He was considered a first-rate infantryman. Once,
during the Persian Gulf War, he walked point for an entire
battalion of the 82nd Airborne Division as it moved to attack the
Iraqis. That was as close as he came to combat; the Iraqis
surrendered at the Americans' approach.
</P>
<P>
   But he never gave much thought to where his career was going. He
dutifully took the elite infantry jobs that his superiors
recommended _ paratrooper, Ranger _ and succeeded at whatever was
asked of him, to the extent that he got his sergeant's stripes. He
was a natural leader as a drill sergeant, fast-talking,
quick-moving and impatient with those who were not.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his career hit a wall after the Gulf War. He was promoted to
staff sergeant in 1992. Seven years later, he had yet to make it to
the next level, sergeant first class. Four times his name went
before promotion boards and four times he was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Ruth, a Puerto Rican whom he met in 1987,
suspected that his academic deficiencies were behind his
stagnation. He had never taken any college courses in the Army,
even though he had had the opportunity. During a stint at Fort
Benning, Ga., for example, he had enough time on his hands to
become a part-time security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about going back to school lots of times,'' Ruth
Williams said one afternoon in their living room, between running
one child to dance and another to basketball. ``A big obstacle for
him is being afraid to go back. He feels he was never really
prepared in high school to do college work.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they watched other sergeants move up _ mainly white ones,
whose credentials were no better than his _ the Williamses also
began to suspect race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you wonder,'' Ruth Williams said. ``Is he being
passed over because he's a black male?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams was getting older and going nowhere. He decided that if
he didn't get a promotion by this summer, he would quit. His two
years as a drill sergeant were up in April. His wife was already
typing out his application to the Secret Service. He toyed with the
idea of running an ROTC program at a black college somewhere and
taking courses at the same time. He even considered volunteering to
serve a year in Korea, figuring that if he put in 12 months there,
he had a chance for an ROTC slot when he rotated back to the
States.
</P>
<P>
   But Korea is considered a war zone, meaning soldiers cannot take
their families with them, and his wife made it clear that she would
not stand for that. ``It would not be good for my kids not to see
their father for a year, especially my son,'' she said. ``So that's
not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   TINKERER FROM SHEBOYGAN
</P>
<P>
   Feyer liked to show off Bravo's cavernous classroom. He had
spent hours refurbishing it, pasting blue sisal halfway up the
white walls to relieve the drabness and deaden the echoes. He had
even designed the floor, using royal blue tiles against white to
make a large ``146,'' Bravo's battalion and brigade.
</P>
<P>
   It was his kind of work. ``I've always loved working with my
hands,'' he said. ``I guess I got that from my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Gerrit, was a Dutch immigrant, a wood carver who
helped make molds for machine parts. Harry was the youngest of
seven children whom Gerrit and Cornelia Feyer reared in Sheboygan,
a manufacturing town on Lake Michigan north of Milwaukee and south
of Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Feyers had moved there for the work and for their faith.
Sheboygan offered a school run by the Christian Reformed Church, an
offshoot of the Dutch Reformed Church, and the Feyers wanted their
children educated in the Reformed tradition. Sheboygan was a safe
setting in which to raise children, but it was isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he was going to a Christian school and hung around
with Dutch people, he was kind of sheltered,'' his father said.
</P>
<P>
   There were hardly any blacks in Sheboygan. A local joke has it
that if you see a black man on the street, he must play for the
Packers. Feyer remembers knowing one black family. The father was a
police officer, the son a thief.
</P>
<P>
   While Earnest Williams was a football hero in high school, Harry
Feyer faded into the crowd at his school. He didn't play sports, he
didn't participate in extracurricular activities, he didn't do well
in his studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was kind of a laid-back kid, not a natural leader,''
recalled Art DeJong, his high school English teacher. ``I wouldn't
say Harry was the most highly disciplined guy I've ever met. He was
friendly and likable, the type of kid who sometimes gets lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Where he usually got lost was under the hood of a car. He would
spend hours in a neighbor's garage, breaking down and rebuilding
engines. Mechanical tasks absorbed him, just as they would in the
Army, to the point where they distracted from what else was going
on in his life.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing school, he married his high school sweetheart,
Laurel Cluk, a strong-willed, outspoken woman. He got a job in a
plant that made wall paneling and shortly concluded that it was a
dead end. That was when he decided to enlist.
</P>
<P>
   In the Army he gained recognition as a first-rate mechanic and
was given the job maintaining Cobras. He wound up doing little more
than that; it took him almost eight years to become a sergeant. In
part he blames a supervisor, in part himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1991, and the Army was phasing out the Cobra, so
promotions for people who worked on it were becoming rare. He was
supposed to be notified of a special program permitting Cobra
mechanics to switch to other specialties. But he was a good
mechanic and his supervisor didn't want to lose him, so, Feyer
said, the supervisor hid the notification papers.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer learned of the ruse the next year, but by then it was too
late for the retraining. ``I should have gone straight to the IG,
the inspector general, and say this guy just screwed me,'' he said.
But the supervisor ``was somewhat of a friend of mine,'' he said,
``and I didn't want to get him in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He does say something when his assertiveness is questioned,
however. He'll smile, bob his head and, like some goofy cartoon
character, sing, ``Doh-dee-doh-dee-doh.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of passivity drives his wife crazy. At dinner one
night at home, he was complaining about being cheated out of the
top drill sergeant award that had gone to Reed. Without missing a
beat he began describing the work he was going to do during the
break between cycles to improve the company's classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But why put yourself to all that trouble after what has
happened? he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's stupid,'' Laurel Feyer interjected.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer smiled sheepishly. ``Doh-dee-doh-dee-doh,'' he sang.
</P>
<P>
   PROMOTION BLUES  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The promotion board was meeting during the summer and Feyer was
eager for a shot at platoon sergeant. But he wondered what chance
he had when all the platoon sergeant slots in Bravo Company were
held by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer had been in an almost identical situation in South Korea.
There a white sergeant, a talented helicopter mechanic, was
bypassed for platoon sergeant because all the platoon sergeants
were black and a black first sergeant looked out for them. Or so
most people, especially whites, suspected. As far as Feyer knew, no
one bothered to find out the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Now he saw history repeating itself. ``I hated thinking like
that,'' he said. ``But I just didn't want to get screwed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not again. Besides, he saw himself as a new man now.
</P>
<P>
   His transformation began, he said, the day in 1994 when the Army
told him that it was kicking him out. It had been three years since
his supervisor had sandbagged him into remaining a Cobra mechanic,
and he had still not made sergeant. The Army was pruning itself of
dead wood, and he, stuck at corporal, was on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Feyer was pregnant at the time, and the couple had a
5-year-old son; they needed the Army's medical benefits. One night
Feyer lay awake, his chest so constricted he could hardly breathe.
``I was really scared,'' he said. ``I didn't know what I was going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear galvanized him. He pleaded with the Army not to discharge
him and volunteered to work in nuclear, biological and chemical
warfare. Not many soldiers choose that specialty. Most are scared
off by it, imagining themselves in stifling chemical-warfare suits,
never mind the poisons. But promotion possibilities there are wide
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it because I didn't want to throw away eight years of
being in the Army,'' Feyer said.
</P>
<P>
   He made sergeant a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion brought another surprise. Attending mandatory
classes for noncommissioned officers, he graduated with honors.
Buoyed by his success, he signed up for courses at a community
college in Colorado Springs, where the family was living. He got
A's, B's and an associate's degree. He was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I went all through high school thinking I'm a failure, that
I'm nothing but a D-minus student,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In short order he became staff sergeant, then drill sergeant,
finishing near the top of his class. Now, at Fort Knox, he had a
chance for platoon sergeant, and he wasn't going to be denied by a
group of blacks just because he wasn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   He talked over the situation with the company's executive
officer, Lt. Paul Bergson, a chubby, college-educated white officer
with a mordant sense of humor. Bergson warned him that before
raising a stink, he should determine whether the blacks promoted to
platoon sergeant had more seniority. He checked, and they had.
</P>
<P>
   But the black sergeants got wind that whites were questioning
the platoon leadership's racial makeup and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never want to see a black man get ahead,'' Reed said as
he sat with a group of black sergeants in the mess hall one night.
Williams agreed. As soon as whites feel even a little threatened,
he said, ``they all stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   A TRUCE, OR MAYBE NOT
</P>
<P>
   By the autumn of last year Williams and Feyer had reached a kind
of accommodation. It may have had something to do with Williams'
promotion; in September he received word that, on his fifth try, he
was being made sergeant first class. The pressure, for the moment,
was off. His wife could put away the application for the Secret
Service.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before the fall graduation, Feyer gingerly approached
Williams and mentioned that his parents would be visiting from
Sheboygan and that they had never seen their son at work. Williams
picked up on the hint and gave Feyer his place at the ceremony
marching in front of 4th Platoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff don't mean nothing to me, anyway,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Feyer began trying to work more effectively with
Williams. He tried to anticipate what was be wanted of him. He felt
Williams tried to talk with him more. ``We're clicking now,'' he
said. ``We don't even have to say anything. We each know what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a different view: his partner still wasn't pulling
his weight. ``He wants his own platoon,'' Williams said. ``I feel
he should get it and then fall on his face. The reason he doesn't
fall on his face now is because I don't let him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams soon had something else on his mind. Near the end
of the fall cycle, he was told that he was being transferred to
Echo Company, across the parade ground.
</P>
<P>
   The orders outraged him. He had achieved a position of power in
Bravo Company. The transfer would mean he would have to start over
again. And it messed up his plans. Bravo was not participating in
basic training for the January cycle, meaning that its drill
sergeants would essentially have nine weeks off. Williams had
enrolled in a college course for the break. Now he would have to
withdraw and work another basic training cycle with Echo.
</P>
<P>
   Why the transfer? Williams saw the reason, again, as racial. To
him and his black colleagues, the battalion's white hierarchy could
not tolerate one of its four companies' being run by black
sergeants. One had to go.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and the other black sergeants say they had a
premonition of this during a change-in-command ceremony in
November, when the company commander was replaced. As the battalion
commander and the battalion command sergeant major looked out on
the parade ground and saw a black sergeant standing in front of
each platoon and a black first sergeant in front of the entire
company, you could see the shock in the officers' eyes, the
sergeants said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Col. Mark Armstrong, the battalion commander, and
Sgt. Maj. Franklin Ashe. They had barely taken notice of the
company's racial makeup, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This blows me away that they would have these perceptions,
because the thought never crossed my mind,'' Ashe said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the December graduation, Feyer and Williams sat
brooding in their office along with Sgt. 1st Class Mike Martin, the
replacement, who is white. Williams was angry about his impending
transfer. Feyer was still upset about having been denied the drill
sergeant's award. He was speculating about who may or may not have
voted for him. Williams, who had voted against his partner, sat in
silence.
</P>
<P>
   `IT'S TOO LATE'
</P>
<P>
   The winter graduation, minus Feyer, was over. Friends and
relatives were mingling in the barracks, congratulating the
recruits. Several parents dropped by Williams' office to shake his
hand for molding their sons into soldiers. But as the minutes
ticked by, Williams grew impatient. He wanted to hurry up and move
his things into Echo. He was supposed to meet Boler and Reed for
beers. Feyer was going golfing with Hanson.
</P>
<P>
   Walking out of his office, Williams mentioned an an overture he
had received that morning. ``Harry said to me at breakfast: `You
live only 200 yards away, and you've never been over my house and
I've never been over your house. Why don't we try to get
together?'''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would consider it. ``But I kind of feel like, what's
the point? It's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, Let's patch things up. But there's really nothing
to patch up.''
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted a number of privates to help him take his gear over
to Echo. They loaded up a truck, drove it across the parade ground
and lugged the stuff up two flights of stairs. Williams hung his
fatigues in a locker and tossed some equipment onto an unmade bunk.
</P>
<P>
   From down the hall he could hear music drifting out of the
office he would share with his new partner. It was gospel music,
the sound of a choir. Williams didn't care for gospel; he was a
rhythm-and-blues man. But it didn't seem to bother him. He had met
his new battle buddy, Mordecial Hale, who is 35, 6 feet 5 and
black.
</P>
<P>
   So will it be better, Williams was asked, having a brother as a
partner?
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt,'' he replied. ``Without a doubt.''

   FORT KNOX, Ky. _ Staff Sgt. Harry Feyer was parking cars and
looking glum when the four platoons of Bravo Company, including his
own, came marching toward him up a long grassy hill on their way to
the winter graduation.
</P>
<P>
   They stepped smartly, 214 strong, their brass buttons gleaming
on dress greens, their black patent leather shoes buffed to a high
sheen. They displayed all the discipline and dash that Feyer, a
leader of 4th Platoon, had helped pound into them in nine weeks of
basic training.
</P>
<P>
   Striding beside them were his fellow drill sergeants, shoulders
back, chests out, their full-dress uniforms a deep green backdrop
for clusters of glinting medals and rainbows of ribbons, their
brown Smokey Bear hats cocked aggressively low on their foreheads.
Feyer, 6 feet tall and lanky, might have been among them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he stood apart in his mottled fatigues and dusty combat
boots, directing traffic outside the dingy yellow gymnasium where
the ceremony was to be held. It was a duty he had volunteered for.
It was his one-man protest.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer was angry that he had been denied an award given to the
top-performing drill sergeant at the end of each basic-training
cycle, an award he felt he deserved. But in the pressure cooker
that is the U.S. Army, winning even a small award could help make
the difference between promotion and stagnation, between a better
life for his family and just scraping by.
</P>
<P>
   And he believed knew why he had lost out: because he is white.
No white drill sergeant had won the award since the company was
founded in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That Feyer had lost out this time came as no surprise in Bravo
Company, particularly to the white sergeants. Everyone knew that in
Bravo, a clique of black sergeants ran things.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer said he didn't like to think that way. People make too
much of race, he said. But there were times when it did matter to
him. ``When it's a matter of something that I deserve because of my
position,'' he said, ``if I outrank a person and he gets a job
because of his color, then there's something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As Feyer stewed in the parking lot, Staff Sgt. Earnest Williams
stood erect in front of 4th Platoon, his square, muscled frame
pushing at the seams of his uniform. Williams was part of that
black coterie that ran the company so smoothly. The white sergeants
might grumble, but they acknowledged that the blacks got things
done.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Williams was not feeling particularly powerful this morning.
This was his last day with the company. He was being transferred to
another unit, away from his buddies, away from his position of
influence.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed unfair to him. But his superiors _ his white superiors
_ had said that there were too many drill sergeants in Bravo
Company, and not enough in others. He did not believe them. He was
convinced that he was being shipped out because he is black. As far
as he could see, the powers that be didn't like it when the
brothers were in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it for a little while,'' said one of his black
compatriots. ``But then they said, `Oh no, we can't let this be.'''
</P>
<P>
   So on a chill December morning, two soldiers _ one black, one
white, both part of an institution that has been portrayed as a
model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in the middle of
this sprawling base, each believing himself the victim of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Just then a gray Honda Accord glided into a parking space and
out popped Sgt. 1st Class Henry Reed, resplendent in his dress
greens. ``Good morning!'' he bellowed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was going to receive the award that Feyer saw as rightfully
his; Reed would get the glory even though it had been Feyer who had
worked the late nights, who had pitched in to help other platoons
when they were short-handed, who had made sure the washers and
dryers got fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was limited by a back injury suffered in a car crash, and
it had not escaped Feyer's notice that Reed had skipped the long
days on the rifle range, that he hadn't humped a 40-pound rucksack
up and down steep, chest-busting hills on 15-kilometer marches.
</P>
<P>
   Reed was also nearing retirement; at 39 he was the oldest drill
sergeant in the company. This was probably his last chance to win
the company's drill-sergeant award. So his fellow black sergeants
had decided to select him, they said, on the basis of what he had
done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Feyer had another reason to fume. Reed had parked his
car off by itself, leaving a gap in the row of vehicles that Feyer
_ who finds satisfaction in rote tasks _ had meticulously arranged.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ruined my parking,'' Feyer said. ``Not only did he screw me
out of my award, but he ruined my parking.''
</P>
<P>
   IDEAL? GET REAL
</P>
<P>
   The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment anymore.
Integrated since 1948, it is now marbled with blacks, Hispanics and
other minority members of all ranks. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and to hear the military brass tell it, no one gives it a
second thought.
</P>
<P>
   But that is an idealized image. The Pentagon itself discovered
as much last year, when it found that two-thirds of the men and
women in the armed forces had experienced a racially offensive
encounter in the previous 12 months. Those findings more or less
mirrored the view from Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry
in the summer and fall of last year. Racial tensions abounded, but
seldom were they out in the open. Even less often did they rise to
high drama. Race-related fights were rare; the angry spitting out
of a slur was uncommon.

 FORT KNOX, Ky.: was uncommon.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 16 sergeants in Bravo Company appeared to get along, too,
eating together in the mess hall, joshing one another about
cultural differences in food, music and sports. In part, they were
helping to fulfill the Army's goal of not so much changing racial
attitudes as altering behavior; to some extent, they were carrying
out orders _ to treat one another with respect regardless of race.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, at least, Williams and Feyer seemed good
candidates for getting beyond race. Both were 34 years old and
married. Their children are of similar ages. Both men had been in
the Army 12 years and had been on drill-sergeant duty since the
company was formed. Both had had spotty academic records and both
had been worrying about their careers.
</P>
<P>
   They were also partners _ ``battle buddies,'' in military
parlance _ in running 4th Platoon, though Williams, as platoon
sergeant, was technically Feyer's supervisor. Their metal desks sat
three feet apart. They even lived on the same street, less than 200
yards from each other.
</P>
<P>
   But neither had ever set foot in the other's house. Williams had
a simple explanation: ``We don't have anything in common. We're
just different.''
</P>
<P>
   They were certainly different in background. Earnest Williams
had grown up poor in a fatherless household in Waco, Texas. Harry
Feyer (pronounced Fire) had led a sheltered, stable life in tidy,
middle-class, lily-white Sheboygan, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   They had also come to be drill sergeants by very different
military paths. Feyer had started as a helicopter mechanic.
Williams was pure infantryman.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, Williams was far more comfortable with the racial
structure of Bravo Company. Though a white captain and white
lieutenant oversaw the unit, the four black drill sergeants were
unofficially in charge. Alongside Williams, Staff Sgt. Otis Thomas
ran the 3rd Platoon, Reed the 2nd and Staff Sgt. Robert Boler the
1st.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was 1st Sgt. Anthony Boles, a black man who was in
charge of day-to-day matters for the entire company. The four black
sergeants held great sway with him _ or so it appeared to some
white and Hispanic drill sergeants.
</P>
<P>
   Boles scoffed at the notion that he played favorites. But he and
the other black sergeants, including Williams, acknowledged that
having a company in which African-Americans were in control was a
source of racial pride. They considered it unusual, and they feared
it would not last.
</P>
<P>
   TO CLIMB, COMPETE
</P>
<P>
   Race wasn't the whole story in Bravo Company. Career and
financial pressures exist in Army life with or without racial
tensions. When race does come into play, though, it only aggravates
the stress.
</P>
<P>
   Any award, any citation, goes into a soldier's personnel file
and can help lift him or her to the next rank. Promotions are
everything. The raises they bring may be small, but they are the
only means of easing the financial strain.
</P>
<P>
   Like other sergeants, Harry Feyer and Earnest Williams each made
about $2,000 a month before taxes. With that they had to buy their
own uniforms, knapsacks, sleeping bags, helmets and even the
stripes they sewed on their sleeves. Meals in the company mess hall
were charged to them. Housing is free if soldiers live on the post.
But that means families must make do with cramped row houses.
</P>
<P>
   In such an environment there can be gnawing suspicions about why
you're not moving up, or not moving up faster. Maybe it's your
shortcomings. Maybe someone is holding you back. Or maybe you're
not getting ahead because of your race.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to tell in the cases of Williams and Feyer. Williams
confided that he thought little of Feyer as a soldier and even less
of him as a leader. He felt his colleague let too many things fall
through the cracks and didn't push the privates enough.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer wondered aloud why his partner didn't share more
responsibility with him, why he didn't trust him more. Why was it
that Williams tended to confer with Reed, Thomas and Boler on
matters involving 4th Platoon?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm his battle buddy,'' Feyer said. ``I feel he should be
discussing things with me.''
</P>
<P>
   STEAMROLLER FROM WACO
</P>
<P>
   On a bright summer afternoon Williams was marching 4th Platoon
along one of Fort Knox's wooded back roads. Each drill sergeant has
his favorite cadence _ the rhythmic call-and-response chant used to
keep the privates in step. Williams was calling out one of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a steamroller, baby,'' he sang in a strong tenor, ``and
I'm rolling all over you.''
</P>
<P>
   The words fit well, physically and temperamentally. At 5 feet 10
inches and 210 pounds, Williams was a model of muscle and power.
</P>
<P>
   Williams learned the necessity of toughness long before he got
to Bravo. He grew up in the central Texas flatlands, bouncing among
housing projects and running through the weeds around shacks in a
neighborhood of drugs and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Earnest Williams was the sixth of 14 children born to Shirley
Ann Hunter. Abandoned by her first and second husbands, she had
little choice other than welfare. Clothes came from the Salvation
Army. The family was constantly being evicted for failure to pay
the rent.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest brother, Greg, became a crack addict, and a younger
brother, James, was killed during a drug deal. But Earnest stayed
out of trouble, channeling into sports the determination his mother
had taught him.
</P>
<P>
   But he was never much of a student. ``I went all the way through
high school and I don't think I cracked a book once,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After enlisting he was steered into the infantry, and with his
physical abilities he found it easy. ``I felt like I'm at home
here,'' he said. He was considered a first-rate infantryman. During
the Persian Gulf War, he once walked point for an entire battalion
of the 82nd Airborne Division.
</P>
<P>
   But he never gave much thought to where his career was going. He
dutifully took the elite infantry jobs that his superiors
recommended _ paratrooper, Ranger _ and succeeded at whatever was
asked of him, to the extent that he got his sergeant's stripes. He
was a natural leader as a drill sergeant, fast-talking,
quick-moving and impatient with those who were not.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his career hit a wall after the Gulf War. He was promoted to
staff sergeant in 1992. Seven years later, he had yet to make it to
the next level, sergeant first class. He had been rejected for
promotions four times.

 &HT;    HOLLYWOOD MOVIE TO GET FIRST ALL-DIGITAL SCREENING
 &HT;    Moving in the (f) financial and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The new Hollywood movie ``Titan A.E.'' is being
beamed to Atlanta on Tuesday over the Internet _ an event being
likened to first telegram, sent from Washington to Baltimore in
1844.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an absolute first,'' said Larry Lang, vice president of
service provider marketing at Cisco Systems, which is supplying the
digital plumbing for the historic four-hour Internet transfer of
the 42-gigabyte file.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that when people publish the milestones of digital
cinema, that one of those milestones definitely will be in Atlanta
tomorrow as the first movie ever delivered down the network to a
theater,'' Lang said Monday in a telephone interview from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   With its hundreds of billions of digital ``bits'' of data, Titan
A.E. (as in, ``After Earth'') overwhelms ``What hath God wrought,''
the message contained in Samuel Morse's inaugural telegram.
</P>
<P>
   The film will stream across a secure private network from 20th
Century Fox studios in Hollywood to the Woodruff Arts Center. It
will travel by way of a Cisco-equipped Qwest Communications data
center in Burbank, Calif., and a comparable BellSouth site in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The animated film features the voices of Matt Damon, Drew
Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Janeane Garofalo, Nathan Lane, and John
Leguizamo.
</P>
<P>
   It is due to open in theaters nationwide June 16 after its
premiere at the Woodruff Center to a Supercomm 2000 trade show
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Lang said only about 25 U.S. theaters, out of some 38,000
domestic movie screens, currently have the equipment needed for a
full digital-to-digital movie transfer. ``But the number,'' he
added, ``will rise quite rapidly after some thorny economic issues
are finally resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie house owners have been hesitant to pay costs of about
$100,000 per projector, when most of the initial savings will go to
the Hollywood studios, which will be freed from the burden of
making thousands of film prints and shipping them around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Lang said, however, that ``it would quite a while'' before such
Internet downloads can enter home theater market. Few homes, he
noted, are equipped with the necessary fiber optic cables.
Moreover, he noted, the projection equipment, even in a more
simplified form, is still too costly for all but the richest
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate security formula adopted by Cisco, which includes
coding of the film's data, multiple protective ``firewalls'' and
secure routers, is aimed at reducing widespread fears in Hollywood
that films will become subject to the same sort of piracy concerns
that have recently plagued the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle, we're doing more or less the same thing as what
happens whenever people deal with their bank or broker through
their Internet browser,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Digital projectors have been used in the last year to exhibit a
few films, such as Disney's ``Dinosaur,'' in a few theaters around
the country. Video images also regularly stream across the
Internet, but often with poor quality and in postage-stamp size.

</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Ruth, a Puerto Rican, suspected that his
academic deficiencies were behind his stagnation. He had never
taken any college courses in the Army, even though he had had the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But as they watched other sergeants move up _ mainly white ones,
whose credentials were no better than his _ the Williamses also
began to suspect race. ``It makes you wonder,'' Ruth Williams said.
``Is he being passed over because he's a black male?''
</P>
<P>
   TINKERER FROM SHEBOYGAN
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved working with my hands,'' Feyer said. ``I
guess I got that from my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Gerrit, was a Dutch immigrant, a wood carver who
helped make molds for machine parts. Harry was the youngest of
seven children whom Gerrit and Cornelia Feyer reared in Sheboygan.
</P>
<P>
   The Feyers had moved there for the work and for their faith.
Sheboygan offered a school run by the Christian Reformed Church, an
offshoot of the Dutch Reformed Church, and the Feyers wanted their
children educated in the Reformed tradition. Sheboygan was a safe
setting in which to raise children, but it was isolated.
</P>
<P>
   There were few blacks in Sheboygan. A local joke has it that if
you see a black man on the street, he must play for the Green Bay
Packers. Feyer remembers knowing one black family. The father was a
police officer, the son a thief.
</P>
<P>
   While Earnest Williams was a football hero in high school, Harry
Feyer faded into the crowd at his school. He didn't play sports, he
didn't participate in extracurricular activities, he didn't do well
in his studies.
</P>
<P>
   Where he usually got lost was under the hood of a car. He would
spend hours in a neighbor's garage, breaking down and rebuilding
engines. Mechanical tasks absorbed him, just as they would in the
Army, to the point where they distracted from what else was going
on in his life.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing school, he married his high school sweetheart,
Laurel Cluk. He got a job in a wall-paneling factory but soon
concluded that it was a dead end. He decided to enlist.
</P>
<P>
   In the Army he gained recognition as a first-rate mechanic and
was given the job maintaining Cobra helicopters. He wound up doing
little more than that; it took him almost eight years to become a
sergeant. In part he blames a supervisor, in part himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1991, and the Army was phasing out the Cobra, so
promotions for people who worked on it were becoming rare. He was
supposed to be notified of a special program permitting Cobra
mechanics to switch to other specialties. But he was a good
mechanic and his supervisor didn't want to lose him, so, Feyer
said, the supervisor hid the notification papers.
</P>
<P>
   PROMOTION BLUES
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1994, the Army told Feyer that it was kicking him
out. It had been three years since his supervisor had sandbagged
him into remaining a Cobra mechanic, and he had still not made
sergeant. The Army was pruning itself of dead wood, and he, stuck
at corporal, was on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Laurel Feyer was pregnant at the time, and the couple had a
5-year-old son; they needed the Army's medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Fear galvanized him. He pleaded with the Army not to discharge
him, so he volunteered to work in nuclear, biological and chemical
warfare. Few soldiers choose that specialty. Most are scared off by
it, imagining themselves in stifling chemical-warfare suits, never
mind the poisons. But promotion possibilities there are wide open.
</P>
<P>
   He made sergeant a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion brought another surprise. Attending mandatory
classes for noncommissioned officers, he graduated with honors.
Buoyed by his success, he then earned an associate's degree at a
community college in Colorado Springs, where the family was living.
In short order he became staff sergeant, then drill sergeant,
finishing near the top of his class. Now, at Fort Knox, he had a
chance for platoon sergeant, and he wasn't going to be denied by a
group of blacks just because he wasn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The company's executive officer, Lt. Paul Bergson, a white,
advised Feyer that before raising a stink, he should determine
whether the blacks promoted to platoon sergeant had more seniority.
He checked, and they had.
</P>
<P>
   But the black sergeants got wind that whites were questioning
the platoon leadership's racial makeup and resented it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never want to see a black man get ahead,'' Reed said.
Williams agreed. As soon as whites feel even a little threatened,
he said, ``they all stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   A TRUCE, OR MAYBE NOT
</P>
<P>
   By autumn 1999 Williams and Feyer had reached a kind of
accommodation. It may have had something to do with Williams'
promotion; in September he received word that, on his fifth try, he
was being made sergeant first class.
</P>
<P>
   Feyer began trying to work more effectively with Williams. He
tried to anticipate what was be wanted of him. He felt Williams
tried to talk with him more. ``We're clicking now,'' he said. ``We
don't even have to say anything. We each know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a different view: his partner still wasn't pulling
his weight. ``He wants his own platoon,'' Williams said. ``I feel
he should get it and then fall on his face. The reason he doesn't
fall on his face now is because I don't let him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams soon had something else on his mind. Near the end
of the fall cycle, he was told that he was being transferred to
Echo Company, across the parade ground.
</P>
<P>
   The orders outraged him. He had achieved a position of power in
Bravo Company. The transfer would mean he would have to start over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Why the transfer? Williams saw the reason as racial: the
battalion's white hierarchy could not tolerate one of its four
companies' being run by black sergeants. One had to go.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the December graduation, Feyer and Williams sat
brooding in their office. Williams was angry about his impending
transfer. Feyer was still upset about having been denied the drill
sergeant's award. He was speculating about who may or may not have
voted for him. Williams, who had voted against his partner, sat in
silence.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the graduation ceremony, Williams moved his
gear over to Echo. He had met his new battle buddy, Mordecial Hale,
who is black. Williams was asked whether it would be better having
a brother as a partner. ``Without a doubt,'' he replied.

lying in a street this weekend, it reinforced our First Amendment
rights to freedom of expression. It also encouraged a trend toward
nudity, particularly female toplessness. British matrons posed nude
for a best-selling calendar. A female Ohio rugby team took off the
bras for a bare-breasted photo shoot. Women have sued for the right
to go topless in public places. Is this good fun or an alarming
decline in moral standards? By MARIANNE MEANS.

   ``It's an absolute first,'' said Larry Lang, vice president of
service provider marketing at Cisco Systems, which is supplying the
digital plumbing for the historic four-hour Internet transfer of
the 42-gigabyte file.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that when people publish the milestones of digital
cinema, that one of those milestones definitely will be in Atlanta
tomorrow as the first movie ever delivered down the network to a
theater,'' Lang said Monday in a telephone interview from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   With its hundreds of billions of digital ``bits'' of data, Titan
A.E. (as in, ``After Earth'') overwhelms ``What hath God wrought,''
the message contained in Samuel Morse's inaugural telegram.
</P>
<P>
   The film will stream across a secure private network from 20th
Century Fox studios in Hollywood to the Woodruff Arts Center. It
will travel by way of a Cisco-equipped Qwest Communications data
center in Burbank, Calif., and a comparable BellSouth site in
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The animated film features the voices of Matt Damon, Drew
Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Janeane Garofalo, Nathan Lane, and John
Leguizamo.
</P>
<P>
   It is due to open in theaters nationwide June 16 after its
premiere at the Woodruff Center to a Supercomm 2000 trade show
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Lang said only about 25 U.S. theaters, out of some 38,000
domestic movie screens, currently have the equipment needed for a
full digital-to-digital movie transfer. ``But the number,'' he
added, ``will rise quite rapidly after some thorny economic issues
are finally resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Movie house owners have been hesitant to pay costs of about
$100,000 per projector, when most of the initial savings will go to
the Hollywood studios, which will be freed from the burden of
making thousands of film prints and shipping them around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Lang said, however, that ``it would quite a while'' before such
Internet downloads can enter home theater market. Few homes, he
noted, are equipped with the necessary fiber optic cables.
Moreover, he noted, the projection equipment, even in a more
simplified form, is still too costly for all but the richest
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The elaborate security formula adopted by Cisco, which includes
coding of the film's data, multiple protective ``firewalls'' and
secure routers, is aimed at reducing widespread fears in Hollywood
that films will become subject to the same sort of piracy concerns
that have recently plagued the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle, we're doing more or less the same thing as what
happens whenever people deal with their bank or broker through
their Internet browser,'' Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Digital projectors have been used in the last year to exhibit a
few films, such as Disney's ``Dinosaur,'' in a few theaters around
the country. Video images also regularly stream across the
Internet, but often with poor quality and in postage-stamp size.

 UNDATED: accurate, authentic. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. After Diana's death, many commentators began looking at her
life as a feminist parable. Did you?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Do I think the transformation of a socially privileged but
emotionally neglected child to a fairy tale princess, to a woman
with a problematic marriage who turns around a sense of
victimization to become a real activist in the world and fighter
for people's rights as a feminist parable? Sure!
</P>
<P>
   But is that the story of Diana? That's one story of Diana, isn't
it?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you implying more to Diana's story than has been told?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think of hers as the story of someone who was vulnerable.
And if that can be elevated into part of the feminist parable _
that one has both strengths and vulnerabilities _ I think that
would be a welcome development to our thinking about women.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your highly influential 1978 book, ``Fat Is a Feminist
Issue,'' posited the idea that some women had eating disorders
because they had been under nurtured by their mothers. Do you still
believe that?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If I were writing that book today, I wouldn't write it in the
same way. But I think that there still is a way in which certain
aspects of female development are seriously unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   I think today women are told that they can conquer the world,
but I don't think they are given the emotional equipment to feel
safe inside themselves. And food is the first relationship. If we
look at mothers' feeding of children, well, the situation is
profoundly worse than it was in the 1970s. We now have two
generations of women who ave been under tremendous assault about:
``You can go out there and be in the world, but don't forget to
look gorgeous and slim. And don't forget, you should eat this and
not that and you should go to the gym.'' As people felt less
effective collectively, politically, we've been offered our bodies
as the site of change.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So the prevailing idea, in your view, now is, You can't
change the world, but you can sculpt your body?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think that's explicit in people's minds. But I do
think that people, in the face of feeling unhappy about their
capacity to be effective, have found an area where they can feel
they are. I think you can see progress in Western countries in
terms of, certainly, certain classes of women's aspirations having
been struggled with. It's sort of like there's been a very
interesting price, which is an intensification in the breeding of
the bodily insecurity of women.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Back to Diana. How did you personally deal with her death?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not really sure I can answer that. I mean, it's shocking
when somebody you know and who is in the public eye has died.
Mainly, I spent the day warding off journalists.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the harassment from the press directed at you help you
identify with Diana?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I have never admitted that Diana was my patient, even though
it's in the public record. It is not something a therapist can say.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when your house is surrounded and you have a clinical
practice to deal with, the other people you are seeing have a lot
to deal with they didn't bargain for. They are being invaded
themselves. I mean, finding pictures of us in the newspapers on a
daily basis. It was not nice.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In closing, your new book consists of eight composite case
histories of psychoanalytic patients. Many therapists, including
Sigmund Freud, wrote in the form of case histories. Why should
readers believe veracity of a form that hovers somewhere between
fiction and nonfiction?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My book is about emotional truth. Why should you believe me?
You don't have to. The question is, Is there anything there of use
to you? Any time a therapist tells a story, they are being so
selective. They are privileging one bit of information over
another. In the end, it isn't really the patient's story anyway.
It's the story the therapist makes of the patient's.
</P>
<P>
   With the book, I was trying to say, ``This is the therapist's
experience.'' If you look from the point of view of the therapist _
the scholarship, the learning, the knowledge, this heart _ what
I've written has a certain truth.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Susie Orbach _ the therapist who treated Diana, Princess of
Wales, for her eating disorders; the founder of the Women's Therapy
Center of London; a former columnist for The Guardian; a visiting
professor at the London School of Economics; and the author of 1978
best-seller ``Fat is a Feminist Issue'' _ is, aside from Sigmund
Freud, probably the most famous psychotherapist to have ever set up
couch in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to New York, Orbach, 53, talked about her
eighth book, ``The Impossibility of Sex: Stories of the Intimate
Relationship Between Therapist and Patient'' (Scribner).
</P>
<P>
   Q. In ``The Impossibility of Sex,'' you own up to a great
emotional involvement with your patients. Is this usual within your
profession?  &QR;
</P>
<P>
   A. Entirely usual. But analysts have a lot of different methods
for dealing with it. Depending on their school, they'll say, ``this
is about my personal engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``this is what is done to me by the patient and it has
nothing to do with me.'' Or, ``this patient is disturbing me, I'll
have to send him to another therapist.'' At the end of the day,
though, we know there are no human relationships where we do not
disturb one another. And that's true of the analytic relationship,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the book, you admit to feeling sexually stimulated by a
patient named Adam, who kept trying to seduce you. Are you telling
secrets out of school?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think there's any shame about that. The point is, How
does one respond to the various emotional invitations of one's
patients? Every person has an idiom. Some patients invite me in
with their intellect. This particular man was a compulsive
fornicator and he had no other way to maintain a relationship
unless he was involved in seduction. To get into his heart and
head, a piece of me had to surrender to that seduction to
understand what that was about for him and to understand how
incredibly painful, barren and problematic it was.
</P>
<P>
   Q. One gets the feeling you see psychoanalyst and patient as a
kind of emotional couple.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I see patient and therapist working together, creating a
relationship in which you are lifting the impediments to intimacy.
And you're often doing that within the relationship you have
together. So in that sense you are a couple. But it's a very
specialized type of couple _ just like therapy is a very
specialized type of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The princess of Wales went to you for several years, did she
not?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I really don't know what I can say ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. When Diana gave her famous 1995 televised interview where she
confessed to infidelity, eating disorders and the fact that there
were ``three people'' in her marriage, she was accused by several
writers of talking ``psychobabble.'' How did you feel about that
sort of critique?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You know, at the time, I was accused of being the
scriptwriter, the person who put these words in her mouth. I found
the accusation extraordinary. It's such a complete misunderstanding
of the therapeutic process, as though therapists were Svengalis.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, We don't have an easy language for emotional life.
That's why we have writers. They are able to find a way to say
things with subtlety. So when a phrase rings true to somebody and
then gets repeated, it becomes, all of a sudden, psychobabble. I
think the problem with describing emotional life is that we have to
stretch ourselves to find the words to say something that is
refreshing, accurate, authentic.  &QL;

GOVERNMENT URGES JUDGE TO DENY MICROSOFT'S REQUEST FOR MORE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Department of Justice urged a federal judge Monday to reject
a request by Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq) for more time to plan how it
would comply with an expected order to break up the software
company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors submitted the third draft of their proposed breakup,
incorporating a few of Microsoft's numerous suggestions. They
agreed to several minor and cosmetic changes, but argued against
the company's most significant protest, a request for 12 months to
come up with a divestiture plan instead of the four months the
Justice Department had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no justification for the proposed extension of time
in which Microsoft is to file a report on the steps it has taken to
comply,'' prosecutors wrote in their response to Microsoft's
comments on their revised proposal. ``Microsoft's request confuses
the actual planning and implementation of the divestiture with the
requirement of this provision, which is simply to report to the
Court.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond, Wash.-based company has until noon EDT Wednesday to
respond in writing ``if it so chooses,'' according to a court
order. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson , who is overseeing the case,
is expected shortly thereafter to order the company split into two
parts.
</P>
<P>
   But the company immediately criticized the latest revisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's latest effort, the version 3.0 of its plan,
would still damage consumers in the high-tech industry, and even
the slightest cosmetic changes do not change the fact that their
plan remains excessive, unprecedented and harmful to consumers,''
said Jim Cullinan, a spokesman for Microsoft. He added that the
company had not been given a fair chance to argue against the
proposed remedies and that prosecutors had not presented sufficient
evidence to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly no testimony or evidence to support the
assertions made by their declarations,'' Cullinan said.
</P>
<P>
   A two-way split, the crux of the government proposal, would
place the ubiquitous Windows operating system in one company and
create a second business for everything else, including software
applications, the Internet Explorer Web browser and the Microsoft
Network Internet service provider and network of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   A final ruling seems imminent this week, though it was widely
expected last week as well, before the company surprised the court
with a long list of proposed changes. Microsoft has said repeatedly
that it will appeal all aspects of the ruling, from the findings of
fact to the remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jackson ordered this additional round of briefs in the
case on Thursday, one day after Microsoft, in what was to have been
the final brief in the case, called the prosecutors' proposal
vague, defective and unlikely to withstand appeal. The company,
which had been given an opportunity to comment on the form of the
proposal, instead made those comments on its substance. It also
offered new witnesses from an array of business sectors to testify
that a breakup would harm the economy and said it would need 12
months to devise a breakup plan, not the four months prosecutors
had offered.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Wednesday , Microsoft argued that ``the timetable
proposed for the divestiture is unrealistic.'' It said that federal
regulators, both foreign and domestic and including the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, would examine a breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, Jackson abruptly closed the proceedings in the case,
refusing Microsoft's repeated requests for more time. The company's
lawyers filed an offer of proof just before Judge Jackson ended the
hearing, which also included a list of such new potential witnesses
as William H. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, and Steve Ballmer, the
company's chief executive, and described the testimony they could
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jackson has ruled that Microsoft employed illegal business
practices to extend a monopoly on computer operating systems to
other markets. His recent attempts to wrap up the case, which
attempts to apply antitrust law to the rapidly changing technology
of a seemingly Internet-bound marketplace, must seek to both avoid
obsolescence and the inadvertant creation of appellate grounds. The
company has already written that it was denied due process because
its attorneys expected the May 24 hearing to be the beginning, not
the end, of the remedies phase.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Judge Jackson's attempts to pick up the pace in the
antitrust case, partly in an effort to allow appeals to begin, the
time required for those appeals is unknown. Provisions specific to
antitrust law give the U.S. solicitor general, and not the Justice
Department, 15 days to request that the Supreme Court immediately
review the company's appeal. That would allow the government to
leapfrog the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, which reversed Judge Jackson in an earlier ruling adverse
to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Within 90 days of a ruling, the behavioral remedies outlined by
17 states and the Justice Department would take effect. These
remedies include publishing the so-called source code used by
programmers to design software applications for Windows. Other
proposed behavioral remedies would regulate Microsoft's relations
with computer makers and software companies.
</P>
<P>
   The company could ask an appeals court to stay a portion of the
remedies; Judge Jackson himself could stay portions of his
remedies.

SOLAR WAVES OFFER HINT TO WHAT'S INSIDE SUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By KENNETH CHANG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   How is the Sun like the ocean? As predicted by theoreticians,
the Sun's surface is pockmarked by a grid of short hills that are
similar to long-lived, slow-moving bumps that travel across the
Earth's oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The observation of the tiny solar bulges, each just about 100
yards tall and separated from the next by about 50,000 miles, could
provide solar physicists a new tool for examining the inside of the
Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see is, Everywhere on the edge of the Sun are bumps
that are carried by solar rotation,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Kuhn of the
University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy, lead author of a
paper describing the solar hills in the current issue of the
journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, from its round-the-clock
Sun-watching position between the Sun and Earth, traces the outline
of the Sun every 12 minutes. The hills, known as Rossby waves, are
too small to be seen in any single outline, but statistical
patterns of undulations emerged as Kuhn's team studied almost three
years of data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an impressive feat, what they've done,'' said
Dr. Charles Wolff, a scientist at Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., who has worked out theoretical calculations of
Rossby waves on the Sun. ``It's the equivalent of standing in New
York and detecting the thickness of a nickel in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Wolff said, there have been only indirect and
inconclusive evidence for Rossby waves through sunspot
observations.
</P>
<P>
   The hill patterns linger, despite other more violent roilings on
the Sun like coronal mass ejections and solar flares.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to live for years,'' Kuhn said. ``We see the
features persist even as the pattern of sunspots comes and goes.''
</P>
<P>
   What creates the hills is the Sun's spin, the same phenomenon
that causes Northern Hemisphere hurricanes, ocean currents or any
other fluid on a spinning sphere to rotate in a clockwise
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like an alternating series of high and low pressure
systems covering the whole surface of the Sun like a
checkerboard,'' Wolff said. ``That entire pattern drifts slowly
westward.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-pressure regions bulge outward slightly, producing the
hills. Oceanographers have detected similar patterns in
ocean-height measurements by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Topex/Poseidon satellite. The watery version of
Rossby waves are only a few inches high and are separated from each
other by about 1,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take something like 15 to 20 years to propagate from San
Francisco to Tokyo,'' said Dr. Dudley Chelton, professor of
oceanography at Oregon State University and a co-author of a 1996
article in the journal Science that first discussed the Rossby
waves in the Topex/Poseidon images.
</P>
<P>
   However, in midlatitude regions, the slow pace of the ocean
Rossby waves is still twice as fast as what was predicted by the
equations of the meteorologist Carl-Gustaf Arvid Rossby, who
devised them in the 1930s to describe swirling weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roland De Szoeke, a colleague of Chelton at Oregon State,
has been tweaking the equations to explain the faster-than-expected
Rossby waves. The speed of the waves depends on the density of the
fluid, De Szoeke said, and at the midlatitudes, the thermocline _
the boundary between the warm surface waters and the cold, denser
waters below _ runs deeper than in the tropics. In turn, Rossby
waves alter the water temperature and density, pushing the
thermocline downward by several hundred feet.
</P>
<P>
   For oceanographers, the Rossby waves don't tell them anything
new about ocean conditions. They can directly measure temperature
and density directly by dropping probes into the water. Solar
scientists who do not have that luxury may be able to use Rossby
waves to deduce something about what is going on inside the Sun.
Why are the hills 100 yards tall? Why are they 50,000 miles apart?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first puzzle is what determines those numbers,'' Kuhn
said, ``and that is undoubtedly going to be determined by the
interior conditions of the Sun.''

PERSONAL HEALTH: WHAT COULD BE GOOD ABOUT MORNING SICKNESS?
PLENTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evolution has not always come up with things people consider
wonderful. Note mosquitoes, sickle cell anemia and the killer
instinct. But according to evolutionary theory, there is a reason
for everything that has evolved. However obnoxious it may seem,
somehow it enhances survival.
</P>
<P>
   And so it seems that survival is the likely reason for morning
sickness, survival not just of the unborn child but also of the
pregnant woman who must bear the burden of its prenatal
development. That is the conclusion of two Cornell University
evolutionary biologists after examining the results of nearly
80,000 successful and unsuccessful pregnancies, correlating their
findings with the incidence of morning sickness and the development
during early pregnancy of food aversions and cravings.
</P>
<P>
   MOTHER AND BABY BENEFIT _ Samuel Flaxman, a graduate student,
and Dr. Paul Sherman, a professor of neurobiology and behavior,
report in the current issue of the Quarterly Review of Biology that
nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, which they call NVP, helps to
protect both mother and fetus from exposure to infectious organisms
and toxic chemicals that could result in fetal damage, miscarriage
or even, in primitive societies at least, maternal death.
</P>
<P>
   Morning sickness, these researchers note, is a misnomer. It can
occur at any time of the day (though not at night while a woman is
asleep) and, they insist, it is not a sickness. It is a 100 percent
normal characteristic of early pregnancy that is associated with a
reduced risk of miscarriage and a greater chance that the pregnancy
will have a healthy outcome. All nine studies that have explored
this relationship in about 20,000 pregnancies showed that women who
experienced the condition were significantly less likely to
miscarry.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than morning sickness, NVP should be called ``wellness
insurance,'' Sherman said. Worldwide and in the United States,
two-thirds of pregnant women acquire this free insurance to varying
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that a pregnant woman afflicted with nausea and
vomiting will be unlikely to consume certain foods that may be
damaging to her fetus at a time when its major organ systems are
developing. Organ development takes place during the first three
months of pregnancy, which is when morning sickness is most
prominent. ``There is an obvious _ indeed striking _ correspondence
between the sensitive periods in embryonic organogenesis and the
peak occurrence of NVP,'' the scientists wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At this time, too, the Cornell biologists noted, a pregnant
woman's immune system is naturally suppressed to keep her from
rejecting the fetus as a foreign tissue. But immune suppression
renders her more susceptible to food-borne parasites and
microorganisms and the toxins they produce, so NVP would protect
her, too.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAIN PROBLEM _ While other theorists, like Dr. Margie Profet
of the University of California at Berkeley, have suggested that
morning sickness evolved to protect the embryo and young fetus from
exposure to natural dietary toxins in vegetables, spices and some
fruits that might cause malformations, the Cornell researchers'
exhaustive analysis of all existing evidence gathered since 1940
has indicated that meat, poultry, fish and eggs are far more
important sources of possible pregnancy problems. Until
refrigeration, these foods were most likely to harbor infectious
and toxic organisms that could sicken a pregnant woman, damage her
fetus or cause an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Cornell report found, the meat category leads the
list of food aversions that develop during pregnancy; nonalcoholic
beverages like coffee come second, and vegetables a distant third.
Having completely lost my appetite for meat and coffee during my
own pregnancy, I am inclined to think the Cornell biologists are
right on target. For most women suffering from NVP, bland
carbohydrate foods like bread, cereal and grains have the greatest
appeal, though cravings for fruit and fruit juice, desserts, ice
cream and sometimes unusual foods are commonplace. Studies have
shown that very few pregnant women crave alcohol, which is a cause
of fetal malformations.
</P>
<P>
   In further support of their theory, the Cornell team examined
dietary patterns in seven nonindustrial societies where pregnant
women never or rarely experience morning sickness and compared the
results with 20 similar societies in which NVP occurs. Those
societies without NVP ``were significantly less likely to have meat
as a dietary staple'' and were ``significantly more likely to have
corn as a dietary staple,'' the scientists wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Also intriguing are the different rates of NVP in industrialized
societies that have different dietary habits. The highest frequency
for a single country was in Japan, a nation fond of eating raw
fish, where 84 percent of the pregnant women in one study reported
experiencing nausea and vomiting. Raw fish, a dietary no-no during
pregnancy in this country, can carry parasites that could harm a
fetus in addition to making the pregnant woman quite ill. Likewise,
undercooked meat, popular in many Western countries where NVP
frequencies are high, can carry a parasite called toxoplasma that
causes serious congenital defects.
</P>
<P>
   But even cooked meat that is not spoiled can be a problem,
Sherman said. If the meat sat around unrefrigerated for a while, it
could become contaminated with pathogens like E. coli even though
it looks and smells fine, he explained. His evolution-based
conclusion: ``A pregnant woman's body responds to the smell and
taste of meat because this category of food in general can be
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell biologists do not dispute the role that the hormones
of pregnancy are known to play in touching off morning sickness.
Rather, Sherman said, ``the hormones explain how this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking why it happens,'' he said. ``Why do the hormones
cause these particular symptoms of nausea and vomiting and food
aversions? Why not headaches or backaches?'' Their answer is that
nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy is protective; it helps to
guarantee the next generation will be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Studies suggest that morning sickness has a genetic component.
Women are much more likely to experience it if their mothers or
sisters also had NVP Forms of morning sickness have also been
observed in domestic dogs and captive rhesus monkeys and
chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SHOULD A WOMAN DO? _ Women who do not experience morning
sickness should not fret, Sherman said, if they live in
industrialized countries where the food supply is safe. But neither
should heroic measures be taken to prevent ``normal'' NVP. The best
way to alleviate the problem is to always have some food in one's
stomach. Hence, the common advice to keep crackers on the night
table and to eat several before getting out of bed in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said he saw ``no reason to believe that suppressing the
symptoms of NVP would improve the outcome of a pregnancy'' unless a
woman developed hyperemesis, continual vomiting that occurs in only
half of 1 percent of pregnancies and which requires hospital
treatment. Ordinary morning sickness, he said, ``is a phenomenon
that is adaptive, not pathological. It's not a symptom of a failing
female body. It's a temporary condition that occurs early in
pregnancy when fetal demands are small and would not be a major
drain on a woman's resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also sees no reason to force a pregnant woman to consume
any foods to which she has developed an aversion. In most women,
aversions that start in the first trimester dissipate during the
second along with a waning of NVP.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all pregnant women should be taking daily prenatal
vitamin-mineral supplements, which help compensate for any
nutrients missing while suffering from NVP. Most important in the
first months of pregnancy is folic acid (or folate), which has been
shown to greatly reduce the risk that the baby will suffer a spinal
defect when consumed at a level of 400 micrograms a day. Since
January 1998, flour and grain products (foods that are unlikely to
be on a pregnant woman's list of aversions) have been fortified
with folic acid.

DOCTORS' CASES: IT CAN PAY TO IGNORE EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER, M.D.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is easy to become irritated with the plodding pace of
clinical medical science. Studies churn on for years, comparing
Drug A with Drug B, Drug C with placebo, finally spitting out a few
cautious conclusions that invariably end with a call for yet more
research on more minutiae of the same old questions.
</P>
<P>
   Even doctors become impatient with it all. Sometimes, especially
as they get older, they just begin to pay the studies less mind,
and concentrate instead on what they have seen with their own eyes.
At conferences they tend to lean their aging bones back in the
chair and say to the young ones, ``I know all about those studies
of A, B and C, and in my experience things are a little
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom of medical experience can be delicious to accumulate
and display. Unfortunately, it can also be quite dangerous _ as a
recent case of hepatitis in a patient of mine clearly shows.
</P>
<P>
   My patient's hepatitis was entirely routine. He was sick for a
week with the usual warning signs _ fatigue, achiness, a sudden
dislike of strong odors. For another 10 days he was in bed
nauseated, with a throbbing ache in the right side of his abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   His diagnosis was easy enough to make: his liver enzymes on a
blood test were off the charts, fifty times as high as normal. His
care was not particularly challenging either: with bed rest and
fluids, he was better in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a month later, he is still a little shaky but back at work.
It will take another blood test to determine which hepatitis virus
made him sick.
</P>
<P>
   The instructive parts of his case are actually not its medical
details at all, but a few casual sentences the patient and I had
exchanged before his hepatitis started. We were discussing whether
he should start taking medications for his infection with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS. His stage of infection was advanced enough
that he probably should, but the decision of when to begin them was
entirely up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' he said, cheerful and efficient. ``I'm ready. I will
start them tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   I shrugged. It was a Friday. ``You might as well give yourself
the weekend off.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is exactly what he did. He took the weekend off, and by
Monday morning he was not feeling very well at all. He dragged
himself through the rest of the week, new pill bottles unopened,
and by the time he stumbled to the lab for the blood tests that
diagnosed his hepatitis, even thinking about the medications made
him queasy. The bottles are still unopened.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose he had decided to start those pills on that Saturday
after all?
</P>
<P>
   If he had, he would still have developed a whopping case of
hepatitis, of course: it had begun to incubate well before our
conversation took place. But he would have developed it just a few
days after he started a set of new pills.
</P>
<P>
   It would have played out as a crystal-clear case of cause and
effect, precisely timed and far too obvious to question. In big
studies, none of the medications he was to start caused liver
problems like his. Even so, I would have been hard- pressed to
avoid blaming the drugs. Even if I had thought to consider a virus,
I would probably have assumed that the drugs had activated the
virus. How else to explain the course of events?
</P>
<P>
   My patient would have had a variety of tests, possibly even a
liver biopsy. When he recovered I would have given him a different
set of drugs, and warned him never to take any of the first again.
</P>
<P>
   I would also have started worrying about using those drugs in
other patients, especially those with liver problems. I would have
known, of course, that studies show hepatitis from those drugs is
mild and rare. But I would have been wary of trusting the studies
against my own experience.
</P>
<P>
   I would have mentioned my patient's case to colleagues all over
the country, implying that they might want to think twice about
those medications in their own patients. ``In my experience,'' I
would have said, settling my aging bones in the chair, ``you can
get into trouble with those.''
</P>
<P>
   And it would all have been utterly misguided, a mistake from
beginning to end, misinformed by a fluke of personal experience.
</P>
<P>
   Only the tortuously slow studies designed to examine drug
effects in thousands of people can begin to sort out this kind of
coincidence from true cause and effect. Their glacial pace shows
how difficult it is in medicine to dissect the powerful role of
happenstance out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   And as for single startling cases of self-evident cause and
effect: often their moral is simply how deceptive single startling
cases of anything can be.

WHO OWNS THE HALLS OF CONGRESS THESE DAYS?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Serious observers worry lest the deluge of big campaign gifts
cross that invisible line between buying preferred ``access'' to
legislators and actually buying votes. Casual private conversations
among Capitol Hill insiders during the week prior to House passage
of the China trade bill would have confirmed their worst fears.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of influence was ubiquitous, unabashed and flagrant.
Seldom (I hesitate to say never) has a bill been more intensively
or expensively lobbied. A taxi driver, picking me up at the Capitol
Wednesday afternoon of that week, asked if I'd been lobbying
congressmen on the trade bill. When I said no, he suggested I was
the first fare he'd had all week who wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   He said out-of-town lobbyists had been talking to one another
with startling candor in the back seats of his cab all week.
Recognizing me as the former House speaker, he became very
confidential. ``It isn't like it used to be here, Mr. Speaker.
Things have changed.'' He cited actual figures he'd overheard,
thrown freely between lobbyists comparing results in their
canvassing for the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   That was hearsay. I cite it as indication only that things must
have grown pretty bawdy to shock one of the few remaining old-time
Washington cabdrivers.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair to report, however, that a slow and subtle change has
come about in the way lawmakers consider and discuss legislation
among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   No longer do legislators talk so much of what their constituents
want. Now it's what their contributors want. They speak
unhesitantly. The focus is on the money, pure and simple. With
enough money for TV blitzes, voters will come around, they feel.
Without it, they feel endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder. Campaign costs have become stratospheric.
Legislators on average must raise $1,000 every day of their term in
order merely to stay competitive. Watchdog groups say at east 60
percent more will be spent by both sides this year than in 1996.
Campaign totals may reach $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when a member harboring monetary motivation for his
vote would be ashamed to confess it, even to colleagues. Today
lawmakers feel no such onus.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that there weren't persuasive ideological arguments
both for and against the bill. Floor debate gave articulate
expression to these, but that debate was rendered irrelevant before
it began. Clinton and the big contributors had sewed it up.
</P>
<P>
   There's something in the deal for almost everyone, except for
wage earners at home and abroad. Clinton gets earned credit for a
foreign policy triumph. Corporate investors get a green light for
cutting lucrative long-term deals. China gets respectability, and
U.S. dollars. Maybe U.S. consumers get some cheaper goods.
</P>
<P>
   The working stiffs of the world? Well, they get the shaft.
There'll be no pressure on China to require that its workers get
decent wages or working conditions. More U.S. factories will move
to the orient, lured by cheap labor. That's the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Will we sell more U.S.-made consumer goods to Chinese? No time
soon. Chinese workers aren't paid enough to afford them. People
making 35 cents an hour at best can't buy new cars, refrigerators,
computers, or much else. That's why we are running a $60 billion
annual trade deficit with China, up one-fifth from last year.
</P>
<P>
   With China in the World Trade Organization, there'll be order of
a sort. Not exactly a just world order, but a profitable one for
some. The WTO makes the rules. It understands and promotes profits,
disregards wages and environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Is it premature to say that corporate America now owns Congress?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not to the point of crying out, in paraphrase of holy writ,
that they've made of our fathers' House a den of thieves. Neither
lawmakers nor purchasers of favor think of what they do as theft
because it is, by labored interpretation, quite legal. And it will
continue to be so until there's serious campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   As for legislators who solicit and accept big contributions,
conveniently embracing the dicta of their sources because they're
so necessary to electoral success, about all that can be said is
that they've been compliant in the subtle erosion of their
time-hallowed institution (and of their own relevance) by
practices, now rampant, which they either cannot or will not
change.
</P>
<P>
   But, for one who remembers how it was, it's sad. How sad!

<P>
   This summer more than one million tourists will venture to the
rim of the Grand Canyon and are likely to feel their jaws drop as
they gaze upon the world famous spectacle: a vast wilderness of
rocks, deep gorges and a mighty river lost below cliffs, buttes and
pinnacles festooned in pastel shades of purple, orange, pink and
green.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, some of these visitors will turn to a park ranger
and ask: ``How did the Grand Canyon get formed? Why did this happen
here and nowhere else?''
</P>
<P>
   The honest answer is that nobody knows. One hundred and
thirty-one years after John Wesley Powell first mapped the Colorado
River by riding its 161 rapids in heavy wooden boats, no one can
prove how the canyon was formed.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not for lack of trying. Geologists are puzzle freaks
who love nothing more than collecting fragmentary clues _ clumps of
gravel, fossilized shells and pollens, the dates that muddy
sediments were deposited in dried-up lakes or whole mountain ranges
were lifted _ and then trying desperately to figure out how the
modern topography before their eyes was produced.
</P>
<P>
   This week, more than 80 earth scientists will gather in Grand
Canyon Village to compare notes and work toward a unified theory of
how and when the Grand Canyon formed. The last time a similar group
of experts met to discuss the evolution of the Colorado River was
in August 1964, before modern theories of plate tectonics
revolutionized geophysics with the notion that continents could
drift, slam into one another and alter entire landscapes the size
of the American Southwest. Not surprisingly, the favorite theories
from the previous era are now on the table for serious revision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to take a new look at the evidence,''said Dr.
Richard Young, a geologist at the State University of New York at
Geneseo, who organized the conference and is an expert on gravel
deposits in the canyon. In the times since the last meeting,
geologists have dated more rock formations, identified new deposits
and are working from a more sophisticated framework about the
overall geological history of the Southwest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which starts Wednesday and ends on June 9 is
bringing together geologists, paleontologists and climate experts
who do not get much chance to interact, Young said. After they talk
and go home to think about what they have learned, pieces of the
puzzle may perhaps fit together in new ways.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that many features in the Grand Canyon do not
make any sense. The modern Colorado appears to be a young river
that flows out of the Rockies and hits a huge plateau, called the
Kaibab Upwarp, which is 50 million to 70 million years old. Instead
of being shunted away from this barrier, the river runs right
through it. Moreover, when sediments from the river are examined
closely, it is clear that the western end of the canyon _ where it
flattens out and begins its final run to the Gulf of California _
is many millions of years younger than the eastern part of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   To many experts, this difference means that the Grand Canyon
could have been cobbled together from ancient river basins that
were created during different geologic eras. But if so, when and
how were those ancient rivers formed and where did they go?
</P>
<P>
   In seeking answers, geologists are faced with a difficult
problem. For critical periods of canyon formation, the geologic
record is entirely missing. The rocks and fossils that researchers
need in order to tell a coherent story have either washed away or
been buried, presumably in places not yet discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, experts have used the few clues they have to
develop two main competing theories about the formation of the
canyon. One maintains that the Colorado River is old and that it
carved the Grand Canyon at least 70 million years ago. The other
says that the river is young and carved the canyon within the last
five million years.
</P>
<P>
   The first explanation, advanced by Powell and other early
geologists, holds that the river has a simple history. In the
beginning of the Tertiary period, 70 million years ago, Arizona was
flat and the river flowed in its present course, roughly east to
west.
</P>
<P>
   Then, during various periods of uplift apparently caused by
collisions between gigantic slabs of the earth's crust, the Kaibab
plateau began to rise at a rate that exactly matched the river's
capacity to erode the landscape. According to this view, the canyon
cutting took place gradually, with the river staying in place and
the land around it rising upward.
</P>
<P>
   This theory held sway for more than 50 years, Young said, but
today it has few adherents because too many pieces of the puzzle do
not fit. For example, as mentioned, a major part of the riverbed
shows strong evidence of being younger than the Kaibab uplift.
</P>
<P>
   One holdout for the old river explanation is Dr. Don Elston, a
retired geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff,
Ariz., who has been working on canyon formation theories since the
mid-1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've attempted to solve the problem using stratigraphy and
climate data from all over the Colorado Plateau,'' Elston said in
an interview. ``Some people call it geofiction, but I think I'm
right.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When dinosaurs roamed the earth, the southwestern landscape was
about 1,000 feet above sea level and very wet, Elston explained.
Then the region experienced three periods of uplift followed by
erosion. In the first uplift, about 100 million years ago,
mountains grew across northern and central Arizona and later eroded
so that a blanket of gravel a few hundred feet thick poured out to
the north. These older gravels can be found today on both sides of
the Grand Canyon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A second uplift occurred 60 million to 75 million years ago,
producing huge rivers that eventually flowed to the west and
collected in enormous inland lakes. It was during this period that
the Grand Canyon was carved out, Elston said. Then the uplift
ceased, erosion continued and this early Grand Canyon filled up
completely with gravel.
</P>
<P>
   A third uplift took place five million years ago to form the
Rocky Mountains and again changed regional drainage patterns,
Elston said. The land in the north rose while the southwest,
relatively speaking, fell. As a result, streams began flowing
westward down from the Rockies, and found the earlier drainage
channel. As they flowed down the old channel, they removed all the
gravel and essentially scoured out the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern Colorado River did not carve the Grand Canyon in
the last few million years,'' Elston said. ``The canyon was already
there.''
</P>
<P>
   After this period, he said, the climate grew very dry, which
explains why there are no older river deposits at the western end
of the canyon. The Colorado River dried up, ran sporadically or ran
completely underground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elston's theory is ``a nice ad hoc explanation,'' Young said,
but most people don't buy it. Since the 1950s, numerous expeditions
to the western mouth of the Grand Canyon, in a region called the
Grand Wash Cliffs, have found no evidence of an older Colorado
River running through, sporadically or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Local sediments stem from a younger geologic formation called
the Basin and Range _ an area that begins where the Colorado
Plateau drops off at the western edge of the Grand Canyon and the
landscape stretches out for hundreds of miles, all the way to
eastern California.
</P>
<P>
   Everything points to the idea that the upper reaches of the
Colorado River are very old and the lower reaches are very new,
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   If the upper Colorado River did not always flow into its present
course, where did it go? Dozens of papers have been written on
this, said Steve Reynolds, a geologist at Arizona State University
in Tempe. Most of these theories posit two separate river systems
that somehow hooked up not far from today's visitor center on the
south rim.
</P>
<P>
   A popular theory from the 1960s held that one of the rivers came
down from Colorado or Utah, flowed south along the course of what
is now the Little Colorado River and joined the Rio Grande into the
Gulf of Mexico. Meanwhile, to the west, a small unnamed river
flowed across the Basin and Range province and into the Gulf of
California.
</P>
<P>
   This younger river, or stream drainage system, was vigorous and
steep, according to this theory. Through a process called headward
erosion, it gradually moved eastward, gobbling up the land around
its headwaters in Pac-Man fashion, until it met up with the
ancestral upper Colorado. This younger river captured the older
river, Reynolds said, established its present course and then
carved the Grand Canyon only four million to six million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there are problems, Reynolds said. The continental
divide would have prevented an ancient Colorado River from joining
the Rio Grande. So other theories propose that the river came
south, hit the Kaibab plateau and did a U-turn back to the north.
This old river system would have emptied into inland lakes in Utah
or Nevada. Unfortunately, the deposits that could prove such a
drainage system existed have not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory holds that the ancestral Colorado flowed from the
north and into a huge lake in central Arizona, laying down the
so-called Bidahochi formation. But Dr. Michael Ort, a geologist at
Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, said he had evidence that
this body of water, called Hopi Lake, was ephemeral. It would fill
up occasionally and then dry out for long periods, Ort said. It
does not appear that an ancient Colorado River could have drained
into Hopi Lake, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some people think that Hopi Lake could have
filled from an unknown source to overflowing about five million
years ago and somehow broken over a barrier that had separated it
from the Colorado River. This would have created a catastrophic
flood that carved the Grand Canyon very quickly, within a couple
million years, Ort said. The problem with this idea is that no
Bidahochi sediments have been found anywhere in the present
Colorado River drainage. Again, physical proof of the theory is
lacking.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, several people are now saying that the existing
Colorado River did carve the Grand Canyon but did so while flowing
in the opposite direction of today. The modern river is just too
weird, said Andre Potochnik, a river guide who is writing his Ph.D.
dissertation on deposits related to early Southwest river systems.
It does not follow fault lines as most rivers do and it has
tributaries that come in at obtuse angles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Potochnik argues that a much older river flowed west to east
down the Kaibab plateau and carved the canyon. Later, as tectonic
forces changed the land to tilt in different directions, the river
changed the direction of its flow and became the modern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Ranney, a geology instructor at Yavapai College in
Prescott, Ariz., argues that the Little Colorado River probably
flowed north through Marble Canyon _ a stretch of the river where
tributaries come in at an angle that is the opposite of what one
would expect, given the way the water flows. ``The river system I
envision would have flowed north into the Glen Canyon area,''
Ranney said. ``Every time I see this landscape, I'm more convinced
that at least this part of the river went the other way. The beauty
of this theory is that it ties together a lot of conflicting ideas
concerning evidence for an old river east of the Kaibab Upwarp and
a young one west of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out the Grand Canyon is like being a police officer
called to the scene of a four-car accident, Reynolds said. ``But by
the time you get there, three of the cars have been towed away,
they repaved the road and washed away the skid marks. You are left
with only one piece of the puzzle.'' Larry Stevens, a river guide
and expert on Grand Canyon ecology, said that the Grand Canyon
might be a ``geological koan.''
</P>

   ``People can spend a lifetime pursuing these questions and we
may never know the answers,'' Stevens said.

THE WHEN AND HOW OF BLACK HOLES EMERGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the latest count, which rose with fresh announcements Monday,
astronomers have detected massive black holes at the centers of
more than 30 galaxies. The numbers are now sufficient, scientists
say, to recognize patterns and understand where, when and how the
most powerful black holes typically develop.
</P>
<P>
   New observations by the Hubble Space Telescope support the
theory that black holes did not precede a galaxy's birth but
evolved along with the galaxy. They were fed by the same inward
collapse of gas that caused the creation of stars in the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger the galaxy, the findings show, the bigger its central
black hole, the extremely dense mass with a gravitational pull so
powerful that it sucks in everything nearby and allows nothing to
escape, not even light. One of the more intriguing surprises is
that the typical black hole, large or relatively small, invariably
has a mass that is two-tenths of one percent of the mass of the
high-density central region, or bulge, of the galaxy. Why such a
proportion pertains to so many examples is still a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Another pattern to emerge from the observations is that the more
massive black holes _ ones with compressed masses more than one
billion times that of the Sun _ appear to develop only in
elliptically shaped galaxies with dense central bulges of stars.
Pure disk-shaped galaxies, like the neighboring Messier 33, have no
observable black holes. And galaxies with only small bulges, like
the Milky Way, Earth's home galaxy, have relatively small black
holes of a few million solar masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we can put strong constraints on the
relationship between galaxy formation and black hole formation and
growth,'' said Dr. John Kormendy of the University of Texas at
Austin, a member of an international team of astronomers that
reported the new findings Monday at a meeting in Rochester of the
American Astronomical Society.
</P>
<P>
   The team announced the discovery of eight more supermassive
black holes in galactic centers, based on observations by the
Hubble telescope's newly installed spectrograph. Although the
objects themselves cannot be detected because no radiation escapes
their gravity, their presence can be inferred by measuring the
velocities of disks of gas trapped in the clutches of black holes,
like water swirling around a drain. At least 33 such objects have
now been observed.
</P>
<P>
   Kormendy and colleagues, Dr. Karl Gebhardt of the University of
California at Santa Cruz and Dr. Douglas Richstone of the
University of Michigan, said that the correlations between galaxy
structures and black hole masses were important clues to how the
galaxies formed and the source of energy to make quasars shine.
Quasars, the brightest lights in the distant universe, are the
radiating signatures of matter plunging into the black hole and
feeding its growth at the center of a young galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main events that made a galaxy and the ones that made its
black hole shine as a quasar are the same events,'' Kormendy said.
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior, the scientists explained, appears to be most
violent in galaxies and most productive of black holes where
primordial hydrogen gas collapses into a dense central bulge around
a small compact core of matter, a ``seed'' black hole. The
observations so far have yielded no clues to how the seed black
holes originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team will try to solve this mystery in the coming year by
looking for the smallest nuclear black holes that we can find with
Hubble,'' Richstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the new findings, scientists have identified two other
ways in which galaxy evolution possibly affects black hole
development. Even though regular disk galaxies do not appear to
harbor massive black holes, if two disk galaxies with small black
holes collide, the merger would produce an elliptical galaxy with
conditions feeding the appetites of growing black holes. Also, in
some cases, gas flowing to the center of a disk galaxy could
gradually create a ``pseudo bulge,'' as opposed to a primordial
bulge, where a black hole could accumulate mass.
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt notes that the more massive black holes dwell in
galaxies where the stars move especially fast, even the ones far
beyond the gravitational influence of the black hole. He said this
was strong evidence that the host galaxy underwent a tremendous
collapse in its earliest stages. So the mass of a black hole may
tell a lot about its history.

CELEBRATING THE POETRY OF IMAGINATION WITHOUT BOUNDARIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By LAWRENCE M. KRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the bitter cold of Antarctica and the blistering heat of
Texas, scientists recently coaxed the universe to display its
hidden structure. In the past weeks, two different high altitude
balloon experiments studying the microwave radiation left over from
the Big Bang independently reported that the universe is very close
to being ``flat.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a geometric concept. Einstein's general theory of
relativity tells us that light rays bend in a gravitational field
because space is ``curved'' in the presence of such a field,
meaning that the standard Euclidean rules of geometry taught in
high school need not always apply. The recent observations,
however, imply that when crossing the entire visible universe,
light seems to travel in straight lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Antarctic announcement, first in print of the two, was
impressive enough to be reported in local and national newspapers,
but it did not, to my knowledge, produce even a slight blip in the
stock market. Nor should it have. Nothing in the entire course of
human history would have been noticeably different if the universe
were not flat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet precisely for this reason there is poetry in the recent
discoveries that I believe is worth celebrating, even if one is not
a cosmologist. They represent on the one hand a triumph of the
human imagination, and on the other a valuable reminder that
science can never be purely cerebral. The universe always seems to
surprise us.
</P>
<P>
   In a century full of scientific revolutions, Einstein's
discovery of general relativity stands as a monument to the power
of human reasoning. In 1915, not a single direct piece of evidence
existed that clearly suggested that space might be curved in the
presence of massive bodies. However, indirect reasoning, based on
careful observations of the nature of light and the motion of
massive bodies, led to the realization that the Newtonian gravity
theory would have to be revised.
</P>
<P>
   Empirically, the observable effects of general relativity were
minuscule. Light, for example, was predicted to bend around the Sun
by about five 10-thousandths of a degree. But small as these
effects were, they changed the way we think about space and time.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein's theory paved the way for interpreting Edwin Hubble's
remarkable discovery that the universe is expanding. For it is only
within the context of general relativity that such a global
expansion can be consistently described. But, there remained a
problem: if the universe is currently expanding, will the expansion
stop, or continue unabated forever?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to this question appeared to depend upon the specific
geometry of our universe, and could not be determined within the
context of the theory alone, without further observations.
Moreover, it seemed to depend on a very careful tuning of the
initial conditions in the expanding universe.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when I was a graduate student beginning to get
interested in cosmology, a poll of astronomers and physicists would
have yielded almost no support for the possibility that we live in
a flat universe.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, none of the data then seemed to point in
such a direction. In the second, a flat universe seemed very
special, merely the boundary between two more generic geometric
possibilities, the so-called open or closed universes. In the
former case, light rays would diverge as they traveled across the
universe and in the latter case they would converge together.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a problem, first voiced by the remarkable
experimental physicist Dr. Robert Dicke and his colleague, the
distinguished cosmological theorist Dr. James Peebles. They pointed
out that living in a flat universe was like sitting atop a very
steep mountain. If one moved slightly away from the top in either
direction, one would very quickly come tumbling down.
</P>
<P>
   But our universe is over 10 billion years old. Surely if the
universe were not essentially flat, it would long ago either have
collapsed back upon itself, or have expanded so fast that matter
would have long ago been diluted to irrelevancy on a cosmic scale.
</P>
<P>
   This theoretical argument led Dr. Alan Guth, a physicist now at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to develop a new
cosmological model, called inflation, which would naturally ensure
that the early universe would be driven to being so close to being
flat that it should remain indistinguishable from being flat for
virtually an eternity thereafter. Guth's theory was itself so
compelling that within a decade, again without any direct evidence
for a flat universe, many cosmologists had been converted.
</P>
<P>
   I remember progressing from graduate student to professor during
this time, as we in the ``flat-universe trenches'' began to win the
day, and others in the field and out began to come around. The
argument seemed so compelling that it appeared that nature would
have had no choice but to adopt it, even if there was always a
slight equivocation that what seemed natural to us might not be so
natural for the universe.
</P>
<P>
   So had the discoveries in Antarctica taken place 20 years ago,
most physicists would have been shocked, and perhaps dubious. Now,
however, many in the cosmological community can be seen patting
themselves on the back for their foresight.
</P>
<P>
   When I ponder these developments, I remain amazed that we have
come to understand the universe so intimately that we may have
suspected in advance that it should be flat. We are, after all,
confined to the immediate proximity of our spinning globe on the
outskirts of the Milky Way galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   No one could guess by simply peering with a naked eye at the
night sky that our galaxy is one of 100 billion or so in the
visible universe, or that the universe is expanding, much less that
space on large scales might be curved. Fortune indeed favors the
prepared mind, and it is hard to over-emphasize the intellectual
journey required before the very question of the naturalness of a
flat universe could even be discussed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But this essay is written in praise of cosmology, not
cosmologists. I have made it sound as if the universe willingly
followed the demands of human reason. Nothing could be further from
the truth. The models we invented in the 1980s to try to bring a
flat universe into accord with the observations at the time are
clearly wrong. Much to our surprise the energy that dominates in
the expanding universe is not associated matter of any sort,
pedestrian or exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it appears that our universe is only flat because empty
space is endowed with some sort of funny energy, whose origin we
can only begin to imagine at the present time. Although Einstein
had been the first to speculate about such a possibility by
introducing what became known as a cosmological constant (in order
to explain why an apparently static universe might not collapse of
its own gravity) he later found it so abhorrent that he dismissed
it as his greatest blunder.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair to say that if observations had not driven us to this
precipice, no one would have traveled there in advance or later
revisited it. Indeed, theoretical a priori arguments suggest that a
cosmological constant tuned to produce a flat universe today is as
unnatural on fundamental grounds as a flat universe now seems
natural.
</P>
<P>
   It gets worse. We were driven to determine whether the universe
is flat or not with one main goal in mind: to constrain eternity.
The classical arguments in pre-1995 cosmology books, mine included,
stressed that if we could determine the geometry of the universe,
we would know its ultimate destiny. How very marvelous to imagine
that in our lifetimes we might determine, for certain, whether the
universe would end with a bang or a whimper.
</P>
<P>
   But the universe has outsmarted us once again. The realization
that empty space might in fact provide the dominant source of
energy in the universe has again changed everything. We now
recognize that any universe, open, closed or flat, can collapse or
expand forever, depending upon the magnitude of this new form of
energy. Geometry and destiny have been disentangled.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, my colleague Michael Turner and I have argued that there
will never be any finite set of astronomical measurements made over
a finite time that will allow us to determine the ultimate fate of
our universe. Some things, it seems, may be forever shrouded in
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   So we find ourselves at the dawn of the 21st century strangely
self-satisfied and at the same time confused. A flat universe
doesn't matter a tinker's damn, an expression my wife likes to use,
in the everyday course of human events. Yet the lessons that arise
from these discoveries can leave us with a completely new
perspective of our place in the cosmos. That is what the progress
of culture is all about. Ultimately this, not technology, may be
the greatest legacy of science.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we learn that the universe is a stranger and more
interesting place than human imagination alone can ever foretell.
If we stop looking outward, we are likely to end up going nowhere.

HOTELS GO RETAIL (NEED A BED?) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 By TERRY TRUCCO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, guests had to leave their hotel rooms and venture
into stores to shop. But these days, some of the finest hotels
offer guests the chance to shop without getting out of bed. If you
can't live without the pillow-top mattress you slept on last night,
or the ice bucket, or the big black desk chair _ they're all for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   For years, hotels have sold small items like monogrammed
bathrobes and towels to guests who wanted to take home more than
memories. Such sales were largely defensive. ``Anything with a
little pizazz would disappear unless there was a sign attached that
said it was for sale,'' said James Eyster, a professor emeritus at
the Cornell University School of Hotel Management.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, hotels have become retailers on a grander scale.
It's no longer unusual to find a price list on the bedside table.
The polite prevention of theft is a big reason for the trend,
particularly at boutique hotels stocked with stylish toys. At the
Mondrian in Los Angeles, a card states that amenities are to be
enjoyed ``during your stay'' and includes a price list should the
trash can ($16) or the alarm clock ($32) prove irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   But old-fashioned marketing is behind the newest wave of hotel
retailing. No one has taken the concept further than the
two-year-old W hotel chain, which publishes a catalog of more than
25 room items, from a $55 chenille throw pillow to an $18
silver-plated yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Fatino, vice president of brand design and development,
said she selected amenities for the hotels' high-style rooms with
two goals in mind. ``We wanted to create an entire environment in
each hotel and to make the guest think how great it would be to
have the hotel experience at home.'' A former buyer for Pottery
Barn, Fatino recalled how she and her retailing colleagues often
picked up ideas for merchandise at boutique hotels in Europe and
Asia. ``At W, we're doing the reverse and selling the items
ourselves,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   So far, catalog sales have been solid but unspectacular; for the
first quarter of the year, W sold $20,000 worth of bedding products
from the catalog. But of course the objects also help publicize the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Large-scale hotel retailing began quietly with mattresses and
bedding. Last year 2,000 guests at Four Seasons hotels asked to buy
the custom Sealy mattresses the hotels use. The New York Palace has
shipped its Sealy mattresses as far away as Singapore. By marketing
its new Simmons mattress, pillows and sheets aggressively with
cards and an 800 number, the Westin hotel group sells three beds a
day on average.
</P>
<P>
   Large chains are in an excellent position to become retailers,
Eyster said. ``When you're buying something at a good volume, it's
not a problem to tag an order on and sell to the public.'' Volume
buying can make the price agreeable. This fall Wyndham Hotels and
Resorts plans to sell the Herman Miller Aeron desk chairs used in
their refurbished rooms for less than the suggested retail price.
</P>
<P>
   Staying in a hotel that sells furnishings allows guests to live
with items before they buy them. ``What better way to test a
mattress than to sleep on it for a night in a hotel?'' said Eyster.

NEW STUDY MITIGATES DANGER OF GENETIC CORN ON BUTTERFLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By CAROL KAESUK YOON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A strain of genetically modified corn that produces its own
insecticide, known as Bt, does not appear to harm black swallowtail
butterflies in the wild, according to a report published today in
The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1999, scientists at Cornell reported in the journal
Nature that monarch butterfly caterpillars died after eating Bt
corn pollen in laboratory experiments, raising concern that these
crops could be causing unintended harm to monarchs and other
insects.
</P>
<P>
   The new research on the swallowtail butterfly is the first
published field study conducted since then to look for potential
effects from genetically modified corn.
</P>
<P>
   The research team from the University of Illinois had studied
the widespread swallowtail butterfly for years. In this study, it
found that both in the wild and in the laboratory, swallowtail
butterfly caterpillars did not appear to be harmed by eating leaves
dusted with pollen from a popular strain of Bt corn known as Mon
810. The Bt toxin is aimed at killing European corn borers, which
can cause major damage to corn crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication is that the impacts of Bt corn might not be as
great as were initially assumed,'' said Dr. May Berenbaum,
ecologist at the University of Illinois and an author of the study,
which was paid for by the University of Illinois Environmental
Council.
</P>
<P>
   But Berenbaum added, ``I'm not saying Bt corn is just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both those who were and were not involved with the new
study cautioned against overgeneralizing from these latest
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Berenbaum noted that her team also found that another strain of
Bt corn, known as 176, which has particularly high levels of toxin
in its pollen, was toxic to swallowtail butterflies in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The finding suggested that while Mon 810 may be safe, other
strains of Bt corn could pose a threat to swallowtails. Researchers
will be studying the effects of strain 176 on swallowtails and
monarchs in the field this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also agreed that the new study and the Cornell study
could not be directly compared since they involved different
butterfly species and different strains of Bt corn. The Cornell
study used another popular strain known as Bt 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study is important because it's one more species,'' said
Dr. John Losey, the lead author on the Cornell study.
</P>
<P>
   But Losey echoed researchers on the new study, adding: ``It
would be just as wrong to look at black swallowtails and say Bt
corn is safe as it was wrong when people looked at monarchs and our
lab study and said there's definitely a problem. I'm not ready yet
to say either.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some 100 species of butterflies and moths could
potentially be affected by Bt corn pollen.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking to mitigate the potential impact of
genetically modified corn, however, the new study suggests that
there may be strains of Bt corn that have little or no impact on
nonpest species, said Dr. Arthur Zangerl, another author of the new
study.
</P>
<P>
   Since the study on monarchs was published a year ago, critics of
regulatory agencies have cited its findings as a sign that
environmental risks are not being adequately monitored. The monarch
itself has been brandished as a symbol by critics of genetic
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But biotechnology advocates have defended the new crop, saying
that it has decreased the use of pesticides and that the risks to
monarchs, if they exist, are likely to be minimal. &QL;

&HT;     D-DAY MUSEUM TO OPEN ON INVASION'S 56TH ANNIVERSARY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JULIE COOPER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ When the doors open Tuesday, the National D-Day
Museum will honor a generation of men and women whose courage
secured an Allied victory in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those wartime veterans will take part in the
grand-opening ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, 1944, the largest Allied invasion of Europe unfolded.
The heroism of the individuals who stormed the beaches of the
Normandy region of France _ as well as in other theaters of war _
is the emphasis behind the D-Day Museum in the trendy Arts and
Warehouse District of New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Why New Orleans?
</P>
<P>
   Because it was here that the Higgins boats, the landing crafts
used in the invasion of Normandy, were manufactured. And it is the
home, too, of museum founder Stephen E. Ambrose, the historian and
author of ``Citizen Soldiers'' and ``D-Day: The Climactic Battle of
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans ``is a city that doesn't brag on itself,'' Ambrose
said in a telephone interview. ``You brag on the food and the jazz
and Mardi Gras. But in World War II this city built all the landing
craft that won the war for us. Nearly every American who went
ashore in World War II did so in a boat built in New Orleans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose conceived the idea in the mid-1980s and established the
museum in 1992. The director of the Eisenhower Center in New
Orleans, Ambrose also is the author of a two-volume biography of
Dwight Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   It was during a meeting with Eisenhower in the 1960s when the
former president asked Ambrose if he had ever met industrialist
Andrew Jackson Higgins. Eisenhower, who was the supreme military
commander in Europe, called Higgins ``the man who won the war for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The D-Day Museum is housed in the former Louisiana Brewery, not
the actual site of Higgins manufacturing on Lake Pontchartrain as
Ambrose originally envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose said he argued for two years about putting the museum on
the lake, but was at last swayed by the museum's board. ``They
finally convinced me,'' he said with a laugh. ```Steve, this is not
a case of `if you build it they will come. We have to be close to
the quarter.'''
</P>
<P>
   The D-Day Museum is nine blocks from the French Quarter, one
block from the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, which opens in 2001,
near the Confederate Museum and blocks away from the New Orleans
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's unveiling of the $25 million museum will cap a weekend
of events including a United Service Organizations swing dance, a
World War II re-enactment at City Park and a military parade in
downtown New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, the star and the director of
``Saving Private Ryan,'' are on the guest list for Tuesday's
celebration. Tom Brokaw, the NBC news anchor and author of ``The
Greatest Generation'' about World War II veterans and the
Depression area, is the event's master of ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The 70,500-square-foot D-Day Museum contains a collection of
artifacts, oral histories, re-creations of equipment (gliders
tanks, and Higgins boats), films, maps, photomurals, uniforms and
text panels.
</P>
<P>
   The 16,000-square-foot gallery is divided into four interactive
exhibits that take visitors through the weeks and days leading up
to the invasions of World War II. Other air and sea assaults of the
war, including battles in North Africa, Sicily and the Pacific are
covered.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose said that the surge of interest in World War II, through
books and movies, has brought generations together. ``Young people
are aware that the privileged life they lead didn't come out of
nowhere, it had to be paid for. We're not talking Audie Murphy
here, it came from all of America.''
</P>
<P>
   The D-Day Museum will emphasize not only the efforts of fighting
men, but the people at home, ``Rosie the Riveter and the home-front
workers,'' he said.

   UKRAINE-ECON (Kharkiv, Ukraine) _ Nearly a decade after
independence, Ukraine's decision to go along with the United States
and break a deal with Russia over an Iranian power station is
emblematic of a lament frequently expressed in this city: that
Ukraine's agenda for growth and economic development in the
post-Soviet era never seems to be as important as the strategic
objectives of the United States and its Western allies. By Patrick
E. Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-EUROPE (Moscow) _ President Clinton addressed Russia's
Parliament Monday, urging its elected deputies to choose wisely in
determining their country's future _ both at home and in its
relationships with the rest of the world. In a 45-minute long
speech in the vast, austere Parliament building, Clinton struggled
to navigate a difficult course. He encouraged Russia to make the
political and economic reforms necessary to become what he called a
``modern, strong, democratic nation,'' but tried not to sound
bossy. By Elaine Sciolino and Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-EUROPE-UKRAINE (Kiev) _ President Leonid Kuchma of
Ukraine used the occasion of a brief visit by President Clinton
Monday to announce that the Chernobyl nuclear power station will be
closed by Dec. 15. Following Kuchma's announcement to close the
plant, the site of the world's worst the worst radiation accident
in history, Clinton pledged $78 million in American aid to help
Ukraine pay for the construction of a $750 million ``sarcophagus
project'' that will reconstruct and stabilize the structure that
covers the ruined reactor. By Elaine Sciolino.

<P>
   RUSSIA-ITALY (Rome) _ Russian President Vladimir Putin called on
the European Union and NATO Monday to join forces with Moscow and
set up a joint anti-missile shield, after talks here Monday with
Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. ``This will avoid creating
problems linked to a imbalance in the equilibrium of forces and
ensure 100 percent the security of all European countries, with the
obvious involvement of our American partners,'' Putin told a press
conference. By Alessandra Stanley.

   SCOTUS-GRANDPARENTS (Washington) _ Declaring that parents have a
``fundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody,
and control'' of their children, the Supreme Court ruled Monday
that a Washington state law went too far in permitting a judge to
order visiting rights for grandparents over a mother's objection.
Without a rationale that could command a majority, the court
stepped cautiously and appeared intent on avoiding a
one-size-fits-all constitutional prescription for a world of
rapidly changing family dynamics. Consequently, the court stopped
short of declaring unconstitutional the Washington law _ one of the
broadest of the so-called ``grandparents' rights'' laws in terms of
permitting judicial intervention into family affairs _ and also of
giving concrete guidance for judging the constitutionality of the
variants that exist in the 49 other states. By Linda Greenhouse.

approved AT&AMP;T's acquisition of MediaOne after the companies agreed
to the sale of some of their assets. By Stephen Labaton.

   MORGAN-WOMEN (Undated) _ A federal agency has determined that

   SCI-GRAND-CANYON (Undated) _ This summer more than one million
tourists will venture to the rim of the Grand Canyon and are likely
to feel their jaws drop as they gaze upon the world famous
spectacle: a vast wilderness of rocks, deep gorges and a mighty
river lost below cliffs, buttes and pinnacles festooned in pastel
shades of purple, orange, pink and green. Inevitably, some of these
visitors will turn to a park ranger and ask: ``How did the Grand
Canyon get formed? Why did this happen here and nowhere else?'' The
honest answer is that nobody knows. By Sandra Blakeslee.

   SCI-GENE-THERAPY (Denver) _ Gene therapy burst into the news
last fall, when a teenager from Tucson died in an experiment at the
University of Pennsylvania. But while politicians and the press
have spent the year focusing on accusations of lax government
oversight and shoddily run clinical trials, the science of gene
therapy has been making quiet, steady progress. Little by little,
researchers say, they are finding new and better ways to deliver
genes to their target cells. Clinical trials of gene-based
treatments for hemophilia are showing promise, and certain cancer
patients appear to respond to gene therapy. And the field got a big
ego boost this spring when French scientists reported they had used
gene therapy successfully to treat babies born with defective
immune systems. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.

   LONDON-ART (London) _ The British are nuts about their artists,
and by nuts I mean they are out of their minds. The condition shows
no sign of easing _ the reverse in fact, thanks to the Tate Modern,
a huge new engine of national self-congratulation spurring many
ancillary goings-on. Fresh galleries are suddenly open, including
another branch of the American dealer Larry Gagosian's empire.
American colonization betrays growing trans-Atlantic regard, a sure
sign of change. To be in London these days is to be endlessly
entertained by art, by the museums that show it, the multiplying
galleries that sell it and the masses who have become weirdly
fascinated by it. A journal by Michael Kimmelman.

   FBN-LEWIS-TRIAL (Undated) _ Baltimore Rams linebacker Ray Lewis
pleads guilty to a misdemeanor count of obstructing justice and, in
exchange, murder charges are dropped against the player. The plea
agreement came as Lewis was standing trial for murder in Atlanta in
the stabbing deaths of two players outside a Super Bowl party last
January. Under the deal, Lewis was sentenced Monday to a year of
probation. What now has to be resolved is what penalties he will
face from the National Football League. By Thomas George.

THE NATURAL DRAMA OF ADOPTION FITS TV'S DESIGNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the end of the premiere episode of ``Time of Your Life,''
Sarah, the young, wide-eyed protagonist played by Jennifer Love
Hewitt, experienced something of an epiphany. On a Manhattan
subway, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Broke, homeless and totally alone in this city of 8 million
people, she couldn't think of a better moment to wipe clean her
slate and start a life makeover. Having come to New York to find
her birth father, and failed miserably, she figured she couldn't
rely on anyone but herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's my lifeline?'' she asked. ``Where do I make the
connection?''
</P>
<P>
   Creators of the series, which aired on Fox, used such questions
as a kind of metaphor for Sarah's ongoing search for self, and for
her severed family ties.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption has long proved a powerful dramatic lure, but never has
the subject turned up such fertile ground for narrative
storytelling as witnessed recently on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity,'' ``Moesha,'' ``Oh Grow Up,'' ``The Smart Guy'' and
``ER,'' where viewers this past season learned that Dr. Kerry
Weaver (Laura Innes) is adopted, are only a few of the series that
have recently introduced plot lines involving adoption in some
form.
</P>
<P>
   Shows dealing with the hardships of adoption were rare just a
few years ago and unthinkable a generation ago. But adoption has
become a contentious, controversial issue recently _ and television
has used it to ratchet up its dramatic quotient and lure viewers.
For one thing, adoption, for years a closed process clouded by
stigmas and misconceptions, isn't nearly as secretive as it once
was. Now it's an infinitely more transparent experience supported
by various state laws prohibiting sealed adoption records. The
changes have allowed adoptees greater control over information that
affects their lives, while diminishing privacy rights of birth
parents and others involved in the process _ all of which has led
to heated public and legal debate on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   That has led to a spurt of television projects in which adoption
is a central theme. Beginning Tuesday, NBC launches ``M.Y.O.B.,'' a
single-camera sitcom focusing on 16-year-old Riley, who slipped
through the cracks of the foster-care system and onto the doorstep
of a high school principal named Opal, who may be the girl's birth
mother's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Such premises are tailor-made for hourlong drama, but they've
also shown up on sitcoms, where they've muted the lightheartedness,
providing an easily relatable way to show high drama and intense
emotions. On ``Moesha,'' for example, one character's nephew turned
out to be his son. Ray J. plays a street-wise teen-ager who learns
by mistake that his mother is really his aunt. He was the product
of an affair, and his father gave him up to the father's sister to
raise.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout has dramatically shifted the dynamics of this
comedy, making it one of the more tense sitcoms on the schedule,
and the season ended with no resolution.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Felicity,'' writers gave the character Julie (Amy Jo
Johnson) a complicated soap-opera scenario. She learns after
searching for and reuniting with her birth mother that her mom not
only married her birth father but also had two other children. In
the season finale, viewers are left hanging about whether Julie
will give a kidney to the dying birth father she's never met.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Abrams, the co-creator of the series and writer of that
episode, said they never thought twice about delving deeply into
the schisms of adoption and exploring how abandonment issues
re-surface with adult adoptees. To make sure they were getting it
right, he says, they consulted adoption experts who read scripts
for emotional authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew that a story line involving self-discovery was
one we wanted to pursue since, in many ways, it parallels adoption
and being a college student away from home for the first time,''
says Abrams. ``Both can feel disoriented and alienated.''
</P>
<P>
   That parallel was never more evident than in an episode in which
Julie first sees her birth mother and is virtually paralyzed. Her
difficulty in revealing herself alternated with scenes of Keri
Russell's Felicity revisiting her artistic passion, but it was
Julie's story line that clearly carried more punch. To her credit,
Johnson has managed to play the scenes with a sense of excitement,
fear and bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that the psychological importance of being
adopted doesn't just stop when you grow up,'' says Johnson, who is
not adopted. ``It kind of lies waiting to take center stage at
various times. In my own research for that particular story line, I
found that one who is not grounded in his factual history won't
feel substantial, and talk of feeling bewildered and powerless and
without a firm sense of self. I just hope we're being true.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, television's portrayal of adoption has been spotty, and
has often been untrue to the real emotional dynamics at play in
families. Adoptee characters on TV are usually angry, cynical,
volatile people showing up unexpectedly at the doorstep of birth
parents who either didn't know about them or weren't all that
interested in seeing them in the first place. Adoptive parents are,
for the most part, nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in ``Oh Grow Up'' and ``M.Y.O.B.'' In the new NBC
series, Katharine Towne plays the adopted Riley as a know-it-all
who masks her emotional vulnerabilities by verbally abusing
everyone she comes in contact with, including her aunt and other
teachers and students at the school.
</P>
<P>
   During her final episodes on ``Party of Five,'' Hewitt's Sarah
would learn that her disenchantment with life and mild depression
were a result of her feeling, as she put it, ``exposed, abandoned,
rejected and unwanted,'' as a child of adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who are adopted certainly have predictable and often
unspoken concerns about themselves and how they feel
disconnected,'' says Marietta Spencer, the former head of the Post
Adoption Department at Children's Home Society of Minnesota. ``So
seeing (that portrayed on TV) is hardly a crime. But if there are
errors committed by television, it's the way it makes all adoptees
seem like these lost souls who will never feel whole until they're
reunited with their birth parents. It's simply not true for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The language of adoption alone can be damaging, says Spencer. TV
has, for the most part, picked up words and phrases that show a
lack of understanding of adoption's intent. In the ``ER'' episode
when Dr. Weaver hires a private detective to find her birth mother,
references were constantly made about her ``real'' parents (as
opposed to ``birth'' parents) and that she ``was given away'' as
opposed to placed for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a lot of ways, how can you fault something like
television?'' Spencer adds. ``Even in worldly cities, people still
say callous things to adoptive families. But the fact that these
shows are on the air and talking about it can only be better for
how people see and understand the adoption process, though that it
may become a trend to be exploited concerns me.''

`GROUCHO': HE CAME TO SAY HE MUST BE GOING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Groucho Marx once said that the best line he ever heard about
show business was spoken by an audience member in a small
Midwestern town. Before he bought a ticket, the man said he wanted
to know one thing: Was the show ``sad or high-kickin'?''
</P>
<P>
   As recounted in Stefan Kanfer's new biography, Groucho's own
life was, in almost equal measure, sad and high-kickin', his
precarious, attenuated childhood leaving him with a lifelong
emotional legacy of insecurity and resentment, while fueling the
derogatory wisecracks and anarchic antics that would make him
famous. Not only would Groucho and his brothers patent a
high-kickin' brand of cacophonous comedy _ part vaudeville, part
theater of the absurd, part surrealistic satire _ but Groucho
himself, with his raffish claw-hammer coat, his waggling,
lascivious eyebrows and omnipresent cigar, would become an iconic
figure, the very avatar of iconoclasm and irreverence and plain
old-fashioned mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Groucho: The Life and Times of Julius Henry Marx,'' Kanfer
does a nimble job of tracing the outlines of Groucho's life and the
evolution of his antic art. The book would have been considerably
stronger had the author devoted more space to such comic
masterpieces as ``Duck Soup'' and less space to the later,
formulaic comedies; more space to the formative days in vaudeville
and less space to the comic's declining years. Still, Kanfer
conveys both a keenly felt appreciation of the brothers' inimitable
talent and an understanding of its sources in vaudeville, commedia
dell'arte and the boys' own refusal (or inability) to grow up.
</P>
<P>
   It is Kanfer's opinion that Groucho never really recovered from
being ``pushed out of the nest before he was ready'' and that as a
result he would internalize his lost childhood, remaining forever
``immature in matters of women, money and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the young Julius harbored dreams of becoming a doctor,
he was pulled out of school by his domineering mother, Minnie, who
made no secret of her impatience with her bookish middle son. By
age 15 he was part of a touring vaudeville act and left whatever
remaining innocence he had on the road. He had his meager savings
stolen twice by unscrupulous colleagues and lost his virginity to a
prostitute who left him with a case of gonorrhea, incidents that
would leave the teen-ager with a deep suspicion of people and an
even deeper pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   As Groucho's trademark persona evolved, Kanfer writes, the comic
had increasing ``difficulty separating the performer and the man
beneath the makeup.'' Though he left womanizing to his older
brother Chico _ Groucho was too insecure, too guarded to act the
part of the leering ladies man he affected onstage _ he
relentlessly bullied his wives, taking advantage of their
vulnerabilities the same way his mother had once taken advantage of
his. The ``hard clown mask he had created'' rarely slipped, even
when he was dealing with his beloved but misunderstood children. He
was ``incapable of expressing emotion, no matter how deep,'' Kanfer
writes, ``unless he came at it from an angle.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kanfer tells it, one of the formative experiences in
Groucho's life came with the onset of the Depression. While the
stock market crash of 1929, which wiped out the comic's carefully
hoarded savings, confirmed his apprehensive outlook on the world,
it also galvanized a skeptical, anti-establishment attitude on the
part of the American public. Henceforth ``such sweet, soft-edged
comedians as Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton would have a harder
time in this era; aggressive, impertinent personalities like W.C.
Fields, Mae West, and the Marx Brothers _ Groucho in particular _
would flourish by assaulting the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Paramount movies like ``Animal Crackers'' (1930), ``Monkey
Business'' (1931) and ``Horse Feathers'' (1932) served notice that
the brothers' sublime blend of nonsense and chaos theory worked as
well on screen as it had on the stage. Their 1933 classic, the
glorious ``Duck Soup,'' fared poorly at the box office, however,
and when the brothers moved to MGM, the studio's chief, Irving
Thalberg, set down a new set of rules. The horseplay in the earlier
pictures had been too unfettered, the ad libs too ad hoc, Thalberg
declared; to broaden the brothers' appeal, more story line and more
sentiment would be injected. While the result was undeniably a hit,
``A Night at the Opera'' _ and the increasingly mediocre movies
that followed in its wake _ presented a newly domesticated version
of the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of making sport of romance, they now facilitated it,''
Kanfer writes. ``Instead of whacking away at the powerful
institutions of government or the military or education, they
battled the toothless enemy of grand opera. At Thalberg's
insistence the crew of maniacs had become hilarious but harmless
uncles, like the later Laurel and Hardy. They were not outrageous
anymore, they were only frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Kanfer spends so much time anatomizing the decline of
the Marx Brothers' films and even more time recounting Groucho's
marital woes, the second half of this book _ with a brief timeout
to chronicle the comic's second career as the cult quiz master of
``You Bet Your Life'' _ often devolves into a sad litany of
disappointments and frustrations. What enlivens these depressing
and unnecessarily long chapters are the copious quotations from
Groucho's own work.
</P>
<P>
   These remarks (which can be found at greater length in ``The
Essential Groucho,'' edited by Kanfer and available from Vintage
Books) may show Groucho _ a k a Rufus T. Firefly, a k a Waldorf P.
Flywheel, a k a Captain Spaulding _ with his clown's mask firmly in
place, cigar in hand and eyebrows cocked. But like the early
Paramount films, they remind us, in Ben Hecht's words, of the
``perpetual Halloween called the Marx Brothers'' and the genius of
the would-be doctor born 11 decades ago Julius Henry Marx.

INMATES USING INTERNET TO FIND LOVE, SYMPATHY, MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by INMATES-TIPS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GABRIELLE CRIST 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Web sites read like cheesy personal ads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Attention, all you footloose, fancy and free ladies, I'm
seeking that special lady for a long-lasting relationship,'' writes
William Bauder III, 27. ``My favorite color is the color of your
eyes. ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeking an honest, kind, loyal, mature and open-minded
friend,'' writes George Picone, 32. ``If I were in the neighborhood
on a sunny day, I would swing by and drag you out of your house to
go to the zoo, play Frisbee, fly kites at the park on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for someone special and real, who still believes
in fairy tales, old fashion love and making dreams a reality. ...
Please don't be afraid, for I am truly a lost and lonely kitten,''
writes Lora Zaiontz, 34.
</P>
<P>
   But these messages are not found during a typical Internet
search of personal ads. To get to these Web pages, the search word
has to be inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Bauder is serving 75 years for aggravated sexual assault of a
child. Picone is serving seven years for conspiracy to distribute
methamphetamines. And Zaiontz is serving a life sentence for
capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   They are among thousands of inmates who are now using the
Internet to find pen pals, sympathizers and money through sites
such as meet-an-inmate.com, pennpals.org, cyberspace-inmates.com
and outlawsonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Toney, a Death Row inmate who killed three people in the
Fort Worth suburb of Lake Worth with a briefcase bomb in 1985,
recently used an Internet auction site in a failed attempt to sell
seats to his execution. Officials from eBay removed the posting
within hours.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates have no access to computers unless their prison job is
to repair them, said Larry Todd, a spokesman for the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice. Instead, the Web pages are created
by people in the ``free world'' _ friends, members of advocacy
groups and the companies that have made inmate Web sites their
business.
</P>
<P>
   But the words on the screen come from the inmates, who, not
surprisingly, say ``I am innocent'' more than ``I am sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates can benefit from communication with supportive friends
or relatives because it gives them an incentive to improve their
lives, prison officials say. But they warn that some inmates are
not looking for companionship, and are instead trolling for
pushovers who are willing to send cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to get ripped off,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   If inmates use their Web pages to proclaim their innocence and
solicit donations, they should be monitored, and in some cases,
removed from the Internet, victims advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona legislators agree, and have passed a law prohibiting
inmates from communicating with ``communication service
providers,'' which includes inmate pen pal services.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which takes effect next month, also prohibits inmates
from accessing the Internet through a computer or third party.
Inmates who violate the law could lose good time credits earned
toward an early release or could be prosecuted on a misdemeanor
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Justice For All, a Houston-based criminal justice reform group,
is monitoring the Arizona legislation to determine whether it might
work for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For victims, it is ``very, very hurtful for them to go to a Web
page and find a very sugar-coated version of what happened,'' said
Sharlene Hall, vice president of the advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   But families should have no say in the matter, said Charles
Sparks, operator of Ohio-based pennpals.org. They participated in
the criminal justice process by attending the trial. Once the
defendant is in prison, victims' families are ``out of the loop at
that point, justifiably,'' Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is their lack of freedom just the starting point? How much do
the victims get to prod these people?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Potter does not have a problem with inmate Web pages, as
long as they are not used to scam money from people.
</P>
<P>
   Potter, 33, was a friend of Darren Cain's, one of two people
fatally shot in Houston in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Victor Thompson is on Death Row for the murders of his
ex-girlfriend, Dennise Hayslip, and her friend, Cain.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web page, Thompson says he is looking for a pen pal who
will ``enter our friendship with an open mind and not judge me. ...
I am a very firm believer that everyone needs someone in their life
and I need you. I am a very interesting person with a lot of
character and I just need someone to share that with.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also proclaims his innocence, then asks for money for
his legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be prepared for any and everything that the state
is coming at me with, the minimum cost of adequate legal
representation starts at $25,000. But we're wanting to raise
$75,000 to cover all bases,'' Thompson says on his Web page.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone sends money, it will not go to Thompson's legal
defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   The money goes to his commissary account, according to a
disclaimer that the Web site operator put on Thompson's page.
</P>
<P>
   Potter said the disclaimer was added only after he and several
others repeatedly contacted the Web site operator, the Canadian
Coalition Against the Death Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, which consists of Toronto residents Tracy
Lamourie and Dave Parkinson, now also lists a link to the victims'
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Lamourie said she does not edit the inmates' Web pages, but that
she simply sets them up.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way that she and her husband could investigate each
of the 250 inmates on their site to verify the facts about their
cases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamourie said she and her husband, both 30, established their
site about two years ago, in hopes of educating others about
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more people were exposed to the realities and the stories,
then perhaps people wouldn't be so quick to support the death
penalty,'' said Lamourie, who works in publishing sales.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Kelly had the same goal when she set up a Web page for
her pen pal-turned-friend, Death Row inmate Michael McBride.
</P>
<P>
   McBride, a former resident of the Fort Worth suburb of Saginaw,
gunned down Boswell High School graduates Christian Fisher and Jim
Holzler, both 18. Fisher had broken up with McBride and was
attending college in Lubbock when he lured her to his Lubbock home
and ambushed her and three of her friends in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   McBride was executed May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who lives in Dublin, Ireland, said she began writing to
McBride after finding an inmate pen pal Web site during a boring
New Year's Eve 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the Web page did not accomplish what she had hoped, Kelly
said, mainly because of what McBride chose to put on it.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said she had wanted him to provide information about his
childhood, interests and aspirations. If people knew more about
him, Kelly thought, they might find his life worth sparing.
</P>
<P>
   But McBride insisted on writing about how he had suffered as a
result of the trial and subsequent death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said she tried to convince McBride to write something
else, but in a letter ``basically putting me in my place,'' McBride
insisted that Kelly transcribe what he had sent her.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before his execution, McBride wrote a letter to Kelly,
which she has since posted on his Web page. In the letter, McBride
says he confessed his sins to a priest:
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I killed did not have that opportunity and my soul
weeps for them. I'm trying to do my part, I know God does his, now
you do yours.''

   Hundreds of inmates now have Web pages on which they ask for pen
pals, romance and, in some cases, money. If you plan to become a
pen pal with an inmate, here are some tips:
</P>
<P>
   1. Don't provide your home address or telephone number, at least
until you become acquainted with the inmate to whom you're writing.
</P>
<P>
   2. Contact the inmate's prison unit before you send anything
other than a letter. Different prison units have different rules.
Inmates typically cannot receive cash, anything metal, or
photographs that are sexually explicit or suggestive.
</P>
<P>
   3. Before you agree to send money to an inmate's legal defense
fund, check the court file to verify the information he or she
provided to you.

DESPITE FERMENT, GENE THERAPY PROGRESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Utah, Pa., Calif., Md., Colo., Italy)   (The Science Times)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Gene therapy burst into the news last fall, when a
teen-ager from Tucson died in an experiment at the University of
Pennsylvania. But while politicians and the press have spent the
year focusing on accusations of lax government oversight and
shoddily run clinical trials, the science of gene therapy has been
making quiet, steady progress.
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, researchers say, they are finding new and
better ways to deliver genes to their target cells. Clinical trials
of gene-based treatments for hemophilia are showing promise, and
certain cancer patients appear to respond to gene therapy. The
field got a big ego boost this spring when French scientists
reported they had used gene therapy successfully to treat babies
born with defective immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with mixed emotions _ worry and regret, enthusiasm and
a little bit of defiance _ that 2,500 gene therapy scientists from
around the nation, and the world, gathered here over the weekend
for the third annual conference of the American Society of Gene
Therapy. It has been, they agreed, a roller coaster of a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's finally coming together,'' said Dr. Savio L.C. Woo, a
softspoken molecular biologist who, as the society's president,
found himself testifying in Congress on more than one occasion in
the past several months. ``We are finally seeing this glimpse of
hope that this new technology is going to bear fruit in the clinic.
And yet we have had this serious setback.''
</P>
<P>
   The setback was the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, who
suffered from a metabolic disorder and had volunteered for an
experiment to test gene therapy for babies with a fatal form of the
disease. His presence was acutely felt at the conference. In his
presidential address, Woo asked those attending to stand in a
moment of silence for ``the young man who has given his life in
pursuit of an ideal treatment,'' and ``to assure him in spirit that
the scientific community is galvanized to do our very best to help
fulfill his dream one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's death has had ripple effects throughout the field.
It touched off a discussion of financial conflict of interest in
gene therapy experiments, prompting the society to issue guidelines
barring members from running clinical trials if they had a
financial stake in the companies sponsoring their studies.
</P>
<P>
   It has also caused a slowdown in human experiments; an official
from the Food and Drug Administration, which recently issued more
stringent regulations to govern the conduct of gene therapy
clinical trials, said here that requests to test gene therapy in
people had dropped off sharply in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is in transition,'' said Dr. Robert Malone, a
researcher at the University of Maryland. ``I think it is
transitioning to a more sober, realistic recognition of what is
achievable. I believe there is a new humility in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rajendra Kumar-Singh is typical. At 32, Kumar-Singh is an
assistant professor of ophthalmology at the University of Utah, and
is just starting his career in gene therapy. He is studying
treatments for retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited condition that
causes blindness. By administering an infusion of gene-altered
viruses to baby mice, he said, he has staved off blindness for 10
weeks in animals that would otherwise have lost their sight within
17 days of birth.
</P>
<P>
   But Kumar-Singh said he would be cautious before testing the
therapy in people. ``Perhaps we were moving too fast,'' he
acknowledged, echoing the sentiments of some critics, including Dr.
Harold Varmus, the former director of the National Institutes of
Health, who felt gene therapy researchers moved too quickly into
clinical trials. Still, Kumar-Singh is optimistic about gene
therapy's future. ``We are seeing a revolution in medicine right
now,'' he said, ``and gene therapy is at the forefront of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind gene therapy is disarmingly simple: to treat or
cure disease by giving healthy genes to patients with defective
ones. But in the 10 years since the first human experiment was
conducted by researchers at the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md., the results have been largely disappointing. One
reason is that scientists have had trouble devising delivery
vehicles, called vectors, that can direct genes into the proper
cells and get them to function once they are there. Vectors are
typically made by inserting genes into deactivated viruses that
target certain cells, literally infecting them with healthy DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger's death, however, raised safety questions about one of
the most commonly used viruses, adenovirus, which causes the common
cold. In most patients, adenovirus produces mild, flulike symptoms.
But in Gelsinger, it provoked a fatal immune response.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Gelsinger's death, molecular biologists had been
turning their attention to a different virus, the adeno-associated
virus, or AAV, which is thought to be safer than adenovirus. Now, a
team of researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,
Stanford University and Avigen Inc., a biotech company, is
reporting promising results in hemophilia patients who received a
genetically engineered form of AAV that contains the gene for
production of Factor IX, a protein that is needed to make blood
clot.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Dr. Katherine High of the Philadelphia
children's hospital, began a small safety study after they found
the treatment could essentially cure dogs of hemophilia. So far,
six patients have been enrolled. The first three received the gene
therapy at a dose so low it was not effective in the dogs. But to
the scientists' surprise, the patients began expressing minute
amounts of Factor IX _ enough that it improved their conditions and
reduced their need for the standard hemophilia treatment,
injections of Factor IX.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were delighted, but skeptical,'' said Dr. Catherine S.
Manno, who is running the clinical trial. ``Only after repeated
measurements over a period of months did we become convinced that
these levels were real.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the hemophilia experiments are still in their early
stages, leaders in gene therapy say that, aside from the French
work, High's research is the most exciting in the field. Dr. Donald
B. Kohn, an immunologist at Children's Hospital of Los Angeles,
said, ``Hemophilia may be within a shot of being cured by this
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   The word cure _ the ``C-word,'' as Dr. R. Michael Blaese, who
performed the first human gene therapy experiment in 1990, calls it
_ is one that gene therapy researchers have learned to use with
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not talk about cure,'' said Dr. Alain Fischer of the
Necker children's hospital in Paris. ``Cure means forever.'' Yet
Fischer's work on babies with a form of severe combined immune
deficiency, or SCID (pronounced ``skid''), is the closest thing
gene therapy has seen to a cure. His study provided gene therapy's
advocates with what they have long lacked: proof, in principle,
that the concept can work.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's findings, published in April in the journal Science,
was a popular topic among the scientists in Denver. ``The field is
now an established principle in medicine,'' said Dr. Theodore
Friedmann, a professor of pediatrics at the University of
California at San Diego who said he had been pursuing gene therapy
since 1968. ``That's the story _ a brand new concept in
biomedicine, irretrievable, and it's beginning to work.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Science article, Fischer recounted the successful
treatment of two babies, both of whom had normal immune systems 10
months after receiving gene therapy. In Denver, he told reporters
that he had since treated three more children. Of the five, four
have had ``a complete or near complete recovery'' of their immune
systems, he said. The outlook for the fifth, who had severe
complications from infection at the time of treatment, is less
certain.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say one reason Fischer was successful where others had
failed is that SCID is particularly suited for gene therapy. The
first human gene therapy experiment, conducted by Blaese and Dr. W.
French Anderson, was directed at curing adenosine deaminase, or
ADA, deficiency, another form of SCID. But it has been difficult to
gauge that study's outcome because a drug, PEG-ADA, is available to
children with the disease, and scientists consider it unethical to
withdraw the medicine.

DENVER: the medicine.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Denver, however, an Italian researcher, Dr. Claudio
Bordignon, announced that he had solved that problem by being
``lucky to find a patient who was unlucky'' _ a child who does not
respond well to PEG-ADA. The patient, now 5, was given her first
infusion of corrective genes in 1996 and was slowly weaned from the
drug. She has not taken PEG-ADA for one year now, and Bordignon
said her immune system is functioning better now than before.
</P>
<P>
   He theorized that the drug may have somehow suppressed the
effects of the gene therapy. ``After discontinuation of PEG-ADA,''
he said, ``all the genetically-engineered cells have come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether, or when, gene therapy will ever become a part of
mainstream medicine remains a matter of debate. Most gene therapy
experiments are still being conducted in animals, and those being
tested in people are producing mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   At the Denver conference, for instance, scientists from Vical, a
San Diego company, reported preliminary results from 52 patients
who have been enrolled in a 70-patient study of gene therapy for
advanced skin cancer. In the study, a gene that alerts the immune
system to recognize and kill foreign tissue is administered
directly into the patients' tumors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Deirdre Y. Gillespie, Vical's chief operating
officer, 10 percent of patients responded extremely well to the
therapy, with their tumors shrinking in size by 50 percent or more.
In another 15 percent of patients, the therapy stopped the
progression of disease, and the therapy reduced the size of tumors
in some of those patients as well.
</P>
<P>
   Those may not sound like spectacular results, but as Gillespie
noted, there is currently no effective treatment for advanced skin
cancer, and the patients in the study had failed all other
therapies. In a sense, then, the cancer study encapsulates the
state of gene therapy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Blaese put it this way: ``For the average person, the progress
may look to be minor. But you need to put the developments of this
field in context. We just started 10 years ago.''

DEMOCRATS GO TO CONVENTION TRYING TO REBUILD TEXAS PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It is just past noon in the back parlor at
Threadgill's, the Austin restaurant where former Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower broadcasts red-hot populism over the
airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of restaurant patrons, munching on corn bread, seem
not to notice that one of the last liberal Democrats to have held
statewide office in Texas is speaking into a microphone on a small
stage near the window.
</P>
<P>
   The headphone-wearing host of the ``Chat and Chew'' radio show
takes a call from a disillusioned former Democrat. Hightower
advises her to vote as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't stand for us, why do we stand for them?'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   The short answer to that question, in Texas anyway, is that
people are not standing up for Democrats at the polling place much
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   As the party of Lyndon Johnson prepares to conduct its state
convention in Fort Worth this week, no one argues that the
Democrats' grip on power in Texas is the weakest it has been since
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The top Democratic statewide candidate is U.S. Senate hopeful
Gene Kelly, a perennial ballot box loser riding the popularity of
the late dancer whose name he shares. Kelly was not initially
offered a speaking role at the convention, and then declined a late
offer to address the crowd in Fort Worth. He has raised little
money for his race against Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   And after being wiped out in elections two years ago, Democrats
occupy no statewide office. Only the House of Representatives, with
four seats to spare, is controlled by Democrats and led by a
Democratic officeholder, House speaker Pete Laney of Hale Center.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats call it a ``rebuilding year'' in which they will focus
exclusively on legislative and congressional races at a time when
the state offices of governor down to land commissioner are not up
for grabs. The legislative contests are seen as crucial because
redistricting adjustments in 2001 could determine the partisan
balance of power for the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic consultant Ed Martin said it makes sense to ignore
the statewide contests this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at Kay Hutchison, who has already got enough
special interest money to make it difficult to beat her, so the
question is: Do you want to throw good money after bad?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the party is betting that the climate will
improve for Democrats statewide by 2002, when George W. Bush will
not be on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats complain that the party's woes have less to
do with what the Republicans are doing and more with their
self-inflicted wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many of our statewide candidates quit being Democrats,''
Hightower said. ``The result is that people who are naturally
inclined to vote for a party that stands for working families ...
that stands for old folks and children and family farmers, didn't
see the party flag flying for them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   THE `BATTLEGROUND PLAN': Democratic fortunes in statewide races
hit bottom in 1998, but some successes in the Legislature and
congressional races in recent years have bucked the trend.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Democrats outnumber Republicans in the U.S. House, 17-13,
hold a four-seat advantage in the Texas House and have battled back
to being one seat shy of a majority in the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Behind those successes is the so-called ``Battleground Plan,''
which, according to one internal Democratic document ``is the sole
reason the Texas House of Representatives still has a Democratic
majority after the 1998 elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the program is to fund combined media campaigns and
get-out-the-vote efforts in ``battleground'' districts _ those that
are competitive. Without any heavyweight Democratic contenders
statewide this year, the battleground plan is the party's exclusive
focus.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan, or the nearly exclusive focus on it, is not
without critics.
</P>
<P>
   Though successful in protecting Democrats in swing districts,
such as U.S. Reps. Martin Frost of Dallas and Charles Stenholm of
Stamford, along with about two dozen state representatives and
senators around Texas, some complain that party leaders
aggressively ignore everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're busy off trying to protect some moderate to conservative
Democrat somewhere from being beat by a Republican and spending no
time or effort in a huge part of Texas that is naturally
Democratic,'' said Ed Wendler, a longtime party operative and
Austin lobbyist. ``You can't win statewide if you don't run.''

NEW COMEDY JUST A SEASONAL BURNOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The worst thing about ``M.Y.O.B.'' is that, at one point in the
hugely misanthropic proceedings, the main character has to explain
to us dullards what ``M.Y.O.B.'' means. Like most of the
alternative weeklies and trendoid magazines out there, it assumes
each of us has the IQ of a tuber and needs to be reminded regularly
that we're too unhip to walk the talk.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the worst thing about ``M.Y.O.B.'' might be that
Lauren Graham, who will someday find a show that makes her a big
star, is once again placed in a rickety vehicle that will soon
sputter into oblivion with other series like ``Conrad Bloom,''
``Townies'' and ``Good Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for Graham, NBC knows ``M.Y.O.B.'' is a turkey and is
merely burning off the six episodes it ordered under the guise of
giving viewers fresh, new fare in the summertime. (Graham, a good
actress with the sort of expressive face made for TV, will reappear
this fall in ``Gilmore Girls,'' a new family friendly drama on The
WB.)
</P>
<P>
   In ``M.Y.O.B,'' she plays Opal Brown, a high school
administrator who we know is uptight because her clothes are. This
wouldn't be of any significance in the world of TV comedy, except
that the show itself bothers to mention it. When Opal kneels down
to administer CPR to the school's stricken principal, the main
character, a teen runaway named Riley Veatch, exclaims in just one
of her many too-precious voiceovers: ``Look at those skirts! Who
dresses her? Ally?''
</P>
<P>
   This sarcastic, TV-savvy patter is a large part of what Riley
(Katharine Towne) has to impart as she moves in with Opal, her
aunt, and expounds on all the foibles of the uptight world. The
rest is cynical, self-referential hoo-hah that's supposed to render
Riley the coolest thing since Skechers but insidiously works to
make her the most unsympathetic character this side of Dr. Evil.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one plank in Riley's manipulative platform of personal
philosophy: ``There's only one thing better than getting what you
want: getting what you want and pissing somebody off at the same
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about ``M.Y.O.B'' is that it offers helpful
hints, such as this one from Riley: ``I bet you were hoping this
wasn't going to be the typical TV show. But I mean, come on, it's
the whole fish-out-of-water, odd-couple, unrequited-love combo
platter you get most every night on every channel. So you don't
want to watch? Hey, that's OK. `Law &AMP; Order' is bound to be on
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank NBC for small favors.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   The half-hour Hollywood satire, ``Action,'' which Fox gave up on
way too soon, returns this month on FX cable. FX will broadcast all
13 episodes, including five that never aired on Fox, starting June
20 at 10:30 p.m. ... ``Freaks and Geeks'' reportedly has found a
home at MTV, but, as is the case with ``Action,'' it's not likely
any new episodes will be filmed. ... Fans of the canceled ``Now &AMP;
Again'' are using Tuesday, the anniversary of D-day, as a rallying
point to send postcards en masse to CBS Entertainment president
Leslie Moonves, hoping he'll grant a reprieve. That CBS address,
once again, is 7800 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036-2165. ...
KCTS/9 starts the 13th season of ``P.O.V.'' one of the best things
about summertime on PBS, Wednesday at 9 p.m. with ``Well-Founded
Fear,'' a documentary about seeking political asylum in the United
States and how the Immigration and Naturalization Service handles
these cases.

   The Texas governor dragged the money sack with him through four
Western states, raising _ between issue-oriented events _ a
targeted $1.8 million for his campaign, the Republican National
Committee (to spend boosting his campaign) and state Republican
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Couples paid as much as $20,000 to meet and exchange small talk
with Bush at some of the receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush and Gore both have talked about the need for new
restrictions on campaign-finance activities, don't expect that to
be a priority issue for either candidate. The only goal they really
have at this point is to be elected president, and money is an
essential commodity in &QL; 
reaching it.
</P>
<P>
   At the rate they _ and President Clinton _ are going, every
political donor in the country may be picked clean before Election
Day.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, Bush has raised more than $80 million, a
record, for his presidential race. The national Republican Party
also has raised at least that much in so-called ``soft money'' that
can be used to help elect Bush and other GOP candidates. And the
Democratic Party has raised $76 million, according to the most
recent reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure the campaign and local victory committees
prepare to conduct one of the most extensive grass-roots campaigns
in the history of American politics,'' Bush told reporters in
Denver, where he kicked off his western swing.
</P>
<P>
   As the presumptive head of the Republican ticket, he has an
obligation to his supporters and the GOP faithful to keep the
engine fueled, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet I'm doing my duty to make sure that those who are
willing to campaign by my side and campaign for me have got the
resources necessary to wage an effective battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The West is important to Bush's presidential bid, and not only
as a source of campaign dollars. The region, he hopes, also will
help provide the electoral votes necessary for a Republican
recovery from Democrat Bill Clinton's back-to-back presidential
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carried several Western states, including California,
the biggest electoral prize, in both 1992 and 1996. And California,
where Bush ended the week at a meeting of the Border Governors
Conference, will probably remain a huge obstacle for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush intends to actively compete there and in the region's
less populous states as well. And he did his best last week to make
Western voters feel at home with him. More than once, he pointed
out that Midland, his hometown, is in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from the West,'' he said. ``People understand that I come
from a part of the world where individual initiative and individual
responsibility are part of the credo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize there's a role for government, but there's also a
healthy disrespect for what government can do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of anti-big government message that has served
the governor so well in Texas, which, like the West, has a can-do,
up-by-the-bootstraps reputation with roots in the rough-and-tumble
frontier era.
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects a historical reality that has seen Texas lag
behind most other states in expenditures on education, health care
and social services important to people who don't even have boots,
much less the straps. It is a legacy that is bemoaned by many
Texans and has cost the governor some negative national publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Texas _ partly because of Bush and partly because of state
legislators from both parties _ is improving its record, and Bush
is quick to point that out in Texas, in the West and everywhere
else he campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's message, overall, is conservative, light on
governmental involvement and heavy on personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a philosophy that one has when you've been raised out in
the West,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also is betting it is a philosophy that, like his
fund-raising prowess, is not confined by geography.

AUSTIN, Texas: don't run.''

   In 1998, Wendler said he and a top aide to former Democratic
Comptroller John Sharp tried to persuade party leaders and
fund-raisers to fund an outreach program in traditionally
Democratic areas in South Texas and the inner cities _ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, who lost the lieutenant governor's race to Rick Perry by
68,000 votes of 3.7 million cast, said he directed several hundred
thousand dollars to drumming up support in nonbattleground areas _
but nobody else did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if we had had more money to produce our vote, if we
had had an Hispanic on the ticket (maybe we'd be better off).
There's a lot of `ifs' on the thing, and it really doesn't do any
good to point fingers,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   THE BUSH FACTOR: Although the politicians and their consultants
dream of what might have been, others suggest that Democrats are
losing elections because they either do not have a compelling
message or they have not been trying to aggressively sell one to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats have been basically messageless,'' said Ben
Barnes, a former lieutenant governor and still a loyal Democrat.
``If you've just got the governor selling and everybody else being
quiet, well, obviously the sentiment is not going to be there, the
pressure is not going to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Liz Chadderdon, a former spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic
Party, was more blunt. She said the party's legislators passed up
numerous opportunities to showcase their issues during the 1999
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   She said Democrats allowed Bush to take credit for issues he
fought them on, including the Children's Health Insurance Program,
which the governor initially wanted to fund at a lower level than
Democrats did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't another state in the country where Democrats would
have handed their issues to a Republican governor,'' Chadderdon
said. ``If they lose, they have no one to blame but themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Chadderdon's former boss, party Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm,
said Democrats are improving on the public relations front.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're encouraging our folks to do is go out and take
credit for what really did happen, and all you've got to do is look
at the record,'' she said. ``They're beginning to realize that
they've got to start talking about their accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE: The drubbing Democrats took in 1998 has led many to
despair, but party operatives are optimistic not only about their
chances in the 2000 legislative and congressional races, but also
statewide races two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are quick to note that Bush beat their nominee, Garry
Mauro, by 1.4 million votes in 1998, but the races farther down the
ballot were squeakers by comparison. In other words, without Bush
on the ticket, they believe that it will be a more hospitable
climate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question of how Democrats should position themselves
produces a predictable split along ideological lines.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals such as Hightower say the party should get back to its
populist roots, motivate ``working stiffs'' to vote and quit trying
to ``fish in the 20 percent pool _ the 20 percent who are doing
well, because that's who makes the campaign contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp, the former comptroller and a moderate who might run
again for lieutenant governor, said the road to victory is right
down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state is not a bunch of right-wing crazies any more than
it's a bunch of left-wing crazies,'' he said. ``The Democrats could
make a mistake, they could nominate a candidate on the left fringes
that would not be able to get money and not be able to get money
from the business community. ... There's got to be somebody the
business community feels comfortable with.''

 UNDATED: accurate, authentic. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. After Diana's death, many commentators began looking at her
life as a feminist parable. Did you?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Do I think the transformation of a socially privileged but
emotionally neglected child to a fairy tale princess, to a woman
with a problematic marriage who turns around a sense of
victimization to become a real activist in the world and fighter
for people's rights as a feminist parable? Sure!
</P>
<P>
   But is that the story of Diana? That's one story of Diana, isn't
it?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Are you implying more to Diana's story than has been told?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think of hers as the story of someone who was vulnerable.
And if that can be elevated into part of the feminist parable _
that one has both strengths and vulnerabilities _ I think that
would be a welcome development to our thinking about women.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Your highly influential 1978 book, ``Fat Is a Feminist
Issue,'' posited the idea that some women had eating disorders
because they had been under nurtured by their mothers. Do you still
believe that?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If I were writing that book today, I wouldn't write it in the
same way. But I think that there still is a way in which certain
aspects of female development are seriously unaddressed.
</P>
<P>
   I think today women are told that they can conquer the world,
but I don't think they are given the emotional equipment to feel
safe inside themselves. And food is the first relationship. If we
look at mothers' feeding of children, well, the situation is
profoundly worse than it was in the 1970s. We now have two
generations of women who ave been under tremendous assault about:
``You can go out there and be in the world, but don't forget to
look gorgeous and slim. And don't forget, you should eat this and
not that and you should go to the gym.'' As people felt less
effective collectively, politically, we've been offered our bodies
as the site of change.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So the prevailing idea, in your view, now is, You can't
change the world, but you can sculpt your body?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think that's explicit in people's minds. But I do
think that people, in the face of feeling unhappy about their
capacity to be effective, have found an area where they can feel
they are. I think you can see progress in Western countries in
terms of, certainly, certain classes of women's aspirations having
been struggled with. It's sort of like there's been a very
interesting price, which is an intensification in the breeding of
the bodily insecurity of women.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Back to Diana. How did you personally deal with her death?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not really sure I can answer that. I mean, it's shocking
when somebody you know and who is in the public eye has died.
Mainly, I spent the day warding off journalists.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did the harassment from the press directed at you help you
identify with Diana?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I have never admitted that Diana was my patient, even though
it's in the public record. It is not something a therapist can say.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when your house is surrounded and you have a clinical
practice to deal with, the other people you are seeing have a lot
to deal with they didn't bargain for. They are being invaded
themselves. I mean, finding pictures of us in the newspapers on a
daily basis. It was not nice.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In closing, your new book consists of eight composite case
histories of psychoanalytic patients. Many therapists, including
Sigmund Freud, wrote in the form of case histories. Why should
readers believe veracity of a form that hovers somewhere between
fiction and nonfiction?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My book is about emotional truth. Why should you believe me?
You don't have to. The question is, Is there anything there of use
to you? Any time a therapist tells a story, they are being so
selective. They are privileging one bit of information over
another. In the end, it isn't really the patient's story anyway.
It's the story the therapist makes of the patient's.
</P>
<P>
   With the book, I was trying to say, ``This is the therapist's
experience.'' If you look from the point of view of the therapist _
the scholarship, the learning, the knowledge, this heart _ what
I've written has a certain truth.

 UNDATED: scientists wrote.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Also intriguing are the different rates of NVP in industrialized
societies that have different dietary habits. The highest frequency
for a single country was in Japan, a nation fond of eating raw
fish, where 84 percent of the pregnant women in one study reported
experiencing nausea and vomiting. Raw fish, a dietary no-no during
pregnancy in this country, can carry parasites that could harm a
fetus in addition to making the pregnant woman quite ill. Likewise,
undercooked meat, popular in many Western countries where NVP
frequencies are high, can carry a parasite called toxoplasma that
causes serious congenital defects.
</P>
<P>
   But even cooked meat that is not spoiled can be a problem,
Sherman said. If the meat sat around unrefrigerated for a while, it
could become contaminated with pathogens like E. coli even though
it looks and smells fine, he explained. His evolution-based
conclusion: ``A pregnant woman's body responds to the smell and
taste of meat because this category of food in general can be
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell biologists do not dispute the role that the hormones
of pregnancy are known to play in touching off morning sickness.
Rather, Sherman said, ``the hormones explain how this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking why it happens,'' he said. ``Why do the hormones
cause these particular symptoms of nausea and vomiting and food
aversions? Why not headaches or backaches?'' Their answer is that
nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy is protective; it helps to
guarantee the next generation will be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Studies suggest that morning sickness has a genetic component.
Women are much more likely to experience it if their mothers or
sisters also had NVP Forms of morning sickness have also been
observed in domestic dogs and captive rhesus monkeys and
chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SHOULD A WOMAN DO? _ Women who do not experience morning
sickness should not fret, Sherman said, if they live in
industrialized countries where the food supply is safe. But neither
should heroic measures be taken to prevent ``normal'' NVP. The best
way to alleviate the problem is to always have some food in one's
stomach. Hence, the common advice to keep crackers on the night
table and to eat several before getting out of bed in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said he saw ``no reason to believe that suppressing the
symptoms of NVP would improve the outcome of a pregnancy'' unless a
woman developed hyperemesis, continual vomiting that occurs in only
half of 1 percent of pregnancies and which requires hospital
treatment. Ordinary morning sickness, he said, ``is a phenomenon
that is adaptive, not pathological. It's not a symptom of a failing
female body. It's a temporary condition that occurs early in
pregnancy when fetal demands are small and would not be a major
drain on a woman's resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also sees no reason to force a pregnant woman to consume
any foods to which she has developed an aversion. In most women,
aversions that start in the first trimester dissipate during the
second along with a waning of NVP.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all pregnant women should be taking daily prenatal
vitamin-mineral supplements, which help compensate for any
nutrients missing while suffering from NVP. Most important in the
first months of pregnancy is folic acid (or folate), which has been
shown to greatly reduce the risk that the baby will suffer a spinal
defect when consumed at a level of 400 micrograms a day. Since
January 1998, flour and grain products (foods that are unlikely to
be on a pregnant woman's list of aversions) have been fortified
with folic acid.

DENVER: the medicine.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Denver, however, an Italian researcher, Dr. Claudio
Bordignon, announced that he had solved that problem by being
``lucky to find a patient who was unlucky'' _ a child who does not
respond well to PEG-ADA. The patient, now 5, was given her first
infusion of corrective genes in 1996 and was slowly weaned from the
drug. She has not taken PEG-ADA for one year now, and Bordignon
said her immune system is functioning better now than before.
</P>
<P>
   He theorized that the drug may have somehow suppressed the
effects of the gene therapy. ``After discontinuation of PEG-ADA,''
he said, ``all the genetically-engineered cells have come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether, or when, gene therapy will ever become a part of
mainstream medicine remains a matter of debate. Most gene therapy
experiments are still being conducted in animals, and those being
tested in people are producing mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   At the Denver conference, for instance, scientists from Vical, a
San Diego company, reported preliminary results from 52 patients
who have been enrolled in a 70-patient study of gene therapy for
advanced skin cancer. In the study, a gene that alerts the immune
system to recognize and kill foreign tissue is administered
directly into the patients' tumors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Deirdre Y. Gillespie, Vical's chief operating
officer, 10 percent of patients responded extremely well to the
therapy, with their tumors shrinking in size by 50 percent or more.
In another 15 percent of patients, the therapy stopped the
progression of disease, and the therapy reduced the size of tumors
in some of those patients as well.
</P>
<P>
   Those may not sound like spectacular results, but as Gillespie
noted, there is currently no effective treatment for advanced skin
cancer, and the patients in the study had failed all other
therapies. In a sense, then, the cancer study encapsulates the
state of gene therapy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Blaese put it this way: ``For the average person, the progress
may look to be minor. But you need to put the developments of this
field in context. We just started 10 years ago.''

CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT WILL CLOSE BY DEC. 15 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine used the
occasion of a brief visit by President Clinton on Monday to
announce that the Chernobyl nuclear power station will be closed by
Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   After Kuchma announced the closing of the Chernobyl plant, the
site of the world's worst radiation accident, Clinton pledged $78
million in U.S. aid to help Ukraine pay for the construction of a
$750 million project that will reconstruct and stabilize the
structure now covering the ruined reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will also pay an unspecified amount for what
it calls a business incubator or economic development plan in
neighboring Slavutych, the city of 28,000 built in the 1980s to
house Chernobyl's corps of engineers. The aid will help offset the
dramatic economic impact the shut down of the plant is expected to
have on the local population.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the United States will give Ukraine an additional $2
million to improve safety at its four other nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine is the third-largest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of this decision is to reduce nuclear risks in the
world,'' Kuchma said after talking with Clinton. The decision, he
added, ``was not easy to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma made his announcement to reporters after the two leaders
met in the white-and-gilt splendor of the Mariinsky presidential
palace. Calling the decision historic, Clinton said, ``This is a
hopeful moment. It is also a moment when we remember those who
suffered as a result of the accident there.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 explosion and fire at Chernobyl, just 80 miles from
Kiev, killed 28 people outright with high radiation doses and
covered much of Europe with a radioactive cloud, causing untold
deaths and illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The sarcophagus, a hastily built concrete and steel structure
that encases the shattered reactor hall containing nearly 200 tons
of radioactive fuel, is now riddled with leaks and threatening to
crack open.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Ukrainians depend on the plant for jobs and
power, but even now, before Chernobyl is closed, Ukraine faces an
acute energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma had promised the group of leading industrialized nations
known as the Group of Eight that Ukraine would shut down the
plant's sole remaining working reactor by the end of the year if
they provided financial help. But until Monday he repeatedly
delayed setting a firm date, saying that Ukraine has not received
aid promised by the developing countries to finish two new nuclear
power plant reactors that were under construction in western
Ukraine before the Soviet Union collapsed. They are expected to
cost about $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official who briefed reporters said
that Monday's announcement represented a significant shift in
Ukraine's position.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement Monday, Kuchma said that Clinton had agreed
to solicit the other Group of Eight countries for help in
shouldering the costs. But with just eight months left in office,
it is not clear what Clinton can achieve.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting with Kuchma, Clinton also delivered a
speech to tens of thousands of Ukrainians during his six-hour
stopover on the final leg of his last scheduled trip to Europe as
U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the oppressors are gone,'' Clinton said. ``Stalin is
gone. The Nazis are gone. But you, the people of Ukraine, you are
still here, stronger than ever!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You must build a free and prosperous Ukraine,'' he added. ``Do
not give up. Keep on fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the president's speech, administration officials
said, was to show concrete support for Ukraine's independence,
which came with the collapse of communism nine years ago after
three centuries of rule by Moscow.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The visit to Ukraine was also a brilliant photo opportunity that
Clinton seized to the fullest. He stood atop an outdoor dais and
waved to the crowd, turning to the north, south, east and west. The
gold-domed, wedgwood-blue St. Sophia Cathedral and the central
square decked with huge U.S. and Ukrainian flags served as a
picture-perfect backdrop on a picture-perfect day. The cathedral
was destroyed by the communists in the 1930s and its reconstruction
is still unfinished. It was blessed and inaugurated last week, just
in time for Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a news briefing why Clinton did not mention the closing
of the Chernobyl plant in his speech, an administration official
said: ``It's Ukraine's reactor. There's a lot of emotional
sensitivity'' attached to the subject.''

THE WEIRD FASCINATION OF THE NEW IS PACKING GALLERIES AND MUSEUMS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British are nuts about their artists, and by nuts I
mean they are out of their minds. The condition shows no sign of
easing _ the reverse in fact, thanks to the Tate Modern, a huge new
engine of national self-congratulation spurring many ancillary
goings-on. Fresh galleries are suddenly open, including another
branch of the American dealer Larry Gagosian's empire. American
colonization betrays growing trans-Atlantic regard, a sure sign of
change.
</P>
<P>
   To be in London these days is to be endlessly entertained by
art, by the museums that show it, the multiplying galleries that
sell it and the masses who have become weirdly fascinated by it.
Entertainment does not necessarily equal enlightenment, but that is
where the art world is, at least this corner of it. The scene,
increasingly hard just to keep up with, is becoming geographically
almost as dispersed as it is in Los Angeles. Older Mayfair
galleries compete for attention with newer spots in the East End,
where various young artists live, and particularly with growing
numbers in Hoxton Square, once a gangland quarter, where it is
still not a great idea to wander far from the clutch of galleries
and fashionable bars clustered immediately around the square. This
is of course an asset, nothing being more appealing to a
contemporary art crowd than the frisson of slumming.
</P>
<P>
   People here act as if a steady profusion of activity plus global
attention means London has already elbowed New York out of the way
as art world capital, never mind that much of the work you see was
in New York first. Considering that the most talked-about show in
New York this season was ``Sensation,'' who can blame them for
boasting? I spent a couple of days looking around before the Tate
opening and found it remarkable to see a country fall so madly for
its art, or for its art scene, which is slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   It's love-hate for the British. Having generally loved to hate
whatever is new in art, they have come to love hating the latest
wave so much that it is now impossible for an outsider to
distinguish between reactions. The press certainly love and hate
art extravagantly here. The YBA's, or Young British Artists like
Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Tracy Emin and the Chapman brothers, by
this point understandably loathe the label, which no longer
applies, although they continue to feed and delight the local
tabloids with juvenile mischief to maintain their improbable
movie-star status. Competition for headlines, more fierce in
Britain than in the United States, accounts for a lot of the
emphasis here on shock art.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine Vogue Britain has even joined in lately, turning
much of its May issue over to the Tate and to several YBA's whom it
asked to make art inspired by Kate Moss. Now if that isn't a sign
that the British are nuts, what is?
</P>
<P>
   I started with a peek into Charles Saatchi's gallery, and in the
morning found people lined up out the door waiting to pay for a
glimpse of Hirst's latest chef-d'ouevre, ``Hymn.'' Ten minutes
passed quickly enough, although who can remember the last time a
wait was required to see a show in a private gallery (this one
sponsored by The Independent newspaper), with a fee charged for the
privilege of entering?
</P>
<P>
   The Saatchi show is one more YBA push, a familiar affair with
Lucas, Ron Mueck, Gavin Turk, Rachel Whiteread, Jenny Saville and
Chris Ofili of elephant-dung fame, about whose big decorative
collages there is now little to say absent the impetus of political
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The spacious gallery had the effect of making the art seem even
more slight. Mueck is a clever trompe l'oeil conjurer, and Saville,
aspiring to Lucian Freud, increasingly qualifies as a watchable
painter.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucas has achieved fame photographing herself sitting on a
toilet and casting herself in plaster from the waist down, naked,
cigarette inserted into vagina. Whiteread's sculptures of the
spaces beneath chairs, lined up on the floor in receding rows, suit
Saatchi's loftlike rooms; but whoever it was who said her works
resemble headstones at a pet cemetery had a point.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hirst, his ``Hymn'' is a two-story version in painted
bronze of one of those anatomical bodies showing internal organs,
inert, shiny and awful.
</P>
<P>
   London reviewers have raved about it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a man I stopped in the subway station who knew
perfectly well who Damien Hirst was looked at me sideways when I
asked how to get across town to Hoxton Square. You don't really
mean to go there, he said. I do, I assured him, and in fact the
place, rapidly changing, is already feeling gentrified. Jay
Jopling, the clever YBA dealer who runs the stylish Mayfair gallery
called White Cube, has just opened the newest place there, White
Cube2, a sleek room not unlike Mary Boone's former SoHo gallery
with the same aura of fresh minted money. Its first show, my next
stop, consisted of more YBA's, including the Chapman brothers,
Gavin Turk, Mona Hatoum and Emin.
</P>
<P>
   Emin's confessional art has made her a British teen idol. This
seems apt. Hatoum, whose sculptures include spiky wheelchairs, an
electrified room and a giant vegetable grater, is everywhere to be
seen in London now, another acquired taste, I suppose, like steak
and kidney pie.
</P>
<P>
   Turk has made a sculpture of himself as the dead Che Guevara on
a bier, his usual. Only the Chapmans, with a miniature reproduction
of a MacDonald's drive-through restaurant, were noticeable for no
other reason than that this was not one of their familiar
multi-genital mannequins.
</P>
<P>
   Do I sound grumpy? I am not really. A funny thing about London
is that one has a good time without seeing much good new art. Maybe
it's because everyone here seems to be enjoying themselves so
thoroughly. I liked a free-spirited video survey at a mostly gutted
five-story building in Covent Garden rented by the excellent Lisson
Gallery. The building is to be converted to apartments. Having just
been to the new Tate, which is simultaneously spiffy and gloomy
because of its vast Piranesian lobby, I was naturally inclined
toward the ramshackle ambience of Lisson's temporary quarters,
despite a few hazards. Pitch-black empty spaces combined with my
lack of coordination to cause me at one point to walk straight into
a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Several men, trying to look disinterested, lingered before one
of Vanessa Beecroft's videos of a barely clad woman parading as if
on a runway. Beecroft provides the art world's current excuse for
soft-core peeping, and her invitation-only performances are
primarily occasions for exclusionary bonding, a fundamental art
world right. I joined the gawkers briefly, then caught a video I'd
already seen at the Venice Biennale, a looping comic narrative by
Rodney Graham in which he plays a castaway.
</P>
<P>
   It is as lush as a David Lean production. Video art, having
gleaned more and more from Hollywood and Madison Avenue, yearly
raises the level of its production values while settling for ever
more diverse forms of amusement. Graham's exercise is the state of
art at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   That fact made the Hayward Gallery's overview of sound art,
``Sonic Boom,'' my next stop, seem anachronistic. It involves the
predictable buzzing, beeping, screeching and gadgetry plus kinetics
and video. A formerly viable-seeming category in the pregnant space
between music and visual art, sound art has been largely superseded
since the 1970s by video and installation art, which also mix sound
and image but more variously. The show made one wonder why there
hasn't been an exhibition about the relationship between modern
music and art, tracing the line from Franz Marc and Arnold
Schoenberg to Morton Feldman and John Cage to Robert Rauschenberg
and Nauman and Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greenhouse Effect'' at the Serpentine Gallery turned out
to be yet something else: a prim exercise in new work about nature
and the man-made. Trompe l'oeil dominated, with examples by
Yoshihiro Suda, Roxy Paine, Tony Matelli, Tom Friedman, Yutaka Sone
and Tim Hawkinson. Some of these artists have elsewhere been
exploring the link between science and art interestingly. But here
their fake little trees and flowers entailed much vapid
craftsmanship, and the Art Nouveau overview at the Victoria and
Albert Museum nearby infelicitously made for a telling
counterpoint, nature having inspired a century ago a vastly richer
artistic efflorescence.
</P>
<P>
   Craftsmanship by itself, a traditional occupation, has clearly
become a factor in contemporary art, improbably linking Graham's
video with Mueck's sculptures as well as with the ``Greenhouse''
artists and a lot of other work that one sees in New York and
elsewhere. Here it raises an odd point: traditional values seem
somehow to mix in Britain with a taste for abasement as
demonstrated by the YBA's and with spirituality to create what
strikes a foreigner as psychic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular art events before the opening of the new
Tate was a very beautiful, deeply spiritual show about Jesus at the
National Gallery, which has been followed by a show of works by
living artists based on paintings in the gallery's collection,
illustrating another kind of devotion.
</P>
<P>
   The other well-attended show was also tradition-bound, an
exhibition at Tate Britain about Ruskin, the most censorious,
biblically minded and nearly unreadable of art critics, which is
saying something. Ruskin, to his misfortune, famously failed to
grasp the value of the work of the American-born Whistler,
regarding him as a dabbling provocateur. I recalled how British
critics later missed the boat again when the Abstract
Expressionists sailed into Europe. Considering that Britain's
current condition seems like mania to an American visitor, maybe
trans-Atlantic communication always breaks down both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Perspective was sought via a brief escape to Paris, where the
renovated Pompidou Center, less ballyhooed than the new Tate, lays
out modern art via a finer collection in endless rooms along a
central corridor that seems to vanish to infinity. It looked
outstanding. Another wait in line was required to enter, but Paris
seemed blessedly quiet, unassuming and provincial after bustling
London, a respite.
</P>
<P>
   Among the buskers and sketch artists on the plaza in front of
the museum, a Japanese guitarist, a regular there, serenaded
English and German girls who smoked Gauloises conspicuously.
Upstairs in the rooftop restaurant, where the waiters dress like
undertakers and the dour D.J. blares Euro pop, young lovers in
bell-bottom pants and thick-soled shoes shared expensive salads.
The view was surpassing.
</P>
<P>
   I decided that maybe this is the age in which art and art
museums, not just in London, have devolved into mere entertainment
suppliers. But from atop the Pompidou, with Paris spread out below,
the current state of affairs didn't seem altogether without its up
side.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: SALUTING FLEXIBILITY, IF NOT THE FLAG, AT
SPOLETO 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES R. OESTREICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Bill T. Jones is not dancing, but Nigel
Redden is. It has been that kind of year here at Spoleto Festival
USA.
</P>
<P>
   Redden, the festival's general director, has become quicker on
his feet since 1998, when he took over the Lincoln Center Festival,
too, only to become mired in an international flap over the Chinese
opera ``The Peony Pavilion'' when its troupe was detained in
Shanghai. It took him a year to snatch triumph from the jaws of
defeat there by presenting the opera with a newly assembled
company.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a star-crossed season at Spoleto, and Redden is
hopping. The first crisis was the growing controversy in recent
months over the Confederate battle flag that flies above the state
Capitol in Columbia. Several performers withdrew from the festival
in protest, including the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company,
and would-be festivalgoers have boycotted in unknowable numbers.
Ticket sales, which were 17 percent ahead of last year in February,
are now 10 percent behind.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure reflects other factors as well, including a
second crisis: a severe spinal injury to the director of another
company, Antoine Rigot of the French circus troupe Les Colporteurs.
(A tightrope performer, he was injured off the job, while
swimming.) Redden acted quickly, bringing in David Dimitri, a
French performer known to the troupe. Nine of the 14 scheduled
performances will be lost, it appears, obviously affecting ticket
sales, but most of the troupe's planned run at the Lincoln Center
Festival next month is expected to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Redden's approach to the flag issue was necessarily subtler and
more multifaceted. Some of the boycotting performers were replaced.
And three thematic events were added, including an outdoor concert
on Friday and addresses and readings by Southern writers on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, the flag controversy is behind us,'' Redden said,
``for better or for worse.'' The State Legislature has decided to
remove the flag on July 1 to a Confederate soldiers' monument on
the Capitol grounds, where a monument to black slaves is also to be
installed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the writers' session, in the Riviera at Charleston Place,
was impassioned. Kendra Hamilton, a black writer from Charleston,
tied together the recurring themes, challenging the familiar
argument that what is being upheld by the flag and similar symbols
is heritage rather than hate. ``Heritage slides very easily into
hate,'' Hamilton said. She advocated instead a shift from heritage
to history given a cold, hard look.
</P>
<P>
   The concert, in a lovely setting at the Cistern on the College
of Charleston campus, offered an inspiriting set of gospel songs by
the Brotherhood, a septet from nearby Mount Pleasant, S.C., and a
performance of Copland's ``Lincoln Portrait'' by Steven Sloane and
the festival orchestra, narrated by State Senator McKinley
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the scheduled musical events also spoke to the
notion of a changing epoch, whether or not tied to a dawning
century or millennium. The official festival concert, on Thursday,
offered the American premiere of ``Surrogate Cities,'' a sonic boom
of a symphony from 1994 by Heiner Goebbels, a pathbreaking German
composer. This work, everywhere amplified, draws much of its
driving energy from rock. It turns the symphony orchestra on its
head, so that percussion dominates; the brasses fill out the sound,
and strings and woodwinds often provide little more than local
color.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer exhilarating sonic assault, heavy with sampling and
with vocal effects that could pass for it (or for percussion), is
barely suggested in a new recording from ECM (which of course also
forgoes the visual assault of spotlights repeatedly searching the
stage and the audience). It gave one listener a first sense of what
it must have been like to hear a big Mahler symphony a century ago,
with the whole notion of sonic possibility expanded at a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   This basic texture made all the more striking the isolated
moments of conventional beauty, like the old recording of a
haunting cantorial song, gently lifted, as it were, out of the
rubble. Or rubble it seemed. Literary meaning is elusive in this
work, with inspiration from Kafka and dimly scrutable texts by Paul
Auster and others, and the program book afforded little help.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of finding jewels amid rubble was enhanced by the
setting, the Memminger Auditorium, an old building abandoned after
Hurricane Hugo blew its roof off in 1989 and partly restored for
the purpose. Here was an opportunity for Charleston, so immersed in
its ancient history (not to say heritage), to reconnect with its
more recent history as well. The performance by Sloane and the
festival orchestra was a knockout, at times almost literally, and
David Moss supplied most of those remarkable vocal effects.
</P>
<P>
   The other work that conveyed a sense of epochal change was far
more modest: Bright Sheng's opera ``Silver River,'' which had its
premiere in 1997 at the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival. Sheng uses
an ancient Chinese folk myth ``of a perfect `heavenly love' that
can exist even between different species,'' in his words, as a
metaphor for a sort of ultimate Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk, unifying
theater with opera, both Western and Chinese. David Henry Hwang's
deft libretto turns precious at times. The music seldom does. Sheng
proves remarkably successful at juxtaposing Asian and Western
idioms in more or less ``pure'' forms. With due respect to several
wonderful performances on Friday evening, especially those of Karen
Kandel as the Golden Buffalo and Jamie Gwan as the Jade Emperor, it
was wondrous to hear the romance between David Fedele's flute and
Wu Man's pipa.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among other events attended was Moshe Leiser and Patrice
Caurier's production of Gluck's ``Iphigenie en Tauride'': notable
on Saturday, it turned out, mainly for its dreariness, in its
strained gestures of stock pity, terror or dementia, and in the
often mistuned playing of the orchestra, again with Sloane
conducting. In fairness, there were vocal consolations, especially
the ringing Pylade of Tracey Welborn, and the rest of the audience
seemed content.
</P>
<P>
   The festival runs until Sunday, when Redden can begin training
for his next dance, at Lincoln Center.

FCC APPROVES AT&AMP;T'S ACQUISITION OF MEDIAONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission on Monday
approved AT&AMP;T's acquisition of MediaOne, clearing the way for a
corporate merger that will create the nation's largest cable
television, telephone and high speed Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   In eliminating the final significant regulatory obstacle to the
merger, the commission gave the companies a choice of which
programming and cable assets they would need to sell to come within
the regulation that forbids any corporation from having interests
in more than 30 percent of the nation's cable market. The
commission had estimated that the combined companies, without any
divestitures, would control more than 40 percent of the industry.
The companies have agreed to sell some assets.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger was valued at $58 billion when it was
announced a year ago during a wave of consolidation in the
telecommunications and high-speed Internet markets. Those deals
have posed a particular challenge for antitrust regulators because
of the complex interlocking ownership interests between cable
operators, programmers and high-speed Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Time Warner, which will now become the nation's
second-largest cable operator, and AT&AMP;T have shared interests in
the same high-speed Internet and programming companies.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago the Justice Department's antitrust division
approved the merger after the companies agreed to sell each of
their interests in Road Runner, the nation's second-largest cable
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC went further Monday, ordering another round of
divestitures to bring the merged company into compliance with a law
that says only mergers found to be in the public interest will be
approved.
</P>
<P>
   The commission decided to give AT&AMP;T and MediaOne a year to
choose from three options to meet the 30 percent limit. They could
sell their interest in the Liberty Media Group, a programming
company that AT&AMP;T acquired an interest in when it bought
Tele-Communications Inc. last year. They could sell MediaOne's 25
percent interest in Time Warner Entertainment, a programming and
cable operating company. Or they could sell enough individual cable
systems around the nation to bring down their share of the market
to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives have not said how they would comply with the
order. They have said they hope to close the deal later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups were critical of Monday's decision, saying that
it did not go far enough in preventing AT&AMP;T from controlling the
rapidly growing cable marketplace. They said the commission
appeared to have caved in to special interests and that the
regulators should have used the deal to force the companies to open
their Internet network to competing service providers.

 &HT;    GEORGIA, UTAH COPS GET LOOK AT THE HOLY, AND HIGH-SECURITY, LAND
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ They took in the history of the walled Old City, but
from a police overlook and through the monitors of surveillance
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen Georgia and Utah law enforcement officials visited
Jerusalem Monday as part of a two week Georgia State University
exchange program to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring discussions on counter-terrorism, bomb disposal, drug
interdiction and common police practices, the program offers the
Utah officials a hand in preparing for the 2002 Winter Olympics in
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   They saw the command center where Israeli police watch monitors
from the more than 200 surveillance cameras that keep an eye on the
Old City. The Old City, predominantly Arab but also with Israeli
Jews and Armenians, is a tangle of tiny bazaar-filled streets and
some of the holiest sites in Islam, Judaism and Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The group visited the Western Wall, sacred to Jews. But, they
descended to it from a police station where paramilitary Israeli
police overlook both the wall and the Dome of the Rock mosque,
sacred to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   For the visitors, Israel's constant state of high security was
clear. While public surveillance and spot searches might put off
Americans, Israelis have learned to live with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Israel take security seriously because they depend
on it for their existence,'' said Tommy Tomlinson, a Georgia State
Patrol commander from Milledgeville. ``In the states, we often take
it for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson was on duty at Atlanta's Centennial Park in 1996 when
it was the scene of the Olympics bombing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth annual trip through the university's
Department of Criminal Justice. The program was started by
department chairman Robert Friedmann(cq), who grew up in Israel.
Several groups of Israelis have also come to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Dearden, Utah commissioner of public safety, said many of
the techniques used by the Israelis were in use during the Atlanta
Olympics. But, he said the trip gives him a chance to see them in
different environments and with time-tested improvements.
</P>
<P>
   For example, motion-detecting fences were activated too
frequently in Atlanta, sending police scurrying on false alarms.
But the Israelis have meshed them with camera networks that can be
used to see if the alarms are real.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli bomb disposal experts discussed the threats they face
from bomb-making instructions now on the Internet. The U.S.
delegation also saw an Israeli-made computer program for
coordinating law enforcement during a large-scale crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is primarily paid for by Georgia Power Company and
Dante's Down the Hatch jazz club in Buckhead.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A cool rain will fall over most of the Northeast on Tuesday as
low pressure moves off the Middle Atlantic coast. The heaviest rain
in the day is expected near the east slopes of the central
Appalachians where moist winds ascend the sloping terrain. Rain
amounts of more than an inch will be common in the interior
Northeast by early Wednesday. Farther west, rain will gradually end
from the eastern Ohio Valley and Great Lakes to the west slopes of
the Appalachians, but clouds will linger most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Drier air will spread over the Southeast in the wake of a cold
front. Despite plentiful sunshine, afternoon temperatures will stay
several degrees below seasonal levels. In the humid air ahead of
the front, scattered thunderstorms will bring needed rain to
drought-plagued areas of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Plains will be warmer than recent days as breezes from the
south develop. Sunshine and heat will persist in the interior West.

   Record-low temperatures for June 5 were reached at several
places across the upper Midwest early Monday. In Duluth, Minn.,
where record-keeping began in 1870, mercury in the official
thermometer plunged to 32 degrees, tying the daily record. Monday's
chill is made more impressive when it is considered that to set
record minimums, modern air masses generally must be colder than
their 19th-century counterparts records because of the local
heating effects caused by urban growth. &QL;

&HT;     KAZUE KATZ, A WAR BRIDE, DIES AT 80 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANNIE NAKAO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ She faced centuries of rigid tradition; he, the
mighty bureaucracy of the U.S. occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Kazue Nagai, resplendent in a silk kimono,
married young Air Force cryptographer Frederick H. Katz in 1946 in
Tokyo. She is said to be the first war bride of a GI in occupied
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Katz, a longtime resident of San Francisco, died of a
stroke May 31 in a Fremont nursing home. She was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The Yokohama native preceded some 72,700 Asian war brides,
46,000 from Japan, who emigrated to the United States between 1947
and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Another 70,000 war brides came from Britain, as well as other
Allied countries, such as Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of these marriages, the union of Katz and Nagai was a
love match.
</P>
<P>
   Katz, who died in 1971, was a native of Philadelphia who had
just been sent to Japan in August 1945.
</P>
<P>
   As daughter Linda Romo, of Santa Rosa, tells it, her mother had
gone to meet a friend in front of an Army post exchange in Tokyo.
When the friend didn't show, she went to a nearby park to eat her
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Katz was walking by and saw her sitting on the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Hi, do you speak English?''' Romo said. ``She said,
`A little.''' The two started talking and soon began dating.
</P>
<P>
   In six months, they were married, though not before Katz sought
and obtained 29 endorsements from Army officials, right up to Gen.
Douglas MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the type of person that if he wanted to do something,
nothing would stop him,'' Romo said of her father. ``He was driven.
If he wanted her, everyone else would just have to accept her.''
</P>
<P>
   The soon-to-be bride's parents were more than startled when
their daughter brought Katz home to Yokohama on the train.
</P>
<P>
   So were friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told her she was making a mistake, marrying one of the
enemy,'' said son Fred Katz Jr., of San Francisco. ``She told them
the war was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Many war brides faced severe societal disapproval for marrying
Americans. Some were even disowned by their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, her parents were very strict, especially when it
came to Americans,'' Romo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nagais, however, were eventually won over after their
daughter insisted that Katz ``was the one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They accepted him and learned to like him,'' Romo said.
</P>
<P>
   Once in America, the Katzes became celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   After they settled in San Francisco, the San Francisco Examiner
followed their family events, from Mrs. Katz taking the oath of
allegiance when she became a citizen, to her aging parents
emigrating to California to live with the family in the Mission
District.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Love Story Made in Japan,'' proclaimed one headline.
``Japanese War Bride a New Citizen,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember film crews coming over to report her story,'' said
Laurie Morton of Fremont, the youngest daughter. ``I think she
enjoyed telling the media about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Katzes, however, weren't fazed by the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Katz joined the National Guard, where he retired as a
sergeant major. He and his wife had five children.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Katz was far away from her native Japan, she kept up
her many accomplishments in Japanese culture, performing odori or
Japanese dance, singing Japanese songs and playing the shamisen, a
Japanese stringed instrument.
</P>
<P>
   She was won several awards for flower arranging, or ikebana, and
did brush painting. Active in the Japanese-American community, Mrs.
Katz often entertained seniors at the Hamilton Senior Center.
</P>
<P>
   She was also a working wife: a typesetter in the Japanese
section of the Nichi Bei Times, a daily newspaper in San Francisco.
And, for 20 years, she was a waitress at Tokyo Sukiyaki restaurant
near Fisherman's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   ``She met a lot of celebrities _ Jimmy Durante, Joe DiMaggio,
Karl Malden and Michael Douglas,'' Romo said. ``They didn't know
who she was because she never made a big deal of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Katz died just before their 25th wedding anniversary. His
son said the elder Katz had been planning to write a book about
``why I married a Japanese girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just love, and he was happy,'' said Fred Katz Jr.
``They really felt they were meant for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Katz also is survived by two other children, Alice Katz
Melillo of San Ramon and Susan Pea of Fremont, and 13
grandchildren.

 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The other morning a radio traffic reporter
looked down on Highway 101 south of San Francisco and reported that
traffic was at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no accident,'' he said. ``There are just too many
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy is booming, so there are more jobs paying more money
to buy more cars.
</P>
<P>
   Every townhouse built in the suburbs means two more cars on the
road. Every family that can afford to live in San Francisco can
afford their two cars, too. I once saw a whole family of newcomers
proudly drive out of San Francisco Honda with their own fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are a symbol of being American, so why not? As a car-lover
since my father bought his brand-new '49 Ford, I can't condemn
cars, despite the traffic misery and pedestrian deaths and injuries
they have caused.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, contrary to that traffic reporter, I think there aren't
enough cars and the traffic jams aren't long enough.
</P>
<P>
   The count of vehicles registered in San Francisco increased from
445,691 in 1998 to 453,905 in 1999. Not counting the cars of
commuters, that's 8,000 new vehicles on the streets in just one
year. That's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   People think they can actually get somewhere in these things.
And they must be constantly trying to get somewhere, because in San
Francisco there are three cars for every two parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   If there were many more cars, people would at least give up
circling the block looking for that mythical space.
</P>
<P>
   If there were many more cars and traffic jams, nothing would
move except for walkers, bicyclists and the public transit that
would have to be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, I'm not some goody-two shoes, NPR-listening hater of
internal combustion engines. I'm a driver and a motorcycle
aficionado (who wised up), but I'm also a bicyclist and a walker.
</P>
<P>
   The internal combustion I worry about is the kind I feel when I
drive, when I think I can actually get somewhere, and a little
faster than the next guy. A lot of drivers feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic, the parking and the madness aren't bad enough yet.
Everything will have to come to a complete stop before people turn
road rage into a demand for rational transportation planning.
</P>
<P>
   If we must have a Manhattanized downtown, let's have
Manhattanized transportation. You can still get across San
Francisco much faster by car than you can by public transit, even
if there's nowhere to park when you get there.
</P>
<P>
   The driving is just frustrating enough, though, that it pushes
people to speed, run red lights and ignore crosswalks. They're
killing and injuring pedestrians at a record rate.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the driving is not frustrating enough to bring
the cars to a complete halt.
</P>
<P>
   You hear a lot of baloney about San Francisco being a
``world-class city.'' Come on.
</P>
<P>
   There is no world-class city in the world where anyone expects
to get anywhere by car. They all have world-class mass transit.
They're all world-class walking cities.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco used to be one of the best walking cities in the
world, but now it's a city where walkers are in a free-fire zone
every time they step off a curb.
</P>
<P>
   When I moved here 25 years ago, you could put a foot into a
crosswalk without looking and the cars would screech to a stop. No
horns, no obscene gestures, just smiles from the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? The number of people stayed the same, and the
number of cars almost doubled. Rents and the pace of life went New
York on us.
</P>
<P>
   Last week two children were hit and injured while crossing a
street with their Montessori school teacher and classmates. The
director of the school, Roger Satterfield, described the current
mental state of the city as ``the adrenaline-panicked life.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great phrase. Adrenaline panic drives us at work, and we
drive to and from work in adrenaline panic. The adrenal glands
drive us to fight or flight, and we're flying and fighting all at
once on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The right turn on red has become part of the downfall of San
Francisco's civilization. It's now performed at full speed right
through pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   I say abolish the right turn on red entirely. That's just one
little thing San Francisco could do to restore civility in the
streets. That would slow traffic down, especially at crosswalks.
</P>
<P>
   The slower the better. A standstill, the best.
</P>
<P>

   Diamond Hunt
</P>
<P>
   Q. A few years back, I was watching a TV show about gems that
mentioned a state park in the South that was open to the public for
diamond hunting. Do you know where it is? _ Patti Winston, Savage,
Minn.
</P>
<P>
   A. Your fortune may await you at Crater of Diamonds State Park,
on Route 27 near Murfreesboro in southwestern Arkansas. It is 120
miles from Little Rock (not a very encouraging name for a diamond
hunter _ but, on a more positive note, not too far from a place
called Hope). Open daily except Thanksgiving, Christmas and New
Year's. Hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. most days, and to 8 p.m. May 26
to Sept. 3; (870) 285-3113, fax (870) 285-4169.
</P>
<P>
   The diamond-search area is a 36.5-acre field of diamond-bearing
soil called lamporite. Weather permitting, the soil is plowed
routinely to make it easier to sift through. Tickets to search for
diamonds are $4.50, $2 ages 6 to 12, and can be bought at the
visitor center; they are good only on the day of purchase, unless
bought after 6 p.m. Park officials say you can sometimes find
diamonds on the surface, so tools aren't required. But you can
bring digging tools (nothing with a motor on it), buy a small
trowel or cultivator for $1.37 each at the park, or rent larger
shovels and soil-sifting screens.
</P>
<P>
   There are 60 campsites in the park, all with water and
electrical hookups, and they cost $13.50 a night. Two bathhouses
contain hot showers and modern restrooms. Except for holiday
weekends, the park says, reservations usually aren't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   What are your chances of walking out of the park looking as if
you're ready for the Oscar presentations? The first diamonds were
found on the property in 1906, a 3-carat white diamond and
1.5-carat yellow diamond. Soon after, the owner sold the land for
$36,000 and a diamond rush quickly followed. From 1907 to the late
1930's, several commercial mining operations were tried on the
80-acre deposit, and all failed. Since 1949, the site has been
operated as a tourist attraction, with the state taking over in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   The largest stone ever found at the site was the Uncle Sam
diamond, mined commercially in 1924. The white diamond weighed
40.23 carats rough and was cut into an emerald-shaped stone of
12.42 carats. The largest one found since it became a state park
was 16.37-carat rough white diamond, cut into a marquise of 7.54
carats. In 1998, a 7.28-carat white diamond was found by a woman
searching the surface of the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Point and Click
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the fall, my wife and I plan to visit five Asian
countries, including Japan. I usually try to brush up on the local
language, but not this time. I have heard of a little pocket-size
folder with pictures on it that you can point to in order to be
understood. Is it polite to use these? And if so, where can I get
them? _ Joel Peck, Morganville, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although we've been taught it's not polite to point, Japan is
a country where many restaurants keep plastic models of various
dishes on display so customers can point to what they want. So keep
that index finger limber.
</P>
<P>
   Langenscheidt Publishers sells foreign-language phrase cards.
Each one packs about 200 phrases on a pocket-size laminated card.
They come in several languages, including Japanese and Filipino,
and cost $1.99 each from Hagstrom Map and Travel Center, 57 West
43rd Street, New York, N.Y. 10036; (212) 398-1222 or (800)
432-6277.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagstrom store also sells two folding guides with
pictographs for $5.95 each. One, by Langenscheidt, is in a small
book form. The other is a laminated folding card.
</P>
<P>
   And the Japan National Tourist Organization, (212) 757-5640,
offers two free aids. ``Tourist Language Handbook'' has 17 pages
with phrases in English and Japanese; ``Hello, Japan'' contains 100
pages of pictograms, travel tips and points of etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Jazz
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be returning to Kansas City, Mo., this summer for my
50th high school reunion. While there, I want to hear live jazz. Do
you know of any clubs I can go to? _ Jerome Evans, South Lake
Tahoe, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. John Niccum, the music editor of Pitch Weekly, a free
newspaper in Kansas City with extensive arts listings, says that on
most nights, there are about a dozen clubs and restaurants in the
city with live jazz. He suggested four clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Club Mardi Gras, at 19th and Vine, (816) 842-8463, is in the
10th and Vine Historic District. The original jazz club at that
site, also called the Mardi Gras, opened in 1929, and various jazz
clubs have operated there on and off ever since. There's music on
Friday and Saturday nights from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. with  $3 cover
and no minimum. Fridays are usually reserved for traditional Kansas
City jazz, with Saturday given over to the blues. Groups are
usually four to seven pieces. One wall is decorated with the
original 1929 mural depicting a Mardi Gras parade. Louisiana-style
food is served.
</P>
<P>
   Two blocks from the convention center, the Majestic Steakhouse,
931 Broadway, (816) 471-8484, is in the basement of a restaurant.
Live jazz is presented nightly, with swing and bebop the
specialties. Music starts 6:30 weeknights, 7 p.m. Friday and
Saturday and 5 p.m. Sunday, and usually stops at 10:30 to 11 p.m.
There is no cover or minimum. The building, dating from 1910, is on
the National Register of Historic Places, and it has tile floors
and tin ceilings. You can eat at the restaurant upstairs or in the
jazz club, and a cigar club occupies the third floor.
</P>
<P>
   For a more intimate setting, try the Phoenix Piano Bar and
Grill, 302 West Eighth St., (816) 472-0001. Swing jazz and blues
are the preferred forms here, with four- to five-piece groups the
norm. Music is offered Monday to Saturday, usually until 1 a.m.,
but if you want a seat, the owners suggest you get there by 6 p.m.
Besides table seating (pasta, steak and seafood are on the menu),
you can sit at the bar or around the piano. There is no cover
charge or minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The Club at Plaza 3, 4749 Pennsylvania Ave., (816) 753-0000, is
in the Country Club Plaza. This is a steakhouse, with the music
presented on the lower level Wednesday through Saturday.
Performances start at about 7 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday and 8:30
p.m. Friday and Saturday and last about four hours. Weeknights
typically feature three-piece groups with larger groups (up to 11
musicians) on weekends. Dinner is available, and there is
cocktail-table seating, too. The $5 cover charge is waived if you
order dinner; there's no minimum.

ADVERTISING: PEPSI TAKES LOW-KEY APPROACH TO MARKETING FRUITWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Blockbuster TV commercials. Glitzy news conferences.
Celebrity endorsers. The Pepsi-Cola Co. is practically synonymous
with this kind of big-league national marketing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   So it's somewhat odd that Pepsi's FruitWorks, a juice-based
noncarbonated drink that will compete with brands like Triarc
Beverage Group's Snapple and Coca-Cola Co.'s Fruitopia, is being
introduced nationally this month with comparatively little fanfare.
And it's deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   The soft drink giant has decided the best way to ingratiate
FruitWorks with the ever-fickle youth market is through grass-roots
marketing programs that it hopes will create a word of mouth allure
and hip personality for the new brand. While grass-roots marketing
has always been a part of selling brands at Pepsi, this time it is
the marketing plan, explained Robin Kaminsky, Pepsi's director of
alternative beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi is going this route after its vast research _ this is the
company that invented the Pepsi generation _ indicated that not
mass marketing, but very specific promotions and TV commercials
made especially for young people is the best way to establish
awareness for its new brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to talk to our target is not through mass
marketing, but through the kinds of one-on-one marketing that our
plan is about: linking with our target and talking to them the way
they want,'' said Kaminsky.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy to reach teen-agers 15 to 24, but as young as 12,
relies on an entertainment-oriented Web site, a sampling program
and a national promotion starting in July with MTV's ``Total
Request Live,'' a popular hit-countdown show.
</P>
<P>
   Central to its strategy of reaching computer-savvy kids is its
Web site, created by DDB Digital, a unit of Omnicom Group. Steven
Marrs, DDB Digital's chief operating officer, said the agency knows
from its experience as the creator and manager of pepsiworld.com
that today's youth are almost hard-wired to reject direct pitches
that dictate what is or is not cool. Instead, he said, the
challenge was to offer a Web site in which young people help to
create ``the personality and tonality of the brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've learned is that these kids are not like everyone
else, they are not ones to be marketed to and they have a desire to
go out and create their own space in world,'' said Marrs. ``So we
work with them to build the brand, and give expression of who they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site features a ``music maker,'' where kids can make
their own sounds and a place to create your own cartoon
frame-by-frame including word bubbles. Both can then be sent as an
e-mail message to friends _ which is a way for Pepsi to spread the
word about FruitWorks. The site began Feb. 8 and through May 22 had
102,000 different visitors, according to DDB Digital research.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to this market, it's important to be cool, but you
can't just say `we're cool,' explained Steve Hicks, DDB Digital's
creative director. ``We actually created a space where kids can go
and express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The FruitWorks promotion with MTV is also an un-commercial.
FruitWorks simply tries to be hip by association. For example, two
spots that will air only on MTV are about TRL's fanatical fans who
line up daily outside MTV's Times Square studios in New York where
the program is broadcast live. FruitWorks is sponsoring the
program's first home video release, and is running a national
consumer sweepstakes where the grand prize is a visit to MTV
studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense in a big way to tap into the Zeitgeist of TRL,
and not so literally be a commercial,'' said John Shea, MTV's
senior vice president of strategic programming.
</P>
<P>
   That the promotion was created by MTV's in-house commercial
division is unusual in itself. Big corporations typically assign an
ad agency of record before advertising on a brand begins. But Pepsi
decided from the start to do this differently, and so far there
hasn't been a need for a classic ad agency relationship. Still,
Pepsi's longtime agency, BBDO Worldwide, is working on media
planning and buying, Kaminsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi expects FruitWorks to be a top 5 brand in its first year
on the market, and that so far sales are 50 percent above its
projections, said Kaminsky.
</P>
<P>
   FruitWorks is late to market. Fruit beverages sold in
single-serve bottles had its fastest growth in the early 1990s with
the proliferation of so-called new-age beverages, led by the
phenomenal early success of Snapple iced teas and fruit drinks,
said Gary Hemphill, vice president of information services at
Beverage Marketing Corp., a New York-based research firm. Coke
introduced Fruitopia, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The market has since slowed, and last year grew about 7 percent
to $2.2 billion, Hemphill said. He said Snapple is still the
leader, with a 12.4 percent share, but Fruitopia is fast-growing,
with 8.5 percent of the market. In comparison, the carbonated
beverage market was flat at about $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company's lack of big advertising dollars behind
the brand has not been lost on its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are taking a low-key approach and it's just a
product that some of their bottlers need to fill up some accounts
to try to compete with new-age beverages,'' said Mike Weinstein,
Triarc's CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Snapple has become known for its grass-roots marketing and wacky
``best stuff on earth'' advertising, first with salesclerk Wendy as
spokeswoman and more recently with national TV commercials that
feature fruit come to life (which are actually actors in costumes
as bananas and peaches) to underscore that Snapple is all natural.
The newest campaign created by Deutsch, New York, shows Snapple
fruits at a health spa where they get in shape with gym equipment
and are ``randomly'' tested for preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But with Pepsi's powerful distribution system FruitWorks'
potential cannot be underestimated. Hemphill said he believes Pepsi
aims to do in the juice-based category what it did in the iced tea
market. Snapple created that category with its all-natural iced
teas back in the 1980s, but it was overtaken by Lipton several
years ago. Lipton Iced Tea is marketed by the Pepsi-Lipton Tea
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Pepsi, it's really about their distribution system _ that
sets them apart from the competition,'' said Hemphill. ``I think
this gives FruitWorks an excellent opportunity to be successful.
You'll see it almost everywhere you see Pepsi-cola products.''

AIRLINES MOVE TO FLY PETS AS CARGO, NOT CHECKED LUGGAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several major airlines announced rules last month restricting
pets traveling as passengers' checked luggage in the baggage
compartments of planes, at least during the summer. But industry
sources say that seasonal embargoes are just the beginning and that
airlines are soon likely to require that pets going by air be
handled by commercial shippers, a more expensive proposition for
the owners. A medium-size dog traveling as luggage may cost $50 one
way; shipped professionally, with someone charged with going to
retrieve the kennel if the weather turns bad or the flight is
canceled, the cost may be $700. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pet owners may be unhappy, but the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which considers air travel a poor
choice for pets, is on the airlines' side, said Nancy Blaney, who
heads the organization's national legislative office in Washington.
The hazards are great if animals end up waiting among the suitcases
in extreme heat or cold when a connection is missed. The ASPCA,
along with other animal advocates, believes the hazards are
lessened if cargo companies take on the task when animals
absolutely must travel by air. Animals with breathing difficulties,
pug-nosed ones for example, should never go by air, experts say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The airlines' recent actions do not affect the transport of
small animals _ cats, small dogs, hamsters and such _ in the cabin
in under-the-seat kennels; this is still permitted, with limits on
numbers, by seven major domestic airlines, but not Southwest, which
does not carry pets at all.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Delta Air Lines said on May 12 that it was embargoing the
travel of pets as checked luggage for June, July and August, and 10
days later Continental announced a year-round rule that after June
1 larger pets would be accepted as cargo only, the steps did not
seem to be linked directly to recent Congressional adoption of the
``Boris Bill,'' which requires airlines to report to the government
the total number of animals carried and how many die or are
injured. Boris is a dog whose dreadful trip to New York in 1996
gave rise to a campaign for greater care for animals in the air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new restrictions come at the season when extreme heat often
leads airlines to refuse animals anyway. In addition, airline
spokesmen say the number of people taking their pets on vacation
has been rising steadily, although no one has an accurate count. As
one airline spokesman said on condition of anonymity, an airline
would rather pass up the $50 it charges for checking an animal as
luggage than risk the barrage of bad publicity that follows a pet's
injury or death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that dogs and cats cannot travel by air.
Despite the apparent anomaly, experts agree that they usually
travel better as cargo than as accompanied luggage. Continental's
new rule requires owners to ship pets as cargo with the company's
Quickpak Live Animal Program, which the line says has a 24-hour
help desk and climate-controlled vehicles for connections in
Houston or Newark. The airline says the cost depends on the size of
the kennel, with an average price of $170. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pet owners may also use professional animal shippers, although
shippers generally say they do not move pets for vacation trips.
There are 93 worldwide members of the Independent Pet and Animal
Transportation Association, Box 747, Highway 2869, Big Sandy, Texas
75755; www.ipata.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These companies transport animals for families that are moving.
Millie Woolf, head of Air Animals in Tampa, Fla. (Web site
www.airanimal.com) and spokeswoman for the group, said: ``The
airlines have more control over cargo than over luggage. It's
booked in advance and prearranged.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for accommodating the vacationing dog, she said she would
work it out, but it is an impractical option. She said she took
animals only from clients like IBM that had established an identity
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a week to make an individual person a known shipper,''
she said. ``It will cost a minimum of $700 each way because if it
is going to be a hot day, I have to pick up the animal to get it to
the airport at 6 a.m. while it's still cool. And make arrangements
for it to be met. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman from Miami called me last week because her dog had to
go to Boston for his four weeks at the lake. I told her it would
cost $1,000 each way. The weather's fine now. When that dog comes
back, it will be too hot in Miami. To be sure the animal arrives in
a cool period, I may have to route it through California on the red
eye. That can't be good for a dog. We recommend a dog sitter.'' &QL;
</P>

Association at www.air-transport.org; click on Pet Travel

</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By THEODORE HSIEN WANG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The harsh treatment of Wen Ho Lee has awakened
and energized many Asian-Americans who will no longer be silent.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Lee has been held in solitary
confinement, a target of an FBI investigation that to date has
produced no accusations of espionage. Lee, 60, a former mid-level
scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, was
arrested in December and indicted on 59 counts of mishandling
nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising element of Lee's case has been its impact on
Asian-Americans. His case has mobilized widespread community
support among Asian-Americans as have few other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Grass-roots groups and volunteers have emerged to support Lee,
raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for his legal defense and
sending thousands of letters and petitions to national leaders
seeking fair treatment for him.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a national coalition will hold a day of protest to
mark six months of incarceration for Lee. Demonstrations, rallies
and other events are planned in 10 cities, from San Francisco to
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   What is it about Wen Ho Lee that speaks to so many
Asian-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   First, a sense of injustice, that the government has targeted
Lee because it thinks that Chinese-Americans are likely to spy for
China.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe the government is seeking an easy and politically
powerless scapegoat to explain away security problems uncovered at
our nation's nuclear laboratories. The government's actions provide
plenty of support for these theories.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the following:
</P>
<P>
   After Lee passed a polygraph test indicating that he did not
commit espionage in December 1998, federal agents told him that he
had failed the test and threatened that he could be executed unless
he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   The former chief of counterintelligence at the Los Alamos
laboratory stated that Lee's ethnicity was a major factor in the
espionage investigation. Non-Asians who had similar contacts with
China were not investigated.
</P>
<P>
   After telling the news media that Lee has given away the crown
jewels, information about this country's nuclear warheads,
government officials later admitted that this information was not
even available at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   While the government has not charged Lee with espionage, it
continues to deny him bail on grounds that he may turn over
sensitive information to foreign agents.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called crown jewels that Lee allegedly downloaded to
unsecured computer systems were in reality data that had a
restrictive, low-level classification. After the government began
to investigate Lee, it gave these documents a higher security
designation.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden change creates the appearance that the government is
trying to manipulate security designations to build its case
against Lee.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Washington Post, Lee may be the first civilian
ever prosecuted for simply mishandling classified data. Many other
non-Asian individuals who committed similar transgressions, most
notably former CIA Director John Deutch, have not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   A second reason that Lee's case has touched a nerve among
Asian-Americans is because many see a bit of themselves in him.
Like Lee, many Asian-Americans came to this country for education
and employment, and in the process created new homes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these first-generation immigrants consider themselves
Americans and are proud of their contributions to the high-tech
industry, education and other areas where Asian-Americans are well
represented. Yet, despite all of their achievements, Lee's
situation exposes a vulnerability that these professionals face.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how accomplished or prosperous Asian-Americans may
become in America, they are still widely perceived as foreigners
who cannot be completely trusted in sensitive positions. It is a
stereotype that undermines Asian-American claims to be equal
members of our society and can have devastating consequences for
individuals, as Lee's case illustrates.
</P>
<P>
   With the large numbers of Asian-Americans who work in high-tech,
research and other positions with access to secret or classified
information, it is hardly surprising that many believe that Lee's
case will have real consequences for their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   While Lee's case has brought Asian-Americans together, the
challenge remains to build a movement that can prevent these cases
from recurring. Those who are passionate about Lee's case and about
stopping the government from considering ethnicity as a basis for
espionage investigations must recognize that Asian-Americans are
far from alone in facing discrimination. Broader alliances are
needed to eliminate racial stereotypes through civil rights
enforcement and public education.
</P>
<P>
   In defending Lee, Asian-Americans have the opportunity not only
to advocate for themselves but for others who continue to face
discrimination.
</P>

TRYING HIS HAND AT SPAM HAIKUS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because I work at home with no adult supervision, I spend a good
part of the day browsing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of worthwhile, educational things on the Internet
and it took me some time to learn how to avoid those and find the
stuff I was really interested in, such as trash, smut and other
things of no practical value.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you don't have to search too long to find this
stuff. The Internet is many things to many people, but at its core
it's a haven for lonely guys with far too much time on their hands.
Why Al Gore wanted to claim invention of this thing is beyond me.
</P>
<P>
   I realize that some of you may be intimidated or bewildered by
things having to do with computers and that is certainly
understandable. The media has done a poor job explaining the new
technology, possibly because they don't understand it themselves. I
followed the Microsoft antitrust case for months and I'm still not
entirely clear what it was all about. Something having to do with
``browser,'' who I thought was the guy from Sha Na Na with the
really deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that while computers themselves are
complicated and expensive and more unreliable than a Chevy Corvair
(If someone runs into the back of your personal computer, the gas
tank may explode. I'm kidding. I think.), computer content is often
refreshingly loony and pointless.
</P>
<P>
   Like a sharpened pork-product dagger to the heart, this
observation was driven home recently with the discovery of an
utterly useless, and therefore fascinating, Web site called Spam-Ku
Archive (http://pemtropics.mit.edu/jcho/spam/archive.html(NUMBER
SIGN)select). The purpose, if one could call it that, is to create
a haiku (three unrhymed lines of 5, 7 and 5 syllables respectively)
dealing with America's favorite canned luncheon-meat-like product,

`MYOB': SHOW VEERS BETWEEN `ANTI-SITCOM' AND WARM AND FUZZY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``MYOB,'' which begins Tuesday on NBC, is electroplated with
attitude. That coating scratches easily, though, revealing the
sentimentality underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom, from a concept by Don Roos, writer and director of
the film ``The Opposite of Sex,'' strikes a subversive pose, as if
it were the opposite of network television. Much of its humor is
directed at the medium's dumb conventions. But the darts it throws
have rubber tips; they hit the target without inflicting damage.
</P>
<P>
   From the first lines of narration from a 16-year-old girl named
Riley (Katherine Towne), you can hear the show straining to be
cool. When first encountered, Riley, a tough-talking little blonde
in tight clothes, has just flown into San Francisco. She accepts a
cab ride from a giggling ninny with a lecherous look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' Riley tells you. ``Nothing bad happens to me.
This isn't a TV movie where, I like, end up murdered and my mom has
to pose as a hooker to help track down the murderer.'' True to her
word, Riley out-foxes the guy after she gets a free meal in his
hotel room, meanwhile sprinkling her narration with wry remarks
about television in general and other NBC series in particular.
</P>
<P>
   But speaking of her mom, it turns out that's who she's looking
for. See, Riley was adopted as a baby, but when she was 4 her
adoptive mother died in a post office shootout _ ``She was the
idiot with the gun.'' How Riley got from then to now isn't
specified.
</P>
<P>
   Riley has a copy of what might be her birth certificate, hacked
from a government computer, which leads her to a woman she thinks
is her birth mother's sister Opal (Lauren Graham), an earnest
assistant principal in a Northern California high school. Opal's
sister, Pearl _ yes, some of this is funny _ who moved to Finland
with her guru 14 years ago, says by e-mail that she never had a
baby. But even Opal allows that crazy Pearl might not remember.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, the love-starved Opal must cope with the arrival
of someone claiming to be her kin, the sudden death of the school's
principal and his quick replacement by Opal's crumb of an
ex-boyfriend, Mitch (Paul Fitzgerald), whom Opal still loves even
though he dumped her long ago and has now stolen the job she
deserved. Whew!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Opal takes Riley home. They start bonding. Riley tells
her, ``Maybe you're worth more than you think.'' Then Riley
blackmails the school superintendent, who turns out to be the creep
who picked Riley up at the airport, into making Opal principal
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Riley plays little miss fix-it again when Opal has a
falling-out with her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   So which is it? Subversive anti-sitcom or warm and fuzzy?
``MYOB'' _ that stands of course for ``mind your own business,''
which Riley cannot do _ tries to split the difference. And despite
its ironic veneer, the show just doesn't have enough difference to
split.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Tuesday's episode, which Roos wrote, Riley throws
down a challenge: ``So you don't wanna watch? Hey, that's OK `Law
and Order' is bound to be on somewhere.'' Great. Where?

   NEW YORK _ New York City's struggle with New York Apple Tours
since a pedestrian was killed May 22 by a company bus whose driver
was not properly licensed has put the city's tourism infrastructure
in a bad light.
</P>
<P>
   The accident led to a state shutdown of the company, pending a
hearing Tuesday. But increasingly over the last few years,
neighborhoods have complained of violations of bans on commercial
traffic on certain streets, of buses idling at the curb for long
periods or making illegal stops, and varied other offenses
</P>
<P>
   But there are positive aspects to bus tours, even for grumbling
New York residents. Tourism is booming; the city expects to receive
34 million tourists this year, up from 30.3 million in 1996.
Because many of these visitors want to see the famous sights _
Greenwich Village, Wall Street, the Dakota apartments, the Statue
of Liberty _ a bus tour, with 50 to 80 passengers, is far more
efficient than the same number of people in automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Two major companies are still operating hop-on hop-off loop
tours like New York Apple's. At Gray Line, (212) 695-0001, Lee
Gelber, the manager of sales, says 31 double-decker buses and 25 to
30 regular buses are used, depending on demand. Their tours are
conducted in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway Bus Tours (877) 693-3253, which uses the name
Double-Decker Tours, has 14 English double-deckers and 10 new
Neoplan double-deckers. It offers tours in English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But there are alternatives to sitting on a bus mired in traffic
in the center of Manhattan. Booking anonymously, I recently found
myself on two tours guided by enthusiastic young New Yorkers who
know their material and ably unfold the city and its history for
strangers: Peggy Taylor, a Manhattanite originally from Montgomery,
Ala., conducts tours in five languages for Harlem Spirituals, and
David Wayne Parker of Astoria, Queens, is a guide aboard Circle
Line vessels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UP TO HARLEM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taylor was the guide on one of four buses Harlem Spirituals sent
off at 9 a.m. on a Wednesday on its Gospel on a Weekday tour. Her
busload spoke English or German _ all but three were from overseas
_ and she described our surroundings in both, but she can also work
in French, Italian or Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Her talk was filled with grace notes. Pointing to Avery Fisher
Hall, she said it was where Kurt Masur, ``who came from Leipzig,''
presided over the Philharmonic, but that he might soon be leaving
New York. ``And there is the most beautiful building in New York,''
she said, pointing to an old-timer on Broadway, ``where I live.''
</P>
<P>
   As the bus moved north, she described Harlem, its origins as a
fashionable resort, its shift to a black and Hispanic community,
its varied character and the streets where Malcolm X, Duke
Ellington and other famous figures lived. At the former Hotel
Teresa, she mentioned Fidel Castro as its most notable guest. She
also pointed out that Ronald H. Brown, the commerce secretary who
was killed in a 1996 plane crash, grew up there because his father
managed it.
</P>
<P>
   I was curious about what gospel music would be offered on a
weekday morning. Taylor said the Addicts Rehabilitation Choir sings
at a church near its rehab center. ``It is not a true church
service of the sort you see on Sunday,'' she said, ``but a
combination service and concert.'' The gathering is parallel to the
``hour of power'' services held elsewhere from 11 a.m. to noon on
Wednesdays, but with music.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers of the four buses all but filled the Mount Moriah
Baptist Church on Fifth Avenue and 126th Street, which the tour
company rents. Local people, including several small children, were
also in the sanctuary, and the choir of 24 people wore red and gold
robes marked ``ARC.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hour, familiar songs, including ``Higher and Higher,''
were sung, and testimony to God's power was offered by congregants
and choir members. A homily and a collection were part of the
service. The robed leader asked at random where the visitors came
from, and each country name was applauded.
</P>
<P>
   Muriel Samama, president of Harlem Spirituals, said in an
interview later that her company supported the Addicts
Rehabilitation Center financially and otherwise. On Sundays, she
said, a huge number of her buses take tourists to regular services
throughout Harlem. She said all churches were notified of how many
were coming, and unless tourists were properly dressed, meaning not
in shorts and halter tops, the tour company would not take them.
</P>
<P>
   The weekday gospel tour of three and a half hours, without an
optional lunch, costs $35; with lunch in Harlem at Emily's Southern
cuisine restaurant or a similar place, $65. Information: (212)
391-0900.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON THE WATER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although I usually urge newcomers to take an around-the-island
cruise so they can grasp how New York's geography became its
destiny, on Memorial Day I tested the two-hour Semicircle Cruise,
which left 42nd Street at 3:30 p.m. and returned at 5:30 p.m. The
Circle Line XV cruised down the Hudson, passing close to Ellis
Island and the Statue of Liberty, and up the East River to the
United Nations and back again. I bought a senior ticket for $16
(regular fare is $20, $10 for children under 12).
</P>
<P>
   The on-board guide I drew was Parker. He told his listeners when
to prepare to take a picture of the Woolworth Building (``my
favorite'') as it materialized between the World Trade Towers. He
gave details on the symbolism of the Statue of Liberty, including
the figure's stepping forward out of chains, and spoke of the
heartbreak of the division of immigrant families early in the
century as part of the government's screening for disease.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's work as a drama student at Brooklyn College enhanced
his talk. He said in an interview that he and his fellow guides
divided up the reading of the daily papers to keep their
information up to date on where parks and buildings are under
construction. Like Taylor, Parker cited places that appear as
settings for notable movies, like the dock areas used in ``On the
Waterfront.''
</P>
<P>
   An advantage of the waterborne tour is the chance to look at
things for a while; the drawback is the inability to quit at will.
As compensation, it's easy to walk around on a vessel that can
accommodate 600 passengers. Coffee, beer, wine and snacks are
available. Circle Line information: (212) 563-3200.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ON AND OFF
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gray Line, the biggest tour operator in New York, offers a
panoply of bus tours, including a Sunday Harlem gospel tour. The
bulk of the company's business, according to Gelber, who trains the
company's 180 guides, goes to the two tours that allow tourists to
get on and off to visit 50 Manhattan sights. A two-day ticket costs
$35, $23 for children up to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Gelber said that because of heavy traffic and the proliferation
of tour buses, his company had made a few trims in its tours ``for
time, driver morale and good neighborhood relations.'' It cut off a
double loop around Carnegie Hall, for instance, he said, and does
not try to drive through Brooklyn Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Gray Line gives all of its tour-takers a 98-page guide with
cartoons and maps, ``New York New York, the Book That Never
Sleeps.''
</P>
<P>
   There are bus tours to places outside Manhattan that get strong
recommendations, although I have not tested them.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Beryl Epstein, proprietor of the Hassidic Discovery Center
in Brooklyn, conducts bus tours of Crown Heights for schools and
other organizations during the week; on Sundays, he offers the
tours to the general public. Visits to a library, a scribe copying
a Torah and a synagogue are features of this trip.
</P>
<P>
   If enough non-Brooklynites reserve, his bus picks them up in
front of the New York Public Library in Manhattan at 9:30 a.m.
Others take the No. 3 train to Kingston Avenue and meet at the
center at 10 a.m. The tour, which includes lunch at a kosher
delicatessen, ends at 1:30 p.m. It costs $48, $24 for children
under 12.
</P>
<P>
   The center's Web site is www. jewishtours.com; the phone number
for reservations is (800) 838-8687.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn's African-American heritage is the focus of Fred
Laverpool's ``Braggin' About Brooklyn'' tours on Saturdays. He
offers trips of two and a half hours of combined bus travel and
walking, with videos aboard the bus to provide supplemental
material on the Underground Railroad and other historical aspects.
The buses leave from 1 Metrotech at Jay Street, opposite the rear
of the Brooklyn Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   The bus crosses the Manhattan Bridge to visit the African Burial
Ground in lower Manhattan, but otherwise Laverpool sticks with his
borough, including Weeksville, an early settlement of free blacks
near Bergen Street. The price is $25; ages 18 and younger, $15; and
62 and older, $20. Laverpool takes reservations at (718) 297-5107. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOUNDS OF QUEENS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Flushing Council on Culture and the Arts will next offer its
five-hour Queens Jazz Trail bus trip on June 24. It leaves from the
Flushing Town Hall at 10 a.m., and with a musicologist as guide,
passes places where artists like Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Lena
Horne and Cootie Williams lived. It visits the Armstrong archives
at Queens College. Sometimes, the 89-year-old bassist and
photographer Milt Hinton greets the tour when he is not playing
jazz festivals.
</P>
<P>
   The participants get a soul food luncheon and a concert as a
wind-up, with the tour closing at 3 p.m. The fee is $75, $65 for
seniors and $60 for students. Reservations: (718) 463-7700,
extension 222. Details appear at www.queensjazztrail.com.
</P>
<P>
   The 92nd Street Y takes buses to other boroughs, too. On Sunday,
July 23, ``The Literary Bronx'' will be toured, highlighting sites
linked to the works of Sholem Aleichem, Clifford Odets, Edgar Allan
Poe and E.L. Doctorow. The docent is Lloyd Ultan, author of ``The
Beautiful Bronx.'' The tour leaves the Y at 10 a.m. and returns at
4 p.m.; the fee is $55. For reservations, call (212) 996-1100.

 &HT;    CLINTON PLEDGES AID TO SHUT DOWN CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR PLANT
 &HT;    With sidebar slugged CLINTON-MISSILES
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ With a vote of confidence in Ukrainian democracy
and aid to help shut down the world's most infamous nuclear power
plant, President Clinton wound up a week of overseas travel here
Monday and headed home to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On the last leg of a trip that earlier took him to Portugal,
Germany and Russia, Clinton stopped off in Kiev, the 1,500-year-old
capital of Ukraine, where President Leonid Kuchma promised to shut
down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant by Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing an estimated 70,000 people jammed into a broad,
brick-paved square, Clinton praised Ukraine's first decade of
democracy and urged the country to press forward with its march
away from Communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine became an independent
state in August, 1991, following the Soviet break up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism has lost in Ukraine, but a full commitment to free
market democracy has not yet won,'' said Clinton, speaking from
atop a temporary dais erected in the historic square.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your children are to live their dreams, it must win,'' said
Clinton. ``Do not give up. Keep on fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also suggested that Ukraine is a candidate for admission
into the economic and security structures that stood down Soviet
Communism. While he didn't mention either the European Union or
NATO by name, he made clear that Ukraine is no longer within
Moscow's sphere of influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``America believes Ukraine has a right to a place among the
nations of Europe. No one must take that right away from you,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reject the idea that the eastern border of Europe is the
western border of Ukraine,'' said Clinton. ``We can, and we will,
keep the door to the transatlantic community of democracies open to
Ukraine.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised Ukraine $80 million in U.S. aid to help shut
down Chernobyl and entomb the reactor that exploded in 1986 in the
worst accident in the history of the nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 fire in another of the plant's four reactors cemented
Chernobyl's reputation as the most dangerous nuclear plant in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The 1986 disaster killed at least 31 people immediately, forced
the evacuation of 135,000 more and released airborne radiation that
swept across much of central Europe. Thousands have died since then
of maladies attributed to radiation received as a result of the
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Closing Chernobyl has been a goal of the United States and its
partners in the Group of Seven industrialized democracies for
years. The G-7 has already given Ukraine some $3 billion _ $200
million of it is from the United States _ over the past decade to
improve safety at the plant and to build new plants to help replace
the electric power production lost by the closing of Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton pledged $25 million to boost the
development of small and medium sized businesses in Ukraine, in
part to help offset the economic losses associated with closing the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's larger mission here was to praise the Ukrainian spirit
and encourage this country of 50 million in its struggle to build a
modern democratic state after a century of war, repression and
genocide.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin waged terror
campaigns against Ukrainian intellectuals and imposed policies that
created famines that left more than 3 million dead. The next
decade, Nazi invaders killed 1 million Ukrainian Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the oppressors are gone. Stalin is gone. The Nazis are
gone. The Soviet Union is gone,'' said Clinton . ``But you, the
people of Ukraine, you are still here, stronger than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to return to Washington late Monday night,
with a busy week of diplomacy and more travel ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   He meets Tuesday with King Abdullah II of Jordan. Close to the
Palestinian community, Abdullah is seen as a key player in
Clinton's efforts to broker a Mideast peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton flies to Tokyo. He will spend only a few
hours there, to attend memorial services for the late Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, before returning to Washington
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton hosts Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo for a
meeting at the White House, then travels that night to Minneapolis,
where he is to deliver the commencement address at Carleton
College.

CLINTON SHOULD CREATE MORE NATIONAL MONUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has written about public lands issues
for over a decade and is respected for his insight into these
issues. His e-mail address is levendos(at)trib.com.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four more national monuments are coming America's way soon. And
there is a strong likelihood that President Clinton will designate
several more monuments before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   There will be the usual clamor in Congress claiming the
president has abused his power _ a power given to the presidency by
Congress when it passed the Antiquities Act in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt sent the
president a recommendation that four unique landscapes be protected
under the Antiquities Act. The proposed national monuments are
located on federal public lands in Arizona, Colorado, Oregon and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiquities Act authorizes the president to create national
monuments on federal land to protect areas of special cultural,
scientific, archeological and ecological interest.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton doesn't have to act on Babbitt's
recommendation, the president has shown a strong inclination to use
the Antiquities Act to protect special landscapes that are in
jeopardy from urban sprawl, development or exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Clinton has designated five new national
monuments and expanded an already existing one, the Pinnacles
National Monument in California. The most recent designation, the
Giant Sequoia National Monument in California, was announced on
April 15.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt proposes that the president designate the Ironwood
Forest National Monument in Arizona, Canyons of the Ancients
National Monument in Colorado, Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument
in Oregon and Hanford Reach National Monument in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Ironwood Forest National Monument is located 25
miles northwest of Tucson and encompasses approximately 135,000
acres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in
the Sonoran Desert. The area supports one of the highest densities
of ironwood trees in the Sonoran Desert. An ironwood tree can live
as long as 800 years.
</P>
<P>
   The ironwood landscape is also critical habitat for the desert
Bighorn sheep. Unfortunately, this unique area is threatened by
numerous golf courses and housing developments.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Pima County Board of Supervisors sent a unanimous
resolution to Babbitt seeking national monument status for this
area, which is within their county.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Canyons of the Ancients National Monument is
located in the Four Corners region of southwest Colorado, about 45
miles west of Durango. The BLM manages the 164,000 acres that would
be included in the proposed monument. The area contains the highest
known density of archeological sites in the nation _ more than
20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The archeological finds include great kivas, cliff dwellings,
shrines, sacred springs, petroglyphs, sweat lodges and villages.
</P>
<P>
   The integrity of these archeological sites is threatened by the
growth of population in the area, with tourism and increasing
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., introduced a
bill to protect the landscape and sites as a National Conservation
Area. He suspended all action on the bill in late March due to
local controversies over the NCA designation.
</P>
<P>
   National monument status is the only quick solution to
protecting the area.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument is located 25
miles southeast of Medford, along the Oregon-California border. It
includes the biologically significant Soda Mountain _ significant
because of its geological age, soil types and transitional climate
zones.
</P>
<P>
   The 52,000-acre area of BLM land is situated where the Klamath
and Cascade mountains converge, creating a rich ecology that
supports a wide variety of rare plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Hanford Reach National Monument contains 200,000
acres of public land located in south-central Washington, along the
Columbia River. The area is within the Department of Energy's
Hanford Nuclear Reservation, but outside the radioactive hot spots
and would become a buffer zone around the nuclear reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would give the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the
responsibility of managing the monument.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford Reach is the last free-flowing, non-tidal stretch of
the Columbia River, where nearly 80 percent of fall chinook salmon
spawn.
</P>
<P>
   The area also contains American Indian cultural artifacts that
span more than 10,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a great deal of political pressure to convert
portions of the area to agricultural uses. Such uses could
jeopardize salmon habitat and threaten other historic objects
within the area of the proposed monument.
</P>
<P>
   If the president designates these sites as national monuments,
he will have created or expanded 10 monuments during his
administration _ setting aside more than 3.8 million acres for
greater protection.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the public agrees with the administration's goal to
ensure greater protection of unique public lands. And the public
can expect Clinton to designate other sites as national monuments
before he leaves office _ the Missouri Breaks area in central
Montana and Steens Mountain in southeastern Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   And the president may expand the Great Sand Dunes National
Monument in Colorado and Craters of the Moon National Monument in
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The move to put these lands out of the reach of oil and mining
interests, developers and those who would plunder natural and
archeological resources for private gain is the right move at the
right time.
</P>
<P>
   With an increasing and mobile population, let us ensure that
future generations have the opportunity to enjoy their special
heritage in nature. The president should adopt Babbitt's
recommendations.

&HT;     POLLSTER SEES TOUGHER ROAD FOR MRS. CLINTON IN SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, enjoying a slight lead in a
new poll in New York state, faces a tougher battle against Rep.
Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., for a U.S. Senate seat than she did against
feisty New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a pollster said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, president of Utica, N.Y.-based Zogby International,
said a statewide survey of 704 likely voters completed Sunday
showed the first lady leading Lazio 46 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Zogby said he found ``anti-Hillary'' sentiment deeply
embedded among parts of the electorate as well as problem areas
looming for her.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, a fourth-term congressman from Long Island, matches or
exceeds Giuliani's margin over Clinton among upstate voters,
suburban voters, male voters and Roman Catholics, Zogby said. Lazio
also cuts into Clinton's edge over Giuliani among blacks and
Hispanics, even though the first lady holds a sizable lead.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Giuliani from the race boosted Clinton's edge
in New York City, among women and among Jewish voters, Zogby's
survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held a slight edge over Giuliani in the last survey
conducted before the mayor's withdrawal, 42 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio entered the race against Clinton to fill the seat of
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., after Giuliani
withdrew, citing the need to seek treatment for prostate cancer and
the breakup of his 16-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio is ``her worst nightmare,'' Zogby told reporters. Clinton
cannot paint Lazio as a right-wing acolyte of former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., because the congressman has voted to support
President Clinton's policies almost as often as he has supported
the GOP agenda, Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio ``kind of comes right down in the middle which is pretty
much where New York Republicans are,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said Clinton's dogged efforts to court New Yorkers,
including constant visits to the state and the purchase of a home
in Chappaqua, N.Y., have failed to boost her margin of support
which remains ``frozen at about 45 percent or 46 percent'' of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of the little-known Long Island congressman to
achieve parity with Clinton in the Senate race within two weeks of
entering the race underscores the depth of residual anti-Clinton
sentiment, Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's showing of 44 percent represents a solid anti-Clinton
vote, Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters ``needed to know that Lazio was neither a serial killer
or a pedophile and that was enough to meet the lowest threshold''
of winning their support over Clinton, Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby added: ``The issue then becomes who can get up to 48
percent or 49 percent which really is what it is going to take to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said that repeated polls show roughly 45 percent of the
New York electorate remains staunchly ``anti-Clinton'' regardless
of what the first lady does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary is the polarizing character,'' Zogby said of a high
profile Senate contest that is expected to cost candidates and
their parties a total of more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Rudy was in (the race) the best that each (candidate) had
going was each other,'' Zogby said. ``And now all of a sudden, Rudy
is out and I think that at least for the time being, Hillary's
people are scrambling because Lazio just sort of defies what the
strategy had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said Clinton cannot hope to benefit from Vice President Al
Gore's 14 percentage point lead in New York state over presumptive
GOP nominee George W. Bush because voters will cast ballots in the
presidential race and the Senate race without regard to the
parallel contest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is such a ``giant in the race'' that people ``will come
out to either vote for or against Hillary,'' Zogby said. Gore's
expected victory in New York ``will not have an impact'' on
Clinton's political fortunes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zogby said Clinton is running a ``very good campaign,'' by
staging repeated visits to upstate cities froim Albany to Buffallo
where she wins coverage in media markets that reach pockets of
Democrats, white working women and union households.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lazio has scored gains as well among loyal Clinton
constituencies. African-Americans were ``energized'' to repudiate
Giuliani at the polls to retaliate for the mayor's unapologetic
support for police in a series of shootings of unarmed blacks,
Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio cuts into this base, drawing 8 percent of the
African-American vote _ a sizeable jump from the 2 percent or less
that Giuliani reaped in some earlier polls.
</P>
<P>
   With Giuliani in the race, ``Hillary was going to mop up'' with
a large turnout among African Americans that could have generated
an extra 80,000 or 90,000 votes for Clinton, Zogby said. ``But that
is missing now,'' Zogby said.

 &HT;    VETERANS GROUP OPPOSES SITE, DESIGN OF WWII MEMORIAL
 &HT;    With photo.
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of World War II veterans said Monday they
oppose building a WWII memorial between the Washington Monument and
the Lincoln Memorial, saying it will ``destroy'' the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veterans to Save the Mall'' and other groups launched a
campaign to relocate the proposed memorial or modify its large,
elaborate design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destroying our National Mall should not be our legacy,'' said
John Graves, a decorated WWII veteran who fought with the 63rd
Infantry Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to honor all who served in World War II, but in a way
that respects our history and the heritage of the National Mall,''
Graves said in a statement. He is also featured in an advertisement
opposing the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that the memorial's 56 square pillars and two
arches will be an intrusive presence on the Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The monument's design, featuring a 237-by-338 foot lowered plaza
located at the east end of the Reflecting Pool in front of the
Lincoln Memorial, has received preliminary approval from the
National Park Service, the Commission of Fine Arts, and the
National Capital Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The National WWII Memorial campaign has raised nearly $90
million from veterans groups, private citizens and corporations to
build the $100 million project, said Mike Conley, associate
director of the project.
</P>
<P>
   WWII was ``clearly the most significant event of the 20th
century, and the victory belongs in the company of the Washington
and Lincoln memorials,'' Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving vierws of the two monuments was the main criterion
for the design, Conley said. In addition, ``the route of visitors
from Washington to Lincoln is virtually unchanged,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After objections were raised to the original design, Conley
said, the structure was redesigned to allow a wider central vista.
Curved ramps were also added to make it easier for pedestrians to
get around the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Another opponent, W. Kent Cooper, said the WWII memorial would
appear to be ``stacked on top'' of the Lincoln memorial. In
contrast, when ``the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was built on the
same grounds, it didn't destroy anything, it added to it,'' said
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who led the design team for the Korean War Veterans
Memorial, is a trustee for the Committee of 100 on the Federal
City, a local organization that opposes the memorial site.
</P>
<P>
   The committee has recommended alternative sites for the
memorial, including the Constitutions Gardens area north of the
Reflecting Pool.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to place the monument in the disputed location,
however, is nearing its final stages. Backers expect final approval
this summer and to break ground on Veteran's Day in November,
Conley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get it built before there aren't any more WWII
veterans to see it,'' he said.

&HT;     NUDITY BECOMES A FASHION STATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The way clothing codes are going, actress Sarah
Jessica Parker was overdressed when she appeared at last Saturday's
MTV Movie Awards ceremony wearing nothing but a casually draped
towel.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, Spencer Tunick, a publicity-conscious
Manhattan photographer, snapped 152 naked models stretched out on a
deserted street. He called it art. And he had permission from no
less than the U.S. Supreme Court, which sided with his First
Amendment right to freedom of expression over the city's
objections.
</P>
<P>
   The high bench looked on this case with more bemused tolerance
than it has displayed in its handling of most past nudity issues.
</P>
<P>
   A New York state ordinance forbids public exposure of private
body areas except when part of a play, exhibition, show or
entertainment. The city claimed it would be ``irreparably harmed''
by the photo shoot because it would invade the privacy of residents
living nearby who ``might object to seeing nude bodies early on a
Sunday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The court didn't buy the notion that the presumed shock to the
sensibilities of local citizens was of such great moment as to
overcome the First Amendment protection of an artistic photograph.
But the photographer was required to complete the picture-taking a
half hour and he promised that everyone would be nude for only 90
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The idea seems to be that going briefly buck-naked is not in bad
taste if the exposure has a benign purpose and is not prolonged or
sensationalized.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick himself said, ``I don't think I could do this in the
middle of the day in front of Macy's.''
</P>
<P>
   When a women's rugby team from Ohio State posed topless in
November for a photo in front of the Lincoln Memorial, however, the
official response was not similarly kind. It wasn't illegal, and
the women said they meant to market a tee-shirt emblazoned with the
picture to raise money for the team. But the university failed to
see the merit of this project, and the team was suspended for the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Similar female exhibitionism is spreading, perhaps stimulated by
sexy poses in magazines and the skimpy outfits on television. When
the fashion industry's recent preoccupation with showing off belly
buttons grew boring, designer emphasis shifted to an excess of
cleavage, which inevitably leads to even more exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Massive outdoor recreational events have become an excuse for
young ladies (actually, they aren't ladies) to take off their tops.
Several women with bared breasts were held aloft this spring in the
infield at Baltimore's Preakness race,for instance. This brazen act
seems to have more to do with too much beer consumption than with a
deliberate descent into sexual degradation.
</P>
<P>
   Should we worry? Hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just America that is stripping. ``The Full Monty,'' a
funny and wise 1997 film about unemployed men who decide to raise
money by putting on a strip show, set the pace.
</P>
<P>
   This past January a club of proper British middle-aged matrons
took off all their clothes except their pearls for a discreetly
posed calendar that forever outdated ye olde bake sale and raised
$550,000 for a local charity. They were such a hit that other
groups around England _ hunters, chefs, farmers, firefighters, men
and women alike _ have also been posing in the buff for charity.
</P>
<P>
   At a Rio de Janeiro beach in February, policemen waving guns
arrested a woman sunbathing topless and jailed her for eight hours.
Going topless had been banned for 70 years, but the law had never
before been enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest prompted days of protests, during which men donned
bikini tops. Legal bikinis are so miniscule they are called, in
Portuguese, ``dental floss.'' Rio officials gave up and lifted the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   Even stodgy Russia has caught the nudity virus. A new television
current affairs show, appropriately titled ``The Naked Truth,''
features interviewers who hug microphones to their bare breasts,
newsreaders who undress as they deliver the news and a female
weather reporter who does a strip-tease. The show is reportedly
popular with those who want to keep abreast of the news. (No
complaints, please, for this corny pun; I lifted it from a London
newspaper.)
</P>
<P>
   The sports world is an energetic participant in the movement to
cut away cumbersome clothing and show lots of female flesh.
Near-nudity sells. TV cameras consistently shoot attractive young
soccer, volleyball and tennis players from angles that best capture
thighs, buttocks and breasts. Their outfits, sometimes mandated by
the sport organizers, are as skimpy as the law will allow. The
Australian women's Olympic soccer team posed for a calendar last
year displaying full frontal nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is just for fun, some for commercial exploitation.
Some, of course, is for sex. Does it mean anything dire for
society? Moral purists will disagree, but I don't think shedding
our inhibitions, within limits, means society is doomed. It may,
however, mean an uncovered world will soon catch a collective cold.

 &HT;    NEW U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM WOULD NOT THREATEN RUSSIA,
CLINTON SAYS
 &HT;    700&AMP;add
 &HT;    With story slugged CLINTON
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton took his case for a controversial new
U.S. missile defense system directly to the Russian people and
their elected officials on Monday, telling them the proposed weapon
poses no threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was ``inconceivable'' that the United States
would deploy such a system without working closely with Moscow to
keep from renewing an arms race between the world's two largest
nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find any future apart from cooperation with you in the
nuclear area inconceivable,'' Clinton said in nationally-televised
remarks before the Russian parliament. ``The real question is a
debate over what the impact of this will be, because of the
capacity of the technology involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks capped a three-day visit to Moscow centered on tough
talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin over missile defense
and nuclear weapons reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The first American president ever to address Russia's
parliament, Clinton left Moscow afterwards and flew to Kiev.
Clinton was scheduled to return to Washington late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   During some eight hours of face-to-face summitry, Putin stood
firm in his objections to a new U.S. weapon system being developed
to defend the country from a missile attack by a rogue state or
terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made a pitch for Russian acceptance of the system in a
joint speech before the 450-member Duma, the key legislative body,
and the 178-member Federation Council. Not all members were in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called national missile defense, or NMD, system is aimed
at protecting the United States from the threat that a rogue state,
such as North Korea, or a terrorist group, such as the followers of
Osama Bin Laden, might one day attempt to attack the country with a
nuclear weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Putin told Clinton the risk of such attack was being exaggerated
by NMD advocates and that deploying an NMD system could cause more
harm than good by upsetting the balance of power between the United
States and Russia, which together possess more than 80 percent of
the world's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pleaded with Russians to think carefully about how
quickly global security is being changed by the wide availability
of new technology and information that will soon make it possible
for many new actors to acquire weapons that only a few large
countries now possess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be realistic,'' said Clinton. ``Despite our best
efforts, the possibility exists that nuclear and other deadly
weapons will fall into dangerous hands, into hands that could
threaten us both.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ``the technology required to launch missiles
capable of delivering them over long distances, unfortunately, is
still spreading across the world. The question is, what is the best
way to deal with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to decide this fall whether to deploy the
NMD system, currently being tested by the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his comments during a 45-minute speech meant to be
a grand survey of U.S.-Russian relations at a time of social and
economic turmoil within the former superpower. He urged the Russian
people to press ahead in their difficult journey from Communist
autocracy to free-market democracy and stressed the need to build
the elements of a civil society based on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Russian parliamentarians showed little emotion during the
speech, never interrupting it for applause. Some could be seen
fidgeting in their chairs or otherwise expressing signs of tedium,
as Clinton poured over the litany of tasks the United States wants
Russian to accomplish: clean up its corrupt government, put in
place an effective tax code, create legal protections for foreign
investors, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message ran into particularly heavy weather in the
form of parliament member Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
ultra-nationalist who has built a political career by decrying the
collapse of the former Soviet Union and the subsequent decline of
living standards across the Russian motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Seated 14 rows away from Clinton, Zhirinovsky grumbled loudly
when the president was introduced. As applause filled the chamber
at the end of the speech, he hollered out to colleagues, ``Why are
you applauding for him? He destroyed our country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky led several dozen protesters _ some chanting
``Yankee go home,'' and ``U.S. out of Serbia _ outside of the Duma
building, while others waved red Soviet-era flags with the hammer
and sickle motif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has poured money into Russia, and after
eight years, what has happened? It has brought to power a KGB
colonel, those whom the United States was fighting against on the
dollars of U.S. taxpayers,'' said parliament member Alexei
Mitrofanov, the number two man in Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is worse for most Russians after ten years of reform,''
Mitrofanov told American reporters traveling with the president.
``Clinton understands nothing of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Kiev, Clinton rounded out his Moscow summit
almost certainly his final trip to the Russian capital as president
with a brief stop at the dacha of former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin looked good today,'' Clinton told reporters after the
social call with the man who was his Russian counterpart for seven
years. ``He's in good spirits, happy, he's got a beautiful place.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reference to Yeltsin's propensity toward alcohol, a
reporter asked which spirits, exactly, Clinton had referenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``No spirits,'' Clinton laughed. ``He and his wife and his
daughter were there. We all just had a nice visit. It was like old
times. But he's in good shape.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ For all the ground they have lost to the
Republicans in recent years, Texas Democrats might be forgiven for
wanting to cry as they head for the state party convention later
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials are optimistic, even in a year when
some party faithful might vote for a favorite son presidential
candidate, Republican Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you gain anything by crying,'' said Betty
Flores, a Democrat who is the mayor of Laredo. ``I think a long
time ago those wounds, if you want to call them that, were healed
and people tended to them. Now I think it's just, `Let's go get
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, Flores added, ``First you've got to know what `it' is.''
</P>
<P>
   To Flores _ who volunteered that she crossed party lines to vote
for Bush when he ran for re-election in 1998 and has voted for
Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison _ it is a matter of attracting
good, credible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixture of getting the right people to come back into
politics, and I don't think we're there yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm said the
convention, which begins Thursday, would reflect the party's
efforts to expand its majorities in the state House and the state's
delegation to Congress, and win back the Texas Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will give everyone an opportunity to see why we are
confident of accomplishing those goals,'' she said. ``Our
convention will be diverse and inclusive and show how people from
all walks of life can unite and work together for the good of all
the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Polinard, a political scientist at the University of Texas
Pan American, had a gloomier assessment of the convention, which he
described as ``a useful device to circle the wagons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a little bit more exciting than a wake,'' he said.
``The party is close to being in desperate straits.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of Democratic heavyweights are not planning to join the
crowd at the convention, which is expected to draw 7,000 delegates
and alternates to draft a state platform, pick a state leadership
team and choose state delegates to the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the party's presumptive presidential
nominee, is expected to skip the event.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk will be out of state, according to his
office. Austin Mayor Kirk Watson, another rising Democratic star,
plans to attend the U.S. Conference of Mayors in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Former Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes, garnering new attention after a
speech in which he warned that Texas is ``drifting toward
mediocrity,'' may attend a convention kickoff reception Thursday
for Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. But that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have got a lot of commitments next week I just made really
without being aware when the convention was,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Barnes is planning an Austin event to raise money
for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee that is
anticipating a bigger name than any appearing at the convention _
President Clinton.

   TARBORO, N.C. _ Surrounded by members of Al Gore's Secret
Service unit, Gerald Perry bid the Tarboro High School Class of
2000 farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, 18, vice president of the 130-member graduating class,
became the man of his house at an early age, after the death of his
father, James.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son had to grow up a little faster than I hoped,'' his
mother, Dorothy Perry, said. ``He's been the man of the house since
his father died, and his sister and I will definitely miss him when
he goes off to school. But for now, we're just proud of the young
man he has become.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a leader on the THS football team. He will attend Fork
Union Military Academy near Richmond, Va., in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In his farewell address, Perry said, ``As we depart from this
educational institution, we move forward to a fast-paced society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prepare for the future, and that future is now. We
must find an antidote to help us cope and make us better as people.
Today the antidote I present to you is faith. Faith is a precious
commodity to us. We won't realize how important it is right now,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he was proud to be a part of the class that had Vice
President Al Gore as its commencement speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were first told about changing the date so he could
come, we didn't really like it,'' Perry said. ``I think it brought
national attention to our area. I'm glad he came.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior class President Casey Collins, who introduced Gore, said
she practiced her introduction for hours Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of family here today, which made me very happy,''
Collins said. ``I was happy about shaking his hand. Not very many
people can say they did that, except for the Class of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduate Trevin Parker won't soon forget the first few days of
June. He became not only a high-school graduate, but also a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure how I feel right now,'' Parker said.
``I've kind of changed my plans for the immediate future. I'm going
to take the first semester off and spend time with my child. But I
do plan to attend Fayetteville State second semester. It's been an
exciting week.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Monteiro Brito, a Brazilian exchange student, participated
in the graduation exercises, although she only attended the school
for 10 months. She was hosted by Cindy Smith and her family and
says she will return to Brazil next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed today,'' Brito said. ``I've enjoyed being in
Tarboro, because all of the people have treated me so well. I've
made some true friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brito returns home, she plans to attend college, and says
she will study to be a food engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wizikowski, 18, said he will attend Oral Roberts University
in the fall to study computer arts and music. Until then, he said,
``As far as what I'm doing this summer, I will be installing
heating and air-conditioning units.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he and the rest of the class had to be patted down by
the Secret Service, Wizikowski said it was worth it to have Gore as
the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to take our cap and gown off as well as our socks and
shoes,'' Wizikowski said. ``It was wild. We had to empty our
pockets and were patted down. But it was worth it. This is
something we will always remember about the Class of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Wizikowski and friends had to wait until after the ceremony to
spray each other with canned foam or bounce a beach ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't sneak any of those things in with us,'' Wizikowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Coker is headed to Georgia for six and half months as
part of her National Guard training.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will remember the Class of 2000,'' Coker said. ``We
were the best.''
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the members of the graduating class had plans
to further their education, while the rest will join the workforce
or military. Approximately $500,000 in scholarships have been
awarded to THS graduates. Four graduates are N.C. Teaching Fellows;
they will get $26,000 toward a college education to be repaid with
four years of teaching in North Carolina public schools.

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT SPURNS MICROSOFT'S ANTITRUST FORMULA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department asked a federal judge Monday
to spurn nearly all of the changes Microsoft Corp. wants in the
government's plan to break up the giant software maker.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
the antitrust team submitted a revised version of their breakup
plan that makes 19 fairly minor changes to its prior draft. But
Justice Department and 17 states largely stood behind their plan,
rejecting all the company's substantive suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   The government brief argued that Microsoft got its way, its
proposals ``would create loopholes and permit Microsoft to continue
to engage in anti-competitive practices or otherwise frustrate or
undermine the purposes'' of the proposed remedy decree.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is primed to issue that landmark order, perhaps as soon
as this week, after he receives Microsoft's final rebuttal
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The company, for its part, has acceded to Jackson's request that
it devise a remedy formula on its own. But it still regards that
plan, which the government disdains, as totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting lipstick on a pig,'' said Michael Murray, a
Microsoft spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has found that Microsoft illegally leveraged its
Windows monopoly for operating software, shows every sign of
approving government plan to divide the company into two firms. One
would make Windows, while the other would make such applications as
Office.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is certain to stay his breakup order pending the
outcome of an appeal, which could take several years.
</P>
<P>
   The latest government brief urged the judge to move quickly. It
argued that ``it is in the public interest that the remedy
contemplated by the final judgment be implemented as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also held that Jackson should ignore the
company's request to be given a year, instead of four months, to
devise a full reorganization plan. It also urged that he reject a
request to limit to four years the period under which Microsoft
must operate with a full set of curbs in force, instead of 10 years
prescribed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has had a dominant position in the operating-systems
business for at least a decade, and under the circumstances there
is no sound justification for entering a decree of shorter
duration,'' the government said in its filing.
</P>
<P>
   In citing an earlier deposition by Bill Gates, the company's
chairman, that ``I delete 98 percent of my e-mails,'' the
government further said there was ``no sound reason'' to lift a
proposed requirement that Microsoft preserve electronic mail
written by officers, directors and managers involved in software
development for at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   In assailing the limited ``cosmetic changes'' made by the
government, another Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said: ``We
have tried to avoid the ambiguity and vagueness inherent in the
government's proposal and the government refuses to be specific
about the issues it is trying to address. The result is going to be
bad for consumers and bad for the industry.''

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT SPURNS MICROSOFT'S ANTITRUST FORMULA
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department asked a federal judge Monday
to spurn nearly all of the changes Microsoft Corp. wants in the
government's plan to break up the giant software maker.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
the antitrust team submitted a revised version of their breakup
plan that makes 19 fairly minor changes to its prior draft. But
Justice Department and 17 states largely stood behind their plan,
rejecting all the company's substantive suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   The government brief argued that Microsoft got its way, its
proposals ``would create loopholes and permit Microsoft to continue
to engage in anti-competitive practices or otherwise frustrate or
undermine the purposes'' of the proposed remedy decree.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is primed to issue that landmark order, perhaps as soon
as this week, after he receives Microsoft's final rebuttal
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The company, for its part, has acceded to Jackson's request that
it devise a remedy formula on its own. But it still regards that
plan, which the government disdains, as totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like putting lipstick on a pig,'' said Michael Murray, a
Microsoft spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who has found that Microsoft illegally leveraged its
Windows monopoly for operating software, shows every sign of
approving government plan to divide the company into two firms. One
would make Windows, while the other would make such applications as
Office.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson is certain to stay his breakup order pending the
outcome of an appeal, which could take several years.
</P>
<P>
   The latest government brief urged the judge to move quickly. It
argued that ``it is in the public interest that the remedy
contemplated by the final judgment be implemented as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also held that Jackson should ignore the
company's request to be given a year, instead of four months, to
devise a full reorganization plan. It also urged that he reject a
request to limit to four years the period under which Microsoft
must operate with a full set of curbs in force, instead of 10 years
prescribed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has had a dominant position in the operating-systems
business for at least a decade, and under the circumstances there
is no sound justification for entering a decree of shorter
duration,'' the government said in its filing.
</P>
<P>
   In citing an earlier deposition by Bill Gates, the company's
chairman, that ``I delete 98 percent of my e-mails,'' the
government further said there was ``no sound reason'' to lift a
proposed requirement that Microsoft preserve electronic mail
written by officers, directors and managers involved in software
development for at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   In assailing the limited ``cosmetic changes'' made by the
government, another Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said: ``We
have tried to avoid the ambiguity and vagueness inherent in the
government's proposal and the government refuses to be specific
about the issues it is trying to address. The result is going to be
bad for consumers and bad for the industry.''

SAFIN OUTLASTS PIOLINE TO REACH FRENCH OPEN QUARTERFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ For the first time in history, two Russian men are in
the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event.
</P>
<P>
   Through drizzle and delays on another rainy day at Roland
Garros, Marat Safin, a 20-year-old with a whippet's frame, a huge
serve and one of the most explosive two-handed backhands in
history, eliminated Cedric Pioline, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3, 7-5, to reach
the final eight in a grand slam event for the first time in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Safin's occasional mentor Yevgeny Kafelnikov reached the final
eight on Sunday and will face Gustavo Kuerten in his quarterfinal.
But the happiest Russian right now appears to be Andrei Chesnokov,
Safin's coach, who was grinning and flashing the thumbs-up signal
to his young pupil as he sauntered off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Safin _ who has won 23 of his last 26 matches, winning
tournaments in Barcelona and Majorca _ parted ways with his
longtime Spanish coach Rafael Menusa and hired his fellow Russian
Chesnokov on a trial basis during the Barcelona tournament. At that
stage, Safin was 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   Chesnokov, a French Open semifinalist in 1989, has helped Safin
regain his appetite for the game. He had never coached anyone
formally, but Safin's enormous gift for the game and for handling
the big occasion has been clear since he qualified here as a
teen-ager in 1998 and beat the future champion Andre Agassi and
Kuerten, the defending champion, on his way to the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Safin would soon reach the top of the sport,
but he also has a temper and a tendency to overhit instead of
overanalyze. Chesnokov has helped him regain a measure of control
and helped talk him through the two-hour rain delay Monday that
interrupted the third set. But Safin is still no stoic.
</P>
<P>
   Serving in the mist at 4-5 in the fourth set with the French
crowd cheering Pioline's every flourish, Safin missed a forehand
passing shot to fall behind by 0-40 and then wheeled and smashed
his racket onto the clay. ``I was already thinking about the fifth
set,'' Safin said.

   But he would proceed to win the next three points as Pioline,
who had attacked earlier in the game, suddenly stopped pushing
forward. In all, Safin saved four set points before knocking away a
backhand volley to get back to 5-5. Visibly deflated, Pioline lost
his serve in the next game on a double fault and then failed to
capitalize on Safin's inability to get his own first serve in play
in the final game. Magnus Norman joined Safin in the final eight by
defeating last year's surprise finalist Andrei Medvedev, 6-0, 6-4,
6-2. The day's two other fourth-round matches were suspended due to
darkness with Argentina's Franco Squillari leading Morocco's Younes
el-Aynaoui by 6-4, 6-1, 3-3 and Spain's Albert Costa leading
Australia's Lleyton Hewitt, 6-3, 4-4.

<P>
   REDDING, Calif. _ The lake was glass, the oars leaving little
swirls with each stroke, and so quiet you could almost hear the
flowers bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, 10 feet off the shore of a small, nearby island, a
raucous splash and squawk on the surface snapped me to attention. I
turned and spotted a washtub-sized swirl on the lake surface,
apparently from a giant bass, leaving a five-foot ring, which then
expanded across the surface like dissipating sound waves.
</P>
<P>
   On the nearby shore, a family of Canada geese seemed to be going
crazy, the adults charging around the perimeter of their young,
rounding them up, occasionally craning their necks to stare at me,
as if to ward me off. There was one less among them, it turned out,
because it had just been eaten.
</P>
<P>
   As I made my first cast toward the island, it felt like a bass
drum was pounding in my chest. I'd been told there were giant bass
here, and now one was feeding, eating anything within range, like
even baby geese. I peered around. There was nobody else here. I had
the entire place, Steiner Lake, to myself.
</P>
<P>
   With a fly rod, reel filled with floating line, and a bass
popper, I delivered the popper on the edge of the island, then
twitched and popped it, at times just letting it sit there.
Nothing. After a dozen casts, I switched to a variation of a
Matuka, a streamer that looks like a minnow if you strip-retrieve
it in a series of short, quick yanks. But again, nothing. Relaxed
now _ the big bass was apparently done feeding _ I played staredown
with the geese as I cast, quacking at them, and suddenly, while
paying no attention, had a strike, an instinctive set, and a fish.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that gosling-eating bass, but it was a fun little
tussle, the nine-foot fly rod curved like a giant hoop; about a
2-pound bass, I figured. But to my surprise, as the fish first
appeared near the boat, it was not a bass at all, but a 15 1/2-inch
crappie, huge for that species, and a personal life-best. It turns
out that this pond not only had some of the biggest bass around,
but some of the biggest crappie as well.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit me. This is why people will pay to fish at Steiner
Lake. Same with several other catch-and-release private ponds and
lakes in Northern California, where there are big trout, bass,
crappie and bluegill, often good numbers of them, and where access
is sharply limited to keep the fish rested, big and in attack mode.
</P>
<P>
   This new opportunity, that is, paying for access to fish private
ponds, is drawing special appeal to those new to fishing who want
action and a chance at giant fish right off, as well as for anglers
who just plain don't have the time to explore and find their own
secret spots. The cost at Steiner Lake is $85 a day; prices at most
private lakes range from $75 to $150, with lodging packages
available.
</P>
<P>
   Although something of an anomaly, the idea of fishing a private
pond has turned into the newest dimension of fishing. After all,
California has enough lakes, streams and coast to fish a different
spot every weekend for 22 years, for free. But all you need in
fishing is hope, and these private lakes lure that in front of
anglers like an intoxicant.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner Lake is located on the outskirts of Redding, about a
10-minute drive from Interstate 5. Initially I downplayed this
adventure as I headed to Redding, after all, hey, pay to fish? But
at the lake, as I sat down in the row boat (included with the fee)
and started tying up, I found myself suddenly excited and eager,
then pulse quickened as I heard and then saw the circles across the
lake from rising fish. I brought three rods, a bass rod with a
level-wind that I rigged with a Zipper Lizard, a spinning rod set
up with a spinner bait, and my fly rod with a popper.
</P>
<P>
   My first surprise was the size of the pond, bigger and deeper
than expected, covering some 30 acres with spots 20 feet deep, with
a series of sheltered, tule-lined coves along the far shore that is
quiet and protected from wind. Before heading out, I'd been told
that someone had hooked a monster back there, but couldn't handle
the fish and never even saw it.
</P>
<P>
   After catching and releasing about a dozen big crappie and bass
in the 15-inch class, alternating gear, I had worked my way to this
spot, and took bass in 3 of 12 casts, all about 3-pounders, then
paddled around a tule point for another cast. I'm not the greatest
flycaster around, but this time delivered a gentle touch, plopping
that popper just inches away from a tule berm.
</P>
<P>
   I let that popper sit there for 10 seconds, then twitched it
once, with tiny ripples emerging around it. In the next second,
what looked like Moby Bass detonated the surface in full attack,
and before I knew it, the fish was hooked and charging off. The
first run was short and powerful, what bass anglers call ``a
freight train.'' I leaned back hard on the rod, and for a minute or
so, played give and take, and then in turn, the fish then came to
surface at an angle about 30 feet out, and I got a full-on look:
About 30 inches long, a foot across from back to stomach, a
12-pounder, maybe bigger.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two seconds, Moby Bass powered straight down to the
bottom, and while I tried to contain the fish, it burrowed into the
weed-covered bottom like a gopher, and just kept going. Suddenly I
was at a complete standstill. At one point, with the rod still
arched, I opened a Pepsi and tried to figure out what to do. After
10 minutes, it became obvious there was nothing I could do. The
fish had buried himself in the weeds, and there was no way I could
get him out.
</P>
<P>
   Late that afternoon, as I rowed back to the dock, I kept
thinking about Moby Bass, and that he's still down there. Next
time, I bring a heavier rod, an 8-weight, I figured, and maybe a
duck lure. As I stepped out of the boat, I looked over at the
island, and noted the family of geese was still ashore, staying
clear of the water. They also learned their lesson for the day.

TRAIN COMPANIES IN JAPAN LOOK FOR WAYS TO CURTAIL GROWING NUMBER OF
SUICIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUNITACHI CITY, Japan _ With its rows of cherry trees casting
soothing pools of shade at midday and mothers ferrying babies on
the backs of bicycles across the tracks, there is hardly anything
sinister about the railroad crossing at the edge of this town.
</P>
<P>
   But with trains speeding by every three to five minutes, and
relative discretion guaranteed by its bucolic setting, this simple
railroad crossing has emerged as a favorite spot for ending one's
life. And the booming number of deaths on this rail line has given
it the reputation of being Japan's suicide express.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live on the second floor of that green house, and there seem
to be suicides here all the time'' said Yukari Omoto, a 30-year-old
mother who was ferrying her toddler daughter to town in a bicycle
seat. ``When I hear the noise I look out the window to see. By
coincidence, once I saw the whole thing take place.''
</P>
<P>
   In just a few minutes of interviews, Omoto's gory description
was matched by tales of death on the tracks by many others whose
daily commutes take them past this spot, a reflection of just how
banal the events have become. ``At the beauty parlor I heard that
people walk with their backs to the trains and jump on the track at
the last moment,'' said Yoshiko Hatori, a 44-year-old
archaeologists' assistant. ``It seems that they're coming in
bunches.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, rail suicides have come in such bunches lately that the
operator of this line, the East Japan Railway Co., or JR East, has
begun to treat them as nothing less than a companywide disaster.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, suicide deaths skyrocketed on JR East's
network of lines, increasing to 212 last year, from 81 at the start
of the decade and far outstripping the 50 percent increase in the
number of suicides nationally during that period. And year in and
year out, the 80 miles of the company's Chuo Rapid, a heavily
traveled commuter express to the bedroom communities west of the
capital bears the largest concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are suffering major losses from suicide,'' said Masaki
Ogata, general manager for transport safety of JR East. ``We've
been studying the problem for 13 years now. There are various
measures that we can take to reduce suicides, but in the end, man
is the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The train company will not say exactly what the suicides have
cost it.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a suicide causes an hourlong delay in train service,
which begins with a sudden stop, and then the dreaded announcement
over the loudspeaker that there has been a ``human incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Train companies charge the families of suicide victims for
damages caused by the suicides. JR East is just one of several
train and subway companies operating in the Tokyo area, but it is
widely rumored that JR East became the most popular line for
suicides because it charged the bereaved families the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a delicate matter,'' said a rail official, who
declined to give information on damage claims by the company.
``Naturally, we would not like to encourage people.'' Other rail
companies, for that matter, would not even release suicide
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   JR East's latest efforts to discourage suicide include painting
crossings like these in a green so bright it could have sprung from
The Wizard of Oz. The thinking behind this, based on psychologists'
studies, is that the dazzling color will alter the state of mind of
would-be suicides. The company has also increased the number of
remote surveillance cameras along its route and trimmed back tree
branches to deny people a sense of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   At enclosed stations, where 46 percent of the deaths occurred
last year, JR East has begun installing mirrors across the tracks
from passenger platforms, with the idea that the sight of oneself
could give a jumper pause.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts say, though, that efforts like these are likely to
prove futile. Psychologists speak of Japan's suicide problem as an
economic crisis and social crisis all wrapped up in one.
</P>
<P>
   The decadelong rash of suicides has coincided with an economic
stagnation that is unequaled in modern Japanese history. In a
society where much is driven by shame, record-high levels of
unemployment have turned many men into despondent daytime wanderers
who pretend to have gainful occupations by staying away from home
all day.
</P>
<P>
   Many people here say that as a nation, too, Japan seems to have
lost its purpose. For decades, the goal was to catch up with the
West economically. Since attaining that goal in the 1980s, the
country has been adrift.
</P>
<P>
   When he set up a telephone hot line last year to help suicidal
people, with financial sponsorship from JR East, Dr. Yukio Saito,
received 1,300 calls a week from people _ mostly men _ who said
they were ashamed of their failings and were considering ending
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic crisis has created quite a lot of anxiety at the
turn of the century,'' said Saito. ``There is a lack of hope.
People have no dreams for the future, and everything seems to be
declining.'' In such a setting, he said, ``suicide has become sort
of epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kunitachi City, as she crossed the tracks aboard her
plain black bicycle, a 68-year-old woman who has long lived in this
town and who would give her name only as Sato said much the same
thing, only in simpler terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seem to be more people doing it all the time,'' she said
about the railway suicides. ``There was a time when the only people
you would hear about dying here were junior high school students
fooling around on the tracks. But that was before the economy went
bad.''

   TWO SLEEK HOTELS FOR NEW ORLEANS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two renovations have brought a bold postmodern twist to New
Orleans' upscale hotel scene, where furnishings tend to be antique,
real or fake, fabrics are often flowery, and charm has long been
mandatory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more visible of the hotels is the W New Orleans in the
Central Business District, formerly a Sheraton Four Points and a
neighbor of Harrah's new casino. Nearby, the W New Orleans-French
Quarter is a dramatic remake of the Hotel de la Poste.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But neither of the hotels, both of which opened officially on
May 11, is without a trace of Louisiana culture. Beyond the
striking red and gold velvets, black leather and oversize chrome
tick-tack-toe games in the small reception area of the W in the
French Quarter, there are voodoo dolls for sale in the guest rooms'
snack bars, for $7 each. The same is true of the W in the Central
Business District, where there is a marble-and-glass staircase and
a backgammon set made of cloth, and chaises longues sit legless in
the playfully decorated lobby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As in other W properties, both the 98-unit French Quarter hotel
and its sibling, which has 400 guest rooms and 23 suites, are
furnished with beds outfitted with pillow-topped mattresses and
down comforters. The rooms' 27-inch television sets are equipped
with wireless keyboards offering fast Internet access.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the downtown W, the signature restaurant is Zoe Bistrot,
where the cuisine is French. In a room off the lobby, Whiskey Blue
is a relative of cocktail lounges in Manhattan and elsewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the French Quarter W, an Italian-style restaurant, Bacco, run
by the Brennan family, who run Commander's Palace, is a holdover
from the Hotel de la Poste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rates at the W New Orleans-French Quarter, 316 Chartres Street,
(504) 581-1200, fax (504) 522-3208, start at $139; in high season
(roughly fall, winter and early spring), $199 to $339.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the W New Orleans, 333 Poydras Street, (504) 525-9444, fax
(504) 581-7179, rates start at $129; in high season, $179 to $339.
Both hotels have pools; the W New Orleans has a fitness center. &QL;

<P>
   BUS LINK TO YOSEMITE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reduce the number of cars in Yosemite, a public
bus system is now making scheduled runs into the national park from
three surrounding counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (Yarts) is
providing service to Yosemite Valley along Highway 140 from a
terminus in Merced, west of the park; passengers can catch a bus at
a number of points along the route, and buses make several stops in
Yosemite. There will be about 14 daily departures during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is weekend service from Coulterville, also
west of the park, and there are daily trips from the valley floor
to Wawona inside Yosemite's southern entrance. Weekend service from
Mammoth Lakes, southeast of Yosemite, started Memorial Day weekend
</P>
<P>
   The new service, which connects with Yosemite's existing shuttle
system, will run all year, although departures will be far more
frequent in summer. Most trips are made with large touring buses,
and fares vary depending on distance. The trip from Merced to the
valley visitors center takes about two and three-quarters hours one
way and costs $15 round trip, $14 for ages 4 to 12 and seniors;
from El Portal, just west of Yosemite, the trip takes about an hour
and costs $7 round trip, $6 for children. The park entry fee ($20 a
vehicle for up to seven days) is included in the fare. &QL;

<P>
   WEB SITE TRACKS AIRPORT CONDITIONS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Federal Aviation Administration's effort to reduce
air traffic delays this summer is to do a better job of putting
together a picture of air traffic delays around the country and
sharing it with its own personnel, the airlines and anyone else who
needs to know. As a result, the agency has established a reasonably
consumer-friendly Web site for travelers, www.atcscc .faa.gov,
giving a window on its Air Traffic Control Strategic Command
Center.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The main page shows a map of the contiguous 48 states and the
major airports; clicking on one shows the delays. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there is not much to say. But on May 10, a day of
widespread thunderstorms in the east, clicking on ORD (better known
as O'Hare) got this response:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to SUPPORT SWAP, departure traffic destined to New York
City's La Guardia Airport is currently experiencing delays
averaging 413 minutes, with some flights receiving as much as 500
minutes delay.'' The glossary explained that SWAP is Severe Weather
Avoidance Program; SUPPORT is undefined. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Newark, it said the numbers were 337 minutes and 500
minutes. Other entries said ``Due to intense TSTMS, departure
traffic destined to ZBW airport will not be allowed to depart until
at or after 5 P.M. CDT.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The terminology is a little rough. A glossary notes that ZBW is
the Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center, which is not an
airport at all but a control center in Nashua, N.H., that handles
traffic to and from Boston, Hartford and other New England
airports. ZNY Airport means the traffic center that covers New
York's major airports. TSTMS is thunderstorms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Calling up La Guardia Airport produced an advisory that gate
hold and taxi delays were ``between 255 and 269 minutes in length
and increasing.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE SUMMER HOUSE, REINVENTED IN ENGLAND  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who wants to find out what a sitooterie is should head
for Belsay Hall in northeast England this summer. Scattered around
the 30-acre landscaped garden of this grand house built in Greek
revival style by Sir Charles Monck in 1817 are 12 sitooteries, the
Scottish colloquialism for a structure to sit ``oot'' in. Twelve
leading architects, including Sir Norman Foster, Claudio
Silverstrin and Julian Opie, have designed contemporary
interpretations of the traditional summer house and pavilion, which
will be exhibited through Sept. 30 at Belsay Hall in
Northumberland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nick Crosbie, of Inflate, has reinvented the bandstand, with a
movable molded plastic canopy, and his entry, positioned near the
front hall, is the first image visitors will see. FAT (Fashion,
Architecture, Taste) has designed a miniature Romanesque church
along the woodland walk; Julian Opie's sitooterie is open to
interpretation: it could be a garage, a customs barrier or a Greek
temple. Perched on an arched ha-ha, Thomas Heatherwick Studio's
sitooterie has more than 5,000 protruding ash batons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sitooteries are part of English Heritage's Year of Public
Sculpture, a countrywide program of exhibitions, festivals and
workshops devoted to sculpture. A free leaflet is available from
English Heritage, (44-207) 973-3434, as is ``A User's Guide to
Public Sculpture,'' a guide to the public monuments and sculptures,
which highlights nine sculpture walks in regional cities ($12 plus
postage). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sitooteries exhibition is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Admission is $5.70, children $2.85. Belsay Hall is 10 miles from
Morpeth station in Northumberland, 285 miles from London; telephone
(44-1661) 881636. &QL;

 &HT;    GRANDPARENTS' RIGHT TO VISIT CHILDREN LIMITED BY HIGH COURT
 &HT;    670&AMP;insert.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dealing a setback to grandparents, a divided U.S.
Supreme Court ruled Monday that they do not have a constitutional
right to visit their grandchildren against parents' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-3 decision grew out of a case from Washington state, which
has one of the nation's most liberal visitation laws. The ruling's
impact on the 50 different state visitation laws is likely to vary.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching its decision, the high court weighed the rights of
families to raise their children without government interference
against laws giving grandparents visitation rights in an era when
divorce and out-of-wedlock births have blurred the rights of the
extended family. The court ruled in favor of parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a presumption that fit parents act in the best
interest of their children,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for
the court's majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children
... there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself
into the private realm of the family to further question the
ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the
rearing of that parent's children.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing in dissent, argued that the
Constitution ``leaves room for states to consider the impact on a
child of possibly arbitrary parental decisions that neither serve
nor are motivated by the best interests of the child.''
</P>
<P>
   In a complicated ruling, the court issued six separate opinions:
the majority 6-3 ruling by O'Connor, two concurring opinions and
three dissenting opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the ruling may be limited, because O'Connor
focused on the application of the Washington state law, rather than
on the constitutionality of grandparent visitation laws in general,
said Jan LaRue, senior director of legal studies for the Family
Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agree with Justice (David) Souter that the Supreme Court
should have affirmed the Washington Supreme Court's decision that
the law was unconstitutional 'on it's face,' and not just as
applied,'' LaRue said. ``Parental rights are a fundamental
constitutional right and deserve the utmost protection in the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, parents groups hailed the decision while AARP, the
nation's largest elder organization, said it would work with other
states to improve their visitation laws to comply with the court's
ruling.

legislated grandparents' rights, said his group was pleased with
the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't look at this as a defeat for grandparents, we look at
this as a significant step toward supporting families,'' Dodge
said, noting that nearly all disputes between grandparents and
adult children are handled out of court. ``It's a defeat for
grandparents who want to litigate rather than cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Entmacher, vice president of the National Women's Law
Center, said Washington state's law _ which allowed ``any person''
to seek court-ordered visitations ``at any time'' _ went too far in
interfering with parental rights concerning care, custody and
control of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``States cannot simply substitute their judgments for a parent's
simply because a state judge believes a 'better' decision could be
made,'' Entmacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Matheis, AARP's director of state legislation, said the
case before the high court ``was never about giving grandparents
the right to usurp parents' control in raising their children,'' it
was about giving grandparents access to their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Matheis said the ruling leaves room for grandparents ``in states
with more narrowly drawn or applied statutes (to) continue to
petition the courts for visitation which is in the best interest of
the child.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, O'Connor noted that roughly 28 percent of the
children in America live in one-parent homes rather than the more
traditional two-parent households. Such changes have sparked laws
in every state giving grandparents some degree of contact with
their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extension of statutory rights in this area to persons
other than a child's parents, however, comes with an obvious
cost,'' O'Connor wrote. ``For example, the state's recognition of
an independent third party interest in a child can place a
substantial burden on the traditional parent-child relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington state case grew out of a relationship between
Tommie Granville and Brad Troxel, who never married but produced
two daughters before ending their relationship in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   After Troxel committed suicide in 1993, his parents continued to
see their granddaughters until Granville attempted to limit their
visits to one short visit per month.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels filed suit seeking more extended visitation rights,
including one weekend per month and a week in the summer. A state
court found in favor of the grandparents, but an appeals court
dismissed their claim and the Washington state supreme court upheld
that decision. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the state supreme
court's ruling.

CHEERS FOR TONY BROADCAST, DESPITE A DROP IN THE RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: a list of winners appears at end of story.) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite the return of Rosie O'Donnell as host, the
competition may have been just too much for the Tony Awards on
Sunday night. The show was up against ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the season premiere of ``Sex and the City,'' and the
Lakers-Trail Blazers game.
</P>
<P>
   The fast national rating for the two-hour CBS broadcast _
meaning an early tally _ was the lowest ever: 6.1, down from 7.0
last year. The ratings have been steadily declining, from 8.4 in
1998 and 9.6 in 1997. Each rating point represents just over a
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, within the theater industry the consensus was that
this year's ceremony was a great improvement over last year's. In
addition to what many considered a misguided effort to honor
straight plays with a montage of lines, last year's show at the
last minute dropped the number from one of the nominated musicals,
``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' because of time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   This year the show ended early, all the musical numbers were
performed, and most people in the industry agreed that the
broadcast made Broadway look exciting.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who came away disappointed, like the creators
of ``The Wild Party,'' which won no awards and, with flagging
ticket sales, was in need of a boost. George C. Wolfe, the
director, co-writer and co-producer of the show, said that there
were no plans yet to close it.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows shut out of the awards included Susan Stroman's
revival of ``Music Man,'' Matthew Warchus' acclaimed production of
Sam Shepard's ``True West,'' and ``Dirty Blonde,'' Claudia Shear's
homage to Mae West.  &QL;

CELEBRITIES RUSHING TO CASH IN THEIR FAME ON THE DOT-COM BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott, former stars of
the San Francisco 49ers, were there. So was Keyshawn Johnson, the
outspoken New York Jets wide receiver who was recently traded to
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that dozens of venture capitalists and
various other boys of Silicon Valley were giddily gathering around
their Sunday afternoon heroes seeking autographs and exchanging
backslaps.
</P>
<P>
   But the fawning was mutual at the Fairmont Hotel here, where an
all-star roster of football and baseball players gathered one rainy
afternoon in February for the annual meeting of Champion Ventures,
an investment fund set up for pro athletes. The jocks may not have
seemed as starstruck, but they were eager to be there, too, seeking
a piece of the dot-com action and hoping a little Silicon Valley
magic would rub off on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I want equity,'' said Johnson, eyeing his agent warily
across the ballroom. ``I don't want to be just the guy with the
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about convergence. For all the buzzwords about the future
melding of high-technology, multimedia and telecommunications, the
real buzz these days has more to do with the coming together of
Silicon Valley money and the culture of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that little extra cachet,'' said Kevin Fong, a venture
capitalist with the Mayfield Fund who hopes big-name athletes will
give the companies he has helped foster an advantage. ``Everyone is
jaded. They want a hot company right on the fine edge. Celebrities
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Silicon Valley is beginning to resemble Hollywood, chalk it
up to more than the Spago's in downtown Palo Alto. A parade of
agents and celebrities have been making the pilgrimage to the
Valley in recent months in the hope of using their fame to cash in
on the dot-com boom. The days, it seems, of demanding simply a
paycheck for a product endorsement are passe. Now celebrities
expect to be  &UR; owners &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the peculiarities of the Internet phenomenon has made
all that possible. Web companies that need instant branding but
have little cash on hand can offer the lure of stock options and
potential market riches. And who better than a movie star or
athlete to help them? Especially considering the success of William
Shatner, the former Star Trek icon, who received 125,000 stock
options _ worth millions today _ to pitch for Priceline.com. Or
Cindy Crawford who became the name and face of fashion retailer
Estyle for a stake in the company and a seat on the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hollywood agents are getting into the act, carving out a
niche in the lucrative new media trade. The Creative Artists Agency
has teamed up with Idealab, the Pasadena, Calif.-based creator of
online ventures like Etoys, to build entertainment sites for the
agency's clients. And that doesn't even begin to factor in what
will happen when large media and entertainment companies catch up.
Then the lines between e-commerce, sports and entertainment will
blur further.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are realizing that entertainment might help
them get above the clutter,'' said John Mass, vice president of
corporate advisory new media, at the William Morris Agency in Los
Angeles. ``There is finally a role for media and entertainment
having an effect on technology.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, venture capitalists are beginning to act a little
more like Hollywood agents. ``To the extent Hollywood is about
access, we have it,'' said Fong. And agents, who control the
talent, are beginning to think more like dot-com venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone would know, Mass of William Morris would. For eight
years, Mass, a former investment banker, has headed the new media
group there, a talent agency known more for its roster of movie
stars than its corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Several clients _ including Lucent Technologies and Anheuser
Busch _ have knocked on his door recently to help execute their new
media strategies. In particular, he said, William Morris arranged a
meeting between executives at SportsLine.com and Intel Corp. before
SportsLine went public. As a result, Intel made a 4.9 percent
investment in the company. ``This gave SportsLline the halo of a
technology company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But William Morris has been equally active is matching up stars
with Internet companies. Last September, an agent introduced Robert
Levitan, the chief executive and co-founder of Flooz.com, which
offers on-line gift certificates for retail Internet sites, to
Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Everyone realizes there is no longer a distinction
between marketing, branding and the experience,'' Levitan said.
``Because we had no brand equity we needed to put brand attributes
around the product and service. Hollywood definitely wants a piece
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitan was looking for a spokesperson for Flooz. Goldberg, the
star of ``Sister Act'' and a past host for the Oscars ceremony, was
perfect for the role. She ``speaks to all groups, men, women,
blacks, whites,'' Levitan said. A 15-minute conversation turned
into an hour. And within a week, she had signed a contract and was
shooting print ads _ becoming in the process the third-largest
shareholder in the company. (Neither Levitan nor Goldberg would
disclose how many options in the still-private company she holds.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew what he was talking about and I was ready to start,''
Goldberg said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But she has influence with more than consumers. Levitan said
Flooz.com, which is based in New York, recently signed a contract
with BarnesandNoble.com to offer Flooz gift certificates. But
BarnesandNoble.com was slow to follow through on the details. So he
asked Goldberg to give the executive in charge a nudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had her call and the secretary was more than a little
surprised,'' Levitan said. ``It sounds like her,'' he said the
secretary whispered to her boss. It was just enough to get the
company moving on the project. Besides, Goldberg said, ``I think it
helped him understand that this was not just a gig for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what could be better than having a hard-to-reach
celebrity on call? In January, Levitan made the 45-minute ride to
Goldberg's home outside New York to show her the coming year's
marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Valentine's Day?'' Levitan said she asked him. He
had no commercials in the works. ``I have time next Tuesday,'' she
told him.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   For Goldberg the experience, so far, has been worthwhile.
``People say, `Why did you do it?''' she said. ``I pay homage to
William Shatner because he made it viable to go to folks like me.
It was an opportunity to make a little dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she added, it relieves some of the pressure of relying
solely on movies as a source of income. ``It doesn't make you feel
bad you didn't have a huge opening weekend,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But access to celebrities can only enhance success; it doesn't
guarantee it. Silicon Valley and Hollywood have a lot to offer each
other, said Dan Case, chairman of Chase H&AMP;Q. The convergence of
technology and media is real. But, he warned, ``there is a growing
numbness, a disconnectedness from reality.''
</P>
<P>
   James Breyer, a partner at venture firm Accel Partners in Palo
Alto, agreed. He has talked to a number of celebrities looking to
either dot-com themselves or find a company looking for a
spokesperson. ``Today I can't tell you whether it will pay off,''
said Breyer. ``Anyone who has spent time putting these kinds of
deals together realizes it is really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that in the crush to cash in on the star of the
moment, business plans will be poorly thought out. Just because a
person knows how to pose for a camera, for example, doesn't mean
they know anything about building a Web business. Actors, too, are
on location for months on end and may underestimate how much work
it takes to help create a brand. And while it may be great fun to
hang out with Joe Montana, Breyer said, ``it is just as important
to talk about an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Still that doesn't deter the likes of Calvin C. Lui, the
28-year-old chief executive of Theman.com, a shopping and lifestyle
Web site for men. He recently hired Karen Sortito, a Hollywood
marketing executive from Sony Pictures Entertainment as his chief
marketing officer, and was at the Champion Ventures meeting,
picking up business cards, hoping that one of the athletes would be
interested in his site and willing to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has had no takers. But Montana is a wine drinker, he
mused, and maybe would be interested in writing a column about
different vintages. But why not just hire a professional wine
columnist? Lui grinned and sighed, as if pointing out the obvious.
``If Joe has a site there,'' he said, ``it will be read because it
is Joe.''

DESPITE CRITICS, COCKFIGHTING THRIVES ACROSS RURAL AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Okla., N.M., La., Texas, Ohio, Ariz., Ala., Mo.)   By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KELLYVILLE, Okla. _ In a carnival atmosphere on Friday night,
200 people gathered at the local cockfighting club to watch
roosters tear each other apart and to bet on their fates.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, the scene was being repeated across the country,
from seedy pits in urban areas like the Bronx to private clubs in
rural communities like this one, where the blood sport of
cockfighting remains entrenched.
</P>
<P>
   Cockfighting classes, instructional videos and books,
newsletters and magazines help fuel a subculture and sustain a
variety of enterprises nationwide. More than half of the 170 pages
of the May issue of Gamecock, a 62-year-old monthly magazine that
claims 16,000 subscribers, were advertisements aimed at
cockfighters. Breeders from Connecticut to California raise birds
for sale at home and abroad, offering proven winners for $1,000,
untested cocks for $75 to $300, and a dozen eggs of winners' mother
hens for $100 to $200. Farm-supply companies sell trainloads of
food for the birds.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines also run ads for drugs. One labeled Strychly Speed
is the stimulant strychine, which, the ad says ``speeds up the
bird's reflexes, making him quick on the draw.'' Another, called
Pure Aggression, can ``put an end to the fear of shock in those
long, hard fights.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the ads and feed stores, a score of manufacturers sell
gaffs and a wide variety of curved, razor-sharp knives, up to 3
inches long, for mounting on legs. The knives, costing up to $100,
tend to kill faster than cheaper gaffs because they rip as well as
pierce. The weapons simply deal a quick death to cocks that would
die in much longer bouts with natural spurs, the breeders maintain.
</P>
<P>
   Cockfighting endures legally in New Mexico, Louisiana and
Oklahoma, which is home to more than 40 established backroad pits,
and illegally in many other states. While betting is a misdemeanor,
it is routine at the pits and ignored by most county sheriffs.
</P>
<P>
   All states allow breeding the birds, which the breeders sell in
states where fighting is legal, in the Philippines, Guam, Mexico
and other countries where the sport is popular, or in the woods and
urban back alleys.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years though, cockfighting has become a target
of the advocates of animal protection. They call it barbaric and
unambiguously cruel, the only sport since the prohibition of dog
fighting decades ago in which animals are bred solely to kill one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the Humane Society of the United States, based in
Washington, helped opponents in Arizona and Missouri win ballot
initiatives that outlawed it. Early this year, the Oklahoma
Coalition Against Cockfighting, largely with $100,000 from the
society, gathered more than 100,000 signatures for a referendum,
possibly in November, that would ban cockfighting and punish
violators with fines of up to $25,000 and jail terms of up to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, more than 180 House members and more than 40
senators have sponsored bills to prohibit the interstate shipment
of fighting cocks.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, only the small silhouette sign of a rooster marks
the turn off Route 66 in Kellyville up a dirt road to the
corrugated metal home of the Kellyville Game Club. There, in the
club's glass-enclosed pit, a man in a red baseball cap and another
in a gray T-shirt step onto the dirt floor from opposite corners.
Under one arm, each cradles a fidgeting two-year-old rooster with
alert orange eyes.
</P>
<P>
   These are strikingly majestic birds, one of the Hatch breed, the
other a Roundhead, with shimmering manes of orange hackle feathers
and arching black tail feathers. But their heads, shorn of wattles
and haughty combs, have become bobbing red knobs. Bound like thorns
to the nubs of each of their severed spurs, they wear a curved,
2-inch long steel gaff that can puncture hearts, brains and lungs
with the thrust of a heel.
</P>
<P>
   The birds are two of the 150, paired by weapons and weight, that
will fight at the regular Friday night derby starting at 10
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   Admission, restricted to members of the breeders' association
and their families, costs $11. The 39 men who have entered the
required four cocks in the derby pay participation fees of $50 or
$75. The fees go into the purse, sometimes up to $5,000, that is
awarded to those whose four cocks win.
</P>
<P>
   In the pit now, the men with the Hatch and the Roundhead begin
the pre-combat ritual of thrusting their birds back and forth, beak
to beak. The betting starts. ``Ten on the red hat,'' shouts one of
200 patrons in the six tiers of seats surrounding the pit. ``Twenty
on the gray shirt,'' shouts another, and another.
</P>
<P>
   The referee shouts, ``Ready, pit!'' The birds explode from their
handlers' grasp and collide breast-to-breast, a foot off the
ground. Beak grabbing beak, hackles flaring like porcupine quills,
the cocks bounce apart and collide, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   The Hatch takes command. The Roundhead rolls over, then revives.
He pounds the Hatch with a foot, spearing a lung. The Hatch fades,
hunkering down and refusing to budge. Coughing up drops of blood,
his breathing sounds like footsteps on gravel. The Roundhead,
fatigued but intact, wins. The Hatch is carried off, most likely to
die.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the full dimensions of this business. Sandy C.
Johnson, a breeder in Ohio and director of administration of the
United Gamefowl Breeders Association, with affiliates in 33 states,
declined to disclose figures. She said cockfighting generates
hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales of birds,
medicines, feed and breeding and fighting gear.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is probably the biggest producer, just ahead of Texas,
Johnson said. ``We estimate that Alabama has 11,545 farms'' that
raise fighting cocks, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Urbanowsky, president of Blue Bonnet Feeds in Ardmore,
Okla. said he and his competitors sell $25 million to $30 million a
year in fighting cock feed to stores in Oklahoma alone. John
Wilson, manager of Midway Feeds, a store in Gans near the Arkansas
border in east central Oklahoma, said cockfighters account for a
third of his sales.
</P>
<P>

   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Among the industry's customers is Jeffrey Pearce, 43, who has a
30-acre fighting cock farm on the outskirts of Sallisaw, near
Arkansas. Pearce moved to Oklahoma eight years ago from Oregon,
where he and his father also raised cocks. His father-in-law is a
prominent breeder in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce raises Hatches, known for power, and Blacks, known for
speed, and continually crosses them. He has all but sold out this
year's production of 200 two-year-olds, for $150 to $175 each,
largely to the Philippines and Guam.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce said that starting at puberty, at six or eight months
old, each male bird, a stag until its first molt at two years old,
is dispatched to its own two-sided, 4-foot tall metal A-frame hut
and tethered by a 9-foot cord to keep him off the turf of
neighboring males.
</P>
<P>
   Across Pearce's closely groomed field of huts, 200 stags
strutted and crowed one day, pecking at the grass and their feed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike inexpert breeders, Pearce said, he does not drug the
birds. He said good care produces the toughest, healthiest
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't make them fight,'' he said. ``Their sole purpose in
life is to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Oliver, attorney for the 7,000-member Oklahoma Gamefowl
Breeders Association, said of the birds, ``They just don't like
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Cockfighting also survives in urban areas. This weekend, the
police in New York City raided a rundown movie house in the Bronx
and arrested 190 people just as a night of betting and bloody
fighting was getting started.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators had paid $25 to sit under low-hanging fluorescent
lights in a squalid auditorium and wager $200 to $500 on the
roosters. The theater was the scene of a similar raid in March
1995, when the police stopped what they said was a national
championship cockfight. Nearly 300 people were arrested or ticketed
that night.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   George R. Day, who raises 100 cocks in Arkansas, said the
opponents of cockfighting do not understand what the sport means in
many rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people who have never lived a rural lifestyle trying
to impress their values on us,'' Day said. ``It doesn't mean
they're right. It just means there are more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   To the humane society and the state's anti-cockfighting
coalition, the sport is beyond justification, unlike killing for
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this as a top priority,'' Wayne Pacelle, senior vice
president of the Humane Society, said of the group's opposition to
the sport.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seeing their traditions and livelihoods under attack, Oklahoma's
breeders formed a lobbying group that is attempting to stall the
referendum with legal challenges for at least a year, allowing time
to eventually kill it.
</P>
<P>
   It could succeed because cockfighting has become a dicey
political issue. Breeders and supporters contribute to political
campaigns, and like most state politicians, Gov. Frank Keating, a
Republican, has been staying out of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really has not taken a position,'' said John Cox, a
spokesman for Keating. ``He's for people deciding the issue. I
don't think he sees a lot of merit in cockfighting, but there are a
lot of business interests in the state that have to be adhered to a
little bit.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I work on the sales floor, and I had an
excellent record here until a problem occurred with a very
difficult customer last week. He was nasty and insulting, and I was
not very nice in response. He wrote a letter to my manager and to
the owner of the company complaining about me, and my manager read
the riot act to me. Does this seem fair? R.H.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Your manager should be spending more time reading
management books and less time reading the riot act. Rather than
playing the come-down-very-hard card, your manager should have
played the investigation card. He or she should have discussed the
situation with you and followed up with the customer as well. There
are obviously two sides to the situation, and before taking any
kind of disciplinary action, both sides should have been fully
explored.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, it is possible that your admittedly unfriendly
reaction to the customer inflamed the situation. At the same time,
it is a complete myth to think that the customer is always right.
There are countless situations in which customer behavior is
obnoxious, destructive and even illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Since you have had a successful work record with the company and
it does not sound like you are frequently in a battle mode with the
customers, you can look at this event as a learning experience.
Hopefully, you learned that lowering yourself to the level of an
abusive customer does not do anyone any good. There's also
something to be learned about communication, support, respect and
trust in your company. You may be in a sales organization, but
management may have forgotten the importance of treating employees
like customers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a great way to do part of my job, and I am convinced
that it will be faster, better and save the company money. My
manager is not the least bit interested in my idea and told me to
do the job the way it is specified. How can I convince him to give
me a chance? P.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Even if there are critical standards, procedures or rules
that call for your work to be carried out as specified, there are
no standards, procedures or rules calling for your manager to
ignore you. If things truly cannot be changed, he should discuss
this with you.
</P>
<P>
   If the rigidity is more a function of his managerial style than
strict operational guidelines, there are some steps that may
persuade him to be more receptive to your ideas. It will be
important for you to try to understand his style of thinking and
working. For example, if he is a detail-minded person, give him
every possible detail to support your plan. Or, if he is quite
visual, use charts and graphs in your presentation. Let him see how
he will benefit by your approach, such as through increased
productivity, work quality, recognition or other factors that are
particularly important to him.
</P>
<P>
   You can also suggest that you use your approach on a trial
basis, or that you simultaneously use your approach and the
company's approach on the next project and compare the two. If you
continue to hit the wall when you suggest options to management, at
some point you may want to look at other options for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: All of us worked very hard on a project, and we put in tons
of extra hours. Our manager went around and personally thanked
almost everyone when it was done, but I did not get any thanks
until a week had gone by. I feel slighted and I am wondering if I
should say something. A.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: The only thing you should say in response to your manager's
late thank-you is ``you're welcome.'' Granted that feedback should
be given as quickly as possible, there can be totally acceptable
reasons for it to occasionally run late.
</P>
<P>
   If you try to envision a scene in which you tell your boss that
you are disappointed that he did not thank you sooner, it is not a
pretty picture. There is no easy way to mention this
dissatisfaction without sounding petty, childish and insecure. And
by doing so, you are likely to trash all of the goodwill that you
built by working so hard.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the best steps for you to take are to put all of
this behind you and to continue to work diligently on your job. At
least your manager understands the importance of thanking his
employees for a job well done, and it would not be surprising to
find that he improves his timing in the future. Even though your
manager can be late with the thanks, there are many employees who
would be thankful to work for someone like him.

U.S.-UKRAINE FRIENDSHIP STRIKES AN ECONOMIC BLOW TO A UKRAINIAN
CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARKIV, Ukraine _ There was a brief discussion among U.S.
diplomats _ very brief by all accounts _ to have President Clinton
stop here during his visit to Ukraine, in the home of the
U.S.-sponsored Kharkiv Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential visit was limited to Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is a program to show off this city of heavy
industries, power blackouts and high unemployment to U.S.
investors. This is being done as compensation for Ukraine's
decision to give up multimillion-dollar contracts to help Russia
build a nuclear power plant in Iran, a project that is proceeding
on Iran's Persian Gulf coast at Bushehr without Ukraine's
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Clinton administration persuaded the
Ukrainian government to order Turboatom, a producer of giant steam
turbines and one of this city's largest enterprises, to back out of
the Iranian project. The move was regarded as a great success of
U.S. policy, and it was expected that it would seriously disrupt
Russia's ability to complete the Iranian power station.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright traveled to Kiev in March
1998 and praised President Leonid Kuchma for ``great
statesmanship'' in joining the struggle to ``halt the proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But today, construction at the Bushehr power plant is well under
way, and Russia's deputy minister for atomic energy, Bulat
Nigmatulin, says it will be completed in 2002. Russia is expected
to earn about $1 billion from the project.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that will go to its largest turbine manufacturer, in St.
Petersburg, which has taken over Ukraine's contract to produce a
turbine that will be delivered to Iran in September 2001, said
Viktor Shevchenko, the factory's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the only party that was hurt by U.S. intervention
was Ukraine, a country that the United States has been trying to
help become an economically independent nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of our biggest contracts, and losing it has been
a very serious blow to the economy of our region,'' said Anatoly
Bugaets, Turboatom's general director. ``But of course we are law
abiding people, and when a decision is made at the highest level,
we have to obey.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kharkiv it is difficult to find anyone who thinks that
it was a good thing for Turboatom to walk away from tens of
millions of dollars in contracts with its industrial partners in
Russia for the sake of a nonproliferation objective that _ here at
least _ seems somewhat fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Ukraine may have stood together, however
unsuccessfully, to oppose the sale of civilian nuclear technology
to Iran, but no one in Ukraine, and especially here, is taking a
victory lap around the idle factories of Kharkiv. Nearly a decade
after independence, Ukraine's broken deal with Russia over the
Iranian power plant is emblematic of a lament frequently expressed
here and in the capital, Kiev. It is that Ukraine's agenda for
growth and economic development in the post-Soviet era never seems
to be as important as the strategic objectives of the United States
and its Western allies.
</P>
<P>
   Ukrainian officials point to a series of actions sought by the
United States: closing Chernobyl, the site of the world's worst
nuclear accident; destroying old missile silos; and putting up
high-tech security fences to keep nuclear physicists who are
begging for work from sharing information with the wrong countries.
The Ukrainian officials point out that the United States has
achieved nearly all of its strategic objectives in this former
Soviet republic _ eliminating nuclear weapons, making Ukraine an
unofficial partner of NATO and, in the case of Turboatom, using
Ukraine in an attempt to destabilize Russia's dealings with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine has actually been one of the largest recipients of U.S.
foreign aid in recent years, receiving about $200 million a year,
much of which has gone to nuclear safety needs. But the nation
remains mired in a kind of post-Soviet purgatory of economic and
social lassitude as well as endemic corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nation at risk'' is how the Central Intelligence Agency
described Ukraine in a mid-decade intelligence estimate, warning
that a seriously depressed economy, rampant corruption and fiscal
and monetary chaos were threatening its long-term survival.
</P>
<P>
   Though there are signs that the Ukrainian economy is beginning a
recovery after a decade of unceasing contraction, the Kharkiv
Initiative has failed to generate a single contract for any
industry in this city. Indeed, it has taken two years for the State
Department to open an office here, which is now staffed by a single
contract employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we are disappointed,'' said the Kharkiv regional
governor, Oleg Dyomin, who will travel as a guest of the State
Department to New York, Cleveland and Chicago this summer in his
continuing search for U.S. corporations willing to invest in a
country with serious corruption problems and an unstable electrical
supply. Dyomin will bring color brochures of the Antonov jet
transport produced here, of the Kharkiv tractor plant lineup, the
high-energy physics laboratories and of Turboatom, with its
cavernous and nearly empty production lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any help yet,'' said Anatoly Myalitsa, general
director of Kharkiv's aircraft plant. ``We are not competitors. We
only want a tiny piece of your market in the far north, where our
aircraft is very capable making short take-offs in the snow. Why
would America, a big country, not want to help small Ukraine?''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month in Kiev, Kuchma put on a pained
expression when the subject of the Kharkiv Initiative came up. ``I
don't want to offer any comment on this,'' he said. ``It hurts too
much and, in fact, it is a strong point of criticism that I get
from my opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   One Western businessman, who has observed Ukraine's painfully
slow emergence as a state, tried to capture the mood here by
saying, ``Disillusionment is too strong a word, but disappointment
may not be strong enough.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Any notion that Clinton might visit Kharkiv was overruled,
Western diplomats say, by concerns that the president might be
jeered by unemployed workers from Turboatom, where the Iran
contract was expected to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the
factory's total output over a five year period.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Russia signed a contract with Iran in 1995 to
complete the Bushehr power station, abandoned by German builders in
1979 with the onset of the Iranian Revolution, the Clinton
administration has opposed it and Congress has threatened sanctions
against Russia. And, for the past two years, Congress has reduced
by half foreign aid payments to Russia's central government,
specifically because of the refusal to abandon Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies have long believed that Iran has a
secret program to develop nuclear weapons, dating back even to the
regime of Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlavi, which ended with the 1979
revolution. Just the idea that Iran wanted to generate electricity
with nuclear power instead of using its abundant oil and gas
resources was suspicious, and still is for many analysts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials do not regard the Bushehr project as a source of
nuclear material that could be diverted to an illicit bomb-making
program. But the Clinton administration has taken the view that the
Bushehr project will train an entire generation of Iranian
physicists and engineers in nuclear technologies, and thus enhance
Iran's scientific base, including any program to develop nuclear
weapons. Israel, whose leaders also see their security threatened
by Iran's nuclear program, joined in the diplomatic offensive to
kill the project, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russian and Iranian officials point out that Iran has
placed the Bushehr plant under the rigid safeguards and inspection
regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, when Boris Yeltsin was president of
Russia, Albright and Vice President Al Gore undertook a number of
missions to try to persuade him to cancel the Bushehr contract. But
Yeltsin would not relent, promising instead not to expand Russia's
nuclear cooperation with Iran beyond Bushehr, where as many as four
reactor and turbine units are planned.
</P>
<P>
   The project has suffered some setbacks. The original contract
envisaged a four-and-a-half-year construction schedule. But Iranian
construction companies were not able to repair the German
foundation work _ bombed during the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 _ in
accordance with Russian specifications. Under a revised contract,
Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy has assumed overall management
of the project and will present Iran with a turnkey facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bushehr is a very interesting and profitable contract for
us,'' said Nigmatulin, the Russian atomic energy official.``And at
the same time it is helping us to restore our industrial
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Having failed to persuade Russia to pull out of Bushehr,
Clinton's senior national security advisers in late 1997 began a
campaign to force Ukraine out of the deal. Ukraine's ambassador to
Washington at the time, Yuri Shcherbak, was told that the
administration would prevent Ukraine from purchasing fuel for its
aging nuclear reactors from U.S. companies unless Turboatom gave up
the Iran project.
</P>
<P>
   There were carrots as well sticks, the Kharkiv Initiative among
the carrots, along with promises of Ukrainian participation in
space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure was enormous,'' said a Ukrainian diplomat who was
working in Washington at the time. ``We made the argument that it
made no sense to put Ukraine in the middle,'' she said. ``And we
pointed out that Russia would be able to replace Turboatom with
another turbine supplier, but we could not escape.''
</P>
<P>
   But Turboatom's departure has brought little cheer to Ukraine's
industries, which remain more connected with Russia's industrial
structure than that of the rest of Europe. And as a consequence of
Turboatom's withdrawal, it seems less likely that Ukraine will be
invited to participate in Russian projects to build nuclear power
stations in China and India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kharkiv lost a very good order, and that is a shame,'' said
Nigmatulin, the Russian atomic energy official. ``An order like
this represents the revival of the turbine business,'' though not
for Ukraine.

WITHOUT WOODS, BUICK CLASSIC IS A TUNEUP FOR THE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ Instead of resting before next week's U.S.
Open, many of the world's top golfers have come to New York.
</P>
<P>
   That is good news for the Buick Classic, which begins Thursday
at Westchester Country Club. Six of the top 10 players in the world
ranking will compete in the Buick Classic _ David Duval, Davis Love
III, Phil Mickelson, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els and Jesper Parnevik _
giving the tournament one of its strongest fields ever. Other
recognizable names in the field include Tom Lehman, Jim Furyk,
Sergio Garcia, Paul Azinger, Fred Couples, Steve Elkington, Greg
Norman, Jose Maria Olazabal, Craig Stadler, Bob Tway and the
defending champion Duffy Waldorf.
</P>
<P>
   But golf's most renowned player will be missing: Tiger Woods,
the world's No. 1 player, is following his usual routine of taking
the week off before a major championship. With the U.S. Open
beginning June 15 in Pebble Beach, Calif., players had an
interesting decision to make. Should they skip the Buick Classic
this week, practice at home, then head to Pebble Beach early to
prepare for the Open? Or should they play the Buick Classic, a
tournament played on a challenging, traditional course, hoping for
a strong week that would build confidence and momentum heading into
the Open?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Buick Classic, many top players decided to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good golf course, and I'm sure they'll try to get the
greens firm, the way we'll probably see them next week at Pebble
Beach,'' said Olazabal, who spent part of Monday practicing on the
putting green with Garcia and Miguel Angel Jimenez. ``This is a
good way to prepare for the Open, but I'm not thinking about next
week yet. I'm concentrating on playing well this week.''
</P>
<P>
   For Europeans like Olazabal, who is from Spain, stopping in New
York was a nice way to break up the long trip to the West Coast.
Other players, like Duval, simply enjoy coming to Westchester
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the golf course, and having to travel out to Pebble
Beach after it's over won't be a problem,'' Duval said recently.
``Most guys will still get out to California by Sunday night. And
you don't want to over practice once you get out to the Open
anyway. If you play 18 holes for three or four days at Pebble
Beach, you might be worn out before the tournament starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Buick Classic, held the week after the United States
Open in Pinehurst, N.C., did not attract a field as strong as the
one this year. This will be Mickelson's first appearance at
Westchester since 1993. Norman has not played Westchester since
1996. Neither Garcia, Love nor Parnevik played last year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absence of Woods, who has not played the Buick
Classic since 1997, the field this year will not lack marquee
names.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is strong, and I'm looking forward to a good week,''
Olazabal said. ``You'll need to bring every part of your game to
win here.''

   CLINTON-EUROPE (Moscow) _ Roundup: President Leonid Kuchma of
Ukraine used the occasion of a brief visit by President Clinton to
announce that the Chernobyl nuclear power station will be closed by
Dec. 15. Kuchma made his announcement after the two leaders met in
the white-and-gilded splendor of the Mariinsky presidential palace.
On the six-hour stopover in Kiev, the last leg of Clinton's last
trip to Europe as president, he also delivered a speech to tens of
thousands of Ukrainians. By Elaine Sciolino and Michael R. Gordon.

   ATT-MEDIAONE (Washington) _ Clearing the final significant

   SCOTUS-GRANDPARENTS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court strikes
down a Washington state law that had allowed not only grandparents
but also non-relatives to petition for the right to visit children.
The 6-3 decision overturned the Washington law as ``breathtakingly
broad.'' But the justices leave open the possibility that less

   NJ-CENSUS (Washington) _ The New Jersey Assembly approves a bill

traditional counting methods when it redraws congressional and

latest example of how the battle over the use of statistical
sampling to augment the census count has quietly shifted from

<P>
   SOUTHERN-BAPTISTS (Winston-Salem, N.C.) _ A deep rift has
developed within the nation's largest Protestant denomination, the
Southern Baptist Convention, in which many in the moderate minority
have created a separate existence, without actually breaking away.
Reluctant to accept conservatives' insistence that the Bible be
interpreted literally and that women be barred from serving as
pastors, moderates have set up seminaries, sent out missionaries
and created church networks, like the Cooperative Baptist
Fellowship, which counts 1,800 congregations as contributors to its
budget. By Gustav Niebuhr. (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in ``a''

   COCKFIGHTS (Kellyville, Okla.) _ Cockfighting furtively survives
in squalid dives in urban America, but in rural communities around
the country it remains entrenched. Its advocates claim it generates
hundreds of millions of dollars for breeders and suppliers. While
it is legal in New Mexico, Louisiana and Oklahoma, it has become a

and Senate would prohibit the interstate shipment of fighting cocks

problems linked to a imbalance in the equilibrium of forces and
ensure 100 percent the security of all European countries, with the

   UKRAINE-ECON (Kharkiv, Ukraine) _ Nearly a decade after
independence, Ukraine's decision to go along with the United States
and break a deal with Russia over an Iranian power station is
emblematic of a lament frequently expressed in this city: that
Ukraine's agenda for growth and economic development in the
post-Soviet era never seems to be as important as the strategic

   SCI-GRAND-CANYON (Undated) _ This summer more than one million
tourists will venture to the rim of the Grand Canyon and are likely
to feel their jaws drop as they gaze upon the world famous
spectacle: a vast wilderness of rocks, deep gorges and a mighty
river lost below cliffs, buttes and pinnacles festooned in pastel
shades of purple, orange, pink and green. Inevitably, some of these
visitors will turn to a park ranger and ask: ``How did the Grand
Canyon get formed? Why did this happen here and nowhere else?'' The
honest answer is that nobody knows. By Sandra Blakeslee. (The story

 &HT;    Fixes graduating class numbers; date of father's death

<P>
   TARBORO, N.C. _ Surrounded by members of Al Gore's Secret
Service unit, Gerald Perry bid the Tarboro High School Class of
2000 farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Perry, 18, vice president of the 136-member graduating class,
became the man of his house at an early age, after the death of his
father, James, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son had to grow up a little faster than I hoped,'' his
mother, Dorothy Perry, said. ``He's been the man of the house since
his father died, and his sister and I will definitely miss him when
he goes off to school. But for now, we're just proud of the young
man he has become.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a leader on the THS football team. He will attend Fork
Union Military Academy near Richmond, Va., in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In his farewell address, Perry said, ``As we depart from this
educational institution, we move forward to a fast-paced society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prepare for the future, and that future is now. We
must find an antidote to help us cope and make us better as people.
Today the antidote I present to you is faith. Faith is a precious
commodity to us. We won't realize how important it is right now,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he was proud to be a part of the class that had Vice
President Al Gore as its commencement speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were first told about changing the date so he could
come, we didn't really like it,'' Perry said. ``I think it brought
national attention to our area. I'm glad he came.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior class President Casey Collins, who introduced Gore, said
she practiced her introduction for hours Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of family here today, which made me very happy,''
Collins said. ``I was happy about shaking his hand. Not very many
people can say they did that, except for the Class of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Graduate Trevin Parker won't soon forget the first few days of
June. He became not only a high-school graduate, but also a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really sure how I feel right now,'' Parker said.
``I've kind of changed my plans for the immediate future. I'm going
to take the first semester off and spend time with my child. But I
do plan to attend Fayetteville State second semester. It's been an
exciting week.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Monteiro Brito, a Brazilian exchange student, participated
in the graduation exercises, although she only attended the school
for 10 months. She was hosted by Cindy Smith and her family and
says she will return to Brazil next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoyed today,'' Brito said. ``I've enjoyed being in
Tarboro, because all of the people have treated me so well. I've
made some true friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brito returns home, she plans to attend college, and says
she will study to be a food engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wizikowski, 18, said he will attend Oral Roberts University
in the fall to study computer arts and music. Until then, he said,
``As far as what I'm doing this summer, I will be installing
heating and air-conditioning units.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he and the rest of the class had to be patted down by
the Secret Service, Wizikowski said it was worth it to have Gore as
the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to take our cap and gown off as well as our socks and
shoes,'' Wizikowski said. ``It was wild. We had to empty our
pockets and were patted down. But it was worth it. This is
something we will always remember about the Class of 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Wizikowski and friends had to wait until after the ceremony to
spray each other with canned foam or bounce a beach ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't sneak any of those things in with us,'' Wizikowski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Coker is headed to Georgia for six and half months as
part of her National Guard training.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will remember the Class of 2000,'' Coker said. ``We
were the best.''
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the members of the graduating class had plans
to further their education, while the rest will join the workforce
or military. Approximately $500,000 in scholarships have been
awarded to THS graduates. Four graduates are N.C. Teaching Fellows;
they will get $26,000 toward a college education to be repaid with
four years of teaching in North Carolina public schools.

AN OPEN E-BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will e-books be a hit? No one knows. But as publishers and
computer companies gamble on success, they should abide by the
principle of openness.
</P>
<P>
   The future seems promising. Publishers are cranking out e-books.
Companies sell e-reading software and hardware. Authors love the
idea of reaching new audiences. And e-books can be bought on
bookselling Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, deals cut by Microsoft with Random House and
Simon &AMP; Schuster raised fears about monopolies and limited consumer
access. Want to read the electronic version of Michael Crichton's
book ``Timeline'' for free? You can, but only with Microsoft Reader
software.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this isn't a conspiracy, just a limited- time offer to
create marketing buzz. Hundreds of other e-books are available in
many electronic formats. As officials at Random House and Simon &AMP;
Schuster point out, publishers make money by offering lots of
options _ conventional books, audio books, and different electronic
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Simon &AMP; Schuster does plan to announce the release of a
book that will only be published electronically. This is not an
information blackout, but it is bad news for some _ including the
blind, teenagers whose families can't afford computers, those whose
eyes or temperaments can't tolerate computer text, and others not
on line.
</P>
<P>
   A Simon &AMP; Schuster official says the company needs freedom to
experiment with such releases. It's an argument with some merit, if
the experiment leads to productive discoveries. In general, though,
e-books ought to create possibilities, not limit them. Simple
mercies include loading e-reading devices with textbooks for
students who would otherwise be crushed by the weight of their book
bags. Consumer opportunities might include electronic travel books
that would be easy to access and update. Commuters with hand-held
devices might no longer have to wrestle newspapers into submission
on crowded subway cars.
</P>
<P>
   Part of literacy's great history, e-books have to uphold a
tradition of making human thought infinitely more accessible.

CLINTON'S HANDICAP IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Displaying his fabled empathy, President Clinton acknowledged
Monday to Russia's parliament that many Russians suspect ``America
does not wish you well.'' Clinton assured the legislators this was
a misconception. Calling on his uncanny knack for telling an
audience what it wishes to hear, Clinton said: ``The United States
wants a strong Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   As ever, the president's performance in Moscow was suffused with
an acute feel for the political psychology of his hosts. Russians
across the political spectrum do resent the way Washington seems to
treat their country. An egregious example of the Russian tilt
toward a paranoid view of the United States was the boorish
behavior of Vladimir Zhirinovsky. As Clinton concluded his speech
to the Duma, the nationalist member of parliament screamed at his
colleagues for applauding their guest.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Zhirinovsky said of the remarks he had directed at
Clinton: ``I told him in English: Lift the blockade on Iraq,
withdraw troops from Yugoslavia, and do not intervene in Russian
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, few take Zhirinovsky seriously anymore. Nonetheless,
his ranting may reverberate in the Russian psyche. Criticism of
Russian massacres of civilians in Chechnya is considered
intervention in Russian affairs even by sober officials in the
Kremlin. The NATO bombing of Serbia by US planes is perceived by
many Russians as unwarranted aggression against a sovereign state.
There are even some Russians, like Zhirinovsky, who believe that
the mass murderer Saddam Hussein is an undeserving victim of US
hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton had the right idea when he tried to talk Russians out
of their suspicions. But his mission was foredoomed by the great
burden he brought to Moscow _ a national missile defense scheme
that is not technologically feasible at present and that confirms
Russian fears of an arrogant America willing to plunge Russia back
into a bankrupting nuclear arms race. Washington has enough
disputes with Moscow over Chechnya, money laundering, weapons
proliferation, Caspian oil, and NATO expansion. The mirage of a
national missile defense should not be allowed to cause chronic
enmity.

FCC PUTS CONDITIONS, SEAL OF APPROVAL ON ATT-MEDIAONE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the key federal approval in hand, AT&AMP;T Corp. says it hopes
to complete its acquisition of MediaOne Group &UR;  &LR; by August.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission approved the $58 billion
takeover Monday, but imposed conditions aimed at preventing the
telephone giant from achieving excessive control over the US cable
market.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the FCC approval, within a year AT&AMP;T must unload
either 40 percent of the combined companies' cable subscribers, or
MediaOne's 25.5 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment, or
multibillion-dollar television programming interests including
Liberty Media.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T had no immediate comment on which option it will pursue. In
a conference call with reporters, AT&AMP;T general counsel James
Cicconi indicated the company thinks it could comply with the FCC
by selling fewer than the reported 9.7 million subscribers or
taking a step short of an outright sale of Liberty Media and other
programming companies.
</P>
<P>
   Greater Boston, along with Chicago and San Francisco, is one of
three ``super clusters'' that each have over 1.5 million AT&AMP;T and
MediaOne subscribers where the companies see huge opportunities in
marketing local telephone and Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   With MediaOne, AT&AMP;T would own outright systems serving 16
million cable subscribers nationally, and own interests in systems
serving nearly 17 million more, most of them through MediaOne's
minority stake in Time Warner Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   RoadRunner Internet subscribers may be moved to AT&AMP;T-controlled
Excite(at)Home in the next two years, under a consent decree
reached last month with Justice Department antitrust prosecutors
who reviwed the MediaOne deal.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, MediaOne customers should expect little immediate
change in service offerings, aside from probably new reduced-price
package deals to get telephone service as well as TV and Net
access, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us at AT&AMP;T are delighted by the FCC's decision,''
Cicconi said.
</P>
<P>
   The move also apparently pleased Wall Street, where MediaOne
shares rose $2.3125 to $69.3125 and AT&AMP;T, the nation's third most
widely owned stock, rose $1.125 to $36.25.
</P>
<P>
   As initially announced last year, the deal values MediaOne
shares at $85 each in AT&AMP;T stock and cash. Unless AT&AMP;T stock
returns to levels over $50, where it traded for much of the last
year, the phone giant may have to come up with billions of dollars
more cash for MediaOne owners to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission approval represents a key
leap for AT&AMP;T's bet-the-company gamble on acquiring cable systems
to provide phone service and Net access to millions of US homes
through upgraded cable TV systems.
</P>
<P>
   The MediaOne deal is part of a $120 billion move by AT&AMP;T, which
has also bought cable provide TCI Inc., to move out of the dying
long-distance phone market and compete with companies such as Bell
Atlantic for local phone and Net customers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T would have to unload cable interests to comply with federal
rules forbidding any one company from controlling more than 30
percent of the multichannel TV market, defined to include cable and
satellite-dish systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision strikes the appropriate balance between
promoting competition in local telephone service and protecting
competition in cable and high-speed Internet service,'' FCC
chairman William E. Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three divestiture options offered by the FCC is
especially appealing for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Dumping the interest in Time Warner could remove AT&AMP;T's leverage
in its negotiations to sell local phone service over Time Warner
systems. Selling Liberty Media could lead to a multibillion-dollar
tax bill for capital gains. And unloading 9 million cable
subscribers undercuts AT&AMP;T's goal of becoming a nearly nationwide
alternative to local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Cicconi said the company is ``confident that we can comply''
with the FCC conditions, but repeatedly suggested the company
thinks it can get away with a modified version of one of the FCC
plans. ``I am certainly not ruling out any of the options,''
Cicconi said. ``We've got time to assess them and make (a)
determination.''

J. BAKER SEES BREAKOUT YEAR AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a new e-commerce and catalog strategy partly borrowed from
a recent acquisition, J. Baker Inc. thinks it's finally ready for a
breakout year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the best kept secret in Boston,'' said Alan I.
Weinstein, chief executive of a Canton, Mass. apparel and shoe
retailer with about 650 stores and sales last year of $665.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, J. Baker bought an apparel chain called Repp Ltd. Aside
from 135 stores, Repp also had a catalog and e-commerce operation,
something lacking in J. Baker's biggest clothing chain, Casual Male
Big &AMP; Tall.
</P>
<P>
   By expanding Repp's Georgia call center and fulfillment
warehouse and by making them do double-duty for both the Repp and
Casual Male chains, J. Baker has the potential to swell annual
sales by an additional $100 million to $150 million over the next
three to five years, Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Casual Male sent out its first catalog in March, and a retail
Web site, www.Casualmale.com, just went live, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been disappointed by upbeat forecasts from J.
Baker before. After sustaining big losses in the mid-1990s, the
company has rebounded to modest profitability, though its stock
price has generally languished in the $6 to $7 range.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its history, the name J. Baker has been synonymous
with shoes. But during the mid-90s, the shoe business became
fiercely competitive, and J. Baker suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it had branched out with stores that sell clothing
to big and tall men. Gradually, the sideline eclipsed the mainstay,
and some of the shoe business was sold as J. Baker sought to become
the go-to clothing brand for big men.
</P>
<P>
   With about 400 stores, Casual Male has the muscle to be an
important force in a $5.6 billion US market for big men's clothes,
according to investment bank Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   While other big shots in big clothes include Sears, Roebuck and
Co. and J.C. Penney Co., nearly half the dollars that men spend on
outsized duds are rung up by mom-and-pop stores; those bit players
are vulnerable to having sales taken away by the much bigger J.
Baker, according to a recent Bear Stearns report.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker also operates Work 'n Gear, a chain that sells clothes
nurses and construction workers might wear on the job.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker also runs shoe departments in stores owned by other
retailers such as Bradlees Inc. and Ames Department Stores Inc.
Shoes accounted for 38 percent of J. Baker's sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Like Casual Male, Repp aims at the 15 percent of the US adult
male population that requires outsized clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Though Repp and Casual Male target the same male market, the two
chains segment it by income levels.
</P>
<P>
   Casual Male and Repp represent the better and best parts of a
``good, better, best'' strategy. If Repp sells to large, upscale
men and Casual Male sells to large, middle-income men, then J.
Baker's outlet stores, in the process of being renamed B&AMP;T Factory
Stores, aim at large men of more modest means.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker operates about 50 B&AMP;T stores, and Weinstein thinks that
number can triple.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Repp offered J. Baker an added bonus _ a
blueprint for taking Casual Male into catalogs and onto the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of starting e-commerce and catalog businesses from
scratch, J. Baker could draw on Repp's expertise and infrastructure
to expand Casual Male into new sales channels.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker recently issued first-quarter results. Sales were up 32
percent to $170 million, partly due to the Repp acquisition. Net
income rose 58 percent to $1.5 million.

NEW MATERIAL CAN `PATCH' SEVERED NERVES, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new biomaterial made from self-assembling molecules like so
many ``smart Legos'' could be the best substance yet found on which
to grow nerves for repairing damaged brains, say scientists at MIT
and New York University who discovered it.
</P>
<P>
   The material could be formed into any shape, sown with billions
of nerve cells, and implanted into the brain or spinal cord: then
it would degrade leaving just the new nerves, like a living patch.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said Monday they were surprised to find that
nerve cells, which are ``notoriously fussy,'' attached themselves
to the thin sheet-like material and promptly grew long extensions
that made connections, or synapses, just as they do in the body.
</P>
<P>
   The material is not only friendly to nerves, but appears not to
cause inflammation or rejection when implanted into the body, the
scientists report.
</P>
<P>
   But it could have many other uses, too. ``The reason this
material is so interesting and unique is that we can individually
tailor it to grow virtually every type of cell in the body'' for
tissue engineering, said Shuguang Zhang, associate director of
Center for Biomedical Engineering, at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   He and Todd C. Holmes, a former MIT researcher now at NYU, wrote
about the material in the currrent Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary appearing in the journal Nature, a German
scientist noted that repairing damaged nerves is a longtime goal,
and that while that day is far off, the new biomaterial ``may bring
us closer to that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Langer, an MIT professor and pioneer in the growing field
of tissue engineering, said Monday that the report was
``interesting'' but that its performance in the body needs to be
tested further.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang first synthesized the material, known as EAK16, about 10
years ago, and Holmes then discovered its useful properties, the
researchers said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The material is 99 percent water; the remaining 1 percent is
interlocked molecules called peptides that are the building blocks
of all proteins. A solution of these peptides in water will
assemble themselves if salt is added, said Zhang, calling the
peptides ``smart Legos'' because they contain information that
enables them to link themselves in repeating patterns like the
plastic building toys.
</P>
<P>
   Peptides, it is now known, can assemble themselves into larger
structures like fibers, small tubes, sheets, and particles, and can
be programmed to disintegrate in the future.
</P>
<P>
   After Zhang made the peptide-based material, ``he was shopping
around for other uses for it,'' said Holmes. A few years later,
Holmes discovered that the shape of the molecules fit nicely into
structures nerve cells need to attach themselves. Experiments then
showed that the nerve cells easily attached to the material and, in
a sign that they were ``happy'' in that situation, grew their long
spidery projections called axons that link up with other nerves to
form circuits. ``If nerve cells are not happy, they may grow'' but
won't make the vital connections, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say this is the best material'' yet found to support
growing nerve cells, Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the material is synthesized, it can be tinkered with to
have different properties, said Holmes, and because it isn't
extracted from animal tissue, as some scaffolding biomaterials are,
there's no chance of spreading harmful viruses by implanting it
into the body.
</P>
<P>
   Other biomaterials are made of plastic, which has the downside
that when it degrades it may be toxic to the recipient, Holmes
added.
</P>
<P>
   The research was supported in part by Hercules Inc., a
Wilmington, Del., chemical manufacturer of pulp and paper, resins,
fibers, and other products.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is one hurdle that will have to be overcome if EAK16 is
to widely used, the researchers said. At present, it costs $1
million a liter, or $2.2 million per pound.

   NEW YORK _ Despite the return of Rosie O'Donnell as host, the
competition may have been just too much for the Tony Awards on
Sunday night. The show was up against ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the season premiere of ``Sex and the City,'' and the
Lakers-Trail Blazers game.
</P>
<P>
   The fast national rating for the two-hour CBS broadcast _
meaning an early tally _ was the lowest ever: 6.1, down from 7.0
last year. The ratings have been steadily declining, from 8.4 in
1998 and 9.6 in 1997. Each rating point represents just over a
million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, within the theater industry the consensus was that
this year's ceremony was a great improvement over last year's. In
addition to what many considered a misguided effort to honor
straight plays with a montage of lines, last year's show at the
last minute dropped the number from one of the nominated musicals,
``It Ain't Nothin' but the Blues,'' because of time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   This year the show ended early, all the musical numbers were
performed, and most people in the industry agreed that the
broadcast made Broadway look exciting.
</P>
<P>
   There were those who came away disappointed, like the creators
of ``The Wild Party,'' which won no awards and, with flagging
ticket sales, was in need of a boost. George C. Wolfe, the
director, co-writer and co-producer of the show, said that there
were no plans yet to close it.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows shut out of the awards included Susan Stroman's
revival of ``Music Man,'' Matthew Warchus' acclaimed production of
Sam Shepard's ``True West,'' and ``Dirty Blonde,'' Claudia Shear's
homage to Mae West.  &QL;

 &HT;    Gore calls Tarboro graduates 'heroes'
 &HT;    By Gene Metrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARBORO _ Vice President Al Gore on Monday told the members of
the Tarboro High School Class of 2000 they were ``American heroes''
for the part they played in helping their community recover from
the 1999 flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world witnessed your bravery, your dignity, your
generosity and your grace under pressure,'' Gore said during his
12-minute commencement address. ``After what you've been through,
with what you have already overcome, there's nothing in this world
that you cannot do.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a crowd of more than 2,400 people who filled the
stands at the school's football stadium, Gore told the 136
graduating seniors to always remember the ``quiet acts of courage
and simple acts of caring'' that united the community as it
struggled to overcome the devastation wrought by Hurricane Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rising tide of floodwater was followed by a mighty wave of
compassion and concern for others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recounted how some of the students had been dropped off by
helicopters ``on this very field'' after losing practically all of
their possessions to the flood. With the high school gym turned
into an emergency shelter for homeless flood victims, many of the
students - some left homeless themselves _ chipped in to help
distribute food, clothing, drinking water and other supplies and
support to the victims, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are an outstanding success by any measure,'' he said.
``You have faced tremendous obstacles and you have endured. We're
all proud of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president urged the students to view the graduation
ceremony as a ``vantage point'' from which to chart their future
successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The values that we stand for when we are at our best are the
same values you embodied and lived when you were helping others in
a time of challenge and need,'' he said. ``You have changed your
town for the better - now, you have the same power to change
America for the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made no mention of politics or the 2000 presidential
campaign, but said he was ready to go on the record with a
``controversial statement'' about the Lady Vikings basketball
team's final game in the state regional tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the closing seconds of the game against St. Paul's,
Marquetta was fouled,'' he said, referring to Marquetta Dickens'
final shot attempt in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John Edwards and U.S. Rep. Eva Clayton, D-1st
District, attended the ceremony with Gore. Edwards said that Gore's
father, the late Sen. Albert Gore, ``taught his son heroic life
lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a model of what a good life can do, you
need look no further than the vice president of the United States,
Al Gore,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   In closing, Gore encouraged the graduates to continue to find
meaning in their lives in their relationships with other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say exactly where the 21st century will take us, but
I believe with all my heart that it can be the greatest time in all
of history,'' he said. ``I have great faith in you, the Tarboro
Class of 2000.''

OLD ARGUMENTS, OLD CONFRONTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As the power-sharing Northern Ireland Assembly
reconvened Monday for the first time in four months, onlookers
could be forgiven for thinking they had seen it all before.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Big Man, the Rev. Ian Paisley, flailing his arms
in the East Belfast assembly, protesting how disgraceful it was
that Irish republicans refuse to fly the Union Jack over the
government buildings they now control.
</P>
<P>
   With Irish republicans, once sworn to destroy the state and now
part of the establishment, it is a new Northern Ireland, but the
arguments are old. Paisley, a fundamentalist
preacher-turned-politician, came to prominence in the 1960s by
challenging the right of Catholic nationalists to fly the Irish
tricolor anywhere in Northern Ireland. It was treason, he fumed
then.
</P>
<P>
   It's treason now, he fumed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The resumption of sessions in the ornate parliamentary chambers
at Stormont was a culmination of the compromise that saw the Irish
Republican Army vow to allow international inspectors to check its
arms dumps, and the Ulster Unionist Party, which represents most
Protestants, to put aside its demands that the IRA begin disarming
before it would resume a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political wing.
</P>
<P>
   It was a promising return to democracy, but no one should be
under any illusions about the difficulties that lie ahead. The most
obvious is the vow by Paisley and his Democratic Unionists to make
the power-sharing government unworkable by filibustering, having
their two Cabinet ministers resign regularly to disrupt its
workings, and putting forward purposely disruptive motions like the
one Monday that demanded the 108-member assembly expel Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   But dissident Irish republicans are as determined as Paisley to
wreck the assembly in particular and the peace process in general.
They put a bomb on Hammersmith Bridge in London last week and have
vowed to mount an offensive in the British capital.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, meanwhile, the annual marching season peaks, as
Protestant groups demand to march through Catholic neighborhoods
where they are not wanted. The Protestants say they are expressing
their heritage; Catholics see it as bigoted triumphalism dressed up
as parades.
</P>
<P>
   While policing and security matters are still the domain of the
British government, the power-sharing assembly in Belfast will
debate and try to find a compromise on the vexing issue of parades.
And as it did Monday, the assembly will continue to debate and try
to resolve the dispute over symbols, such as flags and the badges
for and name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the 90
percent-Protestant police force that most Catholics want
drastically reformed and which most Protestants want to remain as
is.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists of all stripes are outraged that the Sinn Fein Cabinet
members, Education Minister Martin McGuinness and Health Minister
Bairbre de Brun, refuse to fly the Union Jack over the buildings
that house their offices. In an interview, McGuinness said he would
authorize the flying of the Union Jack beside an Irish tricolor. He
said he is not trying to deny the right of British people to see
their flag, only to secure the same right for Irish people.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley, not surprisingly, was apoplectic at the prospect of
McGuinness, a former IRA chief of staff, unilaterally deciding not
to fly what Paisley called ``the national flag.''
</P>
<P>
   While Paisley ranted, de Brun and first minister David Trimble,
the Ulster Unionist leader, tried to make sure the health budget
wasn't cut.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, seemed almost plaintive when
he spoke to reporters at Stormont Monday, saying, ``All sensible
people will want to see these institutions functioning not just
around the big emotive issues, but on the crucially important
issues which affect people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he quietly tries to mollify rejectionists in his own
camp, Gerry Adams knows better than most that not all of the people
in Northern Ireland are sensible.

THOMSON AGREES TO BUY PRIMARK FOR $1.08 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomson Corp., owner of Boston's Thomson Financial, has agreed
to buy Primark Corp., a Waltham, Mass. provider of financial and
economic data, for $1.08 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Thomson will pay $38 a share for Primark, a 31
percent premium over Friday's close. The Toronto-based publisher
and financial information company, which is in the process of
selling its 130 North American newspapers, will assume $235 million
of Primark's debt as part of the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will bolster Thomson's roster of financial data units
that sell information and software to professional investors. And,
in a move that will affect investors who closely watch Wall Street
analysts' earnings estimates, Thomson's First Call and Primark's
IBES International Inc. _ the two biggest providers of earnings
estimates _ would be combined under one company.
</P>
<P>
   Primark shares rose $8.25 Monday, to $37.25, while some
investors wondered if a rival bidder might surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little low,'' Michael Kupinski, an analyst with
A.G. Edwards in St. Louis said of the purchase price. ``The
question now is, could there be room for a sweetened offer or the
emergence of a competing bidder?''
</P>
<P>
   Primark has been looking for a buyer for more than two years.
Thomson took a look at that time, as did an array of companies,
including McGraw-Hill Cos., which is said to have offered around
$50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Both Thomson and Primark have changed significantly since.
Thomson has been refashioning itself into an ``e-information and
solutions'' company, with a focus on business clients. In addition
to selling its newspapers, Thomson since 1989 has sold its oil and
gas operation and a travel business in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Harrington, the chief executive of Thomson, said,
``We're much further along in our own strategy.'' He said Primark's
international reach, with 55 percent of its business overseas,
would enhance Thomson's business: ``It gives us increased scale and
resources to serve our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Primark, for its part, last month sold its Yankee Group unit, a
Boston high-tech consulting and research firm, for $72.5 million to
Reuters Group, the London news service and information company.
Reuters is a rival of Thomson. Primark had revenue of $495 million
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson Financial employs about 3,000 people at a downtown
campus and focuses on selling information and services to mutual
fund companies and brokerages. Under the deal, Primark would become
part of Thomson Financial. Primark's chief executive, Joseph E.
Kasputys, would become chairman of Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said there would be some overlap in administrative
employees at the companies, which could result in job cuts. For the
most part, he said, ``There's probably not much redundancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomson said the purchase would eat into earnings in 2000 and
2001. Thomson shares dipped $1.80 (Canadian) to $49.20.

<P>
   BISHAN, China _ Like many of his fellow villagers, Zhou Zhihai
leapt at the opportunity to work in the tiny, dank shoe factories
here in the county seat.
</P>
<P>
   Though it meant 10- to 14-hour days swabbing leather with
pungent glue, by working fast he could earn as much as $120 a
month, enabling him to build one of the two-story brick houses that
give this county's overcrowded countryside a facade of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   His widow and their 12-year-old son still live in that new
house, set in their hillside village among gleaming rice paddies.
Last September, Zhou became dizzy and weak from severe anemia,
almost certainly caused by inhaling benzene fumes from the factory
glue, and stopped work briefly. But he was in debt and returned to
shoemaking. In December, at the age of 36, he died of leukemia
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people here work in the shoe factories, get sick,
rest, go back to work, then get sick again,'' said Chen Yiwen, who
runs the rudimentary clinic in Zhou's home village, Santai.
``That's all you can do around here to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   As China applies to join the World Trade Organization,
international concern has been directed at the sometimes unpleasant
or dangerous working conditions in the country's export industries,
especially those owned by foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   But health and safety conditions are generally far worse,
Chinese and foreign experts say, in the many smaller factories and
mines that have sprung up across the country during the economic
reforms of the last two decades, mainly producing goods for the
domestic market. These are run by private owners or cash-hungry
local governments, often under 19th-century safety conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou's story is well known in his village and is far from
unique. But few people have been deterred from seeking similar work
in the thousands of mom-and-pop shoe factories for which Bishan
County, about 25 miles west of Chongqing in the central province of
Sichuan, is known.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers persist, even though most have heard that the
benzene-containing glues still widely used in China can cause
life-threatening illness.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers, thumping their chests to show their strength,
simply assume that they will be spared from the epidemic of blood
disorders afflicting this county, where more than 20,000 workers
produce millions of pairs of shoes each year for sale throughout
China.
</P>
<P>
   Others, already weakened, continue working until they cannot
continue _ and no follow-up studies have been conducted of the
subsequent health of such drop-outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to eat,'' said a 46-year-old man in a workshop in
Bishan. ``I need to survive.'' He has has periods of severe anemia
and described his job as ``slow suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, the man, who was afraid to give his name, continued
gluing soles by himself, working through the lunch break. He was
working extra hours, he said, to make up for his slowed pace. He
said he could not even think of going to the nearby hospital,
because it was too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Though little factories are scattered across the county, the
shoe producers are mainly concentrated in the ``shoe town''
district in Bishan, where hundreds of dingy garage-like workshops
bustle with the cutting and gluing activities of shoe construction.
Most of the workers are younger men and women from outlying
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Stylish-looking shoes that may retail for $4 are created in
these workshops with pre-industrial methods, amid a mess of open
glue pots and leather scraps, the rich glue odor pervading the air.
Often the workers, and sometimes the owner and his family too,
sleep in the room above the workshop, potentially inhaling toxic
fumes through the night. Protective masks are nonexistent, exhaust
fans scarce.
</P>
<P>
   Such appalling conditions have stirred the normally compliant
government-controlled trade union federation to demand stronger
measures from Beijing. Describing the general condition of
small-scale industries, the federation's newspaper, Worker's Daily,
said in a recent article:
</P>
<P>
   ``In some newly established, labor-intensive firms, work
conditions are abominable, workshops are small, low and damp, dust
and noise seriously exceed standards, and toxic and hazardous tasks
are not effectively regulated. After working in these abominable
conditions for a long time, workers' health is utterly
devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical consequences, in Bishan county and elsewhere, have
been magnified by the breakdown of public health-care services for
the poor in the economic reform era, with many of the country's
hospitals simply turning away sick people who cannot pay. And
because so many sick villagers do not even try to visit doctors or
hospitals they cannot afford, no one has good data on the
prevalence of occupational diseases in places like Bishan.
</P>
<P>
   Bishan County's shoe-making boom has enabled many villagers to
earn more than $1,000 a year, several times what farming alone can
bring from the undersized plots each family has. Families say they
need the cash for taxes and school fees, and are using what is left
to replace their old mud houses.
</P>
<P>
   For the villagers, it is a calculated risk: In the isolated
village of Santai, one of scores like it in the county, 600 of
1,800 residents are making shoes, according to local newspaper
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see two or three new cases involving shoe-makers every
day,'' said Dr. Chen Wanhui, one of the internal medicine
specialists at Bishan County Hospital. ``They come in complaining
of dizziness, lethargy and poor appetite and say they find it
difficult to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some need blood transfusions, while some only need medicines
and they gradually get better,'' the doctor said. ``Some have no
money and they just go away.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that recovery from severe anemia, caused by benzene's
damage to the bone marrow, usually takes at least three months and
costs from $350 to $600, mainly for medications, but that returning
to the workshops afterwards is extremely dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chen Yiwen, the medical worker in the village of Santai, said:
``It's just a small minority of workers who get the most serious
form of anemia. You can usually get treated and get better _ if you
have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen said that when Zhou, the leukemia victim, first felt dizzy
and weak last fall, he went to a city hospital for treatment, but
he never gave himself a chance to recover fully.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou had taken out a loan to cover medical costs that approached
$1,000, Chen said, and he still owed money on his house. So after a
few weeks, he returned to work in a shoe factory and within three
months he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   In China's shoe and other domestic industries, worker exposures
to toxic chemicals have often worsened over the last two decades of
economic reform and the rise of private enterprise, according to
Meei-shia Chen, a Taiwanese expert in public health, and Anita
Chan, an Australian sociologist. Their study of the health risks in
Chinese shoe factories appeared in the International Journal of
Health Services last year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their other faults, larger state-run companies were
subject to national rules and standards and usually provided
regular medical checkups for their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extreme danger, the use of benzene-containing
glues has stopped in most developed countries and allowable worker
exposures to the chemical have been drastically reduced. Newer
benzene-free glues that cost about 30 percent more are used in much
of the world and are in theory available in China, usually as
imports from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent visit to Bishan's shoe district showed that
virtually all of the glue sold by supply shops there is
Chinese-made and contains benzene, it was clear on a recent visit.
Several factory owners said they could not afford to pay more, in
part because of the taxes they must pay the local government, and
they also voiced a belief _ disputed by experts _ that substitute
glues do not stick as well.
</P>
<P>
   Local governments, themselves, have emerged as an obstacle to
cleaning up the small factories. Throughout much of China today the
county and township governments, far from imposing worker
protections, are increasingly reliant on local private firms for
revenues, said Dai Jianzhong, a sociologist at the Beijing Academy
of Social Sciences who has studied the shoe and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that no matter how serious the problems with
workers' conditions or pollution, the local governments are willing
to put up with them,'' Dai said. ``The present system makes local
government place the bosses' interests before workers' welfare,''
said Dai, who added that only strong regulation can improve the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary on the potential effect of China's World Trade
Organization entry on small, hazardous industries like these.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, many economists believe, the influx of foreign firms
and products will mean more modern and safer factories. Still, the
recent study by Ms. Chen and Ms. Chan also found persistent
examples of dangerous exposure to benzene and other toxins in
larger export-oriented factories, mainly Taiwanese-run, in the
coastal province of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
   Of foreign firms operating in China now, Dai said, ``the
European and American firms, especially the bigger ones, often play
a model role in worker safety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But among firms from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea,
conditions can be much worse,'' he said. ``For much of Chinese
industry, WTO might even worsen conditions by making markets here
even more competitive. Though I can't imagine how much worse they
could be than they are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhao Jiazhu, 36, a Santai resident who worked in others'
factories before starting his own four-person workshop right in the
village under the label ``Good Luck Comes,'' laughed when asked
about his prospects after China joins the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to have any effect here at all,'' he said.
``The ordinary people are not millionaires and they can't afford
all those imported shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhou Weiqiang, 26, whose factory in the nearby town of Liutang
employs 10 to 20 workers depending on the season, produces shoes
under the label ``Hundred Beauties'' and boasts, ``You can buy my
shoes all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   His entire family has left farming for the shoe-making trade and
they are not seriously worried about the health hazards, for
themselves or their workers, Zhou insisted. ``There's some risk,
but it's not too great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the looming impact of the World Trade Organization, he
said, ``The new competition is going to bring down prices, even for
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not too worried,'' he said. ``I just have to get on
with my business.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Evolution has not always come up with things people consider
wonderful. Note mosquitoes, sickle cell anemia and the killer
instinct. But according to evolutionary theory, there is a reason
for everything that has evolved. However obnoxious it may seem,
somehow it enhances survival.
</P>
<P>
   And so it seems that survival is the likely reason for morning
sickness, survival not just of the unborn child but also of the
pregnant woman who must bear the burden of its prenatal
development. That is the conclusion of two Cornell University
evolutionary biologists after examining the results of nearly
80,000 successful and unsuccessful pregnancies, correlating their
findings with the incidence of morning sickness and the development
during early pregnancy of food aversions and cravings.
</P>
<P>
   MOTHER AND BABY BENEFIT _ Samuel Flaxman, a graduate student,
and Dr. Paul Sherman, a professor of neurobiology and behavior,
report in the current issue of the Quarterly Review of Biology that
nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, which they call NVP, helps to
protect both mother and fetus from exposure to infectious organisms
and toxic chemicals that could result in fetal damage, miscarriage
or even, in primitive societies at least, maternal death.
</P>
<P>
   Morning sickness, these researchers note, is a misnomer. It can
occur at any time of the day (though not at night while a woman is
asleep) and, they insist, it is not a sickness. It is a 100 percent
normal characteristic of early pregnancy that is associated with a
reduced risk of miscarriage and a greater chance that the pregnancy
will have a healthy outcome. All nine studies that have explored
this relationship in about 20,000 pregnancies showed that women who
experienced the condition were significantly less likely to
miscarry.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than morning sickness, NVP should be called ``wellness
insurance,'' Sherman said. Worldwide and in the United States,
two-thirds of pregnant women acquire this free insurance to varying
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that a pregnant woman afflicted with nausea and
vomiting will be unlikely to consume certain foods that may be
damaging to her fetus at a time when its major organ systems are
developing. Organ development takes place during the first three
months of pregnancy, which is when morning sickness is most
prominent. ``There is an obvious _ indeed striking _ correspondence
between the sensitive periods in embryonic organogenesis and the
peak occurrence of NVP,'' the scientists wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At this time, too, the Cornell biologists noted, a pregnant
woman's immune system is naturally suppressed to keep her from
rejecting the fetus as a foreign tissue. But immune suppression
renders her more susceptible to food-borne parasites and
microorganisms and the toxins they produce, so NVP would protect
her, too.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAIN PROBLEM _ While other theorists, like Dr. Margie Profet
of the University of California at Berkeley, have suggested that
morning sickness evolved to protect the embryo and young fetus from
exposure to natural dietary toxins in vegetables, spices and some
fruits that might cause malformations, the Cornell researchers'
exhaustive analysis of all existing evidence gathered since 1940
has indicated that meat, poultry, fish and eggs are far more
important sources of possible pregnancy problems. Until
refrigeration, these foods were most likely to harbor infectious
and toxic organisms that could sicken a pregnant woman, damage her
fetus or cause an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Cornell report found, the meat category leads the
list of food aversions that develop during pregnancy; nonalcoholic
beverages like coffee come second, and vegetables a distant third.
Having completely lost my appetite for meat and coffee during my
own pregnancy, I am inclined to think the Cornell biologists are
right on target. For most women suffering from NVP, bland
carbohydrate foods like bread, cereal and grains have the greatest
appeal, though cravings for fruit and fruit juice, desserts, ice
cream and sometimes unusual foods are commonplace. Studies have
shown that very few pregnant women crave alcohol, which is a cause
of fetal malformations.
</P>
<P>
   In further support of their theory, the Cornell team examined
dietary patterns in seven nonindustrial societies where pregnant
women never or rarely experience morning sickness and compared the
results with 20 similar societies in which NVP occurs. Those
societies without NVP ``were significantly less likely to have meat
as a dietary staple'' and were ``significantly more likely to have
corn as a dietary staple,'' the scientists wrote.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Also intriguing are the different rates of NVP in industrialized
societies that have different dietary habits. The highest frequency
for a single country was in Japan, a nation fond of eating raw
fish, where 84 percent of the pregnant women in one study reported
experiencing nausea and vomiting. Raw fish, a dietary no-no during
pregnancy in this country, can carry parasites that could harm a
fetus in addition to making the pregnant woman quite ill. Likewise,
undercooked meat, popular in many Western countries where NVP
frequencies are high, can carry a parasite called toxoplasma that
causes serious congenital defects.
</P>
<P>
   But even cooked meat that is not spoiled can be a problem,
Sherman said. If the meat sat around unrefrigerated for a while, it
could become contaminated with pathogens like E. coli even though
it looks and smells fine, he explained. His evolution-based
conclusion: ``A pregnant woman's body responds to the smell and
taste of meat because this category of food in general can be
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell biologists do not dispute the role that the hormones
of pregnancy are known to play in touching off morning sickness.
Rather, Sherman said, ``the hormones explain how this happens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking why it happens,'' he said. ``Why do the hormones
cause these particular symptoms of nausea and vomiting and food
aversions? Why not headaches or backaches?'' Their answer is that
nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy is protective; it helps to
guarantee the next generation will be healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Studies suggest that morning sickness has a genetic component.
Women are much more likely to experience it if their mothers or
sisters also had NVP Forms of morning sickness have also been
observed in domestic dogs and captive rhesus monkeys and
chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SHOULD A WOMAN DO? _ Women who do not experience morning
sickness should not fret, Sherman said, if they live in
industrialized countries where the food supply is safe. But neither
should heroic measures be taken to prevent ``normal'' NVP. The best
way to alleviate the problem is to always have some food in one's
stomach. Hence, the common advice to keep crackers on the night
table and to eat several before getting out of bed in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said he saw ``no reason to believe that suppressing the
symptoms of NVP would improve the outcome of a pregnancy'' unless a
woman developed hyperemesis, continual vomiting that occurs in only
half of 1 percent of pregnancies and which requires hospital
treatment. Ordinary morning sickness, he said, ``is a phenomenon
that is adaptive, not pathological. It's not a symptom of a failing
female body. It's a temporary condition that occurs early in
pregnancy when fetal demands are small and would not be a major
drain on a woman's resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also sees no reason to force a pregnant woman to consume
any foods to which she has developed an aversion. In most women,
aversions that start in the first trimester dissipate during the
second along with a waning of NVP.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all pregnant women should be taking daily prenatal
vitamin-mineral supplements, which help compensate for any
nutrients missing while suffering from NVP. Most important in the
first months of pregnancy is folic acid (or folate), which has been
shown to greatly reduce the risk that the baby will suffer a spinal
defect when consumed at a level of 400 micrograms a day. Since
January 1998, flour and grain products (foods that are unlikely to
be on a pregnant woman's list of aversions) have been fortified
with folic acid.

GROUP AGREES ON HOME-WIRING ELECTRONICS STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leading technology companies have taken another step toward the
development of plug-and-play computer networks that would run over
a home's electrical wiring.
</P>
<P>
   The HomePlug Powerline Alliance, a group of more than three
dozen high-tech firms, Monday settled on a framework for an
industry-wide powerline networking standard. The standard will be
based on technology developed by Ocala, Fla.-based Intellon Inc.
The Intellon system will be refined and should be adopted as a
final standard by the fourth quarter of 2000. Retail products using
the standard should be available in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the alliance, which includes chipmaker Intel Corp.
and networking hardware maker Cisco Systems Inc., is the creation
of computers and other electronic devices that will be able to talk
to each other through the same electrical outlets that provide them
with power.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer networks now employ a technology called Ethernet,
which uses special cables that must be connected to every machine
on the network. These wired networks are common in businesses, and
many new homes have such wiring built into them as well. But it's
difficult and costly to install new wiring in millions of existing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   But every home has electrical wiring. Alberto Mantovani,
president of HomePlug, says it makes sense to turn the socket into
a data port. ``You have to be connected,'' said Mantovani. ``Why
not get access to the Internet and the home network through that
connection?''
</P>
<P>
   The products planned by HomePlug will be able to transmit data
over electrical wiring at a rate of 10 million bits per second _
the same speed found on many corporate computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   There are already a number of products that use electrical
wiring to transmit data, but there's been no standard way of doing
it. Any reliable system must be carefully designed to filter out
electronic noise common on electrical networks. For example,
turning on a hair dryer in another part of the house could garble
data on the network unless this noise is filtered out.
</P>
<P>
   HomePlug officials think the Intellon system offers the best
solution to such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mantovani said early HomePlug products will be used not to
deliver Internet access but solely to connect multiple computers
inside the home. A user who wants high-speed Internet access will
still need a cable modem or DSL telephone modem. But later versions
of the HomePlug technology might enable the delivery of high-speed
Internet services directly through the electrical wires.

&HT;     COURT LIMITS GRANDPARENTS' RIGHT TO VISIT GRANDCHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wading into the complexities of modern American
families, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that parents generally
have the right to decide whom their children may visit, including
the time spent with grandparents and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the court struck down a Washington state
judge's order under a law that allowed ``any person'' _ a
non-relative as well as a grandparent _ to seek visitation rights
with children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington's breathtakingly broad statute effectively permits
a court to disregard and overturn any decision by a fit custodial
parent concerning visitation based solely on the judge's
determination of the child's best interest,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote in the court's main opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ruling did not strike down the Washington statute,
it could threaten visitation orders previously won under the law by
grandparents in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated decision yielded six opinions from the
nine-member court, but no one opinion attracted a majority of five.
</P>
<P>
   Although giving a slight boost to parental rights, the ruling
stopped well short of answering all questions that state courts
face daily in visitation battles over children. In particular, the
high court did not give parents absolute veto power over who gets
to visit their children. Nor did it give grandparents nationwide
any special status in visitation cases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Monday's decision said nothing to directly endanger
grandparent-visitation laws in the other 49 states.
</P>
<P>
   Such laws are most frequently invoked when parents divorce or
die. Some state statutes require proof of a close relationship
between children and grandparents before visits can be ordered.
Still others insist that courts consider the effect of such visits
on parent-child relationships.
</P>
<P>
   All states require that judges must determine, before they
permit visits between children and their grandparents, whether such
visits are in the children's best interests.The American
Association of Retired Persons (AARP) praised the court for not
striking down the state law, saying that ``grandparents play an
important role'' in the lives of their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The National Women's Law Center, a Washington-based legal
watchdog organization, called the decision a ``victory'' for
parents. ``States cannot simply substitute their judgments for a
parent's, simply because a state judge believes a `better' decision
could be made,'' said Joan Entmacher, the law center's vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington state dispute arose from Gary and Jenifer
Troxel's efforts to see their two granddaughters, now 10 and 8,
over the objections of the girls' mother. The mother, Tommie
Granville, had not married the girls' father, the Troxels' son
Brad. The girls were regular visitors at the elder Troxels' home
while their son was alive.
</P>
<P>
   After Brad Troxel's suicide in 1993, Granville married Kelly
Wynn, who adopted the girls. She sought to limit the girls' visits
with the Troxels to one day a month so her new blended family,
which includes six other children, could bond, she said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1993, the dispute had moved into the courts, with
the Troxels arguing that the bond between them and their
grandchildren was a positive experience for children that should be
legally protected.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge ruled in 1995 that the Troxels could have one
visit a month, from Saturday afternoon through Sunday afternoon,
plus one week during the summer and four hours on each
granddaughter's birthday. But in 1997, a state appeals court
reversed that decision. Then, in December 1998, in a resounding
victory for Tommie Wynn, the Washington Supreme Court voted 5-4 to
invalidate the state's visitation statute, saying it violated
parents' constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, while declining to strike down the law, the U.S.
Supreme Court partially affirmed the state high court decision by
ruling that the trial judge had violated the parent's Fourteenth
Amendment right to due process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visitation order (by the trial court) was an
unconstitutional infringement on Granville's fundamental right to
make decisions concerning the care, custody and control of her two
daughters,'' O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas wrote concurring
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   In his concurrence, Thomas said he agreed with O'Connor ``that
this court's recognition of a fundamental right of parents to
direct the upbringing of their children resolves this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter said the state law ``sweeps too broadly in allowing
anyone at any time to request visitation rights'' and therefore
gives state courts ``too much discretion in every case.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M.
Kennedy each wrote dissenting opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said that the Washington statute ``merely gives an
individual _ with whom a child may have an established relationship
_ the procedural right to ask the state to act as arbiter, through
the entirely well-known best-interests standard, between the
parent's protected interests and the child's.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty million Americans are grandparents, including six of the
court's members: O'Connor, Rehnquist, Stevens, Scalia, Kennedy and
Ginsburg. Thomas was raised by his grandparents. The Granville case
was one of the most closely watched of the term and prompted
friend-of-the-court briefs from numerous organizations and more
than a dozen states.
</P>
<P>
   Among the groups monitoring the case were gay and lesbian
organizations, which argued that ``de facto'' parents who are not
biologically related to the children they are raising should be
given deference in visitation cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay parents sometimes must defend themselves from legal
challenges by meddling third parties who disapprove of the parents'
sexual orientation, while non-biological parents can be shut out of
their children's lives entirely,'' said Ruth E. Harlow, deputy
legal director for Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New
York City-based gay-rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Among the groups weighing in for the grandparents were the AARP
and the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released in January by AARP found about one in nine
American grandparents above the age of 50 helps care for at least
one grandchild. The survey showed that 8 percent provide day care
regularly and 3 percent actually rear a grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Of the grandparents who don't live with their grandchildren or
provide day care, 44 percent see them once a week.

INDONESIA   AND IMF REJECT MEASURES TO PROP UP CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In a move that seems likely to snuff out
Indonesia's latest flirtation with currency controls, the new
managing director of the International Monetary Fund declared
Monday that closing off Indonesia's capital markets would hinder
the nation's fragile economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's chief, Horst Kohler, emerged from a breakfast meeting
with President Abdurrahman Wahid and briskly dispelled speculation
that the IMF would agree to an Indonesian effort to defend its
faltering currency, the rupiah, by placing controls on the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and I fully agreed that the introduction of
capital controls would be counterproductive,'' said Kohler, who was
making his first visit to Jakarta as IMF director. ``He feels that
it would be the wrong decision, and I agree, because such a
decision would deter foreign investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, a senior economic adviser to President Wahid,
Sofyan Wanandi, said: ``It's over. It's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Indonesian officials said they were considering some
type of controls to stabilize the rupiah, which has dropped 18
percent in value since the beginning of the year because of fears
of renewed political unrest. Indonesia considered setting a fixed
rate for the rupiah in early 1998, after a far more serious slide,
but backed off under intense pressure from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy has crept back from the abyss of 1998, it
still depends on billions of dollars in loans from the fund to bail
out debt-ridden banks and corporations. Last week, the IMF approved
a $372 million loan that had been delayed because officials at the
fund were unhappy with the fitful pace of economic restructuring
under President Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler made it clear Monday that Indonesia's future lay in
strictly adhering to the IMF's program. He urged the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Authority to accelerate the sale of assets of
insolvent banks and companies. Failure to do so, he said, ``would
lead to a deterioration in the asset values.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler's predecessor, Michel Camdessus, aroused resentment in
1998 when he stood watching with arms folded, as Indonesia's
longtime president, Suharto, reluctantly signed a loan agreement
with the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kohler did not mince words Monday, he took pains not to
sound imperious. ``We are here to help and support, not to lecture
and impose,'' he said. ``But of course we offer frank advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's markets responded quickly to Kohler. The rupiah,
which had been rallying in recent days on speculation that it might
be stabilized, slipped to a rate of 8,460 to the United States
dollar from 8,400. But the stock market welcomed the news, jumping
2.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Capital controls have gained some credibility in Asia in the
last two years, since Malaysia imposed controls on its currency and
embarked on a powerful recovery. Analysts here said that officials
were focusing less on a fixed exchange rate than on measures to
keep rupiah in the country, like requiring exporters to repatriate
and convert their foreign-exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia is not Malaysia, which has disciplined officials
to police the flow of currencies in and out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't work here,'' said Umar Juoro, a former adviser to
Wahid's immediate predecessor, B.J. Habibie. ``We don't have the
capacity to do it. All it would do is to discourage foreign capital
from coming back to Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the rupiah has rattled officials because they
remember that Suharto was ultimately swept out of power by violent
unrest ignited by a weak currency. But some analysts said the
impact of a weaker rupiah would not be as great this time because
it hurts companies with debt denominated in dollars. And most of
those companies are already bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the weak rupiah has bolstered Indonesian exports, which
jumped 29 percent in April compared with April 1999. For Indonesia
to achieve Wahid's personal goal of 5 percent-plus economic growth
this year, it will need continued strength in exports.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drawback of controls may be political, according to
James W. Castle, an American consultant. Since Indonesia fell into
crisis, the rupiah has been a reliable barometer of public
confidence in the government. The recent decline was precipitated
by Mr. Wahid's decision to dismiss two of his most respected
cabinet ministers and replace them with people regarded as cronies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lesson to the government that there is a price to
pay,'' Mr. Castle said. ``The danger is that it would lose that
feedback mechanism.''

 &HT;    Controversial judge vies for Alabama Supreme Court
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alabama judge Roy Moore is riding the wave of his ``hang ten''
notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   After his 1992 appointment as Etowah County Circuit Judge in
northern Alabama, Moore surveyed his long, narrow Court Room No. 2.
His bench stood three steps off the ground in the left corner of
the room. Except for the portrait of a former judge, the white
acoustic wall tiles were bare.
</P>
<P>
   As Moore explained, ``I wanted something to hang on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Baptist construction worker picked a redwood tablet
of the Ten Commandments he had carved more than a decade earlier.
He raised the ire of the American Civil Liberties Union, among
others, and was sued.
</P>
<P>
   From the resulting legal battles, the 53-year-old former
Australian ranch hand constructed a formidable soapbox among
Alabama's social conservatives and cultivated a nationwide hero
status among like-minded Christian activists.
</P>
<P>
   The name recognition comes in handy during today's Republican
primary. Moore faces three opponents in the race for chief justice
of the Alabama Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the battle over the homemade plaque in
Gadsden, more than half the respondents in a February poll had
heard of Moore _ an astounding number for a judicial race. That has
translated into other surveys predicting Moore will land in a
runoff against state Supreme Court Associate Justice Harold See.
</P>
<P>
   The winner faces Democratic civil appeals court Judge Sharon
Yates in November's general elections. Yates has no primary
opposition. Republican Perry Hooper Sr., 74, is retiring as chief
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Johnson, who heads polling for the Alabama Education
Association, says his survey Thursday night of 228 registered
voters who said they'll vote today in the Republican primary shows
Moore winning 33 percent of the vote compared to 28 percent for
See, the favorite of business leaders. The small sample size
generates a margin of error of 6.5 percent, though other larger
polls reveal similar results.
</P>
<P>
   In an April poll, Moore led See 40 percent to 14 percent. See's
aggressive television advertising has helped him cut the gap. In
one ad, See talks about his faith and how he defended Moore's right
to hang the Ten Commandments _ though he doesn't mention his
opponent by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want to alienate religious voters in this
state,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The undecided bloc of voters is nearly one-quarter of the
respondents. Johnson predicts Moore could win between 40 percent
and 45 percent of today's anticipated small turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments are an issue to fewer than one of every
five voters, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the broader issue is that the voters do not know the
candidates,'' he said. ``That means they're looking for cues how to
vote. Just the fact that they've heard the name of a judge
contributes to his name recognition... If it's a legislator or
president or a governor, you develop issues. Judicial races are for
the most part devoid of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the ACLU challenged Moore's Ten Commandments
display, Moore ignored a state judge's order to remove the tablet
and stop opening his court session with a prayer. Gov. Fob James,
an evangelical Christian activist in his own right, threatened to
protect Moore's display by calling in the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Moore is out of town nearly every weekend preaching about the
Ten Commandments, telling the faithful that school shootings would
diminish with more prayer. He decries judges whom he says deny the
religious underpinnings of the country's government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken something away from us that is the most valuable
thing our forefathers held dear _ the freedom to worship God
publicly and privately in the manner we choose,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar crusades by James helped cost the Republican governor
re-election in 1998 and deepened a backwoods notion of the state
that caused business leaders to cringe. Just like James' primary
race two years ago against business-favored Winton Blount, Moore's
contest illustrates the tug of war for the Alabama GOP between
fiscal and social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Moore is cut from the same philosophical cloth
as James, who once said the Bill of Rights didn't pertain to
Alabama. The former governor often invoked Moore's name during
campaign appearances.
</P>
<P>
   That's why two powerful commerce groups _ the Business Council
of Alabama and the Alabama Farmers Federation _ have endorsed See.
The groups have helped See raise $1.1 million in campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our support is for Judge See and not against any of the other
candidates,'' said Bill O'Connor, president of the Business
Council, tantamount to a state chamber of commerce. ``All we ask
for is impartiality. That's all anybody wants at any station of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Business groups helped convince See to give up his associate
justice seat on the court to run for chief justice. In a state
where business has battled for tort reform, See has developed a
track record for trimming big jury verdicts during his four years
on the state Supreme Court, said University of Alabama political
science professor William Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   But now business leaders face the risk of losing the 5-4
Republican majority on the court if See loses, since Gov. Don
Siegelman likely would appoint a fellow Democrat to fill the
vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows how much business interests value that (chief
justice) seat,'' Stewart said, ``for them to give up (See's) seat
in exchange for a Democratic governor to appoint someone.''

 &HT;    Public awareness crucial for detection of hepatitis C
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When someone is achy and tired but the doctors can't say why,
it's a good idea to get tested for hepatitis C. More than 2.7
million of the nearly 4 million Americans infected with the viral
liver disease don't know they have it, according to estimates by
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
</P>
<P>
   ``In more than 90 percent of the cases, the symptoms are mild or
none at all,'' says Greg Carter, the registered nurse who directs
infection control at Kettering Medical Center. ``Those individuals
that may have chronic fatigue and don't know why should get tested.
So should those who have flulike symptoms that come and go
frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   The most vulnerable are those who received blood transfusions or
dialysis before July 1992, when testing donated blood for the virus
became mandatory. Infected needles are the most common source of
transmission now.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam veterans are at particular risk of the disease because
U.S. military field hospitals performed about 365,000 blood
transfusions there just from 1967 through 1969, according to
Veterans Aimed Toward Awareness. A study last year of 26,000
patients in Department of Veterans Affairs facilities found that
nearly 8 percent had tested positive for hepatitis C, and estimates
for Vietnam vets alone range from 16 percent to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the past two years did federal officials start notifying
people who received suspect blood that they were at risk for
hepatitis C, which can go undetected for 20 to 30 years. It was
believed the disadvantages of a possible health scare outweighed
the advantages of detecting people for whom treatment was
expensive, debilitating and largely ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of antiviral and alpha-interferon drugs now
achieve long-lasting remission in 40 percent of patients, the CDC
says, up from
</P>
<P>
   25 percent in 1997 as therapy has extended from six months to
12. ``They're more effective if they're given early,'' Carter says.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the drug treatment doesn't help, a diagnosis also lets
patients know they should avoid alcohol and medications that might
damage their livers, and be more careful not to spread the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The public health concern was the main reason behind hepatitis C
awareness campaigns in the last few years, Carter says. ``The
numbers we were seeing were frightening, and the hope was that
bringing awareness might help prevent people from spreading the
disease and maybe save somebody's life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Hepatitis C Coalition was created last month in order
to identify the estimated 200,000 Ohioans with the virus and also
to encourage more research into a cure and a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Greater awareness has translated into more diagnoses. The number
in Montgomery County rose from 160 in 1996 to 561 last year. The
public announcement Friday that county courts clerk Craig Zimmers
has hepatitis C will shine further light on the disease, Carter
says. ``That was very brave of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease is still widely confused with its less deadly
cousins. Hepatitis A, transmitted mostly by contaminated food and
water, can cause a short bout of severe fever, nausea and jaundice,
but not chronic liver disease. Hepatitis B, blood-borne like
hepatitis C, is less likely to cause chronic disease and also can
be prevented through vaccination. Hepatitis C leads to chronic
liver disease in 7 out of 10 people it infects.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C's death rate of 5 percent is much lower than the
more prominent blood-borne viral infection, HIV and AIDS, but the
CDC estimates it is four times more prevalent. For both infections,
the CDC says more than half the cases are undiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   Although confirmed U.S. deaths from AIDS fell from 21,000 in
1997 to 10,200 last year, it's an indication of the infections'
relative statuses that the CDC's latest death figures for hepatitis
C show about 10,000 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also want to raise awareness in the legislature and
Congress,'' says Carter, a coalition member. ``They fund the
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are working on enzyme inhibitors that would keep the
virus from reproducing. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is
considering approval of Schering-Plough's more convenient
once-a-week alpha-interferon drug, which was approved in Europe
last week. But aside from the interferon and the antiviral
ribavirin, a liver transplant is the only fall-back option.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly because of hepatitis C, the waiting list for liver donors
has more than tripled in five years to 15,409, adding about 45
names per week since 1998. While the waiting list was only 11
percent higher than the number of liver transplants in 1994, it was
more than three times higher last year.
</P>
<P>
   The recent use of living donors, giving one lobe of their
livers, could shorten the list. Harold and Ian Kaplan of
Beavercreek underwent only the 66th such transplant surgery with an
adult recipient in October. But that number will increase, said Dr.
Douglas Hanto, the Kaplans' University Hospital surgeon in
Cincinnati, ``as we gain experience with it and as long as people
are dying on the waiting list.''

SUPREME COURT AFFIRMS PARENTS' CONTROL IN VISITATION RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Supreme Court, limiting government intrusion into ``the
private realm of the family,'' affirmed Monday the primacy of
parents in decisions about their children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   On a 6-3 vote, the justices struck down as overly broad a
Washington State law that gave anyone, related or unrelated,
extensive rights to seek court-ordered visitation with children
over their parents' objections.
</P>
<P>
   The case was brought by two grandparents who had wanted to spend
more time with their two granddaughters than the girls' mother
would allow. Grandparent-rights groups nevertheless lauded Monday's
ruling because it left narrower visitation statutes in the other 49
states intact, and because they agreed the Washington law was too
sweeping.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the grandparent-rights groups joined advocates for
children and homosexuals in viewing the high-court ruling _ which
included a section explicitly acknowledging the proliferation of
nontraditional parents _ as a milestone in legal recognition of the
changing composition of US families.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children
... there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself
into the private realm of the family to further question the
ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the
rearing of that parent's children,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
wrote in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, along with several of the five justices who wrote
concurring and dissenting opinions, said the states could still
specify conditions under which people other than parents may ask a
judge to order visitation. But the justices notably did not try to
define what relationships those people needed to have with the
children involved, or what constituted a parent.
</P>
<P>
   Legal analysts said those omissions, whether deliberate or not,
underscored the authority of state politicians and judges to take
bold actions such as the precedent-setting Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court ruling last June that granted visitation rights to
the former partner of a lesbian mother.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts said the Supreme Court decision also appeared to
bolster the legal standing of other nontraditional care-givers,
including adoptive parents, foster parents, and grandparents. About
3 percent of America's 60 million grandparents raise grandchildren
and another 8 percent assist in the process, according to the
American Association of Retired Persons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best thing that could have happened to
grandparents,'' said Richard Victor, executive director of the
Grandparents Rights Organization. He added that he was ``relieved''
the court gave the states wide discretion rather than setting any
guidelines, even though its decision provided grandparents with no
special status for seeking visitation.
</P>
<P>
   Ethel Dunn, president of the National Coalition of Grandparents,
said her only concern was that some grandparents would incorrectly
think that their rights had been limited because this had been
widely billed as a pivotal ``grandparents' rights'' case. ``This
affects only the law in Washington, which was far too broad; for
grandparents everywhere else, and for all sorts of nontraditional
families, this is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The case grew out of a complaint from Gary and Jenifer Troxel, a
couple in Anacortes, Wash., whose daughter-in-law limited their
visits with their two grandaughters after their son died. So the
Troxels asked a state court to award them more time, which it did
in 1995: one weekend a month, a week each summer, and four hours on
the girls' birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor pointed out that neither the Troxels nor any court had
accused the mother, Tommie Granville Wynn, of being an unfit
parent. As a result, the justice asserted, it was wrong to impose
on Wynn the burden of proving that seeing the Troxels would not be
in her children's ``best interests'' _ the standard used in most
states to determine visitation rights.
</P>
<P>
   The state-court order in the Troxels' favor was therefore an
unconstitutional infringement on the mother's right to make
decisions regarding the rearing of her children, O'Connor said. She
denounced the ``sweeping breadth'' of the Washington law on which
the Troxels had based their claim, which she said had been an
``application of that broad, unlimited power.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor pointedly wrote that she was making her decision at a
time when the old notion of a nuclear family _ two married parents
living with their biological children _ was quickly being replaced
by a wide variety of situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographic changes of the past century make it difficult
to speak of an average American family,'' O'Connor said. ``The
composition of families varies greatly from household to
household.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor in the majority were Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer,
while Justices David Souter and Clarence Thomas wrote separate
concurring opinions. Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and
Anthony Kennedy each wrote dissenting opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The case had long been perceived as a major test of
grandparents' rights. But the extraordinarily broad language in the
Washington State statute evidently turned it into a barometer of
parental and state responsibilities instead.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of those two often-controversial issues led to
the unusual coalition of the left, right, and center in Monday's
court majority. And it explained the equally uncommon spectrum of
support for the justices' decision, with praise coming from groups
as diverse as the American Civil Liberties Union and the
conservative Institute for Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredibly important ruling ... as much for what it
doesn't say as what it does,'' said Joan Hollinger, director of the
child-advocacy program at the University of California Law School
at Berkeley and author of a friend-of-the-court brief in this case
for the National Association of Counsel for Children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington State law declared open season on parents, and
that couldn't stand. But, by leaving the door open to the states to
do whatever they choose, while explicitly pointing out the changing
nature of American families, this opinion also has far greater
implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Logue, an attorney who also wrote a brief in the case
for the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a gay-rights organization,
echoed Hollinger's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The justices ... basically are letting the states experiment
with how to balance constitutional rights and the reality of
changing families,'' she said. ``They don't presume that there's
just one way to do this, and that's very important for gay and
lesbian families.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REJECTS BIG CHANGES IN ITS BREAKUP PLAN FOR
MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding in detail to Microsoft's criticisms, the
Justice Department Monday rejected any substantive changes in its
plan to break up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's proposed revisions ``would undermine or
frustrate the purpose and effectiveness'' of the remedy proposal,
the government said in a brief filed with the judge in the
long-running antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   After Microsoft filed its proposal last week to water down the
government plan _ while still disputing its very premise _ the
Justice Department and 19 state governments that are partners in
the antitrust suit asked for a chance to respond. As a result,
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson postponed his final ruling, expected
at the end of last week, and scheduled two additional filings,
including the government document issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft now has until Wednesday to respond, and Jackson will
probably rule late this week. He is widely expected to accept the
government's breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman, said the government brief
makes ``only cosmetic changes'' and therefore remains ``vague and
ambiguous as well as excessive and harmful to consumers and the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The government filing Monday notes that Microsoft had asked
Jackson in court on May 24 for an opportunity to comment on ``the
form'' of the government's remedy proposal. But ``many of
Microsoft's comments go beyond merely addressing the proposed
form'' and ``make arguments about the merits that Microsoft has
previously raised and that plaintiffs have addressed in their prior
filings,'' the brief says.
</P>
<P>
   It also notes that Microsoft, in its proposed revisions,
repeatedly tried to reargue the facts of the case, even though
Jackson issued a final ruling on April 3 declaring Microsoft in
wide violation of state and federal antitrust laws. ``Microsoft's
effort to reargue its position should be rejected,'' the brief
says.
</P>
<P>
   The document lists the few Microsoft revisions the government is
willing to accept. Most deal with punctuation or semantics. For
example, Microsoft heatedly objected to the government's
characterization of the breakup plan as a ``reorganization.'' A
Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, said, ``That's like saying, when
a tornado hits a house, it's a spring cleaning.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the government agreed to call the breakup a
``divestiture.'' The other changes are of about the same magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of Microsoft's proposed changes, the government
argues that they ``would create loopholes and permit Microsoft to
continue to engage in anti-competitive practices.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the company had objected to the date when its
intellectual property holdings would be considered allocated to
specific divisions for purposes of any breakup. The government had
set the date at April 27, the day before its remedy proposal was
published, to prevent Microsoft from changing its plans once it
knew the specifics of the government's proposal. Microsoft wanted
to move the date forward. But Monday's brief says: ``Microsoft's
proposal would allow the company to shift assets before the plan of
divestiture is implemented to frustrate the effectiveness of the
final judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the company, in its revision, struck out a provision
requiring Microsoft to inform computer manufacturers _ known as
``original equipment manufacturers,'' or OEMs _ of future plans for
Microsoft products. Monday the government said: ``The proposed
change would allow Microsoft to withhold critical information about
its future plans from certain OEMs in retaliation for their
supporting non-Microsoft products, an OEM concern that was
expressed at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft tried to write the state attorneys general out of the
case during enforcement of the remedy. The government rejected
that.
</P>
<P>
   The government also turned back Microsoft's proposal to delay
preparation of a plan for implementation of the breakup for a year
instead of four months, as the plaintiffs had proposed.
</P>

   ``It is in the public interest that the remedy contemplated by
the final judgment be implemented as soon as possible,'' the
government said, ``and the time periods proposed by plaintiffs are
adequate to perform the specified tasks.''

 &HT;    Dot-com magazines grow with Internet
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dot-com bubble may not be limited to the stock market.
Fortune (June 12) sees a good-sized bubble in the proliferation of
dot-com magazines devoted to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Net magazines have great buzz, are loaded with ads, and seem
indispensable guides to the `new economy,''' says Fortune, which
now devotes a big part of its magazine to the dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   The new genre includes Business 2.0, Fast Company, Upside, The
Industry Standard and Red Herring. They are so full of ads they
choke mailboxes _ 418 pages for Fast Company.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies spent $687 million advertising in these
magazines last year, up 347 percent from 1998. The dot-com
companies like them not so much to reach customers as potential
investors _ venture capitalists, Fortune says.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by this success, several of the magazines, including Red
Herring, The Standard and Upside, indicate they may go public with
a stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   While we're at it, here's a rundown of what's in some of these
Net magazines for June:
</P>
<P>
   _Business 2.0 looks at five companies that it says understand
the Internet's potential, and five that do not.
</P>
<P>
   _Upside looks at the future of Microsoft, which it says is
permeated by ``big company'' thinking in a changing industry.
</P>
<P>
   _Yahoo Internet Life says hotels, airlines and cruise companies
will have to wire up on the Internet ``or pack it in.''
</P>
<P>
   _Fast Company looks behind the scenes at CNBC, which it calls
``a window into a nation obsessed with Wall Street and the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbiased arbitration
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a decade of complaints, investors who feel they
have been cheated by a broker can bring their gripe to an
independent arbitrator, says Barron's (June 5).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big change from the old system where the foxes
guarded the chicken coop: Disputes were decided in arbitration
hearings run by the brokerage industry's self-regulatory bodies,''
Barron's says.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for investors, Barron's says the new system will
cost more to log a complaint because it is not subsidized by the
brokers, as the previous self-regulatory arbitrators were.
</P>
<P>
   In the cards after Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   Flush with (apparent) success against software giant Microsoft,
the Justice Department's next big antitrust campaign will be Visa
and MasterCard, the leading credit card companies, Business Week
(June 12) reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice will try to use its witnesses to tell the story of how
Visa and MasterCard, which jointly control 75 percent of the
business, have worked together to bully competitors and harm the
American public,'' the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   But Visa and MasterCard already are waging a wide-ranging
counterattack. They claim that Justice is simply bailing out a
group of rivals that couldn't win in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Business Week notes that the annual percentage rate
on many credit cards has broken the 30 percent barrier, despite the
low introductory offers.

 &HT;    PSiNet to open Internet hosting center in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PSINet today will anounce opening of a huge Internet hosting
center in Atlanta, part of the Virginia company's plans to dominate
the expected boom in global communications.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, Atlanta with about 50 employees will be one of
more than 20 such hosting centers, including Amsterdam, Los
Angeles, London, New York and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   According to William Schrader, founder, chairman and chief
executive of PSINet, the multibillion dollar expansion is designed
to catch the swelling Internet wave, with more centers being
completed as the demand grows for Net-based communications.
</P>
<P>
   The plain-spoken Schrader thinks it will be a tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts predict that up to 10 percent of the world's
economy will be dependent on the Internet within five years.
Schrader thinks that is too conservative by far. He predicts that
80 percent of the economy will ride on the Internet within four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may either think I am nuts or you won't believe me. But I
don't care what you think, because I am right. I think if you don't
have a good Internet infrastructure you won't have an economy. You
won't be able to buy light bulbs.''
</P>
<P>
   With 88,000 square feet at 40 Perimeter Center East, the new
PSINet center will provide e-commerce services for companies around
the Southeast. Included in that is consulting help for companies
with their Web sites and an offer of high-speed services like the
streaming of video, audio and animation. Customers will be offered
speeds up to 2.4 gigabits per second.
</P>
<P>
   PSINet's biggest competition is WorldCom and its MCI and UUNet
subsidiaries. With revenue of $37 billion and a range of services
that includes local phone service and long-distance, WorldCom has
far more muscle and a longer list of products. By comparison,
PSINet hopes to end the year with revenue coming in at a rate of $2
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom leads in serving the world's biggest companies, at
least those seeking one provider for all their telecommunications
services, Schrader said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are trying to be all things to all people,'' Schrader
said. ``I have said before that WorldCom has an advantage over
PSINet with Fortune 1000 companies that are focused on price.''
</P>
<P>
   PSINet, by contrast, does most of its businesses with smaller
companies, usually of fewer than 2,000 employees and often spending
no more than $5,000 per month on telecommunications. What PSINet
customers do have is presence in more than one place, usually
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can connect those offices, and the better the
technology, the more that can be done with that link.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader says he has what he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused only on the Internet and the surrounds of the
Internet such as Web hosting. We are nothing but Net.''
</P>
<P>
   PSINet, which several years ago sold its consumer access
business to MindSpring Enterprises, owns more than 1 million miles
of high-speed fiber lines, much of it obtained in its 70
acquisitions. But it also has bought and is building the hosting
centers that tie together the network. Having both gives it greater
control over what the customer is using.
</P>
<P>
   His customers ``have a Web and Internet presence and they want
it to work. They don't care what the reason is _ they want it to
work. You can call it control, but I call it customer service. And
if you own your own fiber, you have the lowest cost.''
</P>
<P>
   PSINet has not made a profit yet. Schrader won't say when he
expects one. But he said the major capital investments are already
made and the company is waiting to fill the lines and servers.
Moreover, PSINet has several billion dollars in cash.
</P>
<P>
   That money is a comfort in a time when the stock market frowns
on efforts of high-tech companies to issue stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call it a borderline crisis,'' he said. ``The ability
of smaller and medium companies to raise cash is zero. We have a
lot of cash, and we are hoarding cash. I like cash.''

 &HT;    WorldCom sees Net as `ubiquitous'
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lot riding on the spectacular rise of the Internet and
wireless technology _ like the future of WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi-based telecommunications giant has pegged its
strategy on the belief global transmission of data will make the
Net ``ubiquitous,'' creating an array of new ways to use it, said
John Sidgmore, WorldCom's vice chairman and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, wireless data is really the key to this
puzzle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking during the first day of the Supercomm trade show at the
Georgia World Congress Center, Sidgmore said WorldCom's many
acquisitions _ including the pending purchase of Sprint _ are meant
to build networks that will carry a customer's data from ``end to
end.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged off naysayers who believe WorldCom and other
providers of high-speed lines will soon produce a glut. Yes, there
has been a huge increase in supply of the lines. But consumers and
businesses will fill that bandwidth with things like full-motion
video, Sidgmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that there is no way that Internet bandwidth demand
is going to slow down,'' he said. ``I think demand is going to
speed up. Within the next three to five years, we are going to see
innovation like nothing we've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidgmore showed a series of graphs about the wireless and Net
industries that portrayed factors like revenues, users and market
capitalization. All looked the same _ a long, slow start followed
by a rocketlike ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the reality is dwarfed by potential, he said: About 250
million people in the world use the Internet, including less than
one-third of U.S. families, he said. ``Hardly anyone is really on
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   And wireless is the way to bring the Net everywhere. Sidgmore
held aloft a Net-ready phone from Sprint and joked, ``I paid $130
billion for this phone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for WorldCom, that phone is not quite bought.
Regulators are rumored to be skeptical about the acquisition.
Monday, Sidgmore rejected the report in a British paper that
WorldCom was thinking of spinning off its UUNet subsidiary to win
regulatory approval of the company's pending merger with Sprint.
The deal faces roadblocks both in the United States and Europe.
UUNet, the company's Web management and data transmission business,
could be jettisoned as the price of doing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   UUNet is the main competitor to PSINet, which today announces
opening of an Atlanta-based Web-hosting center.
</P>
<P>
   Supercomm, which is expected to draw up to 50,000, runs through
Thursday. A ticket for most events cost $100.

CHIRAC URGES FRENCH TO SHORTEN PRESIDENTIAL TERM TO FIVE YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ President Jacques Chirac proposed on Monday that
France's presidential term be shortened from seven years to five, a
move that could profoundly change the nature of French politics and
help him in the next elections.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac had long opposed such a change, saying that the country's
42-year-old constitution worked just fine as it is. Only last July,
he called the idea ``a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a televised interview Monday evening, the 67-year-old
president said he believes that cutting the presidential term is
necessary to modernize France's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear it's a long time, '' Chirac said of the seven-year
term. ``Probably too long, in view of the demands of a modern
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate that more than 75 percent of the French
population support such a change. A shorter term has been proposed
by most of the presidential candidates in the last three decades,
but their enthusiasm has always dwindled once they were in office.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, Chirac could gain from the shorter term. He
will turn 70 in 2002, when the next elections are scheduled. If the
presidential term is only five years long, his age may be less of a
factor in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chirac seemed annoyed when interviewers suggested that
to him, saying that if he were concerned about his age as a factor,
he would have acted sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find these reflections curious,'' Chirac said. ``I have
known all along what my age is. If this were the case I would have
acted long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac also refuted interviewers' contentions that he had
``changed his mind'' on the issue. He said that he had always been
in favor of a shorter term but did not want to open the door to
extensive changes to the constitution that was crafted by Charles
de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could now support the measure because he had
concluded that changing the presidential term alone would not
significantly effect the ``institutions'' of the French government.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is vehemently opposed to any other constitutional
changes, such as limiting the number of terms a president can serve
or strengthening the Parliament's powers. Such measures had been
suggested by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, but not
until he was long out of office. He recently brought the issue of a
shorter presidency to the top of the political agenda by proposing
a bill on constitutional reform in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, a Gaullist, said he would use his presidential powers to
stop any measure if amendments were tacked onto the bill during the
approval process in the legislature, which is largely controlled by
France's Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac is likely to face Jospin in the next elections. Some
political analysts believe that Chirac acted Monday in part to keep
his rival, who has often called for a shorter presidential term,
from using the issue against Chirac in 2002
</P>
<P>
   A change in the length of the presidential term could have a
far-reaching impact on French politics. Many hope that putting the
presidency and the legislators on a matching 5-year cycle would
help reduce the awkward periods of ``cohabitation,'' such as the
one France is experiencing now, when the president and the prime
minister belong to different parties.
</P>
<P>
   At least three times in the last 15 years, the French have
elected a president and then a few years later changed course and
elected a majority of legislators from another party. If the
elections were held simultaneously, this would be far less likely
to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The periods of cohabitation are often tense, as the president
tends to lose much of his power and lines of authority between the
two executives are not clearly drawn.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Chirac and Jospin, 62, are extremely popular, with approval
ratings of more than 50 percent. But the constant maneuvering for
political advantage between them is evident at almost every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Even on this reform, both men are jockeying for position.
Quickly responding to Giscard d'Estaing's proposal, Jospin urged
Chirac to move without delay.
</P>
<P>
   If he did not move fast enough, Jospin warned, he would bypass
the president and use Parliament to get the ball rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac took his time answering. Some analysts have said they
expected the president to try to prolong a debate on the proposal
so that an early decision on a shorter term could not be used to
pressure him into resigning early to call for new elections. Chirac
made clear during the interview that he had every intention of
finishing his seven year term and that any changes would apply to
presidents elected in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   He gave no details about when he would take action on his
proposal, which would require approval in Parliament and a
referendum to take effect. Some officials expect it will be debated
in the National Assembly and Senate in the coming weeks. A
referendum could be held as early as October.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ When the Supreme Court allowed a New
York photographer to take a public group shot of 152 naked models
lying in a street this weekend, it reinforced our First Amendment
rights to freedom of expression. It also encouraged a trend toward
nudity, particularly female toplessness. British matrons posed nude
for a best-selling calendar. A female Ohio rugby team took off the

 &HT;    Sanders added to 'Skins talent grab
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Redskins continued to make prime additions to their roster
on Monday, signing former Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders to a
seven-year, $55 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 32, was waived by Dallas in a cost-cutting move only
three days earlier. The eight-time Pro Bowl player received an $8
million signing bonus from the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Since losing to the Buccaneers in the NFC divisional playoffs in
January, the Redskins already had added former Bills defensive end
Bruce Smith, Vikings quarterback Jeff George, Cardinals running
back Adrian Murrell and Lions safety Mark Carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins also had two of the first three picks in April's
draft, which they used to select Penn State linebacker LaVar
Arrington and Alabama offensive tackle Chris Samuels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely the `Who's Who' of the NFL now,'' Redskins
receiver Irving Fryar said. ``We've got a lot of great names who
carry a lot of great talent with them. Yeah, on paper, we're the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, the former Falcon who won Super Bowls with the 49ers
and Cowboys, was cut by Dallas because the team would have owed him
a guaranteed $23.5 million the next two years, including a $10
million roster bonus due prior to this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders arrived in Washington on Saturday night and had dinner
with Redskins owner Daniel Snyder, director of player personnel
Vinny Cerrato and cornerback Darrell Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have the same goal here,'' Sanders said. ``There's a
lot of teams in the NFL who only play because they put a football
on the field. But Washington has prepared to go to the Super Bowl
and that's what I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who has 44 career interceptions, joins a secondary that
includes Green and second-year pro Champ Bailey, a former Georgia
star who was drafted in the first round in 1999. Green, 40, signed
a new five-year contract last week, but will likely lose his
starting job for the first time in 17 years.

SHARE PRICES MIXED AS INVESTORS PAUSE FOR RECENT GAINS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (Eds.: ``Advisors'' in last graf is cq) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Monday, as investors paused
to consider the landscape after last week's big advance.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said they were encouraged by the price action. Monday's
activity stood in stark contrast to the eruptions seen for much of
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in April and May you would get a 150-point to 200-point
rally and give it all back the next day,'' said Ned Collins, head
trader at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned,'' he added, ``it is good that we are
treading water. We had such a big move last week that we need to
consolidate some.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Hewlett-Packard, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
20.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,815.30. But the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63 points, or 0.7 percent, to
1,467.63, attributed in part to declines in General Electric, Cisco
Systems and Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which rose a record 19 percent last
week, rallied during the last hour of trading Monday and closed at
3,821.76, up 8.38 points, or 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks also managed
to eke out a small gain, rising 0.27 points to 513.30.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks jumped last week on reports that showed the economy might
be losing some of its momentum, an indication that efforts by the
Federal Reserve Board to achieve that end might be working.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June, the Fed has raised short-term interest rates
six times to cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   However, the only report of any note this week is the Producer
Price Index for May on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, analysts said stock prices were expected to
remain in a trading range for this week, and possibly a good deal
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay in a trading range is probably the best thing that can
happen to the market,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed
trading at SG Cowen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the people the chance to get into stocks they want to
get into, and to sell others at levels they want,'' he said.
``There is no need to panic one way or the other. That is probably
helpful, because the market needs to be a little calmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was light, but not abnormally so for a Monday in
what Wall Street considers the summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Some 838 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock
Exchange. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.4 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was the Dow's biggest gainer, rising 9], to 120
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and IBM also helped to move the Dow higher.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 9/16, to 66~, after it said it would spend $2
billion to speed adoption of its new Internet-based software.
</P>
<P>
   IBM rose four, to 112, after a Merrill Lynch analyst expressed
optimism about its prospects for the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel slumped 1|, to 132 9/16, as investors took some
profits following last week's big advance. Intel's shares gained 14
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bank stocks, which have rallied strongly in recent weeks on
hopes that an end to interest rate increases by the Fed is near,
retreated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, a S&AMP;P 500 component, lost 2|, to 45[. Bank of
America slid 1}, to 59\. Chase Manhattan lost 1 5/16, to 79]. And
Bank of New York shed 1}, to 46~.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks, which posted very good gains last week,
continued to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech was the biggest winner, rising 19~, to 129, after the
drugmaker won approval from the Food and Drug Administration for
TNKase, a next-generation version of Activase, a clot-busting drug
for heart-attack patients.
</P>
<P>
   Human Genome Sciences rose 7 9/16, to 113{. And PE Corp Celera
jumped 22{, to 91.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting some retrenchment in the biotech sector, and
it didn't happen,'' said Mike Weiner, a managing director at
BancOne Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. ``The follow-through
in those stocks surprised me, and it probably masked some weakness
in the Nasdaq.''

   DOT-COM-CELEBS (San Jose, Calif.) _ For all the talk about the
melding of technology, multimedia and telecommunications, the real
buzz these days is the convergence of Silicon Valley money and the
culture of celebrity. A parade of agents and celebrities have been
making the pilgrimage to the Valley in recent months in the hope of
using their fame to cash in on the dot-com boom. The days of
demanding a paycheck for a product endorsement seem to be over.
Celebrities now expect to be owners. Start-ups, for their part,

 &HT;    Daft: Plaintiffs' demands 'excessive'
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Chairman Doug Daft may have violated a court order by
telling a reporter in Ireland that ``totally excessive money
demands'' are making it more difficult for the company to settle a
racial discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Daft's comments to Paul O'Kane, deputy business editor of The
Sunday Tribune in Dublin, could violate an order prohibiting both
sides from publicly talking about the settlement negotiations,
which began in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeking an equitable and expeditious settlement,'' Daft
told O'Kane in a taped, on-the-record interview last week. ``I
think you've seen enough in some of the other press to indicate
that the settlement is difficult when it just becomes totally
excessive money demands, financial demands. I won't comment on it,
but there has been enough commentary about it.'' Daft's
characterization of plaintiffs' monetary demands as excessive may
have violated an order signed Feb. 8 by U.S. District Judge Richard
Story requiring both sides to participate in confidential
negotiations facilitated by a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ``What occurs during the course of the mediation shall be kept
confidential among the named parties and their counsel and
consulting experts,'' Story wrote in his order.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola spokesman Robert Baskin said the company doesn't
believe Daft violated the order.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his interview with an Irish newspaper reporter in Dublin,
Mr. Daft did not comment on the mediation process, nor was he
seeking to communicate with prospective class members,'' Baskin
said, referring to plaintiffs' efforts to expand the case into a
class-action suit against the company. ``There is absolutely no
violation of any court order.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri said he was ``astonished''
after learning of Daft's comments Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of whether Mr. Daft violated the court's order or
inaccurately characterized the proceedings, we will not comment on
the substance of his statements,'' Mehri said. ``From the get-go in
this case, we have sought to achieve the twin goals of creating
systemic changes in the company's practices and making fair amends
for the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri would not comment on whether the plaintiffs would seek any
legal remedy in the wake of Daft's remark. Legal experts said it is
possible for the plaintiffs to seek sanctions against the company.
</P>
<P>
   On several previous occasions recently, including at the
company's annual shareholders meeting in April, Daft said he could
not comment on the ongoing negotiations because of the court order.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview with O'Kane, Daft did not specifically mention
the monetary demand he thought was excessive. But he referred to
former Coke manager Larry Jones, who has said $200 million would be
an appropriate settlement for four plaintiffs and a prospective
class of 2,000 current and former black employees in the United
States. Jones, who is not a plaintiff in the case, has been
organizing a boycott against the company to try to pressure it to
settle the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, Larry Jones sort of put a number on the table the
other day, which I thought was wrong to do,'' Daft told O'Kane.
``But he's not involved in the settlement of the case. He's outside
it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Daft is not supposed to talk about negotiations, he is
allowed to talk about the allegations in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Daft described the suit as a ``a very
unfortunate issue. I wish it was behind us. Nothing like this is
good. It takes away energy from myself in terms of focus from other
parts of the business. But it has to be settled, and we're trying
to settle and have been for several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft said the diversity concerns raised by the lawsuit probably
stem from employees with individual issues unrelated to race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably just related to bad supervisors,'' Daft said.
Later in the interview he added: ``I would say that 99.9 percent of
people know in their heart and in their mind that there is no
discrimination in the Coca-Cola Co. We're enormously diverse
anyway. We have 215 nationalities that work in our organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations in the suit, which
contends that it has systematically discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the monetary issues that may be affecting the
settlement talks, another key issue concerns whether the
plaintiffs' attorneys and the company can agree on the types of
diversity policies and practices to establish for the future.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As a nonpolitical observer in 1993, when the Oslo
accords ushered in a new era in relations between the Israelis and
the Palestinians, I thought that many Israelis had made up their
minds about the accords based not on a careful review of their
contents, but on assumptions. On the left were those who seemed to
support any agreement so long as the process moved forward. On the
right, many opposed any territorial compromise with the
Palestinians, regardless of the where, when and how.
</P>
<P>
   But while I counted myself among those who were prepared to
compromise with the Palestinians, I was gravely concerned that the
assumptions underlying the Oslo process were fundamentally flawed
and would not yield the historic reconciliation for which its
proponents hoped.
</P>
<P>
   One problematic assumption concerned compliance. With no direct
mechanism to hold the Palestinians accountable, the results were
predictable. While Israel was transferring real land and releasing
real prisoners, the Palestinians were strenuously avoiding their
obligations, from extraditing terrorists to disarming militants.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the terrorism and violence that ensued did not
cause the Rabin-Peres administration to consider how a flawed
accord might be improved, but only convinced it of the need to move
more quickly toward a final agreement. Instead of holding the
Palestinians to their promises and establishing mutual trust, it
looked only at the goal of peace.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiating the Wye Accord in 1998, the Benjamin Netanyahu
government put reciprocity back on the agenda. It was agreed that
each side would fulfill its commitments before the process went to
the next stage. While I was hoping for other improvements, such as
the linking of territorial concessions to the liberalization of the
Palestinian regime, at least one gaping hole in Oslo had been
filled.
</P>
<P>
   When Ehud Barak came to power, determined to breathe new life
into the peace process, he quickly abandoned the principle of
reciprocity. Now all Palestinian commitments have been forgotten
and the days of good will gestures to the Palestinians for the sake
of an improved climate of negotiation have returned.
</P>
<P>
   The wrongheadedness of this approach was proved last month; on
the same day the prime minister was marshaling a vote in the
Knesset to transfer areas on the outskirts of Jerusalem's Old City
to the Palestinians, violence engulfed the territories. It is
encouraging that Barak, a man I believe is firmly committed to
Israel's security, has now decided to postpone this transfer and
that even members of Israel's far left are voicing concerns over
the bloated Palestinian police force and the stockpiling of illegal
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But I fear that as quiet returns, the allure of peace will again
affect the otherwise sound judgment of much of the current
government. Israel must return to the principle of reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
   In making painful compromises, we must demand the same in
return. Giving the Palestinians Abu Dis, an area only a few meters
from Jerusalem's old city, on a silver platter will not help us
achieve that goal. If Barak really intends to reach a final
agreement resolving the thorniest issues, then why is he willing to
transfer Abu Dis without demanding a concession in return? If, as
he has stated, he is giving it as a down payment, one wonders how
the full bill can be paid while preserving the undivided capital of
which he has so repeatedly spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if the Palestinian Authority can get a toehold into
the eastern part of Jerusalem without extraditing a terrorist or
changing a textbook, why should it ever agree to the painful
compromises that are the only way to bring real reconciliation?
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians will not easily embrace compromise; nor is more
violence unlikely. But if the Jewish people are not prepared to
hold their ground in the city that for 2,000 years kept the dream
of Jewish sovereignty alive, I shudder to think of where we are
willing to draw the line.

<P>
   Al Gore. George Bush. Two candidates. Four syllables. That's the
choice. Coincidence? Uh-uh. Those four syllables speak volumes. Not
about them. About us. About what's happened. What's happened to our
politics. What's happened to our attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Once it took more than four guttural grunts to list America's
choices. In 1900, Americans chose among William Jennings Bryan,
William McKinley and Eugene Victor Debs. The names rolled slowly
off the tongue, lingered for a moment in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days when we wrote lengthy epistles to each
other, not e-mails spattered with acronyms. It was a more
reflective time, a time when we had the patience to pause and
listen to the name of a multisyllabic officeseeker. And so it was
through most of the century: indeed, a high point was reached in
1952, when Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson _ a
10-syllable battle, even without middle initials. (Eisenhower also
holds the distinction of having the most unusual last name of any
president, thus proving that if you win a world war, you need hold
neither previous political office nor an easily accessible name).
</P>
<P>
   By the century's close, the inexorable erosion of the American
attention span had slammed full force into our political campaigns.
The half-hour speeches had long since been replaced by the
30-second commercial. The network news had cut the average sound
bites of the major candidates from about 50 seconds in 1968 to
barely nine in 1988. (Had Franklin Roosevelt been running that
year, his most famous utterance would have been reported: ``The
only thing we have to fear is fuhhhh ...'') It was only a matter of
time before the candidates themselves would be judged, however
subconsciously, on how quickly the voters could absorb their names.
</P>
<P>
   Once Michael Dukakis crashed and burned in '88 _ ``I don't even
know how to say his name!'' one of George Bush's country-western
singer supporters had declared that year _ the die was cast. In
1992, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole and Ross Perot combined had a shorter
syllable count than Adlai and Ike. In 1996, with Perot shunted to
the sidelines, Clinton and Dole produced a grand total of five.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is even more dramatic when we fold in the running
mates. In 1844, Henry Clay could choose a running mate so
syllabically endowed that their campaign song became a classic:
``Hurray! Hurray! The country is a-rising! Hurray! Hurray! For Clay
and Freylinghausen!'' And in that landmark year of 1952, Stevenson
had no qualms about running with Estes Kefauver.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, what have we been offered in recent tickets? In
1992, Clinton-Gore defeated Bush-Quayle. Four years ago,
Clinton-Gore beat Dole-Kemp. And this year, some of the likeliest
possibilities sound more like a series of Cro-Magnon grunts than a
ticket: Bush-Ridge; Gore-Graham; Bush-Dole. (Memo to Pataki and
Lieberman: Don't hold your breath).
</P>
<P>
   The next step? Since it's widely believed that politics is
mostly show business, let future candidates take their clue from
that universe: single-name candidates. In fact, short-single-name
candidates. We're not talking Coolio or Madonna. We're not even
talking Donahue or Oprah. We're talking Cher. We're talking Prince.

MODERATE BAPTISTS REBEL AGAINST CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ A deep division within the nation's
largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptist Convention,
has developed to the point that a significant moderate minority has
been creating a separate existence from the denomination's
increasingly conservative leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctant to accept the conservatives' insistence that the Bible
be interpreted literally and that women submit to their husbands
and be barred from serving as pastors, the moderates have set up
seminaries and a religious publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   They have also sent out their own missionaries and created
separate associations of congregations, like the Cooperative
Baptist Fellowship, which by itself counts 1,800 churches as
contributors to its budget.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is First Baptist Church, which covers a city block
here and whose members, over the last century, have donated
considerable time and money to the convention's causes, said its
pastor, the Rev. David Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Hughes likens the relationship between church
and denomination to a marriage gone sour. The two are like a couple
that ``still live under one roof, but they have very little to do
with each other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the Rev. Paige
Patterson, acknowledged that moderates had ``formed a denomination
within the denomination.'' Patterson said he would not be surprised
if 1,500 or more moderate congregations were to leave the
convention in the coming years out of the more than 40,000 total
congregations that belong.
</P>
<P>
   But they would quickly be replaced, he said, adding that the
denomination started 1,479 new churches in 1999 and that its
increasingly conservative stance had been attracting established
congregations as new members, like the Thomas Road Baptist Church
in Lynchburg, Va., where the Rev. Jerry Falwell is pastor. ``We're
gaining, not losing,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' he added, ``is anytime you take a stand and
define yourself very clearly _ and in this case, returning to the
faith of our fathers _ there are people who want to be part of that
and join you. And there are people who don't want to part of it,
and are going to use their chute and rip cord.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without the moderates' participation, the convention
remains formidable. It operates six seminaries, fields more than
6,000 missionaries and runs one of the world's largest church
literature publishing houses. When Southern Baptist leaders speak,
politicians and the news media take notice.
</P>
<P>
   Academic authorities are reluctant to call the rift among
Southern Baptists a formal split because no clean break has yet
taken place, and many moderates still regard themselves as members
of the convention. But the differences are serious and
long-lasting, and many on both sides have suggested they could lead
to the creation of a separate denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Should that happen, the Southern Baptists would be finally
confirmed in a staunchly conservative identity.
</P>
<P>
   What the rift also shows is how difficult it can be, at a time
when many Protestant church members' loyalties to denominations
have weakened, to hold together big church bodies amid divisive
issues.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is particularly acute among Southern Baptists
because of how their convention works. Its member churches across
the country are autonomous, owning their own property and hiring
their own pastors, but collaborating for missionary purposes,
sending men and women around the world to try to convert people to
faith in Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   The formula has been so successful that the denomination long
ago spilled outside its home region, the Southeast, and is nearly
twice the size of the next-largest Protestant body, the United
Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Leonard, a church historian who is dean of Wake Forest
Divinity School, an institution recently established by moderates
in Winston-Salem, said the convention was undergoing a
fragmentation, particularly since the appearance of rival Baptist
organizations in Texas and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the challenge, Leonard said, arises from a growing
tendency among younger Protestants to think of themselves as
nondenominational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't emphasize enough that among this generation of college
students and seminary students, conservative and liberal, their
sense of denominational identity is much smaller than previous
generations,'' he said, meaning that they think of themselves as
Christians, rather than specifically as Baptists or Methodists or
Presbyterians.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy T. Ammerman, a sociologist of religion at Hartford
Seminary in Connecticut, said she saw ``an increasing diversity''
within Southern Baptist ranks as different groups found homes
inside ``alternative organizations,'' like the Cooperative Baptist
Fellowship and a smaller group, the Alliance of Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of such sentiments can be found among members in a
congregation like First Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, affiliated
with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. Phyllis Lile-King, 35, a
civil rights lawyer, simply calls herself ``an authentic Baptist,''
and says she and others she knows are past feeling the need to
actively oppose the conservatives' rule.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara R. Blackburn, 38, a university professor, said that
whenever she moved, she sought out congregations affiliated with
the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, like First Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist leaders have been taking increasingly
conservative positions for years. But in May, a committee of
leaders proposed revising the denomination's core statement of
beliefs at the annual meeting, on June 12 in Orlando, Fla. The
revisions, if adopted at the meeting, would call on Christians to
oppose abortion, homosexuality and pornography.
</P>
<P>
   One clause, among the most controversial, would also firmly
state that the Bible does not allow women to be pastors, a largely
symbolic move in a denomination where few congregations have hired
women for that office. ``While both men and women are gifted for
service in the church,'' the proposed revision states, ``the office
of pastor is limited to men as qualified by Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   One does not have to search far in North Carolina to find
Baptist women who concur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I subscribe to that,'' said Cheri Jimenez, 31, a former
communications director for the conservative organization Concerned
Women for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very controversial and there is enormous complexity to
this issue,'' said Jimenez, a Raleigh resident who helps to run a
Christian ministry to women. ``But I just have to stand on
Scripture and the authority of that, even though that is not
popular at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Eckerd, 33, a physical therapist in Winston-Salem, agreed.
Eckerd said she saw no Scriptural ban on a woman being a political
or business leader. ``If that's where God's directing her, sure,''
she said. ``But I think within the church, within spiritual
leadership, it needs to be a man.''

<P>
   Southern Baptists became a separate denomination in 1845, when
Baptists nationwide split along North-South lines over slavery.
Today, Baptists in the United States are divided among several
denominations, with Southern Baptists the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century and a half, Southern Baptist churches
coalesced and flourished in their region, developing a religious
way of life as all-encompassing as anything in American
Protestantism. Church members could attend services three times a
week, belong to church organizations as children, adolescents and
adults, study Baptist Sunday School material and choose among
colleges and seminaries affiliated with the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total system that connected people to the
denomination from birth to death,'' said Leonard, the Wake Forest
dean.
</P>
<P>
   The denomination thrived, through Reconstruction, the Scopes
trial and the Depression, he said, supported by its members'
loyalty and the atmosphere of a distinct Southern culture.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural support began to crumble in 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the breakup of the Old South _ the civil rights
movement, the immigration of Yankees in and Southerners out,'' said
Ammerman, the sociologist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, a group whose leaders included Patterson, the current
president, succeeded in electing one of their own as the
denomination's president, gaining an office whose powers included
appointing trustees to oversee the Southern Baptist seminaries,
missionary agencies and other boards. The conservatives have
preached that the standard of Baptist belief is that the Bible is
``inerrant'' _ literally true in all matters _ and have said that
those who serve the denomination ought to subscribe to that.
</P>
<P>
   After unsuccessfully trying for a decade to wrest control of the
presidency away from conservatives at the annual convention, the
moderates began founding their own seminaries and ministerial
programs in the 1990s. One is the Baptist Studies Program at
Candler School of Theology at Emory University in Atlanta, whose
graduates include the Rev. Stacey Simpson, 28.
</P>
<P>
   Baptized in a Southern Baptist congregation, Simpson attended
Furman University in Greenville, S.C., when that institution took
steps to distance itself from South Carolina's Baptist
organization, dominated by conservatives. At Candler, she was
ordained in a liberal-leaning congregation that was eventually
expelled from the Baptists' Georgia organization.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson serves as pastor of Fellowship Baptist Church, a
five-year-old congregation in Edison, Ga., affiliated with the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call myself a Baptist,'' she said, ``and I kind of have to
add a bunch of clarifiers after that, when people ask.''

PUTIN USES ROME VISIT TO PROMOTE RUSSIAN ARMS CONTROL ALTERNATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Leaving President Clinton behind in Moscow, Vladimir
Putin went to Rome on Monday to sell Europe _ and the Vatican _ on
a Russian alternative to the U.S. missile defense proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day trip, Putin's first visit to the West since he
elected to the Russian presidency in March, was timed to follow his
somewhat tense discussions with Clinton in Moscow about altering
the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. And it was choreographed to put
Putin's heightened sense of Russian power on display.
</P>
<P>
   He left for Rome one hour before his American guest flew to
Ukraine, kept Pope John Paul II waiting 20 minutes and used his
first meeting with Italian officials as an opportunity to use
Europe as a wedge in Russia's uneasy arms control negotiations with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, which was to include meetings with business and energy
industry leaders in Milan on Tuesday, is also an effort to attract
European investment in Russia's economy. Italy is Russia's leading
trade partner in Europe after Germany. Putin, a somber former KGB
officer rarely given to public displays of exuberance, tried to
disarm his Mediterranean hosts by saying he came to Rome first,
``because we love Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's first public remarks in the West, made after a
two-hour meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, were
aimed at swaying international opinion on arms control, and in
particular exploiting European fears that the United States is
embarked on a risky, self-interested course to refashion the ABM
treaty to create a missile defense system aimed at protecting the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia proposed working with Europe and NATO to create an
anti-rocket defense system for Europe,'' Putin told reporters after
meeting with Amato. ``On one hand, it would avoid all the problems
linked to the balance of force. On the other, it would permit in an
absolute manner a 100 percent guarantee of the security of every
European country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian proposal, which Putin made public in an interview
with the ``NBC Nightly News'' last week, on the eve of Clinton's
arrival in Moscow, seems to offer the United States and Europe a
joint missile defense program using short- and medium-range
missiles to destroy rockets on their way up, instead of
intercepting warheads on their way down. Putin's proposal resembles
what advocates in the United States call a ``boost phase defense.''
This could in theory ward off attacks from so-called ``rogue''
states, but would be of little use against the Russian nuclear
force.
</P>
<P>
   That would make it more acceptable to the Russian military,
which fears a solely American missile force could be used to gain a
strategic advantage. But the U.S. military believes the Russian
approach cannot work, and wants to amend the ABM treaty to build a
battle-management radar in Alaska and put 100 interceptors there to
protect the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, Putin emphasized the advantages of his plan to
Europe's defense, seeking to exploit European fears that American
efforts to rewrite the ABM treaty could destabilize relations with
Russia and leave Europe unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that many here in Europe and in the world and the
United States are worried about whether the 1972 accord would be
kept,'' Putin said, referring to the treaty. ``We share the point
of departure of this discussion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders have warned of the dangers of any unilateral
change in the treaty. Italy, current chairman of the Council of
Europe, has often argued that Russia cannot be left out of any
effort to limit the missile threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing fundamentally new in what Putin proposed,
but it seemed newly tailored to meet European needs,'' one Italian
diplomat said. ``Europeans are preoccupied with any decoupling of
their own security, on one hand, and any unilateral change in
international agreements that could lead to a weakening of
security.'' He added: ``But fear of unilateral actions works both
ways _ vis-a-vis Russia as well as the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin went to the Vatican for his first encounter with John Paul
II. Arriving 20 minutes late, Putin was greeted warmly by the
Polish pope, who told his visitor in Italian, ``I am very happy to
receive you at the Vatican at the beginning of your presidential
mandate.'' Putin replied, ``I was the one who made the decision,
coming here is for me very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, Putin
spent most of the 30-minute meeting describing his vision of how
Russia should be integrated into Western Europe and his views of
how the Vatican could help the process. Calling Putin's proposal a
``very ambitious approach,'' Navarro-Valls said that the pope
``mainly listened, then gave some remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who turned 80 in May, has long yearned to visit
Russia. But the Russian Patriarch, Aleksy II, has never agreed to a
meeting with the pope, citing grievances like Roman Catholic
proselytizing and its support of Eastern rite Catholic Churches in
Ukraine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Putin did not directly renew a longstanding invitation, which
Vatican officials noted is still active. But John Paul II listened
attentively to Putin and refrained, at least publicly, from raising
issues like Chechnya that could have embarrassed the president,
suggesting that the Vatican has some optimism for the future.

COMMENTARY: COMMIES AND DEMMIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the smoke has cleared from the debate over whether to
grant China permanent normal trade with the United States and
membership in the World Trade Organization, it's time for some wild
and irresponsible predictions. I'd like to start the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   My prediction is that in the wake of the China vote two parties
in the world will never be the same again: the Communist Party in
China and the Democratic Party in America.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at each. For years Deng Xiaoping, the architect of
China's shift to a free market, described China's economic system
as capitalism with socialist characteristics, or was it socialism
with capitalist characteristics? I could never keep it straight _
and neither could they. But it no longer matters, because China is
now committed to capitalism with WTO characteristics. And that is
going to be a huge challenge. If the Chinese Communist Party
doesn't adapt, either it will implode or China will explode.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the problem: By joining the WTO, China is basically
agreeing to replace its current mixed economy _ part free market,
part state controlled _ which is run by the arbitrary decisions of
the Communist Party, with an increasingly free-market economy that
will abide by international rules, on trade, tariffs and
investments, set by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   This means the Chinese Communist Party is going to have to back
off and shape up or ship out. You can't have a flourishing free
enterprise system with party hacks interfering with businesses and
distorting prices; you can't have WTO-style foreign investment
without moving toward an independent judiciary that is free of
arbitrary party meddling and is capable of fairly enforcing
contracts; and you can't live up to WTO norms without government
agencies ready to enforce WTO rules, not Communist Party whims. All
that means a different Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideal situation would be if the Communist Party would
serve as the bridge and tutor for China's move toward a
free-market, rule-of-law-based system,'' argued the Stanford
University China scholar Michael Oksenberg. ``If that doesn't
happen voluntarily, I see three other possibilities: One is that
there will be some catalytic event, like a downturn in the economy,
that will force the party to adapt, or face losing power and
legitimacy. Second, there will be a split in the party leadership,
between those who want to move forward and those who refuse. And
third, there could be a mass movement from below. The longer the
Chinese Communist Party puts off the first two, the more likely
becomes the last scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the United States, the China vote was not really a vote
about China. It was a vote about how Americans feel about
globalization. And it revealed a deeply fractured Democratic Party.
The unions were opposed and advocated building walls; the
new-economy types, led by President Clinton, favored further
globalization; and a large group of old Democrats advocated some
middle ground, but had no leader or program to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are becoming the party of resentment and fear, and that is
not who we were and that is not who we want to be,'' said Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, about the number of Democrats who voted
against normal trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the Democratic Party, if it is to remain
united, is to articulate a new progressivism that addresses the
worries of working Americans about globalization _ without
resorting to trade barriers. There is obviously a strong feeling
among the party's rank and file that Clinton's
``progressivism-lite'' is insufficient. Which is why a lot of
Democrats are now groping for a new combination of tax policy,
labor policy and social policy that could form a modern
progressivism. (It would help if the unions got their heads out of
the sand. Imagine if all the money and energy they wasted lobbying
against China were applied to health or education funding?)
</P>
<P>
   Without articulating a new progressivism, the Democrats will
either become indistinguishable from Republicans, especially under
George W. Bush, or, if the unions have their way, the Democrats
will become just kinder, gentler Buchananites.
</P>
<P>
   So in the wake of the China vote the key question is: Can the
Chinese Communists become a real democratic party and can the real
Democratic Party become a true progressive party? Nobody gets to
stay the same.

THOMSON AGREES TO BUY PRIMARK FOR $842 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Thomson Corp., which is selling most of its
newspapers to focus on the electronic distribution of legal and
financial information, agreed Monday to buy the Primark Corp. for
$842 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson will pay $38 a share for Primark, a rival provider of
financial data based in Waltham, Mass., a 31 percent premium to
Primark's share price of $29 on Friday. Thomson will also assume
$235 million in debt. Shares of Primark rose $8.25, to $37.25,
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Thomson fell 1.80 Canadian
dollars, to 49.20, on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Thomson has spent more than $2 billion to buy
database publishers. Its largest division is legal and regulatory,
which includes West Group and its Westlaw online research service,
followed by Thomson Financial. Two other divisions provide research
for professionals in the scientific and health care fields and
education.
</P>
<P>
   Like Thomson, Primark has been focusing on electronic services
and just completed the sale of a subsidiary, Yankee Research Group,
to Reuters Group PLC for $72.2 million in cash. The company said
proceeds would be used to reduce debt and expand in electronic
services.
</P>
<P>
   With the most recent deal, Thomson will add Primark's IBES
International Inc. unit, which compiles analysts' forecasts, to its
First Call/Thomson Financial unit, which does similar work. Thomson
Financial's other services are used by securities dealers and
institutional investors for research, trading and settling
transactions. It owns Securities Data, the Electronic Settlements
Group and American Banker. The combined Thomson Financial and
Primark, which will also bolster Thomson's presence in Europe, will
have about $2 billion a year in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kasputys, the chairman and chief executive of Primark,
will become chairman of Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The boards of both companies have approved the acquisition,
which is conditional on at least 51 percent of Primark's shares
being tendered. Thomson said the purchase, which is expected to
close in the second half of the year, would weaken its earnings per
share this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Although Thomson had its beginning in newspapers and radio
stations in Canada in the 1930s and continues to publish newspapers
and specialized periodicals, its business in electronic databases
and related services contributed half of its $5.8 billion in
revenue last year. The company's chairman, Kenneth Thomson, said
recently that electronic data sales should reach 80 percent of the
company's total revenue within five years, and half of that could
be Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   A chain of 130 newspapers in Canada and the United States, with
combined annual revenue of $800 million, has been for sale since
February, and could be sold before the end of the year. Analysts
think the newspapers could sell for as much as $2.5 billion.
Thomson is keeping its flagship Toronto paper, The Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
   The market has become cluttered, however, because in late April
Conrad Black's Hollinger Inc. of Toronto put a for-sale sign on all
but the biggest of its 77 daily newspapers and 302 other
publications in Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While Thomson's head office is in Toronto, its executive offices
are in Stamford, Conn., and four-fifths of its revenue comes from
doing business is in the United States. &QL;

MURDER AND ASSAULT CHARGES ARE DROPPED AGAINST LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Murder and assault charges against Ray Lewis, the Baltimore
Ravens' star linebacker, were dropped in an Atlanta courtroom
Monday after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of
obstructing justice and agreed to testify against two
co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who had faced the possibility of life in prison if
convicted of murder, received one year of probation. He cannot
drink alcohol or use drugs for one year under the terms of his
probation, which falls under the Georgia first-offender act.
</P>
<P>
   He is scheduled to testify Tuesday and could be back with the
Baltimore Ravens in their minicamp next week.
</P>
<P>
   Art Modell, the Ravens' owner, said Lewis would probably have a
news conference Friday at the Ravens' complex near Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the National Football League said Lewis would not
be suspended but could be fined.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 25, and two friends, Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting,
were charged with murder, felony murder and aggravated assault in
the stabbings of Richard Lollar and Jacinth Baker in the early
hours of Jan. 31 on a street outside of an Atlanta nightclub. The
killings occurred a few hours after the Super Bowl XXXIV game at
the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had alleged that Lewis, Oakley and Sweeting killed
the men in a street brawl outside of the nightclub and then jumped
into a stretch limousine that Lewis had rented from Baltimore.
Duane Fassett, the limousine driver, was expected to testify that
he saw all three defendants fighting and that Oakley and Sweeting
admitted stabbing the men.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Sparks, who was riding in the limousine, had said she saw
another passenger dump a white hotel laundry bag into a garbage
bin. Prosecutors say the bag contained Lewis' white suit and
alleged it had blood on it. But the suit was never found and
prosecutor's witnesses changed their testimony from their original
statements. None of them could place Lewis at the scene with a
knife in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The police and friends testified that Lewis tried to cover up
his role in the deaths, having told the co-defendants to ``Keep
your mouth shut,'' and that he gave incomplete statements to the
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fully acknowledges his responsibility for those acts,'' Ed
Garland, another attorney for Lewis, told Judge Alice Bonner.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard, while acknowledging
disappointment in many witnesses whose testimony differed from
earlier statements, said he did not regret prosecuting Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trial is an instrument to reach the truth, and I think that
in many respects it has been shielded,'' Howard said. ``We are
continuing to try to bring the truth forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my nearly 40 years of ownership, I have had previous
incidents involving our players but this one was especially brutal
because of the nature of the crime,'' said Modell, the Ravens'
owner. ``It has been brutal for all involved but especially for the
family and friends of the people slain. I would not have testified
at Ray's bond hearing if I didn't think that Ray was innocent of
the serious charges. He is a good guy and a great football player
and we welcome him back with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL has its heroes on the field every week and we owe a
responsibility to the fans in deed and in conduct. I intend to have
a long talk with Ray about that. And I hope this has a sobering
effect on all of our players throughout the league and especially
on Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The serious charges were dropped and he was entirely cleared
of those charges,'' said an NFL spokesman, Joe Browne. ``We don't
know at this time if there will be a fine that would fall under the
conduct detrimental to the league policy because we are going to
review the case once his involvement has concluded, including him
testifying on Tuesday. We are going to continue to work as hard as
we can to see that National Football League players will not be
involved in these tough and tragic situations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good day for Ray,'' said one of his defense attorneys,
Don Samuel. ``In effect, the district attorney is saying that Ray
Lewis is not guilty of murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting's lawyer, Steven Sadow, said: ``No matter what Ray
Lewis says, the jury will not find Joseph guilty. It may have an
effect on our overall strategy but then again we have to hear what
Ray says.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, a lawyer for Oakley, said: ``The state just
finished proving with several detectives that Lewis is a liar. He
was a liar when he was a defendant. I guess now he's the state's
liar.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wolfe, another attorney for Oakley, suggested there was no
reason for Lewis to plead guilty since prosecutors had a weak case.
</P>
<P>
   Thomasaina Threatt, an aunt of Lollar, one of the victims, told
The Associated Press outside the courtroom Monday: ``You let a
guilty man go free. Where's the justice in that?''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewis case unfolded following the arrest of the former
Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth in January on murder charges
in the shooting of his pregnant girlfriend. Critics have said the
two cases show that NFL players' off-field conduct may be out of
control and at the least requires more serious counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Tagliabue, the NFL commissioner, said: ``If anyone in the
NFL needed a reminder that high-profile professional athletes need
to be extraordinarily careful in their associates and activities,
Ray Lewis' experience provides that reminder.''

EEOC SAYS A MORGAN STANLEY DIVISION DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Photo NYT10 is being sent to NYT photo clients.

 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal agency determined Monday that Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. discriminated against women working in
one of its divisions, opening the door for lawsuits, and possibly a
class action, against the firm.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first investigations into pay and promotion
practices at a big Wall Street investment bank, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission said it had seen evidence of ``a
pattern and practice'' of discrimination against women employed in
Morgan Stanley's institutional stocks division. The case stems from
a complaint filed with the commission in 1998 by Allison K.
Schieffelin, a trader of convertible bonds, who said she repeatedly
had been denied a promotion because of her sex.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said the evidence it had gathered supported
Schieffelin's contention that less-deserving men had been promoted
to the top rank of managing director while she remained a
principal. The commission also said it found that the firm
retaliated against Schieffelin for making her complaints.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Morgan Stanley, Ray O'Rourke, said: ``We
emphatically disagree with the findings of the commission. We do
not practice or condone employment discrimination of any kind. We
think the commission can only have misinterpreted the data that we
gave them because the information shows no pattern of
discrimination whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The determination signals that the commission may sue Morgan
Stanley if the firm does not agree to a settlement. Litigation is a
last resort for the commission: Last year, it received 77,444
complaints and filed just 465 suits against employers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has filed suit against some brokerage firms and
some major corporations, such as the Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and
drugmaker Astra U.S.A. in recent years. But it has not disclosed
any actions against major Wall Street firms in about a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998. Mitsubishi agreed to pay $34 million to hundreds of
women who worked in its auto factory in central Illinois and agreed
to outside monitoring of complaints of harassment and
discrimination. That settlement was easily the biggest of its kind,
supplanting one the commission reached earlier that year with
Astra, in which Astra agreed to pay $10 million, to admit that it
had fostered a hostile work environment for women and to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what sort of settlement the commission would try
to elicit from Morgan Stanley but a monetary settlement could be
substantial because employees in the division are highly paid.
Managing directors at the firm can earn several million dollars a
year and they can hold those jobs for 10 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. consented to the commission's
monitoring of its hiring of women and minorities in its brokerage
business. Recent high-profile sex harassment and discrimination
suits against Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of
Citigroup were filed in federal court without intervention by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the commission demanded that Morgan Stanley turn
over comprehensive records on hiring, pay and promotions in its
institutional stocks division, in which Schieffelin has worked
during her 14-year career. Neither the commission nor O'Rourke
would describe the information the firm turned over.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Outten, a lawyer in Manhattan who represents Schieffelin,
said he had not seen the data but he believed the commission
received profiles of the division's employees going back 15 years.
He said there were other facts that supported Schieffelin's
complaint, including that only three of 50 managing directors in
the division are women and that senior executives of the firm
condoned and participated in firm-sponsored events from which women
were excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffelin is a golfer but was not invited on golf outings with
clients, he said. She also contended in her complaint that the firm
paid for the entertainment of clients and strip clubs. But in its
response to the commission, Morgan Stanley said ``entertainment at
topless bars was at most infrequent.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also based its decision on information supplied
by several other women who have worked at Morgan Stanley. Two women
who worked in the same division as Schieffelin and now work at
other investment banks corroborated her contentions in sworn
statements, Outten said. He would not identify those women.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffelin filed her complaint with the commission after she
was passed over for promotion to managing director in 1997. Since
then, she has been passed over twice more, Outten said. He said her
year-end bonus for 1999 was substantial but ``we believe that her
bonus could have and should have been higher'' and ``was adversely
affected by the fact that she's a woman and she filed this
charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Outten said going public with her complaint has had a harsh
effect on Schieffelin's relationship with the firm and her
co-workers. She has felt shunned and has been excluded from some
extra-curricular roles, including recruiting prospective employees
and helping develop an online system for marketing new securities,
known as an electronic roadshow.

   Schieffelin, 39, has declined to comment on her case because
Morgan Stanley's lawyers have warned that she could be disciplined
or fired for talking to the press without permission, Outten said.
O'Rourke confirmed that Schieffelin would be violating firm policy
if she talked about her case.

BUSH MAY SCOFF AT POLLS, BUT AIDES CALL THEM RELIABLE PREDICTOR OF
VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You could buy a Texas ranch with a dollar for
every time that Gov. George W. Bush has dismissed polls by saying
that the only meaningful one is on election day. But his aides seem
plenty attuned to the growing number of voter surveys that
anticipate that moment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they invited reporters to the campaign's headquarters
here and, with charts, graphs and a multicolored map of the
electoral college, they made the case that Bush's lead over Vice
President Al Gore in most polls over the past several months is no
fluke. To the contrary, they said, it is a compelling verdict on
the Texas governor's sturdy appeal.
</P>
<P>
   What about the two national polls released over the last week
that showed Gore only a point behind? Possible anomalies, they
responded, crying out for context and statistical confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Or the analogy of 1988, when the challenger, Michael S. Dukakis,
saw a late spring and early summer advantage over the sitting vice
president, George H.W. Bush, collapse and come to naught? A poor
indicator, for any number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One senior adviser drew reporters' attention to a simple,
overarching reality: Bush, from the time that polls began pitting
him against Gore, has frequently hit or surpassed 50 percent of
voters' support, while Gore has not. In the two recent polls in
which the candidates were neck-and-neck, Gore's support was below
45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about that,'' the adviser said. ``There are 182 polls.
He is the vice president of the United States, with name ID well
into the 90s, an incumbent administration of peace and prosperity,
job approval ratings in the 50s and 60s, and this guy can get
himself to 49 percent one time, and to 46-plus five times, whereas
the guy on the other side can get himself to 50 percent 117
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its value as an engrossing reading and rearranging of
political tea leaves, the briefing by Bush's advisers _ the second
of its kind in less than two months _ suggested an investment in
portraying Gore as a persistently unappealing loser whose
retoolings have failed to reinvigorate his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This explains why they're going through their latest
reinvention,'' the adviser said, citing the Gore campaign's
abandonment of attack mode. ``They fundamentally gave it their best
shot, and it didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said he could
not, off the top of his head, even confirm or dispute the Bush
campaign's figures and interpretations, because the vice president
``does not waste his time and resources by analyzing polls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a sure sign of a campaign that's starting to get
very, very nervous when they have to resort to pointing to polls
that support their candidacy,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   He nonetheless argued that polls now as opposed to five or six
months ago made a case for Gore coming on strong and showed that
Gore had eaten into Bush's once-whopping lead by 15 or more
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   And another Gore adviser subsequently called and said that
Dukakis was 12 points ahead at this point in 1988, while Bush was
only 1 point up in the two recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   According to materials handed out Monday by the Bush campaign,
Bush led Gore in 46 of 52 national public polls since early March.
The Bush campaign also used what officials said were the latest
public polls in individual states to draw a map that showed Bush in
a position to garner 266 electoral votes, Gore in line to get 136
and another 136 up for grabs. It takes 270 electoral votes to win.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers repeatedly rejected the model of 1988. And just
last week the candidate himself offered an alternative comparison:
1960, when the vice president, Richard Nixon, was defeated by the
challenger, John F. Kennedy. It was a telling metaphor, implying
that Bush sees himself as the charismatic, fresh alternative to a
perpetually striving, charm-challenged pol.
</P>
<P>
   ``He followed a pretty successful administration,'' Bush said of
Kennedy. ``His message was, `Let's soar higher.' And that's what my
message is going to be, too.''

 &HT;    Lewis to take the stand in Atlanta murder case
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When NFL All-Pro linebacker Ray Lewis takes the stand
today, prosecutors hope they finally have the star witness that has
eluded them in the Buckhead stabbings trial.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview Sunday with Fulton County prosecutors, Lewis
continued to maintain he had nothing to do with the street fight
that left Jacinth Baker, 21, and Richard Lollar, 24, of Decatur,
Ga., dead of stab wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't touch a person,'' Lewis attorney Ed Garland
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is now expected to testify against his former
co-defendants Joseph Sweeting, 34, of Miami, and Reginald Oakley,
31, of Baltimore, after prosecutors dropped murder charges against
the 25-year-old football star Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also implicated Carlos Stafford, a passenger in his
limousine the night of the killings. Lewis told prosecutors he saw
Stafford kicking a victim and that Stafford told him later that he
had hit Baker with a champagne bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford's feet ``may have inadvertently hit one of the people
fighting,'' his lawyer, Dwight Thomas, said. ``It was not
intentional. He was acting as a peacemaker. He surely didn't hit
anyone with a bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard said he is considering charges
against another individual, whom he declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped statement, Lewis said he saw Oakley and Sweeting
punching the victims in the body. Prosecutors contend the attackers
hid knives in their fists.
</P>
<P>
   While Lewis said he did not see anyone with a knife during the
fight, he told prosecutors Sweeting had a knife minutes afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he saw a knife in Sweeting's hand when he asked what
had happened. Sweeting said that every time he got hit, he hit
back, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis attorney Don Samuel said the testimony should support a
self-defense argument, noting Lewis said his group was confronted
by six men after leaving a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis corroborated accounts of Oakley being hit over the head
with a champagne bottle and said he saw Sweeting attacked by two
larger men, Samuel said. Former DeKalb District Attorney Bob Wilson
said the impact of Lewis' testimony remains to be seen. ``What you
have to remember is that the jurors will be listening to a guy who
a couple of weeks ago the D.A. said was part of the homicide,'' he
said. ``But now the prosecution will be saying he's not.''

HILARY CLINTON, IN U.N. SPEECH, PLEDGES COMMITMENT TO WOMEN'S
RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Hillary Rodham Clinton took time off from state
politics on Monday to come back to feminism and the United Nations,
where her audience has always been friendly, to deliver a spirited
speech on women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, was not the main event. She spoke at one of many
meetings on the margins of a weeklong special General Assembly
session to assess the progress of women worldwide, five years after
a groundbreaking conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   She is not part of the American delegation, as she was then. But
the difference was lost on her audience of women from every
continent, who greeted her with warmth and enthusiasm. They sang,
clapped and grasped for her hand as they stormed the podium _ a
display that no other speaker is likely to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 women, and some men, from more than 180
countries are in New York for the session and dozens of related
events.
</P>
<P>
   Gita Sen, a development expert from India, said that Clinton
struck a responsive cord because of her unambiguous commitment to
women's rights everywhere, a message many people gathered here say
they want to hear more often from Americans, who seem to many to
have withdrawn from the organization and the world in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to making this journey together,'' Clinton
told a cheering audience invited by Unifem, the U.N. development
program for women.
</P>
<P>
   Her pledge came on a day when a group of independent
organizations issued a call for help to forestall efforts they say
the Vatican and some conservative Islamic and Catholic countries
are making to reverse gains achieved five years ago at the Fourth
International Conference on Women. At that meeting, a watershed
event that brought grass-roots women's groups and governments
together to form networks that continue to operate, most of the
world's nations pledged to promote women's rights in areas as
diverse as education, family planning and sexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said that Clinton had laid out the administration's position
forcefully. ``It was Hillary saying, do not erode the gains of
Beijing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management in
Bangalore and the leader of an organization for women from
developing nations, said in an interview that this conference _
like the one in Beijing _ was in danger of sinking into arid debate
over definitions and intentions. This meeting is intended to look
for ways to move ahead, not to reopen debate on the issues, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Women no longer want to debate the meaning of ``family'' or
parse what ``access to health care'' means in relation to abortion,
said Joana Foster, a Zimbabwean who is a leader of Women in Law and
Development in Africa. ``Africans think debates over nuances and
language are a waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster represents a new generation of women in Africa, Latin
America, the Caribbean and Asia who have worked hard through
international conferences for improvements in women's rights and
are determined to maintain the momentum. She said that
international agreements like the Beijing ``platform for action''
have real effects in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beijing was a catalyst for a whole lot of things,'' she said.
``People are getting into Parliament. Look at somewhere like
Namibia, which now has 44 percent women in the local government
system. In South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Ghana people are now
fighting for affirmative action to become part and parcel of the
constitutions in their countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``FGM was a big thing in Beijing for all of us,'' Foster said,
talking about female genital mutilation, or the ritual cutting
girls' genitals. ``A lot of countries have passed laws against it.
There is that sort of progress going on. For us, we don't want a
document that future governments can use to stop the progress.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing five years ago, nations agreed to end laws that
discriminate against women and to open more education to girls.
They also called for closing income gaps between women and men.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened the formal assembly
session with a speech reminding his audience of goals still to be
met. ``Most countries have yet to legislate in favor of women's
rights to own land,'' he said. ``Violence against women is still
increasing _ both in the home and in the newer types of armed
conflict which target civilian populations.''

 &HT;    Another knock on Texas' death penalty
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Nine Texas death row inmates were condemned to die
after jurors heard testimony that the defendants are more likely to
become repeat offenders because they are Hispanic or black,
according to the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The review of the cases was sparked by a Collin County death
sentence that was overturned Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court
because of race-tinged testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Quijano, a former chief psychologist for the state prison
system, used 24 factors in testifying about whether Victor Hugo
Saldano would commit future acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano's calculation included the fact that blacks and
Hispanics are over-represented in prison as compared to their
proportion of the overall population. The fact that Saldano, 27, is
Hispanic ``was a factor weighing in favor of future
dangerousness,'' Quijano testified.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the death sentence,
ruling there was no ``fundamental error'' in admitting the
race-based testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Supreme Court, at the urging of Texas Attorney
General John Cornyn, ruled Monday that Saldano is entitled to a new
punishment hearing. His guilt is not in question.
</P>
<P>
   The court did not reverse Saldano's conviction in the November
1995 slaying of Paul King during a Collin County robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed with the Supreme Court, Cornyn said the state
could not defend the death sentence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the fact that sufficient proper evidence was submitted
to the jury to justify the finding of Saldano's future
dangerousness, the infusion of race as a factor for the jury to
weigh in making its determination violated his constitutional right
to be sentenced without regard to the color of his skin,'' Cornyn
told the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said his staff has found eight other death row cases in
which similar testimony was offered. A decision on how to proceed
on those cases will be announced this week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn spokesman Mark Heckmann declined to release the names of
the defendants in the other cases. All of the cases are now on
appeal in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Collin County prosecutors opposed Cornyn's effort to seek a new
punishment hearing for Saldano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it was a miniscule part of the punishment evidence
that had no bearing on the punishment verdict and it was harmless
error,'' said Assistant District Attorney John Schomburger.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling comes as Texas' busiest-in-the-nation execution
chamber gets close scrutiny as a result of Gov. George W. Bush's
bid for the presidency. Last week, for the first time since he took
office in 1995, Bush granted a 30-day reprieve in a death row case.
Bush said the condemned man, Ricky Nolen McGinn, was entitled to
more time to pursue DNA testing that could exonerate him in the
rape-slaying of his 12-year-old stepdaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has said he has no doubt about the guilt of any of
the 131 people executed during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Saldano's guilt is not in question. His appeal included only a
challenge of the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Stanley Schneider, representing Saldano on
appeal, said it is rare for the state to ``confess'' error in a
death penalty case before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that are some people who believe race can be an
issue, and that is shocking,'' he said of the psychologist's
testimony. ``Race has no bearing in a criminal trial, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Quijano was unavailable for comment Monday. But his associate,
Roger Saunders, defended the use of the statistical data concerning
Hispanic inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Quijano was not suggesting that by virtue of the fact
alone that the defendant was a Hispanic was the factor in
determining that he was a future danger,'' said Saunders. ``He was
referring to the fact that he fell into a group which is known to
have a higher-than-average rate of arrest and conviction and
incarceration.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quijano's testimony brought international protest. Saldano
is backed by the government of his country, Argentina, as well as
the governments of by Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico,
Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina finds it intrinsically offensive for anyone to
suggest that any Hispanic is more dangerous _ and therefore more
deserving of the death penalty _ simply because he is Hispanic,''
lawyers for Argentina told the Supreme Court.

ON LAST DAY OF CLINTON TRIP, UKRAINE ANNOUNCES CHERNOBYL PLANT WILL
CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for complete rewrite to restructure and fold in earlier
story, CLINTON-EUROPE-UKRAINE, to create a ledeall on Clinton's
day. Pls. note reversed byline.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine used the
occasion of a brief visit by President Clinton on Monday to
announce that the Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the
worst radiation accident in history, would be closed by Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma made the announcement after the two leaders met in the
white-and-gilded splendor of the Mariinsky presidential palace.
``This is a hopeful moment,'' Clinton said. ``It is also a moment
when we remember those who suffered as a result of the accident
there.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the six-hour visit to Ukraine was the last stop on
his last trip to Europe as president.
</P>
<P>
   He began the day in Moscow with an address to both chambers of
the Russian parliament, in which he acknowledged that ``Americans
have to overcome the temptation to think that we have all the
answers.'' He then urged the Russians not to reject Washington's
proposal for a limited national missile defense and to make the
changes needed to achieve full participation in global trade.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier conversations with President Vladimir Putin, Clinton
failed to shake the Kremlin's staunch opposition to Washington's
proposal for a new missile defense plan _ an opposition shared by
China and much of Europe on the ground that it could spur a new
arms race. The United States argues that it would construct
defenses only against the chance of missiles being launched by
``rogue states.''
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine has been under pressure from the United States and
Europe to shut down the last working reactor at the Chernobyl
plant, where a fire in 1986 spewed radiation over vast stretches of
northeastern Europe and caused untold thousands of deaths and
illnesses. Kuchma had previously said he was prepared to shut down
the plant if major industrialized nations would contribute toward
the $1.2 billion Ukraine needs to built two new nuclear power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement Monday, Kuchma said Clinton had agreed to
solicit the Group of Eight industrialized countries for help in
meeting the costs. Clinton also pledged $78 million in new U.S. aid
to help Ukraine repair and strengthen the concrete ``sarcophagus''
over the damaged reactor, $2 million to improve security at other
Ukrainian nuclear plants, and an unspecified amount to assist the
tens of thousands of Ukrainians whose livelihoods come from
Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim of this decision is to reduce nuclear risks in the
world,'' Kuchma said, adding that it ``was not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the many Ukrainians who depend on the plant for
jobs, Ukraine faces an acute energy crisis. The country also needs
to spend an estimated $750 million to reconstruct and stabilize the
hastily built concrete and steel structure that encases the
shattered No. 4 reactor hall and the nearly 200 tons of radioactive
fuel inside; the structure is riddled with leaks and threatening to
crack open.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his talks with Kuchma, Clinton went outdoors to
address tens of thousands of Ukrainians packed into St. Michael's
Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the oppressors are gone,'' he said. ``Stalin is gone.
The Nazis are gone. But you, the people of Ukraine, you are still
here, stronger than ever! You must build a free and prosperous
Ukraine. Do not give up. Keep on fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the speech, administration officials said, was to
give a strong show of support for Ukraine's independence, which
came with the collapse of communism nine years ago after three
centuries of rule by Moscow, but has run up against severe economic
hardship and rampant corruption. Ukraine is the third-largest
recipient of U.S. aid, after Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was also a brilliant photo opportunity that Clinton seized to
the fullest. He stood atop a dais and waved to the crowd against a
backdrop of the gold-domed, Wedgwood-blue Monastery of Saint
Michael and a city square decked with huge Ukrainian and U.S.
flags.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, concluding his two-day visit to Moscow,
Clinton had taken a defensive line in his speech to Parliament.
``Many Russians still suspect that America does not wish you
well,'' he said. ``The United States wants a strong Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The reception to that speech, however, was muted. Some deputies
skipped the session, partly because they were confused about when
it was supposed to start. For many of them, NATO's expansion, the
Western alliance's war with Yugoslavia and, more recently, the
administration's plans to build a limited missile defense have
created the impression that Washington revels in its role as the
world's only superpower and is determined to thwart the emergence
of new powers, including Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's future is very important to others, because it is
among the most important journeys the world will witness in my
lifetime,'' Clinton declared from the lectern.
</P>
<P>
   On security issues, he insisted that his administration's plan
for a limited missile defense was not a drive for military
superiority, and he stressed that he wanted to preserve the
principles of nuclear deterrence. On the economy, Clinton backed
Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization, a bid that still
requires Moscow to change some of its economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia should not be the only major industrialized country
standing outside this global trading system,'' he said. ``We will
support you, but you must know the decision to join the WTO
requires difficult choices that only you can make.''
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, he criticized the Russian prosecution of
the war in Chechnya. ``My question on Chechnya was an honest one,
the question of a friend,'' he said. ``And that is whether any war
can be won that requires large numbers of civilian casualties and
has no political component bringing about a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   More generally, Clinton insisted that he had not come to Moscow
to preach to Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will choose what your interests clearly demand and what
your people democratically embrace.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some reviews of the speech were generally positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clever lecture,'' said Andrei Kokoshin, a legislator
in the Fatherland-All Russia party and a national security adviser
when Boris Yeltsin was president. ``I think Clinton is still
important.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a full hall'' said Nikolai Kharitonov, the leader
of an agrarian faction that generally supports Putin. ``But it was
not a bad speech. Let's hope it is realized constructively.''
</P>
<P>
   Communists and nationalists in parliament were predictably
critical. The Communists held up signs that read ``Clinton Go
Home'' and ``Defense Missile System Is a Threat to the Word.'' They
chanted, ``Soviet Union! Soviet Union!'' over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a legislator who plays the part of an
ardent nationalist but who is seen by many Russians as a kind of
clown on the political fringe, created a row during Clinton's
speech, screaming ``Shame! Shame!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is he teaching how to live?,'' Zhirinovsky yelled. ``It's
profane! We are not going to do what America commands!''
</P>
<P>
   After addressing parliament, Clinton received the warmer welcome
he was more accustomed to during his previous four trips here as
president when he called on Yeltsin at his residence outside
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin had a sense of comradery that was clearly
lacking in the president's businesslike meetings with Putin. And
Clinton seemed to look back on the old meetings wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all just had a nice visit, just like old days,'' Clinton
said. ``He's got a beautiful place.''

   WASHINGTON _ Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush,
said that the Clinton-Putin meeting had been valuable in advancing
relations between the United States and Russia. Bush welcomed
agreements on disposal of nuclear materials and establishment of a
joint center to monitor missile launchings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Fleischer said, the two leaders did not sign
any binding pledges that would limit action by the next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is pleased the agreements they reached do not tie
the hands of President Clinton's successor so that we can have a
defense policy that reflects post-Cold War thinking,'' Fleischer
said. ``Nothing that was done will hinder that process.''

ALBRIGHT IN MIDEAST, TRYING TO PUSH ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived here
Monday for her first visit in six months, seeking to inject a sense
of urgency into the long-running Israeli-Palestinian negotiations
and to lay the foundation for a three-way retreat-style summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment of truth is fast approaching in the pursuit of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace,'' Albright said Monday night. ``If the
Israelis and the Palestinians are willing to accept that neither
can get 100 percent of what they want, and that each side must
address the other in a spirit of partnership, then they will
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with President Clinton's eagerness to propel the
parties toward a final peace accord during his waning months in
office, Albright, who began her visit by meeting with Prime
Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, hopes to imbue both sides with a
spirit of compromise realistic enough to get them to the endgame of
a century-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the Israelis and the Palestinians, who remain far
apart on every crucial issue, can come together on any of them
quickly enough remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Arafat have not yet made clear if they are willing to
stare down domestic opponents and make deep concessions on
emotional issues like the fate of Jerusalem and the Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, American officials say, it comes down to whether
Barak and Arafat consider the constellation of their determination,
their political strength and their chemistry sufficient to seize
what all are calling a historic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is scheduled to meet with Arafat on Tuesday in the West
Bank city of Ramallah, and to return to Barak in the evening.
Arafat is then supposed to travel to Washington to see President
Clinton, who emerged from a meeting with Barak in Lisbon last week
with the optimistic pronouncement that an agreement was ``within
view.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the Oslo interim peace agreement of 1993, the
negotiations on final peace terms were supposed to take three
years. But because of repeated breakdowns in the
Israeli-Palestinian relationship, the talks began in earnest just
six months ago and delved deeply into the substantive issues only
in the last several weeks during back-channel talks in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   Now, American mediators are trying to parse each side's demands
and determine ``what really is critical to them as opposed to what
may be desirable,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   After her visit here, Albright is to go to Cairo on Wednesday
for talks with Syrian's foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the first high-level Syrian-American meeting since
President Clinton's failed meeting with President Hafez Assad in
Geneva in March, and it raises the prospect that the moribund
Israeli-Syrian peace track could be resuscitated.
</P>
<P>
   That would be bad news for Arafat. Last December, during
Albright's last trip here, Clinton announced the revival of
Israeli-Syrian talks, which effectively shut down Israel's talks
with the Palestinians for months, until the negotiations with Syria
derailed.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel there is the palpable sense _ an anxiety for the right
wing _ that the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are about to enter
the final round. Many of Barak's ministers sent him a letter Monday
night demanding that he convene an urgent meeting of the security
cabinet to let them know what was really happening in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   And before he met with Albright Monday night in his office and
then over dinner at his residence, Barak survived the latest in a
series of parliamentary no-confidence resolutions, this one based
on the concessions he is presumed to be making to the Palestinians.
The resolution was voted down, 38 to 33, with 13 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the doves in Barak's cabinet disagree about how to approach
the months ahead. In one camp are those like Haim Ramon, a
government minister who oversees Jerusalem affairs, who say the
thorniest issues should be deferred. And in the other are those
like Justice Minister Yossi Beilin who say those issues, like
Jerusalem and refugees, will never get any easier.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials say the goal of the
talks is to reach a full deal. ``If they can achieve it, what they
have agreed on is that it should be an end-of-the-conflict
agreement,'' a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   And like Beilin, several experts say Barak will find it easier
to win broad public backing in a referendum if a peace deal is
comprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Barak, yielding much of the West Bank is the price for a
deal,'' said David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington
Institute for Near East Policy. ``But the prize of the deal is the
end once and for all of the conflict. To pay the price without
winning the prize will be seen as undermining the entire rationale
of the peace process.''

BRAVES DEMOTE ROCKER AND FINE HIM $5,000 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with a relief pitcher wild in two ways, the Atlanta Braves
demoted John Rocker to the minor leagues and fined him $5,000
Monday. If Rocker's stay at Richmond of the International League
lasts four weeks, he will miss the Braves' four-game series against
the Mets at Shea Stadium starting June 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' action came a day after Rocker verbally attacked a
magazine reporter for the article that quoted Rocker as denigrating
large segments of society. His comments in the Sports Illustrated
interview earned Rocker a fine and suspension and have made him a
controversial focus of attention of fans and players alike.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates had seemed to tolerate him, hoping he would
maintain a low profile and not cause further disruption in their
clubhouse. But his confrontation with the writer, Jeff Pearlman,
near the clubhouse in Atlanta on Sunday appeared to eradicate their
patience.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves said they optioned Rocker to Richmond not for his
behavior off the field but his performance on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As has been fairly evident watching him pitch, he has not been
able to demonstrate the ability to command or control his stuff and
it has gotten him and our team in considerable hot water,'' General
Manager John Schuerholz said by telephone from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said he, Manager Bobby Cox and Leo Mazzone, the
pitching coach, had been discussing the best way to try to get
Rocker straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environment to do that doesn't exist here,'' Schuerholz
said. ``We don't have the luxury for guys to work their way through
tough times. We decided he needs to pitch consistently to do that.
We think he will do that and be as good as he was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who last year gained 38 saves, has been one of the most
erratic relievers in the National League this season. He had 10
saves, but he also averaged 2.4 runners per inning. He walked 25
and gave up 18 hits in 18 1/3 innings. Of the 41 NL pitchers who
had walked 25 or more before Monday night's games, most had pitched
far more innings than Rocker. The closest pitcher to him was Scott
Sauerbeck, a Pittsburgh reliever, who had walked 31 in 29 1/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz said the problem had reached the point where Cox
``had to have a shadow closer behind the closer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That wears on the bullpen,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Braves wanted to remove Rocker from the team quickly
for disciplinary reasons, his wildness gave them good cover for
their move. The Braves don't have to give a reason for optioning
Rocker, but the players association could question whether it was
disciplinary action. Gene Orza, the union's associate general
counsel, was traveling Monday and could not be reached for comment
on the option.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz readily acknowledged that the fine was a disciplinary
measure for Rocker's tirade against Pearlman, who quoted the
pitcher as telling him, ``Do you know what I can do to you?'' and
``This isn't over between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement that he was
``saddened by the regrettable incident'' that took place in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball is monitoring the situation closely,''
he added, ``and I have been in contact with Braves president Stan
Kasten throughout the day. While Major League baseball is
conducting its own investigation, I am satisfied that the Braves
have moved expeditiously and have treated the matter with the
seriousness it deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig, acting on Rocker's magazine comments, initially fined
Rocker $20,000 and suspended him for all of spring training and the
first four weeks of the season. However, the union challenged the
action as excessive and baseball's impartial arbitrator reduced the
fine to $500 and the suspension to the first two weeks of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   An optioned player must remain in the minors for 10 days unless
another player on the major league roster is injured. But a
four-week stay would ease a problem Major League Baseball has
dreaded _ his appearance at Shea for the first time since the N.L.
championship series last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the security issue becomes less of a concern if he is
not with the team,'' Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager,
said Monday. ``I think we'll be prepared either way. It's something
we always have to be aware of when a team like the Braves is in.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he could understand why the Braves sent Rocker to
the minors. ``It becomes a disruption,'' he said. ``You've read the
players' comments plus he hasn't been performing well.''
</P>
<P>
   To take Rocker's place on the roster, the Braves promoted Jason
Marquis, a pitcher, from Class AA Greenville.

CENSUS WAR SHIFTS TO STATES, WHERE COUNTING HEADS WINS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Ariz., Colo., Kan., Va., La., Utah, Mich., Pa.)  By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress and the Clinton administration in a
stalemate over whether or not to rely solely on traditional
counting methods in the 2000 census, Republicans have quietly moved
the battle over the decennial head count from Washington to state
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   At the prompting of state party leaders, the
Republican-controlled New Jersey Assembly approved a bill Monday
night mandating that the state only use census data derived from
mailed-in census forms, door-to-door canvassers or other
traditional means when it redraws congressional and state
legislative lines. The measure passed 42-34, with Republicans and
Democrats voting along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau and Democrats argue that such traditional
counting methods should be supplemented by data obtained from a
randomly selected national sample of 314,000 households. The
information gleaned from these households would be used to adjust
population totals and, Census Bureau officials say, make the census
more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey bill, which both Republicans and Democrats expect
also to pass in the state Senate would, if signed by Gov. Christie
Whitman, make New Jersey the sixth state to ban the use of census
data that is adjusted using sampling in the redrawing of
congressional and legislative district lines. The other states are
Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Kansas and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Similar measures have been passed in at least one legislative
chamber in Louisiana, Utah and Michigan, and the Pennsylvania
Senate has passed a nonbinding resolution that also prohibits the
use of adjusted data in redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   All the bills have been introduced by Republican state
legislators and votes have followed party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of the fight over statistical sampling to the
states is a deliberate strategy on the part of national leaders of
the Republican Party who felt their prospects of blocking sampling
in Washington were small.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years President Clinton has vetoed bills that would
have prevented the Census Bureau from conducting a census that was
supplemented by statistical sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court gave opponents of sampling only a partial
victory when it ruled in that the method could not be used in
determining population counts used in allocating seats in the House
of Representatives among the states, but was silent on whether
sampling could be used to draw lines for legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the Supreme Court decision, the Census Bureau
announced that it would produce two sets of population figures. One
would be used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives
among the states. The other set of numbers could, if the states so
choose, be used to draw congressional and state legislative
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Supreme Court decision, it was decided the prospects
of achieving much more in Washington had basically disappeared,''
said a Republican official who was familiar with the strategy but
who asked not to be identified. He added: ``It was a definite
strategy that once all the progress that could be made in
Washington was done, the idea was to turn it over to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   By adjusting the population counts using numbers from the
national sample, the Census Bureau hopes to avoid a repeat of the
1990 Census when more than 8 million people, mainly minorities,
were missed, and another 4 million people, mainly whites, were
counted twice.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's plans, however, have become the subject of an
intense partisan debate. Republicans fear, and Democrats hope that
adjusting the census count will increase the number of people
living in traditionally Democratic areas. As a result, these areas
may gain seats in state legislatures at the expense of white
suburban or rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey Monday familiar arguments over the legality of
statistical sampling and whether it produces more or less accurate
population figures for small geographic areas _ debating points
that filled the air in Washington in recent years _ echoed in the
halls of the state legislature in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``An argument can be made that statistical sampling can be more
accurate on a universal level, say for getting the population of
New Jersey,'' said Michael Patrick Carroll, a Republican from
Morris County who is the chief sponsor of the bill. ``But when
you're trying to get the population of Grove Street in Morristown,
then statistical sampling has a huge margin of error, something
along the lines of 35 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials acknowledge that in some tests that were
conducted before the actual census, population figures derived by
using numbers from a national sample were off by about 35 percent
in some small geographic areas. But these officials say often
figures obtained by traditional counting methods are equally
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a group of black ministers and African-American and
Hispanic legislators called on Whitman to veto Carroll's measure
when it reaches her desk.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, the Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive
director of the Black Ministers' Council, called the bill
``divisive'' and added that ``it dilutes, lessens and, in fact,
negates the votes of Latinos, African Americans and other
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Whitman said that the governor
has yet to decide whether she will sign the measure or veto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not formed an opinion on the bill yet,'' McDonough
said. ``We are waiting to hear more of the debate.''

   The Northern Ireland Assembly met for the first time since home

debating whether the Union Jack, the Irish tricolor, both flags or
no flag should fly over official buildings. The Rev. Ian Paisley,

who asked not to be identified. He added: ``It was a definite
strategy that once all the progress that could be made in
Washington was done, the idea was to turn it over to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   By adjusting the population counts using numbers from the
national sample, the Census Bureau hopes to avoid a repeat of the
1990 Census when more than 8 million people, mainly minorities,
were missed, and another 4 million people, mainly whites, were
counted twice.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's plans, however, have become the subject of an
intense partisan debate. Republicans fear, and Democrats hope that
adjusting the census count will increase the number of people
living in traditionally Democratic areas. As a result, these areas
may gain seats in state legislatures at the expense of white
suburban or rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey Monday familiar arguments over the legality of
statistical sampling and whether it produces more or less accurate
population figures for small geographic areas _ debating points
that filled the air in Washington in recent years _ echoed in the
halls of the state legislature in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``An argument can be made that statistical sampling can be more
accurate on a universal level, say for getting the population of
New Jersey,'' said Michael Patrick Carroll, a Republican from
Morris County who is the chief sponsor of the bill. ``But when
you're trying to get the population of Grove Street in Morristown,
then statistical sampling has a huge margin of error, something
along the lines of 35 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials acknowledge that in some tests that were
conducted before the actual census, population figures derived by
using numbers from a national sample were off by about 35 percent
in some small geographic areas. But these officials say often
figures obtained by traditional counting methods are equally
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a group of black ministers and African-American and
Hispanic legislators called on Whitman to veto Carroll's measure
when it reaches her desk.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, the Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive
director of the Black Ministers' Council, called the bill
``divisive'' and added that ``it dilutes, lessens and, in fact,
negates the votes of Latinos, African Americans and other
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Whitman said that the governor
has yet to decide whether she will sign the measure or veto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not formed an opinion on the bill yet,'' McDonough
said. ``We are waiting to hear more of the debate.''

COMMENTARY: PANNING FOR GOLD IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's one heck of a lot of money sloshing around the political
troughs these days. According to a report in Monday's New York
Times by William Glaberson, one race for the Ohio Supreme Court
this year is going to cost up to $12 million. We have candidates
spending a couple of million dollars to become state legislator, a
job that generally carries less prestige than that of nightclub
bouncer. At this rate, the next bunch of people stranded on a
desert island with a TV crew is going to demand a whole lot more
than a lousy million dollars for the effort. (Coming soon: ``Who
Wants to Be a Political Consultant?'')
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the primary Tuesday in New Jersey, where a
former Wall Street honcho named Jon Corzine has spent close to $35
million trying to win the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate
against former Gov. Jim Florio, whose entire budget is
approximately what Corzine will be spending on fax machines and
commemorative potholders.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine is in many ways a fascinating story, although the
fascinating part does not seem to follow him onto the campaign
trail. Despite the very best coaching money can buy and a
dramatically left-wing agenda, he makes Steve Forbes look like
Franklin Delano Roosevelt. (In a recent debate, Corzine delivered
this defense for his largess: ``I have not been a politician and
spent 30 million and over 30 years building name recognition and
establishing the perspectives people might have. I needed to
communicate.'')
</P>
<P>
   According to one of his associates, Corzine entered the race
envisioning a $10 million primary, a plan that went awry somewhere
between his decision to hire Robert Shrum, the man who gave us Al
Checchi's failed $38 million campaign for governor of California,
and the moment he started opening his checkbook for the local
Democratic organizations. Corzine used to be famous for his
munificent federal campaign contributions. But he assured New
Jersey party officials that his newfound interest in state politics
would naturally be reflected by a shift in his gift-giving. This
had the approximate effect of tossing a chunk of hamburger into a
tank of piranhas. ``Word got out there was this pot there, and
things got out of control,'' conceded one campaign official.
</P>
<P>
   One of the comforting things about American election campaigns
is the way the monetary playing field keeps leveling. You come into
the game like George W. Bush with a big fat financial cushion and
slurp, it vanishes. Nature may abhor a vacuum, but political
campaigns can create one in a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always that pressure _ to donate to the local parties,
hire the local potentates' daughters. You end up not saying no to
anything,'' recalled John Weaver, who has run presidential
campaigns for candidates with too little cash (John McCain) and too
much (Phil Gramm). ``Gramm went through the money pretty quickly,''
he recalled. ``We had about 25 opposition research people. We
probably needed one.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no way that Corzine could go through his entire
$400 million fortune running for Senate _ potentates have only just
so many unemployed relatives and you can only run so many ads on TV
before the viewer throws a shoe through the screen. Even as it is,
Corzine may have overdone it. He seems to have made people feel a
little sorry for Florio, a feat most New Jersey residents might
have hitherto regarded as impossible. Corzine not only spent about
20 times as much as his opponent, he also managed to make Florio,
whose household income last year was more than $500,000, look
underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has already broken the record for spending in a U.S.
Senate race, set by Michael Huffington in California in 1994. But
that was for the entire election, against an incumbent. It takes a
lot of money to overcome those odds, especially when your candidate
seems both shy and dimwitted. Corzine is running for a vacant seat,
against a primary opponent who is best known for having raised
taxes by $2.8 billion. He does not seem to lack aggression. His
friends say he is smart, and they rave about his generosity.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if all the stories about his beneficence are true,
every single person who put a Corzine sign on the front lawn this
week should expect to be rewarded with a paid-off mortgage or, at
minimum, a reshingled roof. When the money starts sloshing, the
wise man goes for a pail.

SPORTS COLUMN: A DAY OF READING AND ROLE MODELS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What a great scene. A splendid afternoon in New York,
250 elementary students sitting in Central Park's Rumsey Playfield
to help the New York Public Library kick off another summer reading
club membership drive.
</P>
<P>
   There was a fresh twist to this year's Reading Rally:
professional athletes _ Major League Baseball players _ the Mets'
Al Leiter, the veteran pitcher; Todd Zeile, the first baseman; the
reserve infielder Matt Franco and Manager Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   The kids sat in bleachers and, on Valentine's cue, chanted,
``Let's Go Mets.'' Then they settled down to listen to the players.
Franco began by reading ``Where the Wild Things Are.'' Zeile read
``Giraffe and a Half'' as Valentine pantomimed each new layer of
the story: ``a giraffe and a half _ with a rat in his hat _ looking
cute in his suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Leiter read ``The Great Kapok Tree.'' He prefaced the
reading with a caveat about his own elementary school days when he
didn't love to read as much as he should have.
</P>
<P>
   This was a good day, though for the young students a confusing
day of sports news that defines their lives.
</P>
<P>
   They learned that Ray Lewis, a talented linebacker for the
Baltimore Ravens on trial for murder and aggravated assault, got
the break of his young life: Probation, no prison time in exchange
for his testimony against two co-defendants. The students learned
that John Rocker, Atlanta's volatile relief pitcher who made news
for ugly comments about gays, minorities and New Yorkers in
general, blasted the reporter who wrote the story. By day's end the
students learned that Rocker had been demoted to the minors and
fined $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   What a collage: baseball players reading books to kids on a
sunny afternoon; a football player paying dearly for bad judgment
and a pitcher on the brink of ruining his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than just a story,'' Leiter said. ``It's almost
like a book you can write on professional sports being a microcosm
of society in the year 2000. What I see, even outside my teammates
is that it's a very loose, liberal environment. There a lot of
people who have very little concern for discipline. I think our
society has gotten to a point where freedom of this and freedom of
that is more important of maybe knowing what's right and wrong and
having somebody to let you know what's right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter broke in with the Yankees in 1987. When the subject of
athletes and responsibility is raised, Leiter's lament is similar
to the lament of veteran athletes in all sports and older workers
in all professions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in when Ron Guidry would look at me a certain way and I
knew I had to shut up,'' he said. ``Or Dave Righetti. If he saw
that I sat too far in the back of the plane he'd just go like
this.'' Leiter motioned with his index finger, as if to say, `Come
here.' ``I didn't curse or say, `Who do you think you are?',''
Leiter said. ``I turned around. I understood the fraternity of it,
I respected him as a person and as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, the older guys stood their ground and made a stink
of it. We, as older guys, we don't hold our ground; we'll let an
idiot young player get away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter said the reason older players may not chastise younger
ones as readily _ or as rigorously as before _ is the perceived
volatility of youth. He recalled the old days when you fought and
the fight ended and was over. ``Now you're worried someone might
have a gun. You think of stuff like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Does Leiter really think younger players would respond violently
to being corrected. ``Maybe they would,'' he said. ``There was a
guy, Jackie Gutierez a few years ago, winter ball. A guy made him
mad; he went home, got a gun and came back: Forget that. I don't
know what kind of unstable mind some of these guys have.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is Rocker thinking? What's he thinking? I don't know. I
don't want to make him mad. Plus he's a big guy; probably kick my
behind. So you know what? You turn your head and say, `Forget it.'
If the people upstairs don't see this and don't take care of it,
just because he throws 97 miles per hour ... I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The answers came out right Monday: Atlanta made John Rocker the
minor leaguer he's always been. Lewis, as it turned out, was stupid
but not guilty. And the Mets? The Mets made 250 elementary school
students associate sports with all the good stuff: sunny days,
baseball and ``Giraffes and a Half.'' &QL;

LIVE, FROM PARIS: IT'S `LA TRAVIATA' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In a fantasy world of opera where plots frequently
strain credulity, ``La Traviata'' is unusually realistic. Based on
a true story, it was Verdi's only contemporary opera, one inspired
by events and attitudes of his time. In fact, even today, it
requires no great leap of imagination for audiences to accept that
the tragic love of Violetta Valery and Alfredo Germont is unfolding
in and around mid-19th-century Paris, and not on stage.
</P>
<P>
   So why not present it, live and in color, in Paris?
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, an Italian production team did just that,
with an ultrarealistic version of ``La Traviata'' set in four
different Parisian locations and broadcast live or slightly delayed
in 125 countries. It will be rebroadcast by PBS in the United
States in late summer, scheduled Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The lush production went off with barely a glitch, with
Violetta's poignant demise timed to coincide with the bells of
Notre Dame Cathedral chiming at midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The hidden star of the $25 million production was, of course,
technology, but it served to enhance the show.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian soprano Eteri Gvazava, singing her first
``Traviata,'' was a beautiful and moving Violetta, while the
Argentine tenor Jose Cura was a convincing Alfredo and the Italian
baritone Rolando Panerai a forceful Giorgio Germont. The National
Symphony Orchestra of the RAI, the Italian television network, was
conducted by Zubin Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago the same production team, led by Andrea
Andermann, presented a similar version of ``Tosca,'' broadcast at
the time and from the places established by Puccini, with Catherine
Malfitano and Placido Domingo in the lead roles. With ``La
Traviata'' the locations are less specific than those of ``Tosca''
in Rome, yet as  &UR; the &LR;  Paris opera, it seemed like an obvious
candidate for a new audiovisual adventure.
</P>
<P>
   To place the production even more firmly in Paris, Andermann and
his director, Giuseppe Patroni Griffi, set it in the Paris of the
Universal Exhibition of 1900 and included live views of Paris,
including the Eiffel Tower, shot from a boat traveling down the
Seine. And for the locations of the four main scenes, they again
picked places that reinforced the link to Paris, albeit allowing
time for performers to change costumes and move between the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   For Act I, Violetta's party, where she first meets Alfredo, was
held on Saturday evening in the Hotel Boisgelin, the 18th-century
Left Bank mansion that is now the residence of Italy's ambassador
to Paris. For Act II, the hamlet built for Marie-Antoinette in the
park at Versailles became the country retreat of Violetta and
Alfredo on Sunday noon. The finale of Act II, Flora's party, where
the lovers break up, occurred on Sunday evening in the Petit Palais
in Paris, itself built for the Universal Exhibition. And for Act
III, which began at 11:30 p.m. on Sunday, the ailing Violetta's
apartment was on the Ile St.-Louis, with a view of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   The technical challenge was to link these different locations to
the Salle Wagram, where Mehta was leading the RAI orchestra. Each
performer, including a large chorus in two scenes, was equipped
with two tiny radio microphones and could follow the conductor's
beat on television monitors hidden around each location. In place
of a score, Mehta had a television monitor showing the performance
as well as an earpiece carrying their voices.
</P>
<P>
   The recording itself posed other challenges. With television
broadcasts of theater opera productions, the cameras stay offstage;
with other film versions of opera, like Franco Zefferelli's own
``Traviata,'' the music was prerecorded and the scenes shot in
takes like a movie. Here the cameras had to move constantly among
the singers without ever being seen by another camera.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the great technical breakthrough this weekend, then, was
the daring use of four Steadycams, large cameras strapped to the
body of the operator that provided both visual fluidity and
stunning close-ups. In Act II they followed Violetta and Giorgio
through fields, while in Act III Garett Brown, the Englishman who
invented the Steadycam for Stanley Kubrick's film ``The Shining,''
caught the drama of Violetta's reunion with Alfredo and subsequent
death in one uninterrupted 28-minute take.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Tosca,' we were just amateurs,'' said Vittorio Storaro,
the Oscar-winning cinematographer. ``Now the camera is even freer
because the Steadycam can be used emotionally. The Steadycam is now
part of the style.'' Andermann put it even more succinctly: ``It's
like a work for solo, orchestra and Steadycam.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of preparation and weeks of rehearsal, however, a
final headache was posed by the forecast of stormy weather. And
indeed, heavy rain both preceded and followed three of the scenes.
But the only significant problem was a brief blackout during Act I
when Gvazava entered the Left Bank mansion's garden and a camera
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lasted three seconds, but it felt like three days,''
Andermann said. ``We had five seconds to decide whether to run the
backup tape. But then it came back on again. Still, it was a bit
like when Placido Domingo fell in the first act of `Tosca.' It
proved it was going out live.''
</P>
<P>
   For the video version, which will be seen in the United States,
the blackout will be replaced for a few seconds by the backup
version recorded during the final dress rehearsal. What the
American audience will see, though, is Andermann's proudest
``discovery,'' the tall Siberian-born soprano whom he picked from
among hundreds auditioned to be his Violetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eteri was supposed to be the surprise, and she is the
surprise,'' he said. ``I kept her out of contact with the world for
six months, three months learning Italian in Rome, three months
during rehearsals. I found her in a small opera company in Germany.
She knew nothing about film or television. No one had heard of her.
Now I think she will have a marvelous career. She's a natural
tragedienne, all that deepness of Russian soul, but she also showed
she is a natural comedienne.''

 &HT;    High court reverses Davidians' prison terms
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court Monday reversed the lengthy prison terms
given to five Branch Davidians in 1994 and sent the cases back to a
federal judge in Waco.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous opinion could cut the sentences of four of the
five sect members from 40 to 15 years and the fifth from 20 years
to 15.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also settles a conflict among the nation's federal
appellate courts by stating that prosecutors must prove to a jury
what type of firearm was used in a violent crime if that is an
element of the offense. A judge cannot during the sentencing
determine on his own the type of gun used, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian defense attorneys Monday said U.S. District Judge
Walter S. Smith Jr. will now have to drastically reduce the
sentences he imposed six years ago. However, it was unclear whether
the judge has the option of submitting the weapons issue to another
jury.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that Smith erred when he determined that the
Davidians used machine guns during the Feb. 28, 1993, government
raid on David Koresh's Mount Carmel compound near Waco and bumped
the sentences for four of them from five to 30 years on the weapons
count.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled that the firearm issue must be decided by a
jury, which was not asked in the Branch Davidian criminal trial in
1994 to determine what types of weapons were used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to think that Congress would have wanted a
judge's views to prevail in a case of so direct a factual conflict,
particularly when the sentencing judge applies a lower standard of
proof and when 25 additional years in prison are at stake,''
Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law calls for mandatory, five-year prison terms for
those who carry or use a ``firearm'' during a violent crime. That
term can jump to 30 years for those convicted of carrying or using
machine guns or what are known as ``enhanced'' weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for justice,'' said Stephen P. Halbrook, the
Fairfax, Va., attorney who argued the case before the Supreme Court
in April on behalf of the Davidians. ``It vindicates our system of
a right to a jury trial and the right to know what you are charged
with. The decision was nine to zero. That tells you that the court
thinks it was an easy case for them, and that has implications that
I won't go into about what happened below in the trial court.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Smith was out of town on Monday and was not available for
comment on the court's ruling or how he intends to act in
accordance with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Waco attorney Stanley Rentz, who represents Davidian Graeme
Craddock, said he believes handing the issue back to another jury
would be unconstitutional double jeopardy. He likened that scenario
to a defendant being tried once for manslaughter and then
prosecutors electing to try him later on more serious charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sect members were tried in San Antonio in 1994 on various
charges, including conspiracy to murder federal agents, stemming
from a gunbattle at Mount Carmel in which four agents from the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and five Davidians were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Four members were acquitted of all charges stemming from the gun
battle and a fifth was convicted of a weapons count. Six others
were convicted of manslaughter and carrying or using a firearm
during a crime of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian attorneys believed the firearm charge carried a
mandatory consecutive five-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith, responding to a motion by federal prosecutors,
found that the Davidians had used machine guns and increased their
prison sentences from five to 30 years on the weapons charge.
</P>
<P>
   The question of what kind of weapons the Davidians used was not
alleged in the indictment and was not presented to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Smith sentenced Kevin Whitecliff, Jaime Castillo, Renos Avraam
and Brad Branch to 30 years on the weapons charge and stacked on
that additional 10-year terms for manslaughter. Graeme Craddock,
who was sentenced to an additional 10-year term for possession of a
grenade and using a firearm during a crime, could get his sentence
cut by five years.
</P>
<P>
   Davidian Livingstone Fagan, who also is serving 40 years,
elected not to appeal his sentence. However, that could change in
light of the Supreme Court ruling, Halbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitecliff, 38, in a telephone interview with the Tribune-Herald
just minutes after hearing the news from his attorney, Steven
(Rocket) Rosen of Houston, said he was ``elated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still feeling it right now, it has just been a minute. I'm
sure it will take a while to sink in, but I now see some light at
the end of the tunnel,'' he said from a federal prison in Beaumont.
``I had some hope that it would happen after the Supreme Court
agreed to hear it. It made no sense to me for them to hear it and
not to make a decision on it in our favor. ``
</P>
<P>
   Whitecliff, who like the others has been in custody since has
made no secret of her disdain for the judge's decision to bump the
sentences up to 30 years for the weapons counts. She traveled to
Washington in April to attend the Supreme Court oral arguments,
saying she hoped to personally witness the overturning of the
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, I am elated,'' Bain said Monday. ``I believe
that the Supreme Court did what should have been done all along.
The firearms statute as it was written was a little too vague to
determine if it was up to the jury or the judge to determine what
type of firearm was used. Now that the Supreme Court has said that
is a jury issue, I think that is totally proper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did determine that firearms were used, but we were never
asked to consider the type of firearms. Then the judge determined
that illegal firearms were used. I don't have any idea what we
would have done had we been asked, but it should have been the
jury's decision,'' Bain said.

 &HT;    Poll: Fan split on what todo with Rocker
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marion Hammond wore her John Rocker jersey to Turner Field
Monday night and was disappointed that the real No. 49 wouldn't be
in a Braves uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther in trouble he gets, the better I like him, because
he stands up for what he believes in,'' said Hammond, 47, of
Sylacauga, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was sent down to Richmond a day after he confronted
Sports Illustrated writer Jeff Pearlman at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're punishing him for what he said,'' Hammond
said, ``plus he hasn't been throwing good anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fans said that Rocker's lack of control in his conduct _
not to mention his throwing _ justified sending him to the minors
to work on his game.
</P>
<P>
   In an online vote conducted on ajc.com, which began before the
demotion, 58 percent of the first 11,000 respondents voted to keep
Rocker on the team and 42 percent wanted to get rid of him. But
during the game, the next 5,000 voters had swung the poll toward
booting rocker 50 percent to 49 percent, with 1 percent voting to
``give him one last chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Demuth, 26, of Charleston, S.C., believes sending Rocker
to Richmond was the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's to get his wits about him,'' Demuth said. ``He
has to rethink his career.''
</P>
<P>
   And Demuth thinks Rocker's absence will improve morale. ``You
don't want to have someone in your clubhouse who's giving a
negative feeling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But like many fans, Demuth wants to see a new, improved Rocker
back in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adds to the game,'' he said. ``I hope he's a little smarter
and has his mouth under control a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   And his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Brown, of Rome, Ga., agreed that the 25-year-old closer
needed to find his strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe he needs to regroup his thoughts about what he said
and what he's done,'' said Brown, 54, who wore a 1995 World Series
shirt. ``Maybe he hasn't gotten over it, and he needs to.''
</P>
<P>
   She wants to see him back, too, ``but not like he was. He
doesn't fit the typical profile of a Brave. The image I have of a
Brave is of a gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's husband, Randle, 57, a Braves fan since the team arrived
in Atlanta, thinks the Braves can use Rocker, ``but he's got a head
problem right now. It's affecting his skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Wells of Sheridan, Wyo., who has followed the team since
they were the Milwaukee Braves in 1957, was making his first trip
to Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to the excitement when he came sprinting
in from the bullpen tonight,'' said Wells, 52.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Rocker was sent packing because of his outburst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're going to be counseling Rocker on how to deal
with the media over the issues from his statements,'' Wells said,
``and I think they want to emphasize to him that what he did
yesterday is not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wells thinks the Braves can't win it all without Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the Braves to win the World Series,'' he said.
``Rocker's a part of that and I think the Braves know that. I don't
think the Braves are going to deal him.''

 &HT;    Newsweek speculates on Ted, George on the politics of beauty
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fathers will have their day on June 18, and now they have their
own magazine. A new bimonthly publication, dads ($2.99), debuts
today with a cover story on Cal Ripken and articles aimed at
helping men be parents. Features include notes on fatherhood from
Ben Stein, Frank McCourt and Boomer Esiason, advice on how parents
can connect with their sons, and tips on what gifts fathers really
want.
</P>
<P>
   Editor Eric Garland, a new father, says the magazine fills a
niche that traditional magazines have ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our proposition is simple,'' Garland says. ``Men are
different. We are different from our fathers' generation, and
different from our wives. ... We want to be more committed, more
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine is packed with helpful, if somewhat bland, service
articles. What it needs are more entertaining essays such as Debra
Goldman's column on how fathers are portrayed on television. Even
the new show ``Once and Again'' gets it wrong, she notes: The
divorced-dad character, Rick, is ``the perfect dad, the perfect
lover _ and, alas, the perfect bore.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  All about Ted: In a report on CNN's 20th-anniversary bash and
the pending AOL-Time Warner merger, Newsweek ($3.50) recaps the
events in Ted Turner's private life and speculates about the media
mogul's future without any clear-cut duties. Telling Newsweek
correspondent Johnnie L. Roberts that ``change is always difficult
for older people,'' Turner then hints that he might try to buy a
television network. But AOL's Steve Case says the network deal is
not happening: ``This is not the right time to be thinking of other
acquisitions.'' (Rob come out a winner.

   If this light is on, your vehicle's emissions are out of
control. Scheduled maintenance may help, but sometimes these items
simply deteriorate over time.
</P>
<P>
   The first on my list is the oxygen sensor, thurn the extra fuel
completely. Instead of getting carbon dioxide (a harmless gas that
trees recycle into oxygen), you end up with carbon monoxide (a
poisonous gas that kills people and animals). This is called a
fuel-rich mixture.
</P>
<P>
   The other side of the coin is too much oxygen and not enough
fuel. Although this would seem to be OK because extra oxygen
shouldn't hurt anything, the fuel molecules are moved further apart
from each other, becoming difficult to ignite. The combustion
process is incomplete. This is called a lean mixture.
</P>
<P>
   The byproduct is hydrocarbons (the stinky part of exhaust) and
extra oxygen. In addition, extra oxygen causes a hotter burning,
which creates another gas called oxides of nitrogen, or NOX.
Hydrocarbons and NOX contribute to ground-level ozone.
</P>
<P>
   The oxygen sensor is called that because it senses oxygen by
comparing the amount of oxygen in the air with the amount of oxygen
contained in the exhaust gasses. If there is too little oxygen, it
sends the signal back to the computer that the fuel is rich, so it
cuts the fuel supply to the engine.
</P>
<P>
   Now the exhaust gas will contain more oxygen. The O2 sensor
sends the signal back to the computer, which interprets a lean
condition, so it supplies more fuel to the engine. This seesaw
effect happens in milliseconds. As long as it switches back and
forth at this rapid pace, proper fuel control is taking place,
resulting in complete combustion. Years of starting, warming up,
idling, and miles of driving take its toll. The sensor becomes
lethargic, reacting slowly to the change in oxygen. The signal to
the computer slows down, and fuel control is affected, increasing
tailpipe emissions.

JUSTICES LIMIT VISITING RIGHTS IN DIVIDED CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for complete writethru to update and expand; note new
byline.) 
(See also SCOTUS-GRANDPARENTS-CASE) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Declaring that parents have a ``fundamental right
to make decisions concerning the care, custody and control'' of
their children, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that a Washington
state law went too far in permitting a judge to order visiting
rights for grandparents over a mother's objection.
</P>
<P>
   With a 6-3 vote but lacking a single rationale that could
command a majority, the court stepped cautiously and appeared
intent on avoiding a one-size-fits-all constitutional prescription
for a world of rapidly changing family dynamics. As Justice Sandra
Day O'Connor acknowledged in her opinion for a plurality of four
justices, ``The demographic changes of the past century make it
difficult to speak of an average American family.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the court stopped short of declaring
unconstitutional a Washington law, one of the broadest regarding
the rights of grandparents in terms of permitting judicial
intervention into family affairs. Nor did the justices offer much
guidance for judging the constitutionality of similar laws in the
49 other states.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with New York in 1966, states adopted laws on visiting
rights that reflected the rising divorce rate and the impact of
custody battles that caused grandparents to lose contact with their
grandchildren. While most state laws make parental death or divorce
a precondition for grandparents to seek visiting rights, the
Washington law required no such triggering event.
</P>
<P>
   The four-justice plurality found only that the law had been
unconstitutionally applied to order visits by the grandparents in
the case in question, a dispute between Tommie Granville, the
mother of two daughters, and Jenifer and Gary Troxel, the parents
of the girls' father, who had killed himself. Granville was willing
to allow some visits, but not the two weekends a month the Troxels
had requested when they invoked the state law and went to court.
They won a modified order that was invalidated on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth justice, David H. Souter, voted to strike down the
Washington law in all possible applications _ as had the Washington
Supreme Court in a 1998 ruling that was before the court Monday _
and a sixth justice, Clarence Thomas, suggested in a cryptic,
two-paragraph opinion that he would do the same. Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen
G. Breyer joined O'Connor's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative, splintered nature of the decision, with a total
of six separate opinions among nine justices, all but guaranteed
that challenges to other state laws would reach the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the court did set a constitutional bottom line that
any statute would have to meet, with a balance struck clearly in
favor of parental decision-making while leaving the door open to
upholding more carefully tailored statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of a fit parent to deny or limit access to a child
is entitled to ``at least some special weight'' or ``presumption of
validity,'' O'Connor said, adding that it was these characteristics
that the Washington law failed to apply in this case, Troxel vs.
Granville, No. 99-138.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children
(i.e., is fit),'' O'Connor wrote, ``there will normally be no
reason for the state to inject itself into the private realm of the
family to further question the ability of that parent to make the
best decisions concerning the rearing of that parent's children.''
</P>
<P>
   One undoubtedly unanticipated resultof the case, which was
argued in January, could be to strengthen the federal government's
hand in its support of Juan Miguel Gonzalez in his effort to take
his son, Elian, home to Cuba over the objection of relatives in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that there is now no question that a parent
decides for a child,'' Pamela S. Falk, a professor of international
law at the City University of New York, said in an interview.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   The Washington law, passed in 1994, provided that any person may
petition the court for visiting rights at any time, which a court
could order when visits ``may serve the best interest of the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a ``breathtakingly broad'' invitation, O'Connor said,
for state judges simply to substitute their judgment for that of
the parents. But, she said, ``the Due Process Clause does not
permit a state to infringe on the fundamental right of parents to
make child-rearing decisions simply because a state judge believes
a `better' decision could be made.''
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the law, the Washington Supreme Court had gone
considerably farther, ruling not only that the parental decisions
were entitled to some measure of judicial deference, but that in
the absence of an unfit parent or a showing of harm to the
children, parents had a constitutional right to exercise an
effective veto over any request for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the state court said, a ``best interests of the
child'' standard was never constitutionally adequate.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said Monday that it was unnecessary to resolve the
question of whether, in order to be constitutional, a statute had
to require a showing of parental unfitness or harm to the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not, and need not, define today the precise scope of the
parental due process right in the visitation context,'' she said.
She added, ``Because much state court adjudication in this context
occurs on a case-by-case basis, we would be hesitant to hold that
specific nonparental visitation statutes violate the Due Process
Clause as a per se matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's hesitation reflected not only the novelty and
emotional weight of the issue, but also the fact that in the U.S.
legal system, family law has been the province of state
legislatures and state courts, with only rare occasions for Supreme
Court intervention on such questions as the right of parents to
choose private rather than public schools, as the court held in a
case from the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion Monday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said
the court should have confronted, rather than avoided, the question
of whether a law providing for visiting rights in the best
interests of the child could ever be constitutional. In Kennedy's
view, such laws could be constitutional if directed to people who
had acted ``in a caregiving role over a significant period of
time,'' whether a grandparent or a ``de facto parent'' of another
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens also filed a dissenting opinion that
called attention to ``the almost infinite variety of family
relationships that pervade our ever-changing society,'' and warned
against adopting a rule that would allow parents to exercise
``arbitrary'' power over their children's contact with other
adults. Stevens said the court should ``reject any suggestion that
when it comes to parental rights, children are so much chattel.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Logue, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, which filed a brief on behalf of the mother, said
it was encouraging that justices on both sides of the case had
appeared eager to maintain a level of constitutional flexibility in
recognizing that ``there are many ways to raise children'' and that
significant relationships between children and people who are not
their biological parents can be deserving of protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is letting this area of law evolve to meet the
families that are out there,'' Logue said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the variety of views the justices expressed Monday, the
differences among eight of them appeared nuanced rather than
fundamental. The lone exception was Justice Antonin Scalia, who
filed a separate dissenting opinion rejecting the application of
the Due Process Clause and of what he called ``judicial vindication
of `parental rights' under a Constitution that does not even
mention them.'' He warned that the court was ``ushering in a new
regime of judicially prescribed, and federally prescribed, family
law.''

PEROT IS UNLIKELY TO CHALLENGE BUCHANAN, HIS AIDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass., Minn., Colo., Del., Md., Alaska, Wyo., R.I.,
Calif.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite his distaste for Pat Buchanan's conservative views on
social issues, Ross Perot, the founder of the Reform Party and it
two-time presidential candidate, has all but ruled out running
against Buchanan for the party nomination this year, a spokesman
for Perot said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way someone could get in now and compete for the
presidential nomination,'' said Russell J. Verney, a former
national chairman of the Reform Party who remains close to Perot
and often conveys his political sentiments. Verney added that Perot
had no plans to engineer an 11th-hour campaign to put himself in
contention for the nomination through a balloting process that
begins next month and ends on the eve of the party convention in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Verney's statement seems to remove the last bit of uncertainty
over whether Buchanan will win the third-party nomination and the
$12.5 million in federal campaign funds that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Verney emphasized that staying out of the race did not
necessarily reflect Perot's support for Buchanan, even though it
was largely at Perot's invitation that Buchanan left the Republican
party last year to join the Reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Verney expressed concern that Buchanan was ultimately
less interested in winning the White House than in presiding over
an ``ideologically pure right-wing party'' that reflected his
deeply held beliefs on social issues like abortion and
homosexuality, which the Reform Party platform has ignored for the
sake of party unity.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a former White House speech writer and political
pundit, deflected the accusation in an interview Monday with
Political Points, the Web cast of The New York Times and ABC News.
``I'm criticized on the one hand by social conservatives,'' he
said. ``They say, `You've abandoned right-to-life, Pat, and you're
not talking about the social issues.' On the other hand, there are
Reform Party opposition folks who say, `All you're talking about is
right-to-life and the social issues.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the matter is I've never abandoned my views and
philosophy. I am pro-life. I indicated to that in my opening
announcement running for the Reform Party nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the concern about Buchanan's intentions focuses on what
he and his allies could do with the Reform platform. While the
popular vote determines the nominee _ virtually any registered
voter can cast a ballot _ a nominee supported by two-thirds of the
delegates has the right to rewrite the party platform and its
preamble, both of which are currently silent on social issues.
Party rules also provide for a two-thirds vote of the delegates to
overturn the popular choice of presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   No one from Buchanan's campaign has said unequivocally that he
would not alter the platform or preamble if he were nominated. Paul
Truax, who serves as the party's southwest regional representative,
said Monday that Buchanan officials ``have told us repeatedly they
would not make a change this year. But we just don't know. Are we
supposed to be satisfied for just this year? We don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   To win a place on the Reform primary ballot, a candidate has to
demonstrate, through signature petitions, sufficient support around
the country to become a viable challenger to the likely major party
nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Buchanan has helped get the Reform Party on the ballot
in almost 30 states, and he was well on his way to securing the
delegates he would need if he wanted to alter the party platform.
After state reform party conventions last weekend in Iowa,
California and Rhode Island, he estimated that he has won the
support of almost half of the 596 national convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're really marching toward the nomination,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, opposition remains.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Perot, some Reform leaders are backing John
Hagelin of the nascent Natural Law party. Reform Party officials
opposed to Buchanan have been helping the Hagelin campaign generate
support among Reform members who feel more comfortable with the
party platform as it was written with Perot at the helm. Those
issues focus on government reform as the party's major thrust,
positions that the Natural Law party embraces in a variety of
areas, like education, health care and the environment. Like the
current Reform Party platform, the Natural Law party takes no
official position on abortion or other social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin, a research physicist from Connecticut who now lives in
Iowa, predicted that he would win the popular vote over Buchanan
because his politics appeal to a broader base of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely positive about our chances,'' Hagelin said in an
interview. ``And I'm quite confident we are going to win the public
plebiscite.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to Buchanan are also trying to ease his
ever-tightening grip on the party infrastructure. In addition to
collecting signatures and wooing delegates, Buchanan has also
enjoyed widespread success in helping place supporters in key state
party positions. In at least three states _ Wyoming, Delaware and
Maryland _ the state party chairman, who is ostensibly supposed to
project neutrality, is also the Buchanan campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   And two members of the national convention credentials
committee, which controls who gets seated, are Buchanan chairmen in
their states, Alaska and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some Buchanan supporters say the efforts to derail him _
especially any by Perot supporters _ are simply sour grapes because
they have lost control of the party. David Goldman, a senior party
official in Florida who was once a staunch Perot and Verney
loyalist, said he has broken with them to support Buchanan over
what he described as ``fraudulent behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   As examples, he cited Dick Lamm, the former Colorado governor,
Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota and Buchanan as people they invited
to join the party and help expand its base, only to turn on them
when they began to generate support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would rather blow up the party than allow people like
Ventura and Buchanan to have control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Buchanan, he added, ``They're trying to destroying their
own creation, but he has been strong enough to resist their efforts
to drive him out.''

   WASHINGTON _ If a foreign student enrolls in a US university to
pursue a literature degree then switches to study nuclear physics,
should the move be monitored by school and immigration officials?
</P>
<P>
   Such changes are already kept on file at individual
universities. But when a congressional panel on terrorism Monday
suggested that the Immigration and Naturalization Service should
also be notified about a student's study program, it drew immediate
criticism, even though plans for tracking foreign students more
closely have been under way for years.
</P>
<P>
   Some school officials, and one former CIA anti-terrorism chief,
expressed alarm at a suggestion in the report by the National
Commission on Terrorism that a new immigration system might
``record a student's change in major from English literature to
nuclear physics.'' Sharon Ladd, director of Harvard University's
International Office, said she ``sort of shuddered'' when she heard
about the report on the news. She cited how controversial the
monitoring of student visas has been historically.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my colleagues are very concerned about (the program)
being intrusive,'' she said. ``I think a lot of it is the way it's
being portrayed. Is this the INS trying to provide a service for
schools, or is it that we're trying to track terrorists?''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's recommendation came as part of a 47-page report, titled
``Countering the Changing Threat of Terrorism,'' mandated by
Congress after the US embassy bombings in East Africa two years
ago. The recommendations included reclassifying Greece and Pakistan
as countries ``not cooperating fully'' with anti-terrorism efforts,
as well as devoting greater resources to collecting
counterintelligence information. In general, the commission found
that the US government should prepare more fully for a terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual proposals was one to limit the ability
of federal law enforcement officials to keep ``secret evidence''
when prosecuting foreign terrorism suspects. Juliette N. Kayyem,
one of the 10 members of the commission and an associate at the
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said the
recommendation marked a victory for civil rights advocates because
it recognized that in hiding evidence from a defendant, Americans
had ``gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first national security commission which has been
known to ask for less,'' Kayyem said.
</P>
<P>
   But that measure was greatly overshadowed by the single line in
the report recommending the monitoring of student degree programs,
in part because the rules governing an estimated 250,000 foreign
students are still in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, when
immigration officials were unable to locate a suspect who entered
the country on a student visa and stayed after it expired, the INS
has been under pressure to map a new strategy for monitoring
foreign students. Efforts have thus far mostly centered on an
obvious first step: putting all student visa information onto a
computer network instead of relying on paperwork that takes months
to process.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of Monday's report said they were not proposing any
expansion of INS powers. The chairman of the blue ribbon panel,
former ambassador L. Paul Bremmer, said there would be ``no change
in procedure or in the scope of it,'' saying the chief
recommendation was that the INS streamline its paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The written recommendation was worded extremely cautiously:
``The President and Congress should work together to create an
effective system for monitoring the status of foreign students
nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Bremmer outlined a program that went beyond
the one INS officials describe as their current practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably, if you had a student from a terrorist state
switching majors from humanities into molecular biology or nuclear
physics, it should at least send up a red flag at INS to ask
questions about the guy,'' said Brenner, a former
ambassador-at-large for counter-terrorism. ``Presumably, you could
have the INS call him in for an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   In developing its new strategy for monitoring foreign students
over the last four years, the INS has moved relatively cautiously,
beginning with a pilot program known as the Coordinated Interagency
Partnership Regulating International Students, or CIPRIS.
</P>
<P>
   Comprised of 20 schools in Southern states, CIPRIS is described
by immigration officials as simply a computerized version of the
current paper system _ and a welcome advance at the often outdated
immigration agency, according to officials at several schools.
</P>
<P>
   But despite assurances by the report's authors that the panel
was not suggesting any expansion of authority, an INS official
Monday night said the new INS pilot program does not include
monitoring which degree a student is pursuing. Eyleen Schmidt, an
INS spokeswoman, said it was ``not included as part of the original
CIPRIS pilot, and at this point, there are not plans to include
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said the panel had, in its recommendation, interpreted
immigration law differently from the INS. One of the elements the
INS tracks is the ``current academic status'' of a student, which
it defines as whether a student is in school full-time. The panel,
she said, would redefine that term to include which program a
student was enrolled in.
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, said Vince Cannistraro, former head of the CIA
counter-terrorism unit, the commission was addressing ``a problem
that may not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's intrusive,'' Cannistraro said of the commission's
proposal. ``I don't think it's necessary. The FBI already has all
the authority they need to follow people who are up to no good. If
you put on them the additional burden of tracking every foreign
student in the United States, you run a significant risk of civil
liberties infringements.''

PROTESTERS DENOUNCE FREE TRADE AS OAS DELEGATES DEBATE PERU 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ Inside the annual meeting of the Organization
of American States, delegates debated Monday Peru's flawed
presidential vote. But outside, free trade was the issue that
brought 2,500 protesters surging around the 10-foot steel mesh
fence protecting the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say they are talking about poverty, and dealing with
issues like Peru and so on,'' said Maude Barlow, chairwoman of the
Council of Canadians, a nationalist group. ``But the OAS is the
political institution moving forward the agenda of Free Trade Area
of the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   Although trade is not on the agenda of the three-day meeting,
which ends on Wednesday, some Canadian and American demonstrators
against free trade had vowed to shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   With almost one police officer on duty here for each protester,
Canada decided to follow the example of Washington, D.C., last
April in pre-empting protesters before they could cause the chaos
that disrupted the World Trade Organization meeting last November
in Seattle. The protests here have been the largest in memory at an
OAS gathering.
</P>
<P>
   In the four days leading up to Sunday's protest, Canadian
immigration officials at the bridge and tunnel crossings from
Detroit refused admittance to 560 Americans, a much higher rate
than the normal rate of refusal of 1,000 a month. Ken Lawrence, a
spokesman for the immigration service, said many of ``the
individuals were coming in to protest.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Yen, a Canadian customs spokesman, said that during the
same time at the Detroit crossing, customs officials had
confiscated, from about 200 Americans, hundreds of items that could
have been used in protests, including tear gas canisters, gas
masks, eye goggles, bleach, pepper spray, pipes, bats, flares and
spray-paint cans.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 41 protesters were arrested outside the riverfront
convention center here, 35 for blocking a bus that carried
delegates and several more for attempting to scale the security
fence. Sgt. David Rossell of the Windsor police said that officers
used pepper spray after protesters hiding behind an anti-free-trade
banner had thrown smoke bombs and unknown liquids at them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, about 400 people in downtown Detroit, across
the river here, paraded with Shut Down OAS banners, chanting
``Clean up this mess, stop the OAS.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police officers removed scores of demonstrators who
had linked arms and sat in the rain to block delegates in three
buses from arriving at an official luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that by moving aggressively, they had
headed off the kind of disorder that cost $10 million in damage in
Seattle and led to 525 arrests. In Washington, D.C., there were
1,300 arrests.

NEW LIBRARY TO MAKE AVAILABLE MARY BAKER EDDY PAPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Christian Science Church plans to announce Tuesday
a plan to build a $50 million research library to house more than
500,000 documents and artifacts of church founder Mary Baker Eddy.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, many of which have not been available to scholars
or the public, are expected to make the Mary Baker Eddy Library for
the Betterment of Humanity the largest library devoted to the work
of an American woman.
</P>
<P>
   The library, which is being modeled after presidential
libraries, with a mix of exhibits for tourists, archives for
researchers, and meeting spaces for conferences, will be housed in
the 68-year-old Publication Society Building, in the church's
landmark Back Bay headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Leading religion and US history specialists said the library
would provide invaluable resources on the history of gender, faith,
and journalism in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite fascinated by the comprehensiveness of the
collection,'' said Don W. Wilson, who has worked on numerous
presidential libraries, including the George Bush presidential
library in Houston, and is one of several non-Christian Science
scholars on a panel that will oversee the Eddy Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a 19th century woman leader who was ahead of her
time, and the collection shows the multifaceted nature of her
interests, in journalism, in healing, in a whole variety of
issues,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to construct the library comes as the Christian
Science church is increasingly seeking to promote public interest
in Eddy as an early advocate of spiritual healing and an early
example of women's rights in action. The church, which does not
release estimates of the size of its membership, says it will not
use the library to recruit new members.
</P>
<P>
   ``These papers are probably the largest single collection by a
woman leader of the 19th century that remained unavailable through
the 20th century. . . . I suspect (they) will be widely used in
many areas,'' said historian Allen Weinstein, president of the
Washington-based Center for Democracy. The former Smith College and
Boston University professor has been granted access to the archives
and is working on a book of Eddy's letters.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Science Church, founded by Eddy in 1867, has often
been controversial, largely because many members refuse the medical
care of doctors because of their belief that disease can be cured
through prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy, a native of Bow, N.H., who lived part of her adulthood in
and around Boston, enjoyed a long life _ from 1821 to 1910 _ and
she was an extraordinarily prolific writer and a dedicated saver of
documents. The collection includes her diaries, scrapbooks, poems,
sermons, and notes, as well as correspondence to and from everyone
from her grandchildren to suffragist Susan B. Anthony, publisher
William Randolph Hearst, and first lady Ida S. McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Her collection, which church officials started saving before she
died, has been supplemented by donations and purchases over the
last century, and is now stored in vaults in and around Boston.
Church archivists believe they have 500,000 documents, 14,000
photographs and 7,000 objects associated with Eddy, but specialists
say estimates of collections of this size are often low.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials say they hope to open the library in 2002, and
a satellite facility in Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 2003. Seneca Falls
is the site of the first women's rights convention in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   The church also owns three houses that Eddy lived in, as well as
her artworks, her personal library, her jewelry, and the eight
carriages in which she traveled around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents, now being catalogued by 20 church
archivists, are an 1862 letter to Eddy from her second husband,
written from a Confederate jail during the Civil War, and the 1875
printer's bill for the publication of Eddy's book, ``Science and
Health.'' That volume, and the Bible, are the basic texts of the
Christian Science religion.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also include the 47-word missive with which Eddy
ordered her students in 1908 to establish the Christian Science
Monitor _ an order they honored within months and which led to the
creation of a highly respected newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials said the materials are likely to enrich
history's view of Eddy, but not dramatically alter it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are any surprises, it's just that the scope of this
material is so broad,'' said Virginia S. Harris, who as chairman of
the Christian Science board of directors is the church's top
official. The church has no clergy. ``It's not just religious. . .
. It will speak to women scholars and to (19th century) historians,
of journalism, of medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   The library, covering 75,000 square feet, is intended to become
the main tourist attraction on the Christian Science campus,
providing access to the Mapparium, a 30-foot-high, walk-in, stained
glass globe depicting the world in 1985 which had been attracting
250,000 visitors a year before being closed in 1998 to allow
building renovations to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say that the decision to make Eddy's documents public
reflects a maturation of the denomination, its leaders now secure
enough to eliminate some of the secrecy that characterized a group
of adherents once fearful of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a movement that has had somewhat tense relations
with American society in general now feeling comfortable to come
forward and completely open the papers of their founder to the
public and the scholarly world,'' said Ann Braude, a women's
religious history specialist at Harvard Divinity School who has
agreed to advise the library project. ``What is most significant is
that they now feel they can let the light of day shine on their
most private documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Although best known for her advocacy of healing through faith,
Eddy was also an early advocate of what she called a
``father/mother God,'' a deity who is not necessarily male.
</P>
<P>
   In 1907, Human Life magazine called Eddy ``the most famous,
interesting, and powerful woman in America, if not in the world,
today. No woman was ever so rich, who actually earned the money
herself; no woman was ever so influential, for in her church she
has more authority than the Pope; and no other woman in history was
ever the means of erecting such beautiful and costly edifices, or
of promulgating a faith that had 80,000 faithful followers.''

JUSTICES SAY STARR BROKE HUBBELL IMMUNITY DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the office
of Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, violated an
agreement with Webster Hubbell by forcing him to produce thousands
of pages of personal financial records under a grant of immunity
and then using those records to indict him on charges of tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-1 decision affirmed a ruling last year by the federal
appeals court here, which declared that it would find the
indictment fatally flawed unless the independent counsel's office
could prove that it knew in advance, when it issued a far-reaching
subpoena for Hubbell's financial information, that the documents
existed and that Hubbell had them. Starr acknowledged that he could
not meet that standard and appealed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the ruling on Monday was to dismiss a conditional
guilty plea agreement that Hubbell, the former associate attorney
general and once a close friend of the Clintons, entered into with
Starr's office. Under the agreement, Hubbell pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor tax charge and received no incarceration and no fine.
The agreement provided that the guilty plea would be erased if the
independent counsel's office did not win the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Ray, Starr's successor, said on Monday he would soon
file a motion to vacate the guilty plea. Ray said he was ``pleased
that the Supreme Court has clarified this difficult area of the
law.'' He noted that a guilty plea Hubbell entered at the same time
last year to a felony charge of concealing information from federal
bank regulators was not affected by the ruling on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While the stakes were not particularly high for Hubbell, who
served 17 months in prison for financial violations involving his
former law firm and clients, the decision clarified a principle of
the law of immunity that could be important in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The question was whether, and under what circumstances, the fact
of producing documents required under a grant of immunity is itself
a ``testimonial act,'' protected by the Fifth Amendment's guarantee
against compelled self-incrimination as well as by the immunity
statute. The contents of voluntarily prepared documents are not
protected, so the focus in this case was on the act of production
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Justice John Paul Stevens said that given
the breadth of the subpoena _ essentially all of Hubbell's
financial records for the previous three years _ the act of
producing the documents was more than a ``mere physical act.'' He
said ``the collection and production of the materials demanded was
tantamount to answering a series of interrogatories asking a
witness to disclose the existence and location of particular
documents fitting certain broad descriptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens noted that Judge James Robertson of Federal District
Court, who dismissed the indictment in 1998, had called the
subpoena ``the quintessential fishing expedition.'' The subpoena
``did produce a fish,'' Stevens said, ``but not the one that the
independent counsel expected to hook.''
</P>
<P>
   While the purpose of the subpoena was to aid Starr's
investigation of a possible obstruction of justice involving
Hubbell's sources of income after he left the Justice Department,
no such charge was ever brought. Instead, the independent counsel
charged Hubbell with evading taxes on the income that the documents
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel ``has not shown that it had any prior
knowledge of either the existence or the whereabouts of the 13,120
pages of documents ultimately produced'' by Hubbell, Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   In a concurring opinion, Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin
Scalia took an even broader view of the Fifth Amendment privilege,
saying that in the view of the founding fathers, the protection
against compelled self-incrimination applied not only to testimony
but to ``any incriminating evidence.'' Had that been the rule, the
court would not have had to inquire in this case, United States vs.
Hubbell, No. 99-166, whether Hubbell's response to the subpoena was
testimonial in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted his dissent, but did
not file an opinion to explain his reasons.

FCC APPROVES AT&AMP;T'S ACQUISITION OF MEDIAONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Updates throughout with quotes, details, background; no
pickup.) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission approved
AT&AMP;T's acquisition of MediaOne on Monday after ordering the
companies to sell some of their assets, clearing the final obstacle
to a merger that will create the nation's largest provider of cable
television, long-distance telephone service and high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a prime example of the consolidation that began in
the telecommunications market after it was deregulated in 1996,
which has promised to blur and redefine the nation's phone, cable
and broadcast industries.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman and chief executive since
1997, has been trying to move his company away from a stagnant
business _ long-distance telephone service _ so it can take
advantage of the revolution in digital communications. He has
committed billions of dollars to offer consumers a basket of
services: television; the Internet; and local, long-distance and
wireless telephone access.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits. The FCC gave the companies a choice of
which programming and cable subsidiaries and investments to sell to
comply with a rule that forbids a corporation from having interests
in more than 30 percent of the nation's cable and satellite
television market, or nearly 25 million subscribers. Officials
estimate that, without any divestitures, AT&AMP;T and MediaOne would
control more than 40 percent of that market, reaching more than 34
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The decision angered some consumer groups, who had asked the
commission to force AT&AMP;T to sell the cable systems the company
co-owns with Time Warner, its next biggest rival, which is being
acquired by America Online. The groups had also asked the agency to
force AT&AMP;T to open its Internet network to competing service
providers without requiring consumers to pay additional fees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Consumers Union said they were so troubled by the
decision that they would file a lawsuit in federal court to
overturn the commission's action and would ask Congress to adopt a
new law that would narrow the agency's authority to review mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than use its merger authority to protect the public
against an expanding monopoly, the commission has allowed AT&AMP;T to
extend the reach of its cable and broadband Internet service
monopolies and extended the time during which it can abuse
consumers and harm potential competitors,'' said Gene Kimmelman,
co-director of Consumers Union's Washington office. ``This decision
is so inconsistent with the commission's own factual depiction of
AT&AMP;T's market dominance that it defies logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimmelman added that the decision ``smacks of political
favoritism for one company.''
</P>
<P>
   But federal regulators said the order struck a delicate balance
by encouraging AT&AMP;T and MediaOne to continue investing billions of
dollars to upgrade the nation's cable system for high-speed
Internet access and entering local telephone markets to challenge
the regional Bell companies. At the same time, they said, the order
prevents the company from monopolizing the cable market and
creating inappropriate bottlenecks for rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T's application, as originally filed, was inconsistent with
the public interest and presented significant diversity and
competition concerns,'' said William E. Kennard, chairman of the
FCC. ``But the merger we approve today looks very different from
the application initially presented to us. This decision strikes
the appropriate balance between promoting competition in local
telephone service and protecting competition in cable and
high-speed Internet service.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he had also relied on AT&AMP;T's nonbinding commitment
not to block rivals' access to its system, as Time Warner did
briefly during a recent contract dispute with ABC, which is owned
by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T executives were thrilled by Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger will mean a real choice and lower prices in local
phone service, faster Internet access and better cable TV,''
Armstrong said. ``For consumers, that's a home run in any ball
park.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger was valued at $58 billion when it was
announced a year ago during a wave of consolidation in the
telecommunications and high-speed Internet markets.
</P>
<P>
   Those deals have posed a particular challenge for antitrust
regulators because of the complex interlocking ownership interests
between cable operators, programmers and high-speed Internet
service providers. In many ways, the blurring of lines between
content providers and distributors mirrors the technical
convergence that is occurring as it is becoming more difficult to
distinguish between a telephone service, a television network and
an Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T and Time Warner, which will be the nation's
second-largest cable operator, have shared interests in the same
high-speed Internet and programming companies. But two weeks ago
the Justice Department's antitrust division approved the AT&AMP;T
merger after the companies agreed to sell their interest in Road
Runner, the nation's second-largest cable Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the FCC went further, ordering another round of
divestitures to comply with a law that says the agency will approve
mergers that are only found to be in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC decided to give AT&AMP;T and MediaOne a year to choose from
three options to meet the 30 percent limit. They can sell their
interest in the Liberty Media Group and Rainbow Holdings,
programming companies that AT&AMP;T acquired interests in when it
acquired Tele-Communications Inc. last year. They can sell
MediaOne's 25 percent interest in Time Warner Entertainment, a
programming and cable operating company that serves 12.6 million
cable subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Or AT&AMP;T and MediaOne, which together have interests in 41.8
percent of the cable and satellite television markets, could shed
11.8 percent, or about 9.7 million subscribers, to lower their
share of the market to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The order gives the companies until May 19, 2001, to complete
the divestitures. The date is the one-year anniversary of a
decision by a federal appeals court here upholding the
constitutionality of the cable ownership limits. The agency also
ordered AT&AMP;T to report on what companies they intend to sell within
six months of the date of the closing of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   James Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general counsel, said the company had not
decided what it would sell but that it had had no intention of
spinning off its interest in Liberty Media. That unit's largest
shareholder, John C. Malone, is also AT&AMP;T's largest shareholder and
a member of its board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not prepared to pick an option today,'' Cicconi said.
``We're confident we can comply.'' He said AT&AMP;T planned to close
the deal by the first week in August.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups and rivals said that once the deal closed,
it would solidify AT&AMP;T's position as the dominant cable player.
They said the FCC appeared to have caved in to special interests
and that the regulators should have used the deal to force the
companies to open their Internet network to competing service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its approval, the FCC indicates that it will continue to
monitor AT&AMP;T's promise to provide open access in the future,'' said
Greg Simon, co-director of the Open Net Coalition, a group of
consumer organizations, Internet providers and other telephone
companies critical of AT&AMP;T's refusal to provide them with equal
access to its high-speed service. ``However, by the time the FCC
determines if AT&AMP;T has fulfilled its vague voluntary commitments on
open access, it may be too late to offer customers meaningful
choices for cable Internet services.''

US PLANS TO MONITOR FOREIGN STUDENTS ALARMS SOME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If a foreign student enrolls in a US university to
pursue a literature degree then switches to study nuclear physics,
should the move be monitored by school and immigration officials?
</P>
<P>
   Such changes are already kept on file at individual
universities. But when a congressional panel on terrorism Monday
suggested that the Immigration and Naturalization Service should
also be notified about a student's study program, it drew immediate
criticism, even though plans for tracking foreign students more
closely have been under way for years.
</P>
<P>
   Some school officials, and one former CIA anti-terrorism chief,
expressed alarm at a suggestion in the report by the National
Commission on Terrorism that a new immigration system might
``record a student's change in major from English literature to
nuclear physics.'' Sharon Ladd, director of Harvard University's
International Office, said she ``sort of shuddered'' when she heard
about the report on the news. She cited how controversial the
monitoring of student visas has been historically.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my colleagues are very concerned about (the program)
being intrusive,'' she said. ``I think a lot of it is the way it's
being portrayed. Is this the INS trying to provide a service for
schools, or is it that we're trying to track terrorists?''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's recommendation came as part of a 47-page report, titled
``Countering the Changing Threat of Terrorism,'' mandated by
Congress after the US embassy bombings in East Africa two years
ago. The recommendations included reclassifying Greece and Pakistan
as countries ``not cooperating fully'' with anti-terrorism efforts,
as well as devoting greater resources to collecting
counterintelligence information. In general, the commission found
that the US government should prepare more fully for a terrorist
attack.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual proposals was one to limit the ability
of federal law enforcement officials to keep ``secret evidence''
when prosecuting foreign terrorism suspects. Juliette N. Kayyem,
one of the 10 members of the commission and an associate at the
Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, said the
recommendation marked a victory for civil rights advocates because
it recognized that in hiding evidence from a defendant, Americans
had ``gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first national security commission which has been
known to ask for less,'' Kayyem said.
</P>
<P>
   But that measure was greatly overshadowed by the single line in
the report recommending the monitoring of student degree programs,
in part because the rules governing an estimated 250,000 foreign
students are still in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, when
immigration officials were unable to locate a suspect who entered
the country on a student visa and stayed after it expired, the INS
has been under pressure to map a new strategy for monitoring
foreign students. Efforts have thus far mostly centered on an
obvious first step: putting all student visa information onto a
computer network instead of relying on paperwork that takes months
to process.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of Monday's report said they were not proposing any
expansion of INS powers. The chairman of the blue ribbon panel,
former ambassador L. Paul Bremmer, said there would be ``no change
in procedure or in the scope of it,'' saying the chief
recommendation was that the INS streamline its paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The written recommendation was worded extremely cautiously:
``The President and Congress should work together to create an
effective system for monitoring the status of foreign students
nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, Bremmer outlined a program that went beyond
the one INS officials describe as their current practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably, if you had a student from a terrorist state
switching majors from humanities into molecular biology or nuclear
physics, it should at least send up a red flag at INS to ask
questions about the guy,'' said Brenner, a former
ambassador-at-large for counter-terrorism. ``Presumably, you could
have the INS call him in for an interview.''
</P>
<P>
   In developing its new strategy for monitoring foreign students
over the last four years, the INS has moved relatively cautiously,
beginning with a pilot program known as the Coordinated Interagency
Partnership Regulating International Students, or CIPRIS.
</P>
<P>
   Comprised of 20 schools in Southern states, CIPRIS is described
by immigration officials as simply a computerized version of the
current paper system _ and a welcome advance at the often outdated
immigration agency, according to officials at several schools.
</P>
<P>
   But despite assurances by the report's authors that the panel
was not suggesting any expansion of authority, an INS official
Monday night said the new INS pilot program does not include
monitoring which degree a student is pursuing. Eyleen Schmidt, an
INS spokeswoman, said it was ``not included as part of the original
CIPRIS pilot, and at this point, there are not plans to include
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said the panel had, in its recommendation, interpreted
immigration law differently from the INS. One of the elements the
INS tracks is the ``current academic status'' of a student, which
it defines as whether a student is in school full-time. The panel,
she said, would redefine that term to include which program a
student was enrolled in.
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, said Vince Cannistraro, former head of the CIA
counter-terrorism unit, the commission was addressing ``a problem
that may not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's intrusive,'' Cannistraro said of the commission's
proposal. ``I don't think it's necessary. The FBI already has all
the authority they need to follow people who are up to no good. If
you put on them the additional burden of tracking every foreign
student in the United States, you run a significant risk of civil
liberties infringements.''

SEC WARNS PURVEYORS OF VARIABLE ANNUITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid a federal examination of the sale of variable
annuities, combinations of mutual funds and insurance, an SEC
regulator on Monday warned that misleading tactics and incomplete
disclosure would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission regulator, Paul F. Roye,
zeroed in on bonuses offered by some companies to attract variable
annuities customers and told an industry group that his agency was
concerned that investors were being given the false impression they
were receiving something for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as a free bonus,'' he said, noting that
bonuses are generally tied to variable annuities with higher fees
and penalties so that the companies selling them eventually get
their money back. Other critics have pointed out that after the
companies had been reimbursed, they continue to receive higher fees
for the life of the investment.
</P>
<P>
   Roye, who is the director of the SEC's Division of Investment
Management, said his agency would take issue with any company that
failed to ``fully and fairly disclose the downside as well as the
upside'' of variable annuities. And while the industry contends
that some buyers benefit from the bonus feature, Roye said that
``increasing sales at the expense of those for whom these products
are not suited will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Roye was addressing several hundred executives of insurance
companies, which produce variable annuities, and of banks and
brokerage firms which, along with financial planners, are the main
sellers of variable annuities.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the National Association for Variable Annuities, said
it welcomed the close scrutiny: ``If anything is going on that
shouldn't be going on, then I think everyone will see that any
improper activity will be stopped,'' said Mark Mackey, the group's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clear that many of the executives listening to Roye's
speech feared that highlighting deceptive practices could put a
crimp in an industry that, while still smaller than the mutual fund
business, has been increasing assets under its control at the rate
of 36 percent a year for several years. In contrast, contributions
to mutual funds have been increasing by about 25 percent a year.
Over time, Americans have invested $1.2 trillion through variable
annuities compared with more than $6.8 trillion through mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' said one executive in the audience. ``I
understand the risk and the problems, but I don't necessarily agree
that the SEC should be doing things this way.''
</P>
<P>
   As Roye spoke, the room was hushed, and when he finished, no one
applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The nationwide examination of variable annuity sales practices,
which is concentrating on the new bonuses, has been under way for
nearly six months. The agency, and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which is also participating, have taken no
action so far. But later this week the managers of SEC offices
around the country are meeting here to review their work on
variable annuities as well as other regulatory matters, moving
closer to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday morning, as part of its consumer education
program, the SEC issued what officials referred to as an ``investor
alert'' to help consumers understand ``the benefits, risks and
costs of variable annuities.''
</P>
<P>
   During a panel discussion on Monday morning, Susan Nash, a
senior assistant director at the SEC, disclosed for the first time
that the agency had examined the records of 52 investment and
insurance companies involved in the sale of variable annuities last
year, partly in the course of routine oversight and partly in
response to complaints. She said 80 percent of the companies were
cited for failure to follow regulations related to sales. Of the
infractions, she said, 20 percent were serious enough to warrant
further investigation and possible penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Other agency officials said the total level of infractions was
about par for the financial services business, including mutual
fund companies and groups of financial advisers. But they said that
usually about 3 percent to 6 percent of the infractions were
regarded as serious. The agency would not name the companies that
were examined, but said those receiving sanctions would be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Roye challenged the insurance companies: ``Ask
yourselves whether your products are designed with investors'
interests in mind or whether they will act as a spur to
inappropriate sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are on the sales side,'' Roye said, ``ask yourself
whether you have safeguards in place to prevent unsuitable sales,
and whether you are taking a second look at transactions that
appear to be unsuitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to recent sanctions against mutual fund companies and
brokerage firms, Roye said: ``We are not sympathetic in problematic
situations when firms either have no'' procedures for safeguarding
investors' interests, or have them ``but do not implement them.''

POST-COLD WAR SUMMIT A BIT CHILLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (editors: Haass is cq) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As President Clinton finished his historic appearance
before the Russian Parliament Monday, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
ultranationalist, leaped up to scream: ``It was a waste of time.
There was no need to invite him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the polite applause from less caustic legislators, by
the end of his three-day visit to the Russian capital, Clinton
himself may have been wondering about the wisdom of tacking the
summit with President Vladimir Putin onto his frequently amended
European itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin clearly did not establish the warm
relationship that grew up almost immediately between the U.S.
leader and former Russian President Boris Yeltsin _ two
larger-than-life, natural-born politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there a major breakthrough on the agenda-topping issue
of the prospective U.S. anti-missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   In the not-too-distant days of Cold War summitry, that could
have been a dire, world-shaking, market-moving disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current geopolitical scheme of things, the equivocal
outcome of the first major Clinton-Putin sit-down was not even
necessarily a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong in moving slowly on the anti-missile
front, in the view of a number of U.S. and European defense
specialists, especially given the Clinton administration's strong
advocacy of the Alaska-only siting of the system. Analysts believe
alternative siting proposals, including a sea-based system, have
been given extraordinarily short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would have welcomed a more substantive outcome, but
Western analysts had cautioned against make-work deals with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a moment for great accomplishments,'' said Richard
Haass, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings
Institution in Washington. ``Rather, it's part of a continuing
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just meeting to stay in touch,'' said John Hulsman,
senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a point the Clinton administration, facing a summit with
minimal results, had virtually conceded before leaving home. Sandy
Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said Clinton's
entourage was seeking ``some greater degree of understanding'' with
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has all but banned the word ``legacy'' from the
White House, there is little doubt he has his eyes on the history
books. And he is on his way to becoming the first U.S. president
since Gerald Ford not to complete a bilateral arms-control deal
with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Haass, pointing out that Clinton is ``15/16ths'' through his
term, warned that ``this is not a time for great legacy-building''
based on last-minute deals.
</P>
<P>
   More conservative analysts, such as the Heritage Foundation's
Kim Holmes, question even the continuing emphasis on U.S.-Russian
summitry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole strategic relationship is, in some ways, a relic of
the Cold War,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was having none of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find any future apart from cooperation with you in the
nuclear area inconceivable,'' Clinton, the first U.S. president to
address the Russian Parliament, told legislators Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's said his message was that it was not for the United
States to tell Russia how to run itself, but he spent much of his
45-minute address doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered the lawmakers what has become boiler-plate
advice in remarks to foreign parliaments, urging nations to work
together to solve the challenges of economic globalization, wider
democratization and environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   For Russia, he particularized the message to call for passage of
an equitable tax code and guarantees on private property to attract
outside investment, which he said the nation needed more than aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have a sense of responsibility for the future,''
Clinton said. ``We are not destined to be adversaries, but it is
not guaranteed that we will be allies. For us there is no fate
waiting to be revealed, only a future waiting to be created, by the
actions we take, the choices we make and the genuine views we have
of one another and of our future.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Clinton made a quick trip to the Kremlin to
bid farewell to Putin _ he is to see him at least three more times
this year _ and then visited Yeltsin at his home outside Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in good spirits,'' Clinton said of his long-time
interlocutor. When a reporter, referring to Yeltsin's well-known
drinking, asked ``Which spirits exactly?'' Clinton laughing
replied, ``No spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin often met without a major agreement to sign,
and the American, earlier in his weeklong European tour, spoke out
against saving summits until a big deal was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't only do these trips and these dialogues when we
know we've got a guaranteed outcome,'' Clinton said in Lisbon,
Portugal. ``Sometimes it's most important to be talking when
there's still unresolved differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton found Putin ``frank and open.'' In translation, at
least, the new Russian leader seemed largely devoid of the musty
obfuscations that encrusted the discourse of many leaders who grew
up in the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin also lacked the back-slapping bonhomie of Yeltsin, who
picked the 47-year-old ex-spy out of the Kremlin chorus line of
bureaucrats and thrust him into the nation's top job with an early
retirement last New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Any White House fixation on personal relations between the two
presidents has long been criticized by analysts. Holmes called it
``one of the mistakes'' of the Clinton years ``to personalize our
relationship with Russia through the support for the president in
power _ more or less equating that president with democracy by
saying the alternatives are worse, therefore, we have no choice but
to support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the traffic tie-ups as motorcades zip around central
Moscow, ordinary Russians have become blase about summitry.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction outside the Parliament building near Red Square was
muted. A couple of old-line communists waved hammer-and-sickle
flags of the Soviet Union, and there were a couple of rude signs.
One retro soul shouted: ``Yankee, go home!''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential schedulers possibly should re-examine the wisdom of
putting the most important part of a trip at the end of the
itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was clearly weary as he delivered his speech to the
Russian legislators.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Duma member was struck by Clinton's almost wistful,
nostalgic tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a farewell address to Russia,'' said Andrei
Kokoshin, a centrist parliamentarian.

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The board of Bestfoods met Monday night to discuss a
sweetened takeover offer of about $20 billion, or $72 a share, from
Unilever amid increasing pressure from shareholders to sell the
company.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bestfoods was pursuing a $15 billion purchase
of the Campbell Soup Co., the beleaguered maker of canned soups
that has been struggling to expand its business over the last
several years. One person involved in the talks said the company
would also discuss its options with Campbell at the board meeting,
which may resume Tuesday. Representatives of Campbell and of
Bestfoods refused to comment on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever increased its bid by $6 a share, to $72, Sunday night,
executives said. That offer for the maker of Skippy peanut butter,
Thomas' English muffins, Entenmann's baked goods and Knorr soups
was up from the $61 to $64 originally offered in April. At the
time, the board of Bestfoods unanimously rejected the plan, saying
the price was inadequate and that it did not think it was
``opportune to consider a sale of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Niall FitzGerald and Antony Burgmans, the co-chairmen of
Unilever, arrived in New York on Friday and have been waiting
anxiously for breakthroughs in their bid to acquire Bestfoods.
``They look very tired,'' said a person close to the talks. ``This
is gamesmanship. It's three-dimensional chess, with humans.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month, Burgmans said his company was
surprised that the $66-a-share offer had not brought Bestfoods
executives to the negotiating table. ``What puzzles and amazes
us,'' he said, ``is that at that price, a premium of 34 percent
over what the stock was trading at, they haven't come up to talk to
us.'' The company has seemed unwilling to bid higher, without a
real competitor other than Bestfoods' reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the latest increase will be enough to
make the board budge from its position, although several large
investors said they thought Unilever was headed in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think Bestfoods will end up selling at a price anywhere
from $72 to $75,'' said Alexi Makkas, a principal equity analyst
for State Street Global Advisors in Boston, which, with 5.7 million
shares, is the fourth-largest shareholder of Bestfoods.
``Bestfoods' management team are rational people and they
understand they are not going to be able to get this sort of value
on their own. They have been adamant the entire time about doing
the best thing for shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Unilever in New York said the company would be
making no statements Monday on its attempt to buy Bestfoods.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said that Unilever, whose brands
include Dove, Lipton and Good Humor, had raised its bid for
Bestfoods from $66, first offered in April, to about $72 a share
over the weekend. The actual price had not been fixed, executives
said, because Unilever wanted to first determine whether there were
additional cost savings that might be realized through the merger.
Unilever said it anticipated $500 million in such savings, but in
talks with investors, Bestfoods has asserted that closer to $1
billion could be saved through a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The offer was made in a letter delivered to Bestfoods on Sunday
night, according to a person close to the talks. The letter was
accompanied by a draft contract intended to be a starting point for
negotiations, the person said, adding that top executives from
Unilever and Bestfoods met informally on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Bestfoods' bankers have been discussing merger
possibilities with their counterparts for Campbell. Investors
seemed highly disapproving of any union with Campbell, and drove
down Bestfood's share price Monday in response to reports that the
company was considering such a move. Shares of Bestfoods closed at
$63 Monday, down $2.125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bestfoods has been scrambling for alternatives for the last
month, but I don't see how buying Campbell's is a defense against a
$70-plus all-cash bid,'' said John R. McMillin, an analyst for
Prudential Securities. With a board considered independent, and not
dominated by company insiders, many expect Bestfoods to make a
decision that will provide the biggest payout to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Another shareholder, Barry Goggins of David L. Babson &AMP; Co.,
said a Campbell-Bestfoods union would not play well with investors.
``The Street obviously thinks Bestfoods is ready to do something
defensive,'' he said. ``But with Campbell's problems, I'm wondering
how they can compare this and make it shareholder-friendly,
relative to the Unilever offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Makkus of State Street said that a serious move in the direction
of a Campbell acquisition would be devastating for shareholders,
and for the company. ``If they go out and buy Campbell, the stock
gets crushed and management loses all credibility,'' he said.
``After that, there's no way the stock gets back up to $72.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent increased bid from Unilever does not necessarily
represent a capitulation, said one person close to the talks. ``It
could be interpreted as bidding against yourself, or it could be
interpreted as paying more for more synergies,'' the person said.
``Unilever on this occasion is more likely to walk away than to
engage in further debate on the subject.''

AFTER SEVEN YEARS, A COUPLE FACES DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SCOTUS-GRANDPARENTS)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Wash. _ For seven years, through three tiers of
the court system, Gary and Jenifer Troxel have been trying to win
the legal right to have extended visits with their grandchildren.
Monday, after a divided United States Supreme Court ruled against
them, the Troxels were left with little but an emotional appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one afternoon a month is what we get, we'll be happy with
that,'' Mrs. Troxel. ``We miss them. They're still a part of our
family.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few hours a month _ which was the original offer of the
parents that set the Troxels off on a legal trek that galvanized
retirement groups on their side and parents' rights organizations
on the other _ may not even be in the offing now, the parents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a huge waste of time, money and emotion,'' said
Tommie Wynn, the mother of the two children at the center of this
case. ``I'm relieved we finally won. It's a victory for every
parent in the country. But I'm just not sure what we'll do as far
as their request for visits.''
</P>
<P>
   The case that pitted a pair of 60-year-old grandparents, one of
whom claims an asterisk in rock 'n' roll history, against the
mother who was never legally tied to the Troxel family, dates to
1993 when Brad Troxel, father of the two children, committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Troxel and the children's mother, then known as Tommie
Granville, were never married; Brad lived at home with his parents.
After the suicide, when the mother tried to limit the time the
grandparents could spend with their two children, the Troxels went
to court and were granted visits one weekend a month and for one
week during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels have been married 35 years, and have three other
children and 10 grandchildren. Gary Troxel, a longshoreman, was a
founding member of the rock band the Fleetwoods, which recorded
hits like ``Come Softly to Me'' and ``Mr. Blue.'' In his house in
the Skagit Valley north of Seattle are two gold records for the
songs, and he still performs with the group on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary was quite well known in the music world, and these girls
have a right to know him,'' said Mrs. Troxel. The grandchildren,
both girls, are 8 and 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute was not about whether the grandparents had the right
to visit but rather boiled down to exactly how much time they could
have with their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   When Tommie Granville married, she tried to limit the visits.
She offered them one afternoon a month, both sides said. But the
Troxels wanted overnight stays. They were backed by a Washington
state law that allows ``any person'' the right to visit when it
serves a child's best interest.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wynn said there never would have been a problem if the
Troxels had not insisted on extended visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were never denied visitation,'' she said. ``It was a
control decision. These people became like the Elian Gonzalez
relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wynn has eight children, six of whom live at home with her
in Anacortes, just a few miles from the Troxels.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in its ruling Monday, said the Washington law
allowing third-party visits was ``breathtakingly broad.'' The
Washington State Supreme Court also ruled against the Troxels, and
it was the grandparents' appeal of the latest Washington state
ruling that led to Monday's high-court decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels' lawyer, Mark D. Olson, said he was ``heartened by
the decision'' because it did not throw out laws that allow
grandparents the right to visit, but only knocked out the
foundation of the Washington statute.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the grandparents did not have a new legal
strategy for enforcing visits. ``Frankly, the Troxels will take any
time they can get,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Carmen Dell'Orefice was 15 and modeling to help
her mother pay the rent on a Third Avenue walk-up, she made a visit
to the 57th Street studio of Louise Dahl-Wolfe. At the time, 1946,
Dahl-Wolfe, 51, was in her 10th year as the reigning photographer
at Harper's Bazaar and her umpteenth as a woman who looked like a
home economics teacher at a girls' reform school.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seemed ancient,'' Dell'Orefice recalled a few weeks ago.
``The first thing she said to me was, `Your mother shouldn't let
you wear makeup.''' When Dell'Orefice answered that she wasn't
wearing any, the photographer dragged her to a window and pinched
her eyelashes for proof. Finally, Dell'Orefice was sent home on the
grounds that she was too young to stand in front of a tripod for
money, or at least too young for Bazaar's older readers. Not long
after, she appeared on the cover of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Dahl-Wolfe would see dozens of models rise and fall
before she died 43 years later, in 1989, at 94. On June 12, the
Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology will present the
first full-scale retrospective of her work, little of which points
to the kind of benighted sensibility her behavior, and a hair bun
slathered with beeswax, might have led one to expect.
</P>
<P>
   Curated by Irving Solero and Nan Richardson, the exhibition will
run through Aug. 12 and move to the Center for Creative Photography
in Tucson in September. A companion book by Richardson, ``Louise
Dahl-Wolfe: A Retrospective,'' is due from Harry N. Abrams this
summer. Some of Dahl-Wolfe's black-and-white images are on view at
the Staley-Wise gallery.
</P>
<P>
   During her time at Bazaar, a 22-year tenure that ended when she
quit in 1958, after the magazine's editor, Carmel Snow, and the
legendary art director Alexey Brodovitch both resigned, Dahl-Wolfe
chronicled the birth of a looser, less pinched spirit in American
fashion. With Diana Vreeland as her fashion editor, Dahl-Wolfe
traveled around the world, shooting that new concept, sportswear,
out of doors where it comfortably breathed. Before the triumvirate
of Snow, Vreeland and Dahl-Wolfe, American style, as Richard Avedon
has put it, did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louise has a pivotal role moving fashion photography out of
formal studio work into a portrayal of the active, modern American
woman,'' Amy Rule, an archivist at the Center for Creative
Photography, said.
</P>
<P>
   Other photographers, like Martin Munkacsi and Toni Frissell,
were already capturing the new mood, but Dahl-Wolfe distinguished
herself with images that implied a languorous sexuality. She often
photographed models on the beach, in repose, their eyes closed or
averted, their bodies positioned _ trapped _ rigidly in the frame.
Dahl-Wolfe seemed to realize that new sportswear by Claire
McCardell and Bonnie Cashin offered women the semblance of an
unconstricted life, not the real freedom that only a challenge to
accepted social arrangements could bring.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a Norwegian marine engineer, Louise Dahl was
born in San Francisco in 1895 and showed no tendencies during her
young womanhood to live within the narrow corridor of risk laid out
for her sex. After studying art in San Francisco, she moved to New
York to take classes in architecture and design. In 1927, she
embarked on a tour of Europe with her friend Consuela Kanaga, a
news photographer. A year went by, and when the women were bored
with the Continent they headed for North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a train platform in Tunisia in 1928 that Dahl, 32,
spotted her future husband, a sculptor from Tennessee named Meyer
Wolfe. ``She saw him,'' Irving Solero, who befriended Dahl-Wolfe in
1978, recalled, ``and said, `That's for me.''' The two married that
same year.
</P>
<P>
   Without fail, those who knew Dahl-Wolfe remark on the intense
bond she and her husband shared. ``They lived together nonstop, 24
hours a day,'' said Solero, who spent time with the couple in their
Frenchtown, N.J., home, known as the Creamery. ``They fought all
the time, but a fight would erupt for five seconds and then it was
over.'' Wolfe would travel with his wife, typically picking her up
for lunch during out-of-town shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he died at 88 she was self-abandoned,'' Mary Jane
Russell, a friend and favorite model of Dahl-Wolfe's, said
recently. ``Her mourning was coupled with anger: `How could he have
left me? Why couldn't I be first?'''
</P>
<P>
   While she was close to Russell, her relationships with others in
the Harper's Bazaar orbit were more complex. Well into the '70s and
'80s, Dahl-Wolfe would talk about her former colleague Avedon ``as
though he were a kid,'' Solero said, adding, ``She'd say, `He has a
long way to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Bassman, whose impressionistic photographs began
appearing in Bazaar around 1950, said that Dahl-Wolfe repeatedly
tried to have her fired. In the mid-'40s, when Bassman was still
working in the magazine's art department as an apprentice, Carmel
Snow sent her to Paris to try to find photographers who had worked
for Bazaar before the war. Dahl-Wolfe was so irritated at the
prospect of competition, Bassman said, that she complained to Snow
that the art-director-in-training had been maligning her. Snow
swiftly dispatched Bassman to the country and out of the way. ``It
was a testimony to Louise's stature at the magazine,'' Bassman
said. After that, their relationship was ``a mess,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   With underlings in the fashion department, Dahl-Wolfe often
played the taskmaster. Some 50 years ago, the fashion editor Polly
Mellen traveled to Jamaica with Dahl-Wolfe for a shoot and recalled
waking up every morning at 4:30 to braid the hair that would
eventually be cranked into the photographer's signature bun. ``In
my growing years, she was one of the few people who really formed
me,'' Mellen said. ``She taught me extreme discipline.'' And
demonstrated a certain largesse as well. When Mellen left Bazaar to
marry in 1952, Dahl-Wolfe gave her a going-away party and took her
wedding pictures. ``If she was on your side, you were most
fortunate,'' Mellen said.
</P>
<P>
   After Dahl-Wolfe left Bazaar, she worked briefly for Vogue
before relinquishing photography in 1960, saying that advertisers
had gained too much influence over magazines. But however
frustrated she had become with what she saw as the
commercialization of magazines, she was never the sort who demanded
that some notion of artistic vision take precedence over the
business of showing off clothes. One hallmark of her thousands of
published images, 86 Bazaar covers among them, is that the gowns
and bathing suits and ski clothes are always visible front and
center. ``She worked for the magazine because she showed the
frocks,'' said Martin Harrison, a curator and historian of
photography. ``The models were good-looking, and it was a great
time for American fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Harrison, a detractor, admits that Dahl-Wolfe had a talent
for color. In her effort to show garments to their best advantage,
she would typically go to the printing press where Bazaar was
churned out and nudge engravers to change a blue backdrop to, say,
a yellow one if it made a dress look better. ``It was almost as if
she were a set designer,'' said Christopher Greene, who produced
prints from Dahl-Wolfe's negatives late in her life.
</P>
<P>
   While Dahl-Wolfe might flinch at the sort of images that today
fill the pages of avant-garde fashion magazines like Dazed and
Confused, the striking, saturated colors that are their trademark
hark back, in some sense, to her. Before the rise of digital
technology, it was impossible to reproduce prints from Dahl-Wolfe's
Kodachromes that resembled what appeared on the printed page.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason, said Richardson, the Fashion Institute
curator, that a coffee-table book of her work has never been
published before.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Dahl-Wolfe always thought the notion rather
flashy and pretentious.

 &HT;    Lewis accepts misdemeanor, gets probation
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard paused in a hallway
to sum up why he decided to cut murder defendant Ray Lewis loose on
misdemeanor charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trial is about getting to the truth,'' he said. ``Sometimes
it comes in strange ways.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the understatement of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized roundly by many for rushing to ``overcharge'' Lewis
and trying a case fraught with flip-flopping witnesses and scant
direct evidence, Howard had to shore up his flagging case. After
two weeks of testimony, courtroom observers had been on somewhat of
a death watch of the Lewis prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   A directed verdict _ where the judge throws out the charges
before the case reaches the jury _ would have been a huge
embarrassment to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case was going down the tubes,'' said prominent criminal
defense attorney Jerry Froelich, who has closely watched the trial.
``They should have cut this deal a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said election-year political pressure did not cause him
to back off Lewis. ``I thought about the two dead boys'' in
deciding to cut a deal with Lewis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard insists those who criticize him for indicting the case
too quickly were ``dead wrong.'' He credits the quick indictment,
and the ensuing speedy trial, with bringing the issue to a head.
And those factors ultimately may help solve the case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Howard admitted he had been ``disappointed''
with and ``surprised'' by the changing testimony of some of the
prosecution witnesses he called to the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, attorney for former co-defendant Reginald Oakley,
said Lewis, the prosecution's new star witness, has zero
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state just finished proving he's a liar; now they're
saying, `He's our liar,''' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of
justice and will be sentenced to 12 months' probation and pay
one-third of the court costs of his prosecution. Lewis' lawyers
said that could total $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also will be sentenced under the First Offender Act, where
his charges will be expunged if he stays out of trouble during his
probation. ``It was as if it never happened,'' said Lewis' attorney
Ed Garland.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction charge stems from Lewis' telling his limo
passengers to keep their mouths shut and giving an ``incomplete''
statement to police, Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   The murder and aggravated
</P>
<P>
   (salinity) Please see LEWIS, B4
</P>
<P>
   assault charges against Lewis were dropped in exchange for him
testifying as to what he saw Jan. 31 when Jacinth Baker, 21, and
Richard Lollar, 24, both of Decatur, were stabbed to death. The men
died after a night of post-Super Bowl partying when they brawled
with the passengers in Lewis' rented Lincoln Navigator limousine.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is expected to say he saw his co-defendants fighting, as
well as another unidicted limo passenger, Carlos Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Thomas, Stafford's attorney, said he has heard that Lewis
has told investigators that Stafford was involved in the deadly
melee. Thomas said his client may have inadvertently kicked a
victim but was acting as a peacemaker. He denied his client hit
Baker with a champagne bottle, something Lewis has allegedly told
prosecutors. Howard said the victims' families were split in their
reaction to the deal. ``One family understood, the other had some
reservations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charita Lollar, a cousin of one of the victims, was angered by
the decision. ``In Atlanta if you have money. . . you'll walk out
of here and play football,'' she said. Howard said he took the case
to the grand jury based on statements made to him by limo driver
Duane Fassett, who failed to deliver expected key testimony two
weeks ago. Fassett backed off a statement that he saw Lewis hit a
victim and that he overheard co-defendants Oakley, 31, of Baltmore,
and Joseph Sweeting, 34, of Miami, admit to stabbing the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised by the way they testified,'' said Howard,
describing Fassett and other witnesses. ``We would have acted
differently'' in pursuing the murder indictment against Lewis, had
he knew Fassett would waver.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he had made a pre-trial trip to Baltimore where he
sat down and looked Fassett ``eye to eye'' to gauge his
credibility. Howard said he will not continue to pursue Fassett to
force him to testify again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lewis is not guilty of murder, then the system ultimately
worked, (although) it may not be pretty,'' said J. Tom Morgan,
district attorney of DeKalb County. ``Prosecutors all the time cut
deals with those who are the least culpable to get those most
culpable. Usually it's not in the middle of a trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland said he had fielded other offers from Howard to cut a
deal, refusing them until the latest deal came.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial, Howard offered Lewis a chance to plead guilty
to aggravated assault with a recommended sentence of three years in
prison plus seven more on probation, Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   But Garland flatly rejected that deal because Lewis was never
going to admit he played any role in the fight. ``It didn't matter
what they offered in exchange for aggravated assault,'' Garland
said. ``He was not going to admit having anything to do with
injuring people.''
</P>
<P>
   Garland said he was driving to the office Sunday morning when
Howard called saying he wanted to talk. Garland returned home to
his Buckhead mansion where he and co-counsel Don Samuel met Howard
and Assistant District Attorney Clint Rucker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredibly relaxed,'' Samuel recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was made and later that day a call was put into
Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner, who tentatively approved it.
Lewis then gave a videotaped statement.
</P>
<P>
   The offer of reducing two murder charges to a misdemeanor with
no time to serve was too good to pass up, even though Garland was
convinced his client would be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is sure what a jury will do,'' Garland said. ``But with
this deal, we can't do any better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Garland praised Howard's ``courage'' for making the deal,
he also contended the whole matter could have been avoided.
</P>
<P>
   The dealings between Lewis' camp and prosecutors have been rough
from the start.
</P>
<P>
   The lines were drawn even between Garland and Atlanta police
after Lewis was arrested and jailed for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Garland had held news conferences proclaiming his client's
innocence, accusing authorities of a rush to judgment and saying
police didn't know the whole story. He said he'd called the
district attorney's office to offer information on Lewis' behalf
but couldn't get his calls returned.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Feb. 8, Atlanta Police Sgt. Keith Meadows called
Garland, asking the lawyer to identify passengers in the limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I need to have some dialogue with you and someone from
the D.A.'s Office,'' Garland said, according to Meadow's account
turned over to the defense in pre-trial discovery. ``If you want
these names we all need to discuss a bond for my client or some
kind of deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meadows said he was investigating a homicide and would not
take part in discussing deals or bonds. Garland became ``irate,''
Meadows wrote in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess you have your case and that's it, you're not
interested in these witnesses,'' Garland said, according to
Meadows. ``If we can't sit down and have some dialogue I'll just
bring my witnesses to court.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Lewis was indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Splits in the defense camps were evident last week, especially
when Lewis' attorneys fought successfully against the introduction
of a witness statement that called Oakley ``a fall guy'' who needed
to worry because ``Lewis has the money and resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey complained to the judge when jurors heard testimony from
a detective who said Lewis told him he was ``with the wrong
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the remaining defendants differed Monday when asked
by Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner if they wanted to trial to
continue right away.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, wanted a continuance to Tuesday to assess Lewis'
statement and to ready themselves to cross examine him.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeting's attorney, Steve Sadow, wanted Lewis to testify right
away. To continue the case, even for a day, ``gives the state a
little more time to get it's case together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner sent the jury home Monday morning without hearing any
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Sadow believed his client, Sweeting, was close to getting his
charges dropped on a directed verdict from the judge or at least
was on his way to an acquital. Harvey is expected to argue his
client was knocked semi-conscious by the bottle and dropped a knife
at the scene. Jessica Robertson, a limo passenger who has spent
much of the week with Lewis, told police she overheard Oakley say
he dropped a knife during the fight.
</P>
<P>
   A knife was found at the scene with no blood on it. Harvey will
argue that his client may have been involved in the fight but
stabbed nobody and will argue that one of the other limo passengers
did so.

CHRISTOPHER REEVE TRIES THERAPY TO ENABLE BREATHING WITHOUT
VENTILATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DORIS CHANDLER   
 The Gainesville Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ University of Florida rehabilitation experts
are consulting with paralyzed actor Christopher Reeve and his
medical team on therapy designed to help him spend less time on a
ventilator and more time breathing on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve has followed a training program for six months that has
been used in the past four years to successfully wean certain
long-term ventilator patients off the machine or to decrease their
dependency on it.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve uses a small spring-loaded device that provides, in
practical terms, weight training for the breathing muscles, said
Danny Martin, associate professor of physical therapy with the
university's College of Health Professions.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Paul Davenport, professor of physiological sciences
and a specialist in respiratory physiology at the College of
Veterinary Medicine, met with Reeve in his Bedford, N.Y., home in
December to discuss the program. Since then, Martin and Davenport
have consulted regularly by telephone with Reeve and his pulmonary
medical team, which oversees the training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not originate this idea of training patients that are
on ventilators. We modified a program that had been in use a decade
ago,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The device is placed on the tracheotomy breathing tube in
Reeve's throat, and he has to breathe, generating sufficient
pressure to open the spring and take in air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set the pressures at appropriate levels to build up his
strength, and then couple that with increasing periods of time
where he is breathing on his own, without any ventilator support
whatsoever,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve is progressing, albeit slowly, since beginning the
muscle-strengthening exercises, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve was the first patient with a spinal cord injury to
participate in this training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can generate spontaneous breath, otherwise he couldn't
train, so there obviously was a sufficient sparing of his spinal
cord,'' said Davenport. Apparently enough descending nerve fibers
were still intact after the injury to allow Reeve to breathe on his
own, Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our goal, then, with any patient that has that kind of
sparing is to increase the power of what's there. Part of his
muscle weakness is disuse. Part of it is a loss of conductions from
the place _ the brain stem _ that produces the signal to breath and
the actual nerves that make the muscles contract,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind breathing is the brain stem, which
sends signals through connections in the spinal cord to the nerve
cells that drive the pump that makes us breathe, Davenport said.
The body breathes in oxygen, which is metabolized and the
by-product _ carbon dioxide _ is exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take a patient off the ventilator and they are not
breathing, their carbon dioxide is going up and their oxygen level
will fall until that stimulates the brain stem to say, `We've got
work to do,' and then they will start breathing. That will kick the
system in and rev the engine up, and away the pumping goes,''
Davenport explained.
</P>
<P>
   It will be many months, possibly a year or more at Reeve's
current rate of progress to reach a level where he experiences real
functional breathing off the ventilator, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming slowly, and really, from the very first meeting,
we told him we didn't know how far he was going to advance or if he
was going to advance at all,'' Martin said. ``He reassesses on a
regular basis whether or not he wants to continue, so we're six
months into the process and he still feels like he's making
sufficient progress to continue. We agree with his assessment of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every patient on a ventilator is a candidate for this type
of rehabilitation therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term ventilator subjects like coma patients, patients who
have progressive diseases like Lou Gehrig's disease, or patients in
the advanced stages of multiple sclerosis and certain other
neurological diseases would not be candidates for this type of
program, Martin said.

JUSTICES SET ASIDE TEXAS DEATH CASE OVER POSSIBLE RACIAL BIAS 

</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday set aside the
death sentence of a Texas killer whom state prosecutors said might
have been condemned because he is Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, in a statement Monday, said
the capital case the justices sent back for resentencing might be
part of a larger state problem of convicts being sentenced to death
in part because they are black or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas audit of criminal trials has uncovered eight cases in
which prosecutors might have used testimony that equated being
black or Hispanic with a propensity for violence to secure a death
sentence, Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Supreme Court case, the justices told Texas judges to
reconsider Victor Hugo Saldano's death sentence, which was based in
part on pre-sentencing testimony that the Argentine national poses
a continuing threat of violence because he is Hispanic. Cornyn had
urged the high court to order a new sentencing hearing, saying the
jury had improperly been told to consider Saldano's race before
recommending that he be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, ``future dangerousness'' is regarded as an
aggravating circumstance that could lead a jury to recommend a
killer be executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the use of race in Saldano's sentencing seriously
undermined the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the
judicial process, Texas confesses error and agrees that Saldano is
entitled to a new sentencing hearing,'' Cornyn wrote in a legal
brief to the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's office declined to disclose where any of the eight
capital cases were decided, but said the audit's findings will be
released by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to vigilantly monitor all death-penalty
cases,'' Cornyn said. ``Our goal is to assure the people of Texas
that our criminal justice system is fairly administered.''
</P>
<P>
   Saldano's appellate attorney, Stanley Schneider of Houston,
welcomed the high court's action and called it ``absolutely
shocking ... that anyone in 1996 (when Saldano was sentenced) would
even dream of introducing a person's race as a factor in
life-or-death decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Saldano was convicted of the kidnapping and killing of Paul King
in an isolated area north of Dallas. Saldano, who took King at
gunpoint from a grocery store, shot him five times and stole his
wallet and watch.
</P>
<P>
   At sentencing, clinical psychologist Walter Quijano testified
that Saldano's Hispanic heritage made it likely he was a threat for
future dangerousness. Quijano added that Hispanics and blacks are
over-represented in the prison population.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors then cited Quijano's testimony in successfully
pressing the jury to recommend a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals upheld the execution order,
saying that using race as a factor at sentencing did not constitute
``fundamental error'' by the trial court.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, Saldano's attorney, urged the justices to set aside
the death sentence, calling it ``fundamentally unfair for the
prosecution to use racial and ethnic stereotypes in order to obtain
a death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, in pressing for a new sentencing hearing, expressed
confidence that a jury would again recommend that Saldano be
executed. Saldano's ``random, callous, cruel and bold'' killing of
King warranted the death penalty, Cornyn wrote in his legal brief
to the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina and the governments of about 10 other Latin American
countries urged the high court to throw out the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to imagine many constitutional errors that
would strike as serious a blow to the fairness and integrity of
judicial proceedings as those of allowing the state to use a
capital jury to impose the death penalty based on the notion that a
member of a certain racial or ethnic group is automatically likely
to be more violent or dangerous than others,'' Houston attorney
Scott Atlas wrote to the justices on behalf of the foreign
governments.

 &HT;    Lewis a hero back home in Baltimore
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the sports Webs to the radio stations, the crab houses to
the fan clubs, Baltimore welcomed Monday the imminent return of
football hero Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sigh of civic relief from some, and a collective
urge to put behind this sorry southern affair which sullied more
than just a newly native son. There was also a palpable
``I-told-you-so'' current of public opinion which castigated
official Atlanta's rush to judgment when, it turns out, the
evidence against Lewis was as weak as Monday's rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy for him. I don't think he did it,'' said Ange
Jordan, who works at the Windsor Inn Crab House west of downtown
Baltimore. ``Your (officials) followed the letter of the law too
seriously. This situation seemed a little too vague for the letter
of the law. But I'm not a lawyer. I'm just a barkeep.''
</P>
<P>
   It was to a private dining room at the Windsor Inn that Lewis
and fellow Raven football players would retire Monday evenings for
Baltimore's trademark crab cakes and cold beer. But the NFL's best
linebacker isn't expected to soon return to the favored haunt. Fans
predict he'll opt instead for a quiet life beyond the media
spotlight in his Owings Mills mansion.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't keeping staunch supporters from planning a
homecoming of sorts. Larry Young, a popular radio host and former
Maryland state legislator, hopes to hold a community prayer service
for Lewis this Saturday at the New Shiloh Baptist Church in west
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   To Young, Lewis represents more than just the latest in a long
line of Baltimore sports icons which runs from Babe Ruth through
Johnny Unitas to Cal Ripken. Lewis is black, and, Young points out,
he beat a criminal justice system too often allied against people
of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that a majority of whites thought Ray was
innocent, but certainly a majority of blacks in the community
did,'' said Young, whose morning radio show followed closely the
Buckhead murder trial. ``Some hope that Ray will be mindful that
(blacks) have stood with him. I proudly said to them that I don't
expect that to be a problem. ... We said he's innocent and the case
bore us out. That gives the Afro-American community bragging
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lewis' return isn't without tarnish. He pled guilty Monday
to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice for lying and
misleading Atlanta police and prosecutors investigating the murders
of Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar. Today, as part of his plea
bargain, Lewis is expected to testify against former friends and
co-defendants Reginald Oakley and Joseph Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks will be saying, `Well, he's a snitch, a
turncoat,' '' said Doug Phillips, president of the Ravens Nest Fan
Club who has proudly owned season tickets to the Ravens and former
Colts since 1975. ``But he kept his mouth shut at the beginning, I
guess, because he was scared. Now, he realizes he better do some
talking or else he could get in some real trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of fans spun ``Ray-is-vindicated'' messages on Phillips'
Web site Monday. One missive, from ``bigravensfan'' read: ``May the
guilty be punished and may we all move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet. While team officials welcome Lewis' return to a
voluntary practice next week, the NFL might impose a fine and/or a
suspension on Lewis.

   The Federal Communications Commission approved AT&AMP;T's
acquisition of MediaOne after ordering the companies to sell some
of their assets, clearing the final obstacle to a merger that will
create the nation's largest provider of cable television,
long-distance telephone service and high-speed Internet access. The
FCC gave the companies a choice of which programming and cable
subsidiaries and investments to sell to comply with a rule that
forbids a corporation from having interests in more than 30 percent
of the nation's cable and satellite television market. Officials
estimate that, without any divestitures, AT&AMP;T and MediaOne would
control more than 40 percent of that market.

GORE ENVISIONS A GOVERNMENT WITH ALL ITS SERVICES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ In a populist spirit, Vice President Al Gore on
Monday proposed putting nearly all federal services online so that
citizens do not have to wait in line or at their mail boxes to do
things such as receive their Social Security benefits, apply for a
federal home loan or report a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous activities are now possible online, such as applying
for student loans and paying taxes. Gore would expand those
services, so that, for example, the six million companies that now
file quarterly Social Security payments through the United States
mail on behalf of their workers could do so online.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the plan could go into effect by 2003. It would cost
$100 million, but Gore aides said it would more than pay for itself
with savings in paperwork. And as part of his plan to bring the
government up to Internet speed, Gore proposed giving everyone an
encrypted ``digital certificate'' to gain access to their own
information and ensure their privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual town square that Gore envisions would also allow the
government to make its vast purchases on the Internet and to
auction off surplus equipment, using a site called ``g-bay,'' a
play on the concept of ``eBay'' that drew chuckles from his
audience of about 100 people at North Carolina State University's
Centennial Campus, part of the 7,000-acre Research Triangle Park.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal fit with the campaign's recent strategy, in which
Gore is putting forth positive ideas and avoiding the negative
attacks against his rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, that have
marked much of his post-primary period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concentrating on my own vision of America's future and
what we can do together,'' he told reporters after his speech as he
flew on his airplane to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at the Supper Club in midtown Manhattan, Gore joined a
bevy of Democrats to celebrate the 70th birthday of Rep. Charles
Rangel of Harlem. The evening raised $2.6 million for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The money came from two events _ a reception with 70 people, who
paid up to $1,000 apiece, at the Supper Club, and a dinner with 250
people who paid $5,000 apiece at the union headquarters of the
Service Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 200 people applauded Gore, Hillary Rodham Clinton,
the Democratic Senate candidate; Rep. Dick Gephardt, minority
leader; Rep. Patrick Kennedy, chairman of the House Democratic
re-election campaign; and Dennis Rivera, president of the local
service employees union, one of the most powerful in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton paid homage to Rangel, who has been stumping across the
country for House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the days when her Senate candidacy seemed an
improbable rumor, Clinton noted: ``Maybe earlier than many, I began
to just do whatever Charlie told me to.'' She added: ``And so when
people said, ``Well, you know, gee, are you going to run for the
Senate in New York?' I said, well, Charlie told me I should, so
here I am, and I'm very happy I am because I'm having the time of
my life.''

MANAGER, COACH ACCUSED OF GIVING BEER TO LITTLE LEAGUERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, Texas _ Sheriff's deputies are investigating whether a
Little League manager and assistant coach gave beer to 9-year-old
players returning from an outing to a Houston Astros baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents also reported that the ride home in a limousine
included a stop at a strip club parking lot where a picture of the
team, the Angels, was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Fe Little League directors removed the titles of the two
adults after reports of the May 26 post-season trip to Enron Field
began coming in from parents of the children involved, league
president Kevin Chaffin said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, assistant coach and another adult _ all parents of
team members _ took about a dozen boys to see the Astros play the
Atlanta Braves, said Chaffin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find the actions deplorable,'' he said. ``They are no
longer a manager and assistant coach in our Little League.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaffin declined to reveal the names of the adults involved in
the incident while the investigation is going on.
</P>
<P>
   The trip was not Little League-sponsored, Chaffin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a team party,'' he said. ``The parent had bought
tickets and rented a stretch limousine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galveston County Sheriff's Department reported that some
accounts of the trip indicate the boys were encouraged to drink
real beer, but others said the beverage may have been so-called
non-alcoholic beer.
</P>
<P>
   Players told their parents they had their photograph taken with
Heartbreakers, a large strip club just off Interstate 45 in
Dickinson, Texas, in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Chaffin said he and other Little League board members ousted the
assistant coach and manager immediately after interviewing the
assistant coach about the trip. He refused to say what the coach
told them.
</P>
<P>
   Chaffin said he has heard accounts that the boys were given
beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcoholic or non-alcoholic, that's not what you want to teach
9-year-old little boys,'' he said. ``It was very bad judgment on
the adults' parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not tolerate it,'' added Chaffin, a petrochemical
plant process operator in his first year as Santa Fe Little League
president.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Maj. Freddie Poor said Monday that the case will be
referred to the Galveston County District Attorney's office for
possible charges against the adults involved after the
investigation is completed.

CENSUS WAR SHIFTS TO STATES, WHERE COUNTING HEADS WINS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Ariz., Colo., Kan., Va., La., Utah, Mich., Pa.)  (ADDS year of Supreme Court decision in 9th graf)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Congress and the Clinton administration in a
stalemate over whether or not to rely solely on traditional
counting methods in the 2000 census, Republicans have quietly moved
the battle over the decennial head count from Washington to state
capitals.
</P>
<P>
   At the prompting of state party leaders, the
Republican-controlled New Jersey Assembly approved a bill Monday
night mandating that the state use only census data derived from
mailed-in census forms, door-to-door canvassers or other
traditional means when it redraws congressional and state
legislative lines. The measure passed 42-34, with Republicans and
Democrats voting along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau and Democrats argue that such traditional
counting methods should be supplemented by data obtained from a
randomly selected national sample of 314,000 households. The
information gleaned from these households would be used to adjust
population totals and, Census Bureau officials say, make the census
more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey bill, which both Republicans and Democrats expect
also to pass in the state Senate would, if signed by Gov. Christie
Whitman, make New Jersey the sixth state to ban the use of census
data that is adjusted using sampling in the redrawing of
congressional and legislative district lines. The other states are
Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Kansas and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Similar measures have been passed in at least one legislative
chamber in Louisiana, Utah and Michigan, and the Pennsylvania
Senate has passed a nonbinding resolution that also prohibits the
use of adjusted data in redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   All the bills have been introduced by Republican state
legislators and votes have followed party lines.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of the fight over statistical sampling to the
states is a deliberate strategy on the part of national leaders of
the Republican Party who felt their prospects of blocking sampling
in Washington were small.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years President Clinton has vetoed bills that would
have prevented the Census Bureau from conducting a census that was
supplemented by statistical sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court gave opponents of sampling only a partial
victory in 1999 when it ruled in that the method could not be used
in determining population counts used in allocating seats in the
House of Representatives among the states, but was silent on
whether sampling could be used to draw lines for legislative
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the Supreme Court decision, the Census Bureau
announced that it would produce two sets of population figures. One
would be used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives
among the states. The other set of numbers could, if the states so
choose, be used to draw congressional and state legislative
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Supreme Court decision, it was decided the prospects
of achieving much more in Washington had basically disappeared,''
said a Republican official who was familiar with the strategy but
who asked not to be identified. He added: ``It was a definite
strategy that once all the progress that could be made in
Washington was done, the idea was to turn it over to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   By adjusting the population counts using numbers from the
national sample, the Census Bureau hopes to avoid a repeat of the
1990 Census when more than 8 million people, mainly minorities,
were missed, and another 4 million people, mainly whites, were
counted twice.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's plans, however, have become the subject of an
intense partisan debate. Republicans fear, and Democrats hope that
adjusting the census count will increase the number of people
living in traditionally Democratic areas. As a result, these areas
may gain seats in state legislatures at the expense of white
suburban or rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey Monday familiar arguments over the legality of
statistical sampling and whether it produces more or less accurate
population figures for small geographic areas _ debating points
that filled the air in Washington in recent years _ echoed in the
halls of the state legislature in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   ``An argument can be made that statistical sampling can be more
accurate on a universal level, say for getting the population of
New Jersey,'' said Michael Patrick Carroll, a Republican from
Morris County who is the chief sponsor of the bill. ``But when
you're trying to get the population of Grove Street in Morristown,
then statistical sampling has a huge margin of error, something
along the lines of 35 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Census officials acknowledge that in some tests that were
conducted before the actual census, population figures derived by
using numbers from a national sample were off by about 35 percent
in some small geographic areas. But these officials say often
figures obtained by traditional counting methods are equally
inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a group of black ministers and African-American and
Hispanic legislators called on Whitman to veto Carroll's measure
when it reaches her desk.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, the Rev. Reginald Jackson, executive
director of the Black Ministers' Council, called the bill
``divisive'' and added that ``it dilutes, lessens and, in fact,
negates the votes of Latinos, African Americans and other
minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter McDonough, a spokesman for Whitman said that the governor
has yet to decide whether she will sign the measure or veto it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not formed an opinion on the bill yet,'' McDonough
said. ``We are waiting to hear more of the debate.''

CAMPAIGN SOFT MONEY ENRICHING DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats and Republicans have almost doubled their
soft-money totals raised four years ago, and House and Senate
candidates set records in the 15 months that ended March 31, the
Federal Election Commission reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee and the party's Senate and
House campaign committees raised $86.4 million in soft money _ the
large, unregulated donations from corporations, unions and wealthy
individuals _ compared with $44.7 million in the 1995-96 period.
For their Democratic counterparts, the total was $77 million
compared with $39.7 million in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   For both parties, the sharpest increases came for their
congressional fund-raising committees. While the Republican
National Committee's total of $41.2 million in soft money was up 38
percent, the National Republican Senatorial Committee's $17.6
million was up 101 percent, and the National Republican
Congressional Committee's $27.5 million was a 183 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   But no Republican Committee approached the growth rate of the
Democratic Senate and House committees, which are aggressively
raising unrestricted donations in a drive to regain control of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Senate Campaign Committee raised $16.5 million in
soft money, up 1,037 percent since 1995-96. The Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee's take rose only half as fast, up
540 percent to $21.9 million. In contrast, the $39.9 million raised
by the Democratic National Committee was only a 14 percent increase
in four years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, rising soft-money contributions to the political
parties sparked controversy. The Democratic National Committee
returned millions of dollars in suspect soft money that came from
overseas donors or from individuals who may not have contributed
their own money. Both parties used soft money for issue advertising
to promote their presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is already an issue for elections this year:
Democrats have blasted Republicans for contributions from tobacco
companies and the National Rifle Association, while Republicans
have criticized Democrats for donations from trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In ``hard money'' donations to party organizations, which are
limited to $20,000 in a calendar year from individuals and $15,000
from political action committees, there were only modest changes
from 1995-96. The three Democratic committees raised $104 million,
up 1 percent. The Republicans raised $179.3 million, down 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties were also about even in hard cash on hand, an
important detail because soft money cannot be used by itself but
must be combined with varying fractions of of hard money in
different states to buy television advertisements, its main use
these days. Republicans had $32.2 million on hand, Democrats had
$31.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to individual candidates in House races,
especially races where no incumbent is running and seats are most
likely to change parties, Republicans held an important advantage.
In open seats, their candidates had raised an average of $165,775.
Democrats in those seats had raised an average of $75,820.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top 30 fund-raisers among Senate candidates, 19 were
Republicans. The overall leader was Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New
York City, a Republican who withdrew from the race last month. He
reported raising $19.3 million, compared with $12.8 million for
Hillary Rodham Clinton, the New York Democratic nominee. She was
second. U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, the Long Island Republican who became
his party's nominee after Giuliani dropped out, but who was still a
House candidate on March 31, was sixth among House candidates, with
$2.1 million raised, but first in cash on hand, with $3.5 million.

SUPREME COURT SLASHES SENTENCES OF DAVIDIANS WHO KILLED ATF AGENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (editors: Rocket Rosen is cq) 
 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Monday substantially reduced
the prison terms of four men convicted of killing federal law
officers at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In their 9-0 decision, the justices said U.S. District Judge
Walter Smith of Waco improperly lengthened the sentences of the men
found guilty of slaying four Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had increased the killers' imprisonment from 10 to 40
years after concluding that they had used automatic weapons to kill
the officers. Under federal law, a judge can add 30 years to a
convicted killer's sentence if the slaying was committed with an
automatic weapon, rather than a less deadly firearm.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court, in striking down Smith's enhanced sentence,
said the type of firearm used is a factual question that a jury
must answer, not a judge. The jury had concluded only that the men
had used firearms before Smith determined on his own that they had
fired automatic weapons, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Halbrook, an attorney for the men, hailed the court's
decision as a reaffirmation of the right of defendants to have
juries, rather than a single judge, decide important factual issues
at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to a jury trial is supreme,'' said Halbrook of
Fairfax, Va. ``That's what distinguishes our legal system from
other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for Kevin Whitecliff, one of the four men, said his
client was ``ecstatic'' with the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good day today,'' said the lawyer, Rocket Rosen of
Houston. ``Justice finally triumphed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, which prosecuted the case, had no
comment on the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The four men, Whitecliff, Jaime Castillo, Brad Branch and Renos
Avraam, are expected to be resentenced to 15 years each in prison,
based on the initial 10-year sentence and a five-year boost that
judges are permitted to impose if any type of firearm is used.
</P>
<P>
   A jury had convicted each of voluntary manslaughter and firearms
possession in the shooting deaths of ATF Agents Steven Willis,
Conway LeBleu, Todd McKeehan and Robert Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth defendant, Graeme Craddock, was convicted of possessing
a destructive device and sentenced to 10 years. Smith had added 10
years to the prison term after concluding that Craddock had
possessed an automatic weapon. His sentence is expected to be cut
to 15 years, based on the initial 10-year sentence and five-year
boost.
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had
upheld Smith's increased sentences last June, prompting the appeal
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling for the men, the high court said Congress never
intended to give judges the authority to decide for themselves
whether a killer used an automatic weapon or a revolver. Instead,
lawmakers made the type of firearm used an element of the crime
that must be determined by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,
Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   The slain ATF officers were part of a team sent Feb. 28, 1993,
to arrest Branch Davidian leader David Koresh on weapons charges at
the cult's compound at Mount Carmel outside of Waco. Twenty-two
other agents were wounded when cult members fired on the officers
during a nearly two-hour gunbattle.
</P>
<P>
   Six Branch Davidians were killed in the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal gunplay was followed by a 51-day standoff between
federal agents and cult members that ended April 19, 1993, when
fire engulfed the compound after FBI agents flooded it with tear
gas. At least 75 Branch Davidians, including Koresh, were killed by
gunfire and the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Branch and Whitecliff had left the compound during the standoff
on March 19, 1993, and were later captured. Castillo, Avraam and
Craddock fled the facility during the final blaze and were caught.
</P>
<P>
   The end to the standoff has sparked an independent federal
investigation into what role, if any, the FBI played in starting
the deadly fire. In addition, cult members who survived and the
relatives of those killed have sued the federal government,
alleging that officials bear culpability for the deaths.

ROUNDUP OF THE DAY'S SUPREME COURT DECISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCOTUS-GRANDPARENTS, SCOTUS-HUBBELL) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The following is a summary of Monday's activities
at the Supreme Court:
</P>
<P>
   Grandparent Visits
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that parents have a ``fundamental right to make
decisions concerning the care, custody and control'' of their
children, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that a Washington state
law went too far in permitting a judge to order visiting rights for
grandparents over a mother's objection.
</P>
<P>
   With a 6-3 vote but lacking a single rationale that could
command a majority, the court stepped cautiously and appeared
intent on avoiding a one-size-fits-all constitutional prescription
for a world of rapidly changing family dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the court stopped short of declaring
unconstitutional a Washington law, one of the broadest regarding
the rights of grandparents in terms of permitting judicial
intervention into family affairs. Nor did the justices offer much
guidance for judging the constitutionality of similar laws in the
49 other states.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative, splintered nature of the decision, in Troxel vs.
Granville, Nol. 99-138, with a total of six separate opinions among
nine justices, all but guaranteed that challenges to other state
laws would reach the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the court did set a constitutional bottom line that
any statute would have to meet, with a balance struck clearly in
favor of parental decision-making while leaving the door open to
upholding more carefully tailored statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell Tax Evasion Case
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the office of Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, violated an agreement
with Webster Hubbell by forcing him to produce thousands of pages
of personal financial records under a grant of immunity and then
using those records to indict him on charges of tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-1 decision, in The United States vs. Hubbell, No. 99-166,
affirmed a ruling last year by the federal appeals court here,
which declared that it would find the indictment fatally flawed
unless the independent counsel's office could prove that it knew in
advance, when it issued a far-reaching subpoena for Hubbell's
financial information, that the documents existed and that Hubbell
had them. Starr acknowledged that he could not meet that standard
and appealed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the ruling on Monday was to dismiss a conditional
guilty plea agreement that Hubbell, the former associate attorney
general and once a close friend of the Clintons, entered into with
Starr's office. Under the agreement, Hubbell pleaded guilty to a
misdemeanor tax charge and received no incarceration and no fine.
The agreement provided that the guilty plea would be erased if the
independent counsel's office did not win the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted his dissent, but did
not file an opinion to explain his reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Gun Sentencing
</P>
<P>
   The court unanimously rejected the Justice Department's approach
to a law that imposes a mandatory 30-year sentence for using a
machine gun in connection with a crime of violence. Under the
government's view, the law simply provides an enhanced sentence,
which is to be imposed by the trial judge.
</P>
<P>
   But in an opinion by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the court found
that in this 1988 law, Congress intended to make the use of a
machine gun not just a sentencing factor, but a ``separate
substantive crime,'' to be charged separately and proven to a jury.
The decision overturned a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   This case, Castillo v. United States, No. 99-658, was the latest
of several recent cases in which the court has wrestled with the
distinction between a sentence enhancement and an element of the
offense. The decision vacated 30-year sentences given to four
members of the Branch Davidians, who were convicted of voluntary
manslaughter in the deaths of four federal agents during the 1993
raid on the group's compound near Waco, Texas. The decision also
vacated the 10-year sentence imposed under the same law on a fifth
member of the group, who used a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security Appeals
</P>
<P>
   The court handed the government another loss in rejecting the
Social Security Administration's view that a person making a claim
for benefits cannot raise in court any issue that he had not raised
in an administrative appeal to the Social Security Appeals Council.
The vote was 5-4, overturning another 5th Circuit opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said that
although the normal rule is to require claimants to raise all
issues in the administrative process before going to court, that
rule should not apply to hearings such as those before the Social
Security board that are not trial-like in nature. Most Social
Security claimants do not have lawyers and the appeals council
itself is supposed to investigate all the issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Breyer said the claimant was
represented by a lawyer and that the requirement to exhaust all
issues before the board was important in a process that handles
more than 100,000 claims a year. Justices Stevens, Sandra Day
O'Connor, David H. Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the
majority in Sims v. Apfel, No. 98-9537. Rehnquist and Justices
Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy joined the dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Death Penalty
</P>
<P>
   The court unanimously vacated a death sentence issued by a Texas
court to an Argentine man convicted of a murder committed during a
robbery. Under Texas law, the jury deciding on a sentence of death
is to consider whether the defendant presents ``a continuing threat
to society,'' and in this case, a clinical psychologist who
testified as the prosecution's expert witness told the jurors they
could take into account the fact that Hispanics were
``over-represented'' in prison compared to their population and
might therefore be considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the defendant, Victor Hugo Saldano, did not
object to this testimony, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
found that the failure to object essentially forfeited the right to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Saldano's appeal to the Supreme Court drew support from the
government of Argentina and civil rights groups, arguing that
ethnicity had been improperly injected into the sentencing process.
The Texas attorney general, John Cornyn, then filed a statement
with the court, agreeing that the sentencing hearing had violated
the defendant's rights to equal protection and due process. He
asked the justices to vacate the sentence so Saldano could receive
a new hearing ``in which race is not considered.'' The justices did
so on Monday in Saldano v. Texas, No. 99-8119, without further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone Rates
</P>
<P>
   In a case of considerable importance in the telecommunications
industry, the court agreed over the government's objection to hear
a challenge by the GTE Corp. to the rate-setting methodology by
which carriers are required to subsidize service at low rates for
poorly served areas. The so-called universal service program, or
e-rate, was established by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The
case, GTE Corp. v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 99-1244,
is an appeal from a ruling by the Fifth Circuit that upheld the
program.

   The Braves made John Rocker go away Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't very happy,'' general manager John Schuerholz said,
``but nobody who's sent down ever is.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely not the combustible Atlanta closer, who closed out a
tumultuous two weeks by being optioned to the club's Class AAA
affiliate in Richmond. In another determination the team maintains
is not related, the Braves also fined Rocker $5,000 for his his
threatening exchange with Sports Illustrated writer Jeff Pearlman
at Turner Field Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's going to say this is related to the incident that
happened in the tunnel,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``It's absolutely
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has 72 hours to report to the Richmond Braves, or face a
fine. In a midafternoon meeting in a conference room off the Braves
clubhouse, he did not imply he would not report but first wanted to
consult with his agents, the Houston-based team of Randal and Alan
Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker left the stadium without speaking with reporters. Before
he departed, he did make an obscene comment to an Atlanta
Journal-Constitution photographer who attempted to snap his picture
in the same tunnel where the pitcher encountered Pearlman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a pact he would calm down and not get in any
trouble,'' right fielder Brian Jordan said of the fine. ``And he
made another boo-boo, another mistake. He forced their hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Under baseball rules, Rocker must remain in Richmond for at
least 10 days and will be paid under the terms of his $290,000
contract and not a minor-league salary. The timing makes him
available to return to the team in time for the much-anticipated
four-game series with the New York Mets June 29-July 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are measuring it by the trip to New York. We're
not,'' Schuerholz said. ``When he's ready to pitch for us and able
to pitch for us, he'll be here, whenever that is, whenever we think
he's ready to help. We didn't even think about New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball began an investigation into the Pearlman
incident, with executive director of security Kevin Hallinan
interviewing witnesses to the Sunday morning tirade. Sports
Illustrated spokesman Joe Assad said the magazine would not pursue
any possible charges for the episode.
</P>
<P>
   In a released statement, commissioner Bud Selig said, ``I am
saddened by the regrettable incident that took place.... Major
League Baseball is monitoring the situation closely and I have been
in contact with Braves president Stan Kasten throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Major League Baseball is conducting its own
investigation, I am satisfied that the Braves have moved
expeditiously and have treated the matter with the seriousness it
deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig attempted to fine Rocker $20,000 and suspend him for a
month for his racially charged statements in a December Sports
Illustrated article. An arbitrator later reduced the sanctions to
two weeks and $500.
</P>
<P>
   WAGA Channel 5 sportscaster Jeff Hullinger said he had not be
interviewed by MLB officials, though he says Rocker twice engaged
him in heated exchanges. The second incident some three weeks ago,
Hullinger alleged Rocker threatened his life and said sports
psychologist Jack Llewelyn had to separate them.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had become the least reliable pitcher in the bullpen,
allowing 12 of the last 18 hitters he faced to reach base. He has
issued 25 walks in 18 1/3 innings and loaded the bases in three of
his last four appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's pitching good,'' Cox said. ``My opinion was,
he's not pitching good, not the way he can pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker will be working with Richmond pitching coach Mike
Alvarez, who recently replaced legendary coach Bill Fischer after
he was hired in April by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we had been thinking about since our last road
trip in Houston,'' said Cox. ``At that time, Greg McMichael came up
with a sore (shoulder) and we couldn't do it. We thought maybe this
could be a repreve for him and he can get it going again. But he
hasn't got it going again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play so many tough games with this ball club and they're
always close. When you bring in a guy in the seventh, eighth or
ninth inning, you got to have strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rocker left them no indication he would not report to
Richmond, the Braves fully expect him not only to report by return
to Atlanta soon, even if he left the clubhouse glumly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to ignore what guys say when they're optioned,''
assistant general manager Frank Wren said

LOCATING A FLAT IN SAN FRANCISCO: EVEN SAM SPADE MIGHT FIND IT
TOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The open house for the $1,800-a-month four-room
flat began at 9:30 a.m. sharp: By 9:35 a.m. a couple were perched
on the wooden steps hastily filling out a rental application, and
two more were about to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after three months of nonstop searching for a
contradiction in terms _ an affordable, available apartment in San
Francisco _ Kim Kowalski and Dylan Snodgrass had nothing to lose by
throwing their credit reports in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we have a combined income of $110,000, we're
considered low-end,'' said Kowalski, a 31-year-old marketing
representative. ``We've had places charge for the rental
application. We've had people require that we give them sealed
credit reports. Usually, if it's a good place for a good price _
our limit is $2,200 _ there's usually around 30 applicants.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after an hour at the open house, Gene Fong, who was
showing the apartment in the four-unit Edwardian house for its
owners, had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Just one little ad in an Internet community bulletin board on
Thursday afternoon had yielded more than 40 e-mail queries and at
least that many visitors to the Saturday morning showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the rent is pretty reasonable,'' Fong said, as though
he thought it might be a little too reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no need for another open house. There never is.
</P>
<P>
   These are manna-from-heaven days for San Francisco landlords.
Driven by Silicon Valley millionaires and their buying frenzy, the
median price of a home here is now close to $500,000, a price only
11 percent of the city's 750,000 residents can afford.
Consequently, 80 percent of San Francisco's residents are tenants,
perhaps the highest percentage in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, which has a vacancy rate of less than 1
percent, compared with 2.57 percent in New York City, there are
never enough apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The free-market horror stories about elderly long-time tenants
being forced out so that young blood with new money can pay
whatever it takes are all too common here. So are the tales of
barely inhabitable rooms for $1,000 a month. The hunt for an
apartment in almost any neighborhood in San Francisco is unlike the
hunt anywhere else in the country, even overpriced Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A 300-square-foot unrenovated studio in the kind of neighborhood
your mother taught you to avoid can cost $1,100 a month, with a
three-month security deposit. A studio in a building you would not
mind showing your boss can run for $1,700. Rents for one-bedroom
apartments with no amenities except a respectable address are at
least $1,800. But it is not only the prices that make the search
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Any apartment listed in the classified ads or on rental bulletin
boards will draw dozens, even scores of applicants. This leads to
intense competition among prospective tenants. Individual
appointments are almost unheard of; most apartments are shown
through open houses where applicants elbow each other to audition
as the best rental bet.
</P>
<P>
   Rental agents are suggesting that prospective tenants come armed
with renters' resumes detailing their credit and job history,
credit reports and references. They also suggest that renters wear
professional attire and show enthusiasm for the apartment, as
though the $1,800-a-month junior one-bedroom walk-up overlooking
the freeway was their dream home, the place they wanted to settle
in for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renting a place in San Francisco, people have to treat it as
if they are applying to an Ivy League college,'' said Grey Todd,
president of Rent Tech, an apartment-listing service. ``You have to
kiss up to the landlords. The landlords can pick the creme de la
creme of tenants, the absolute perfect person for their space. How
many people are looking for a studio or a two-bedroom? As many as
50 to 80 for each place. The tenant has to stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   Landlords, besieged with applicants with six-figure incomes and
stock portfolios, say it is not uncommon for prospective tenants to
offer 10 percent over the monthly asking price for a rental, or to
offer to redo the floors or remodel the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 22 years, it has never been this crazy, this good,'' said
Don DeShon, who co-owns 13 rental properties in San Francisco. Last
week, he was offered $5,000 just to hold an $1,800-a-month
one-bedroom apartment in an industrial neighborhood that he had yet
to advertise. ``I would suggest, if you're looking and you see
something you're vaguely interested in, you take it,'' DeShon said.
</P>
<P>
   Any landlord unfortunate enough to have a place listed for more
than a week will be inundated with perhaps hundreds of phone calls.
Marc Lamboy, who owns three small buildings in the city, listed a
$1,500-a-month one-bedroom apartment and received more than 100
calls in a week. ``Do I have sympathy for renters?'' he said.
``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Those looking can start feeling pretty sorry for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so competitive,'' said Jennifer Bomze, who moved here
from Ann Arbor, Mich., with her boyfriend. Both recently earned
their MBAs and are working for a start-up company where they earn a
combined $200,000 a year. That has not been enough to impress
prospective landlords.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few places that we really liked and hoped to hear
from,'' said Bomze, who has set her ceiling at $2,500 for a
one-bedroom in what she would characterize as a halfway decent
neighborhood. ``I don't know if people got there before we did. I'm
not sure what else it is the landlords are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Kowalski and Snodgrass, who have been renting a room in a
friend's house for $1,200 a month until they find a place, have
turned the task into a full-time job. ``I basically spend at least
six hours a day, six days a week looking,'' said Kowalski, whose
real job is on hold while Snodgrass, a carpenter, earns their keep.
The couple moved here from the Central Coast city of San Luis
Obispo, where the living is easy and Kowalski paid $580 for a
one-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dylan wanted to live in San Francisco because it's such a
great city,'' Kowalski said. ``But we have no life. We do nothing
but look for a place. We do nothing but compete with other people
for the landlords' attention.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Snodgrass joined a group of applicants encircling
Fong at the open house on Saturday, hoping Fong would notice what a
nice, clean-cut young man he was.

WARNED BY THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, WEB SITE FILES SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a lawsuit that legal experts say may have
broad implications for all Internet search engines, a music Web
site has sued the recording industry to retain the ability to link
to music files even though some of the works may be pirated
material.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed late Friday in Federal District Court in San
Jose, brings to a boil a simmering dispute between MP3Board.com
Inc., a 12-employee music search engine in Santa Cruz, Calif., and
the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the
major record labels.
</P>
<P>
   MP3Board.com runs a search engine focused on finding MP3 files.
The company's lawsuit asked Judge Ronald M. Whyte to declare that
MP3Board.com should not be held liable for copyright infringement
if it provided results of an automated search that might include
pirated copyrighted works.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, which has
complained to MP3Board.com, says that results of its searches turn
up hundreds of links to pirated songs.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, the president of the association, said in an
interview on Monday that the Web site is abetting music pirates by
aggressively pointing people to copyrighted music. On May 25, the
association sent a cease-and-desist letter to MP3board.com, saying
that if the site was not disabled by June 2, or all of the
offending links removed, then the association would consider taking
additional legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the case has profound implications because the
association is seeking to hold MP3board.com liable for linking to
copyrighted material produced during an automated Web search. If
the court embraces that reasoning, search engines in general could
find themselves liable for providing such links whether to music,
literature, movies or other works _ said Mark F. Radcliffe, a
copyright lawyer with the Palo Alto, Calif., law firm of Gray Cary
Ware &AMP; Freidenrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is right in the back yard of the major search engines,
and if the decision goes the wrong way it's going to affect Yahoo
and Excite(at)home very directly,'' Radcliffe said, adding the case
touches on issues copyright lawyers have been struggling with. ``It
goes right to the heart of the way the Web works.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen declined to discuss whether her group considered
MP3board.com similar to other search engines, or whether the
efforts to pursue the actions of MP3board.com had implications for
other search engines. ``I'm not going to put our legal theories''
in the newspaper, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Mapstead, chief executive of MP3board.com, said his company
kept an index of roughly 500,000 songs its automated search engine
has culled from the Web. He said it would be prohibitive to go
through every link provided by an automated search engine and
determine whether or not it was a pirated work. ``I would literally
have to listen to every song,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said activity is no different than other search engines,
except with a different focus, and he said that he suspects that
the industry association was going after his company because it was
small and did not have deep pockets like bigger search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Copyright experts and the entertainment industry are already
struggling with the issue of linking and providing access to
pirated copyrighted works. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of
1998 provides some ``safe harbor'' provisions that prevent search
engines and Internet service providers from being held liable for
some content posted on their services, but not all the provisions
have been tested or refined in court. In a case that touches on
some of the same issues, the movie industry has sought to prevent a
Web site, ``2600: The Hacker Quarterly,'' from posting links to
other sites that offer software that allows users to copy DVD
movies.

   Ira P. Rothken, a lawyer representing MP3Board.com, said that if
the association succeeded in taking his client off the Internet for
linking to copyrighted material, it could ``lead to paralysis on
the Internet because automation would become meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the effect could reach much further on the Web. At the
major search engines, he said, ``a human being would have to go
through every single file.''

NO WALKING, JUST WATERING FOR THIS PUPPY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Switzerland, Germany, Spain)   By SHAILA K. DEWAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last year, the art world was abuzz about elephant
dung and a shark in formaldehyde at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
This year, animals are once again capturing artistic attention: a
parade of artist-designed cows are posing throughout the city this
month, and Monday, the artist Jeff Koons unveiled a 43-foot puppy
sculpture carpeted with living flowers in Rockefeller Center.
</P>
<P>
   Like the cows, which were a hit in Zurich and Chicago, Koons'
West Highland white terrier is a tried and true crowd pleaser.
Koons first exhibited the sculpture, called ``Puppy,'' during an
international art show in 1992 in Germany. The artist had not been
invited to participate in the exhibition, ``Documenta IX,'' but
``Puppy'' nonetheless stole the show, and was shown again in Sydney
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Puppy' is one of the most significant sculptures of the 20th
century,'' Susan Freedman, the president of the Public Art Fund,
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   But however bland and friendly its demeanor, ``Puppy'' may not
have been, strictly speaking, a safer choice than a shark or
elephant dung. In 1997 in Spain, where a second version of the
sculpture stands guard outside the Guggenheim Bilbao, two
terrorists were caught trying to plant bombs inside the artwork,
and a police officer died in the ensuing gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Monday marked the first time ``Puppy'' has been seen in the
United States. It will be on view in Rockefeller Plaza, where the
Christmas tree stands during the holiday season, until Labor Day.
Rockefeller Center paid for the display but refused to disclose the
cost, saying it was a gift to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Koons is famous for borrowing American kitsch and transforming
it into art. In the '80s, his porcelain portrait of Michael Jackson
with his pet chimp, Bubbles, was priced at $250,000. More recently,
a 1988 sculpture brought $1.8 million at an auction at Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven stainless-steel sections, each holding 12 inches of dirt,
fit together to form the armature of the verdant canine. An
internal irrigation system nourishes a varicolored carpet of 60,000
flowering plants, including marigolds, begonias, impatiens,
lobelias and 50 kinds of petunias from nurseries on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's controlled random,'' Koons said of the pattern created by
the flowers, which will be allowed to grow out naturally. ``It's
such a pleasant experience to give up control, to let nature take
its course.''

$3.5 BILLION AFRICA PIPELINE EXPECTED TO BE APPROVED BY WORLD BANK
</HEADLINE>

 By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With U.S. support, the World Bank is expected to
approve on Tuesday a $3.5 billion project to develop an oil
pipeline in Chad and Cameroon in West Africa, despite widespread
concerns about the potential for corruption and environmental
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will vote in favor of World Bank
sponsorship after specifying an unusually detailed list of
safeguards that officials hope will earmark the oil revenues for
development projects and ward off abuse, a senior U.S. official
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the project does not have united European support, the
United States, as the major shareholder in World Bank, is confident
that there will be enough votes for a loan to pass, the official
said. Exxon Mobil is the lead company that is seeking the loan. The
World Bank is generally expected to contribute $90 million to $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 663-mile pipeline, which would link oil fields in
landlocked Chad to the Atlantic Coast of Cameroon, has stirred an
outcry among environmentalists and anti-poverty crusaders. They say
the project will provide a boon to corrupt African officials,
dislocate indigenous peoples and harm ecologically sensitive areas.
</P>
<P>
   The senior U.S. official said critics had ``very legitimate
concerns.'' But after more than two years working with the oil
companies, he said, officials and independent figures in both
countries, planners have come ``a very long way'' in addressing
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a project with substantial development potential,''
the official said. ``I'm confident that it will be approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups contend that the companies have failed to
set aside adequate money to clean up an oil spill, allocating less
than $1 million, despite Dutch researchers' citing a need for $28
million.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline, the critics add, will threaten the livelihoods of
hundreds of Bagueli people, or pygmies, and endanger the habitats
of endangered black rhinos, gorillas and chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you lay a pipeline, you're basically building a road
for loggers and poachers,'' said Alejandro Queral, associate
Washington representative of the Sierra Club.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say the World Bank will effectively be lining the
pockets of a corrupt government in Chad that the State Department
says brutally persecutes its enemies. Nearly every region of Chad,
a nation 2 1/2 times the size of France, has erupted in
ethnically-based unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Providing oil revenues to the central government is ``like
adding more fuel to the fire,'' asserted Korrina Horta, a senior
economist at Environmental Defense in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dangerous situation,'' Horta added.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil has insisted on World Bank participation as a hedge
against instability, Horta said. She referred to the bank's role,
which represents less than 10 percent of the project, as
``political risk insurance'' for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You make the World Bank a shareholder in the project, and no
government is ever going to nationalize it,'' Horta said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the support clears the way for Exxon Mobil, Chevron
and Petronas to seek additional financing before investing $3
billion of their own, she said, adding, ``It's the Good
Housekeeping Seal of Approval.''
</P>
<P>
   In tandem with its support for the loan, the administration has
insisted on a framework to be monitored by the World Bank that
would reduce the risk of corruption or mismanagement. That
structure would include an escrow account for oil revenues that
would set aside most of the income for health, education and
development and allow for monitoring by nongovernmental groups in
Chad.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-backed strictures also require that money be set aside
to create national parks, compensate displaced people and respond
to oil spills.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline would be one of the largest that involves direct
foreign investment in Africa in decades, officials said. Experts
expect it to generate $80 million to $100 million a year for Chad
and $20 million in transfer fees for Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledged that the project would be something
of a test for the World Bank. Last week, the bank released a report
in which it faulted itself and the International Monetary Fund for
making Africa poorer through failed lending policies over 40 years.

ADVERTISING: PEPSI TAKES LOW-KEY APPROACH TO MARKETING FRUITWORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS address of Web site in 9th graf) 
By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Blockbuster TV commercials. Glitzy news conferences.
Celebrity endorsers. The Pepsi-Cola Co. is practically synonymous
with this kind of big-league national marketing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   So it's somewhat odd that Pepsi's FruitWorks, a juice-based
noncarbonated drink that will compete with brands like Triarc
Beverage Group's Snapple and Coca-Cola Co.'s Fruitopia, is being
introduced nationally this month with comparatively little fanfare.
And it's deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   The soft drink giant has decided the best way to ingratiate
FruitWorks with the ever-fickle youth market is through grass-roots
marketing programs that it hopes will create a word of mouth allure
and hip personality for the new brand. While grass-roots marketing
has always been a part of selling brands at Pepsi, this time it is
the marketing plan, explained Robin Kaminsky, Pepsi's director of
alternative beverages.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi is going this route after its vast research _ this is the
company that invented the Pepsi generation _ indicated that not
mass marketing, but very specific promotions and TV commercials
made especially for young people is the best way to establish
awareness for its new brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to talk to our target is not through mass
marketing, but through the kinds of one-on-one marketing that our
plan is about: linking with our target and talking to them the way
they want,'' said Kaminsky.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy to reach teen-agers 15 to 24, but as young as 12,
relies on an entertainment-oriented Web site, a sampling program
and a national promotion starting in July with MTV's ``Total
Request Live,'' a popular hit-countdown show.
</P>
<P>
   Central to its strategy of reaching computer-savvy kids is its
Web site, created by DDB Digital, a unit of Omnicom Group. Steven
Marrs, DDB Digital's chief operating officer, said the agency knows
from its experience as the creator and manager of pepsiworld.com
that today's youth are almost hard-wired to reject direct pitches
that dictate what is or is not cool. Instead, he said, the
challenge was to offer a Web site in which young people help to
create ``the personality and tonality of the brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've learned is that these kids are not like everyone
else, they are not ones to be marketed to and they have a desire to
go out and create their own space in world,'' said Marrs. ``So we
work with them to build the brand, and give expression of who they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The FruitWorks site (www.fruitworks.com) features a ``music
maker,'' where kids can make their own sounds and a place to create
your own cartoon frame-by-frame including word bubbles. Both can
then be sent as an e-mail message to friends _ which is a way for
Pepsi to spread the word about FruitWorks. The site began Feb. 8
and through May 22 had 102,000 different visitors, according to DDB
Digital research.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to this market, it's important to be cool, but you
can't just say `we're cool,' explained Steve Hicks, DDB Digital's
creative director. ``We actually created a space where kids can go
and express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The FruitWorks promotion with MTV is also an un-commercial.
FruitWorks simply tries to be hip by association. For example, two
spots that will air only on MTV are about TRL's fanatical fans who
line up daily outside MTV's Times Square studios in New York where
the program is broadcast live. FruitWorks is sponsoring the
program's first home video release, and is running a national
consumer sweepstakes where the grand prize is a visit to MTV
studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense in a big way to tap into the Zeitgeist of TRL,
and not so literally be a commercial,'' said John Shea, MTV's
senior vice president of strategic programming.
</P>
<P>
   That the promotion was created by MTV's in-house commercial
division is unusual in itself. Big corporations typically assign an
ad agency of record before advertising on a brand begins. But Pepsi
decided from the start to do this differently, and so far there
hasn't been a need for a classic ad agency relationship. Still,
Pepsi's longtime agency, BBDO Worldwide, is working on media
planning and buying, Kaminsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi expects FruitWorks to be a top 5 brand in its first year
on the market, and that so far sales are 50 percent above its
projections, said Kaminsky.
</P>
<P>
   FruitWorks is late to market. Fruit beverages sold in
single-serve bottles had its fastest growth in the early 1990s with
the proliferation of so-called new-age beverages, led by the
phenomenal early success of Snapple iced teas and fruit drinks,
said Gary Hemphill, vice president of information services at
Beverage Marketing Corp., a New York-based research firm. Coke
introduced Fruitopia, in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The market has since slowed, and last year grew about 7 percent
to $2.2 billion, Hemphill said. He said Snapple is still the
leader, with a 12.4 percent share, but Fruitopia is fast-growing,
with 8.5 percent of the market. In comparison, the carbonated
beverage market was flat at about $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company's lack of big advertising dollars behind
the brand has not been lost on its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are taking a low-key approach and it's just a
product that some of their bottlers need to fill up some accounts
to try to compete with new-age beverages,'' said Mike Weinstein,
Triarc's CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Snapple has become known for its grass-roots marketing and wacky
``best stuff on earth'' advertising, first with salesclerk Wendy as
spokeswoman and more recently with national TV commercials that
feature fruit come to life (which are actually actors in costumes
as bananas and peaches) to underscore that Snapple is all natural.
The newest campaign created by Deutsch, New York, shows Snapple
fruits at a health spa where they get in shape with gym equipment
and are ``randomly'' tested for preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But with Pepsi's powerful distribution system FruitWorks'
potential cannot be underestimated. Hemphill said he believes Pepsi
aims to do in the juice-based category what it did in the iced tea
market. Snapple created that category with its all-natural iced
teas back in the 1980s, but it was overtaken by Lipton several
years ago. Lipton Iced Tea is marketed by the Pepsi-Lipton Tea
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Pepsi, it's really about their distribution system _ that
sets them apart from the competition,'' said Hemphill. ``I think
this gives FruitWorks an excellent opportunity to be successful.
You'll see it almost everywhere you see Pepsi-cola products.''

SHARE PRICES MIXED AS INVESTORS PAUSE FOR RECENT GAINS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (CORRECTS fractions of stock prices in 19th, 22nd grafs)  
(Eds.: ``Advisors'' in last graf is cq)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were mixed Monday, as investors paused
to consider the landscape after last week's big advance.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said they were encouraged by the price action. Monday's
activity stood in stark contrast to the eruptions seen for much of
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in April and May you would get a 150-point to 200-point
rally and give it all back the next day,'' said Ned Collins, head
trader at Daiwa Securities America.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I am concerned,'' he added, ``it is good that we are
treading water. We had such a big move last week that we need to
consolidate some.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Hewlett-Packard, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
20.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,815.30. But the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63 points, or 0.7 percent, to
1,467.63, attributed in part to declines in General Electric, Cisco
Systems and Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which rose a record 19 percent last
week, rallied during the last hour of trading Monday and closed at
3,821.76, up 8.38 points, or 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks also managed
to eke out a small gain, rising 0.27 points to 513.30.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks jumped last week on reports that showed the economy might
be losing some of its momentum, an indication that efforts by the
Federal Reserve Board to achieve that end might be working.
</P>
<P>
   Since last June, the Fed has raised short-term interest rates
six times to cool the economy and dampen inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   However, the only report of any note this week is the Producer
Price Index for May on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, analysts said stock prices were expected to
remain in a trading range for this week, and possibly a good deal
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay in a trading range is probably the best thing that can
happen to the market,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed
trading at SG Cowen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives the people the chance to get into stocks they want to
get into, and to sell others at levels they want,'' he said.
``There is no need to panic one way or the other. That is probably
helpful, because the market needs to be a little calmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume was light, but not abnormally so for a Monday in
what Wall Street considers the summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Some 838 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock
Exchange. Volume on the Nasdaq stock market was 1.4 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard was the Dow's biggest gainer, rising 9], to 120
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and IBM also helped to move the Dow higher.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 9/16, to 66~, after it said it would spend $2
billion to speed adoption of its new Internet-based software.
</P>
<P>
   IBM rose four, to 112 7/16 after a Merrill Lynch analyst
expressed optimism about its prospects for the second half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel slumped 1|, to 132 9/16, as investors took some
profits following last week's big advance. Intel's shares gained 14
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bank stocks, which have rallied strongly in recent weeks on
hopes that an end to interest rate increases by the Fed is near,
retreated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, a S&AMP;P 500 component, lost 2 3/8, to 45[. Bank of
America slid 1}, to 59\. Chase Manhattan lost 1 3/16, to 79]. And
Bank of New York shed 1}, to 46~.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology stocks, which posted very good gains last week,
continued to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech was the biggest winner, rising 19~, to 129, after the
drugmaker won approval from the Food and Drug Administration for
TNKase, a next-generation version of Activase, a clot-busting drug
for heart-attack patients.
</P>
<P>
   Human Genome Sciences rose 7 9/16, to 113{. And PE Corp Celera
jumped 22{, to 91.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting some retrenchment in the biotech sector, and
it didn't happen,'' said Mike Weiner, a managing director at
BancOne Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. ``The follow-through
in those stocks surprised me, and it probably masked some weakness
in the Nasdaq.''

INDONESIA AND IMF REJECT MEASURES TO PROP UP CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs to correct spelling for IMF's Koehler throughout) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In a move that seems likely to snuff out
Indonesia's latest flirtation with currency controls, the new
managing director of the International Monetary Fund declared on
Monday that closing off Indonesia's capital markets would hinder
the nation's fragile economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's chief, Horst Koehler, emerged from a breakfast meeting
with President Abdurrahman Wahid and briskly dispelled speculation
that the IMF would agree to an Indonesian effort to defend its
faltering currency, the rupiah, by placing controls on the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and I fully agreed that the introduction of
capital controls would be counterproductive,'' said Koehler, who
was making his first visit to Jakarta as IMF director. ``He feels
that it would be the wrong decision, and I agree, because such a
decision would deter foreign investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, a senior economic adviser to Wahid, Sofyan
Wanandi, said: ``It's over. It's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Indonesian officials said they were considering some
type of controls to stabilize the rupiah, which has dropped 18
percent in value since the beginning of the year because of fears
of renewed political unrest. Indonesia considered setting a fixed
rate for the rupiah in early 1998, after a far more serious slide,
but backed off under intense pressure from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy has crept back from the abyss of 1998, it
still depends on billions of dollars in loans from the fund to bail
out debt-ridden banks and corporations. Last week, the IMF approved
a $372 million loan that had been delayed because officials at the
fund were unhappy with the fitful pace of economic restructuring
under Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler made it clear Monday that Indonesia's future lay in
strictly adhering to the IMF's program. He urged the Indonesian
Bank Restructuring Authority to accelerate the sale of assets of
insolvent banks and companies. Failure to do so, he said, ``would
lead to a deterioration in the asset values.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler's predecessor, Michel Camdessus, aroused resentment in
1998 when he stood watching with arms folded, as Indonesia's
longtime president, Suharto, reluctantly signed a loan agreement
with the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Though Koehler did not mince words Monday, he took pains not to
sound imperious. ``We are here to help and support, not to lecture
and impose,'' he said. ``But of course we offer frank advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's markets responded quickly to Koehler. The rupiah,
which had been rallying in recent days on speculation that it might
be stabilized, slipped to a rate of 8,460 to the United States
dollar from 8,400. But the stock market welcomed the news, jumping
2.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Capital controls have gained some credibility in Asia in the
last two years, since Malaysia imposed controls on its currency and
embarked on a powerful recovery. Analysts here said that officials
were focusing less on a fixed exchange rate than on measures to
keep rupiah in the country, like requiring exporters to repatriate
and convert their foreign-exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia is not Malaysia, which has disciplined officials
to police the flow of currencies in and out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't work here,'' said Umar Juoro, a former adviser to
Wahid's immediate predecessor, B.J. Habibie. ``We don't have the
capacity to do it. All it would do is to discourage foreign capital
from coming back to Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the rupiah has rattled officials because they
remember that Suharto was ultimately swept out of power by violent
unrest ignited by a weak currency. But some analysts said the
impact of a weaker rupiah would not be as great this time because
it hurts companies with debt denominated in dollars. And most of
those companies are already bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the weak rupiah has bolstered Indonesian exports, which
jumped 29 percent in April compared with April 1999. For Indonesia
to achieve Wahid's personal goal of 5 percent-plus economic growth
this year, it will need continued strength in exports.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drawback of controls may be political, according to
James W. Castle, an American consultant. Since Indonesia fell into
crisis, the rupiah has been a reliable barometer of public
confidence in the government. The recent decline was precipitated
by Wahid's decision to dismiss two of his most respected cabinet
ministers and replace them with people regarded as cronies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lesson to the government that there is a price to
pay,'' Castle said. ``The danger is that it would lose that
feedback mechanism.''

DEBATING A BISHOP'S MOVE: FISCALLY WISE OR COLD AND BIASED? 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ In his dozen years as head of the diocese of
Bridgeport, Bishop Edward Egan has had his leadership tested
repeatedly by a long-running, uncommonly public dispute with the
parish of Our Lady of Montserrat, a fast-growing congregation of
Hispanic immigrants here that in many ways represents the future of
Roman Catholic America.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has centered on the simple fact that Our Lady of
Montserrat, despite vibrant growth, has never had its own suitably
sized building. Parishioners yearned to build a new church. Egan
decided that the parish could not afford it. In 1997, relations
with the bishop became so bitter that the church's pastor, the Rev.
Bernardo Rodriguez, resigned in protest.
</P>
<P>
   This month, both Our Lady of Montserrat and Egan move on. Last
Friday, under the bishop's order, the parish will leave its cramped
building to merge with the parish of St. Benedict, half a mile
south in the Cove section. Ten days later, Egan will be installed
as the new archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares to take the most visible Catholic pulpit in the
nation, both Egan's most devoted supporters and his harshest
critics have pointed to his handling of the Our Lady of Montserrat
situation as an indication of how he will take control of an
unwieldy archdiocese with 10 counties, 2.4 million worshipers and
complex financial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, diocesan officials close to Egan have
characterized the merger of the two churches as the latest example
of his deep commitment to meeting the needs of immigrants, which
they saw fit to emphasize as he moved to New York, where there are
nearly 900,000 Hispanic Catholics, more than double the number of
all parishioners in the diocese of Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   It could also be seen, they said, as evidence of his management
skill in consolidating to cut costs and of a willingness to make
tough decisions in the face of public outcry. These qualities, they
said, would be essential in New York, where many financially
struggling schools and parishes need to be consolidated or closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a public dispute with respect to the bishop's
leadership regarding Our Lady of Montserrat,'' said Tom Drohan, a
spokesman for the Bridgeport diocese. ``As the leader of the
diocese, he has responsibility for the health of each parish, the
spiritual health and the financial health.''
</P>
<P>
   But some parishioners at Montserrat view the merger as the
latest blunder in a long dispute in which Egan and his predecessor,
Bishop Walter Curtis, failed to help the parish build its own
permanent house of worship. It is evidence, they say, of an
autocratic, unyielding style less concerned with people than with
finances.
</P>
<P>
   Some parishioners say they not only feel betrayed by Egan, but
are doubly stung by the lavish praise heaped upon him after his
appointment to succeed Cardinal John J. O'Connor. Some described
Egan as not just unconcerned with immigrants, but as anti-Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the impression that the people here have of him,'' said
the Rev. Leonard Paskus, who has been the administrator of
Montserrat for a year and a half. Paskus said he disagreed with the
negative view of Egan, but he invited parishioners to vent their
anger at a meeting shortly after the merger with St. Benedict was
announced in March. About 60 people attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's injustice,'' said Maurizio Ahumada at the
meeting. ``It's discrimination. He has been described as a
brilliant fund-raiser, but he never did anything to help this
parish.'
</P>
<P>
   Ahumada recalled a meeting with Egan in September 1997. It
began, he said, not with a prayer or a call for healing, but with a
warning. ``You will not bend me,'' Ahumada recalled the bishop's
saying. ``I have been in this business for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsignor Aniceto Villamide, the vicar for Hispanic ministry,
dismissed the criticism, saying Hispanics had flourished under
Egan. The bishop learned Spanish when he arrived in Bridgeport, and
frequently worshiped in Spanish, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bishop Egan was very supportive of Hispanics,'' Villamide
said. ``The numbers speak for themselves. When he came here 11
years ago, there were only three Spanish-speaking priests from
Hispanic countries. Right now, when he leaves, there are 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Egan, Villamide said, the diocese began a weekly radio
program in Spanish and added a page in Spanish to the diocesan
newspaper. ``He was the one to take the initiative to create
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this has swayed the Montserrat parishioners. It may
be telling that when he went to the church to announce the merger,
Egan was accompanied not by Villamide but by Michael Dolan, the
diocese's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the bitterness stems from the thwarted efforts of
parishioners to undertake a renovation and expansion of
Montserrat's building on Hope Street. An architect's rendering
showed a white Spanish Colonial building with a red-tiled roof,
arched windows and a bell tower.
</P>
<P>
   The parish, which has more than 1,500 members, raised $500,000
by summer 1997 to meet goals set by Egan. Current and former
parishioners said they kept their end of the deal. All they needed,
they said, was the bishop's help to get a loan for the balance.
</P>
<P>
   But, Drohan said, the church never met a diocesan requirement
that any parish wishing to undertake a building project must have
enough money to cover at least half of the cost. By the time the
parish raised $500,000, the projected expansion cost had increased
from $1 million to more than $1.5 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So in July 1997, Egan decided against giving the parish its
loan. Angry parishioners held a rally with signs questioning the
bishop's faith. Father Rodriguez, their beloved pastor, quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some feel if we were an Anglo community,'' Paskus said, ``we
would have been given permission to build.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Villamide said Egan's decisions reflected a trend among Catholic
leaders to prefer territorial parishes that served parishioners
within a geographic area to parishes intended for an ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   He said Egan was tending to a growing community of Haitian
Catholics in Stamford, which would get the building occupied by
Montserrat as a community center. Several parishioners there said
they suspected that the diocese planned to sell the property, a
valuable parcel surrounded by condominium buildings. Drohan denied
any intention to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela Rivera was among those shocked by the merger. ``After
an hour and a half with the bishop, you are wondering what are you
here for,'' she said. ``You are here just to listen and obey.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 15 years, the parishioners of Montserrat have been
Catholic nomads, going from one building to another. By 1984, their
original home, a small wood-frame building in downtown Stamford,
could no longer hold them. Curtis proposed a merger with St.
Benedict.
</P>
<P>
   That merger was abandoned after protests from hundreds of
parishioners at St. Benedict and pleas from Montserrat worshipers
who hoped to build their own church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Montserrat bought a building on Hope Street, knowing it
would not be big enough for its growing needs. That December, Egan,
who had been vicar of education in New York, was installed as head
of the Bridgeport diocese.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived to find a diocese deeply in debt. Many of its urban
churches and schools, once filled with European immigrants, were
impoverished. Alongside the old congregations were equally poor new
ones filled with immigrants from Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   The new bishop closed some schools and initiated a fund-raising
campaign. It was not a time to talk about building anything. In
1995, with the Montserrat parishioners asking for more space, Egan
sought to add a Spanish Mass at St. Mary's, one of Stamford's
largest churches.
</P>
<P>
   Parishioners at St. Mary's, mostly of Irish or Italian descent,
suspected a possible merger and rebelled. ``Why does Montserrat
need to have its own church?'' one St. Mary's worshiper wrote to
The Advocate of Stamford. ``Why should it take ours? If most of the
parishioners there consist of illegal aliens and the like, why
should they have the right to such a voice in selecting the church
they'd like to own?''
</P>
<P>
   Any idea of joining the churches was dropped, and Egan swiftly
removed the pastor of St. Mary's. Lay leaders said they thought
their priest had been punished for their opposition to a merger
with Montserrat.
</P>
<P>
   The Montserrat parishioners continued to hope for their own
church. After the fight with St. Mary's, planning began in earnest
for expanding Montserrat. Financial and architectural plans were
drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parishioners of Our Lady did everything they were supposed
to do in good faith, but in the end we were told we couldn't do it
for reasons that were not justified,'' said Alex Martinez, a former
parishioner who was the parish's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Since his resignation, Montserrat has not had an official
pastor, but an administrator. Seeking to underscore that the merger
with St. Benedict would be an equal one, Egan announced Father
Paskus and the Rev. Vincent Veich of St. Benedict would be
co-pastors of the new St. Benedict-Our Lady of Montserrat.
</P>
<P>
   The diocesan newspaper applauded the merger as providing new
lifeblood for the older congregation and a new home for the younger
one, a Tudor-style stone church with stained glass and a separate
social hall. Its mission would be to serve new Americans, whether
from Eastern Europe or Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   Veich attended the meeting at Montserrat to listen to complaints
and offer calming words. Parishioners at St. Benedict are
apprehensive about parking, but have have responded favorably to
the tripling of their congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Veich said the merger guaranteed that St. Benedict, built to
serve Slovak Catholics, would remain strong. He said it was fitting
that a parish that served one immigrant group at the start of the
20th century would serve another at the start of the 21st.
</P>
<P>
   The church secretary, Cathy Romano, has prepared the first joint
newsletter, in English and Spanish. Some parishioners are
contemplating new culinary traditions. ``I don't know about
kielbasa anymore at the picnics,'' said Ronnie Florio. Her husband,
Tony, disagreed. ``We'll mix it with the enchiladas,'' he said.
``We'll have a variety of food.''
</P>
<P>
   Drohan said things would work out. ``Part of what goes with the
bishop's role is the loneliness of command,'' he said. ``But a
decision isn't made in a vacuum. It's measured against facts. It's
measured against the future and future needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it an unpopular decision?'' he said of the merger.
``Clearly it was in certain quarters. Was it the correct decision?
We're very confident that the parishioners and the community will
see that it was.''

BELMONT IS LOOKING FOR A FEW GOOD HORSES
</HEADLINE>
  By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After three years of Triple Crown suspense, Belmont
Park was trying to pick up the pieces from its shattered cast for
the Belmont Stakes Monday. But it was finding few signs of a
stampede by quality horses to replace the departed winners of the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   It was also having trouble finding words to express its dismay
at not having a horse with a shot at the Triple Crown this year
after three straight blockbuster years when a horse did, before
crowds that reached a record of 85,818 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anybody, we are disappointed with the turn of events that
have cost us the Derby and Preakness winners,'' said Terry Meyocks,
president of the New York Racing Association. ``But the well-being
of the horses comes first. However, our expectations are still
high. The Belmont Stakes is a New York event.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks after the withdrawal of Red Bullet, who won
the Preakness, the race was dealt a kind of coup de grace on Sunday
by the withdrawal of Fusaichi Pegasus, who won the Derby and ran
second in the Preakness. It lost Red Bullet when his owner decided
the colt needed more time between races. Then Fusaichi Pegasus was
withdrawn by his trainer, Neil Drysdale, after the colt sustained a
small cut on his right front hoof in his stall. Neither horse had a
shot at the Triple Crown, of course, but a rematch would have at
least made the Belmont highly anticipated. And now, some of that
anticipation is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trainers at Belmont Park reacted diplomatically to
the double blow, but Carl Nafzger announced from Churchill Downs
that Unshaded, who ran second to Postponed in the Peter Pan, would
now be entered in the Belmont. Not only that, but the horse's
owner, James Tafel, will also pay the $100,000 supplemental fee
required because the colt was not nominated to the Triple Crown.
Earlier, Nafzger had said that Unshaded would not run unless the
race ``fell apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The trainer announced the switch in plans after Unshaded was
timed in one minute flat for five furlongs in a workout at
Churchill Downs, with Nafzger terming it ``a very professional
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, when Fusaichi Pegasus came out of the race,'' he
said, ``that had something to do with it. But it was the work that
made the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Another horse at Churchill Downs was committed to the Belmont
after a solid workout. D.Wayne Lukas, who had listed Commendable as
a possible starter, made it definite after the colt worked six
furlongs in 1:13 4/5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an excellent work,'' Lukas said from his barn at Santa
Anita. ``We were leaning toward running anyway, but we wanted to
get that last work into him.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the defection of two top players would be an open
invitation to lesser horses to enter a major race. But it was
difficult to find horses who could run a 1 1/2 miles and who were
ready to try it this Saturday. Entries must be filed by Wednesday,
so it appeared likely that the absence of Fusaichi Pegasus and Red
Bullet would favor the contenders already committed to the race. A
field of 12 is expected.
</P>
<P>
   John Kimmel, the trainer of Wheelaway, who ran fifth in the
Derby, skipped the Preakness and is now set for the Belmont,
reacted with something of an understatement, saying, ``I look at it
as one less horse to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Schulhofer, the trainer of Postponed, acknowledged some
sense of relief that Fusaichi Pegasus would not be running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very bad for Neil Drysdale,'' he said. ``But I'm not
going to say that I'm not happy the horse isn't running, because I
am. It makes the race easier for the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the handlers of Red Bullet have second thoughts now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fusaichi Pegasus had nothing to do with it,'' said Joe Orseno,
who trains Red Bullet for Frank Stronach. ``We weren't going in the
Belmont before, and we're not going after.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though New York may have been spoiled by three straight
years when the Triple Crown was within the grasp of a 3-year-old
colt running in the Belmont, racing officials were hoping that
there might be some carry-over effect and that the public would
show up in force this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the decade of the '90s, in the years before the Triple
Crown went on the line, we had crowds of 37,171 on Belmont Day in
1995 and 40,797 on Belmont day in 1996,'' said Bill Nader, NYRA's
director of broadcast communications and promotions. ``Then,
suddenly, we had three years in a row when a horse came in here
after winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and the crowds
doubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if Pegasus had come in here after winning the Derby
and Preakness, and for the fourth straight year, racing history
went on the line. We might have had 90,000 people at the track next
Saturday, maybe even 100,000.''

GREGSON'S DEATH LEAVES RACING WORLD IN SHOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The suicide of Eddie Gregson, trainer of 1982 Kentucky Derby
winner Gato del Sol, left the California racetrack world in shock
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Gregson, 61, shot himself in his South Pasadena
office and was found dead at 9:45 p.m. Sunday night by his wife
after he failed to come home or answer the phone.
</P>
<P>
   He had saddled horses in two races at Hollywood Park earlier in
the day. Crows finished third and Street Cat finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Mark Miller said Gail Gregson told police her husband faced
personal problems unrelated to racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, these things are just an awful blow to you,''
said Noble Threewitt, the veteran trainer who gave Gregson his
start as a horseman in the late 1960s. ``I visited with Eddie
almost every day. I visited with him (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Threewitt said Gregson didn't indicate anything was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his death, Gregson was president of California
Thoroughbred Trainers and an officer of the California Thoroughbred
Breeders Association. His life had been unusually eclectic for the
insular horse-racing world.
</P>
<P>
   Born Edwin Janss Gregson in Los Angeles on Aug. 7, 1938, the
nephew of real-estate developer Edwin Janss Jr., he graduated from
Stanford with a degree in European history and did post-graduate
work at Cal. He worked as an actor under contract to Warner Bros.
and 20th Century Fox, appearing in ``The Naked and the Dead''
(1958), in which his character was bitten by a snake, requiring him
to foam at the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (New York Times) review said the snake-bite scene was the
most exciting thing in the movie,'' Gregson told the Daily News in
1985. ``Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to further my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregson quit Hollywood and divorced actress May Britt after a
two-year marriage, went to work on a ranch and speculated in
Mexican cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Threewitt, who had trained for Ed Janss, recalled the uncle
saying, ``Eddie can't seem to find anything he wants to do. Now he
wants to train horses. Can you help him out?''
</P>
<P>
   After learning from Hall of Fame trainer Woody Stephens in New
York and Threewitt in California, Gregson opened his own stable in
1974. He will be remembered best for Gato del Sol, who won the
Derby at 21-1, and Super Diamond, the 1986 Hollywood Gold Cup
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Financially comfortable, his reputation established, Gregson had
the luxury of walking away from owners who disagreed with his
methods. He didn't saddle many horses in later years and won only
13 races in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gregson made news in recent months by speaking out against the
racing industry's permissiveness on equine medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a good horseman. He was very, very intelligent. He was
very honest,'' Threewitt said. ``I don't think you can say too many
good things about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregson is survived by Gail, his third wife, and daughters
Brooke and Esme. &QL;

HEMISPHERE GROUP PLANS TO SEND A MISSION TO PERU TO STUDY CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Subs for writethru.) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario _ Responding to the unopposed election of
Alberto Fujimori to a third term as president of Peru, foreign
ministers of the Americas agreed here Monday night to send a
mission to Lima to explore options for strengthening democracy in
Peru.
</P>
<P>
   The team is to be led by two critics of the May 28 voting in
Peru, Canada's foreign minister, Lloyd Axworthy, and Cesar Gaviria,
secretary general of the Organization of the American States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidential vote in Peru is a matter of deep concern to
us all,'' Axworthy said Monday morning before the vote. ``Left
unexamined, it will certainly diminish the credibility of this
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Opening the conference here on Sunday, Gaviria, a former
president of Colombia, cited attempted military coups in Ecuador
and Paraguay and the election problems in Peru, describing this as
``a year of trials, threats, and stumbling blocks for democracy in
the Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to face the fact that democracy can no longer be
considered an absolute certainty,'' Gaviria continued.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the election in Peru, he said bluntly, ``There were
irregularities, defects, inconsistencies and inequities in both
rounds of elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution left it up to the mission to decide on a
timetable for the mission and a forum for its reporting. Many
diplomats agreed that the mission would have most impact if it went
to Lima well before Fujimori's planned inauguration date, July 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a loss for the OAS if this becomes a high-level
fact-finding mission; we are beyond fact finding,'' said Eduardo
Stein, the former Guatemalan foreign minister who pulled his OAS
observer mission out of Peru two days before the May 28 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for an election administration that is independent of
Fujimori, a ban on the use of state resources for official
candidates, and full press access to all candidates, Stein said of
the new mission: ``Their role should be promoter and negotiator of
these changes _ as fast as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and Peruvian opposition legislators who gathered
here Monday called for new elections, and, failing that, concerted
pressure on Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to tell Fujimori that we have you under the
microscope here, your case is not under a done deal,'' said Jose
Miguel Vivanco, a Chilean lawyer who is executive director of the
Americas division of Human Rights Watch, a Washington-based
organization.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If the OAS does not take these minimal steps, the
message is the OAS will only react to confront bloody, unpopular
coups.''

POLICE NAME SUSPECT IN WOMEN'S DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO, RICHARD ESPINOZA and TANYANIKA SAMUELS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Prosecutors Monday
named the suspect in the killings of two women found buried in
barrels in a Kansas field, and authorities found three more barrels
in the man's Raymore storage locker.
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Edward Robinson Sr., 56, was being held Monday in the
Johnson County, Kan., Jail. Bond was $5 million _ the largest ever
set in the county.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he is charged with sexually assaulting two women after
meeting them for sadomasochistic encounters at hotels in Lenexa and
Overland Park, both in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County prosecutors said that Robinson, who has a
criminal record of fraud and theft charges dating to the 1960s,
would be facing homicide charges within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Robinson is a suspect in the deaths of the two women found
in the barrels in Linn County,'' District Attorney Paul Morrison
said. He said he did not expect anyone else to be charged in the
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the two women, who authorities think have been
dead for weeks, if not months, were found Saturday on land near La
Cygne, Kan., that Robinson bought in September.
</P>
<P>
   In Cass County, police Monday found three 55-gallon drums in the
locker at Stor-Mor For Less, 711 E. Missouri 58, Raymore Police
Chief Kris Turnbow said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County authorities learned last weekend that Robinson
had been renting the locker for about five years.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the barrels were sealed, but one was partly open.
</P>
<P>
   After looking inside that barrel, police sent all three of them
and other evidence to the Jackson County medical examiner's office
and the Kansas City police regional crime lab for analysis, Turnbow
said. He would not say what police saw in the open barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators remained at the storage facility into the night,
itemizing the contents.
</P>
<P>
   Cass County Prosecutor Chris Koster was to hold a news
conference at 1:30 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   In Linn County, Kan., investigators said they would continue to
search Robinson's property, where police dogs helped them find the
two drums on the west edge of the land. About 20 investigators,
including some from the FBI and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation,
were working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ground-searching every bit of the land involved, and
there is also a pond involved,'' said Linn County Sheriff Marvin
Stites. ``There's a possibility we may drain that pond.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the bodies resulted from a three-month
investigation. Robinson was arrested Friday at an Olathe mobile
home community where his wife works as a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said Monday that one of the bodies found Saturday was
thought to be that of a woman who was reported missing March 1. The
woman lived in another state that Morrison declined to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not know who the second victim was, but Morrison
said he thought she would be identified in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies were being conducted, and investigators said they had
a good idea how the women died, although they would not discuss the
causes of death.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the women Robinson was charged with sexually
assaulting traveled from Texas to have a sexual encounter with him
in April. The residence of the other woman, who met with Robinson
in May, was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson allegedly developed relationships on the Internet with
women interested in sadomasochistic encounters. He was known to use
the screen name ``slavemaster'' in his computer correspondence and
sometimes called himself James Turner in person, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case has to do with the suspect having numerous contacts
throughout the United States who share similar interests, over,
among other things, the Internet,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were looking for other women who had been in
contact Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Both women involved in the criminal charges told police that
they voluntarily agreed to act as ``sex slaves'' for Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   They said they objected to his photographing them during the
encounters, and both said he brutalized them in a way that went
beyond what they intended.
</P>
<P>
   The woman from Texas also reported that Robinson stole more than
$700 worth of whips, paddles, riding crops, rattan canes and other
sex toys from her.
</P>
<P>
   When she asked for her property back, he allegedly threatened to
reveal a signed ``slave contract'' to licensing authorities in
Texas, where she is a licensed psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson appeared in court Monday on the charges of aggravated
sexual battery and felony theft.
</P>
<P>
   He asked for a court-appointed attorney, and District Judge
William Cleaver appointed the public defender's office.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver also increased Robinson's bond from the $250,000 set
Friday to the $5 million requested Monday by Ted Baird, assistant
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Baird said prosecutors considered Robinson an ``extreme flight
risk'' with previous felony convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials in Kansas and Missouri said Robinson had been
incarcerated in both states in the 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Court records in Clay and Johnson counties show convictions for
theft, stealing and fraud-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors in Olathe said they had no idea of Robinson's criminal
past.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Timmons, who lives next to Robinson at the Santa Barbara
mobile home park, described him as a cordial neighbor who put out
yard decorations on holidays and seemed to keep to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Timmons said he was surprised when police arrested Robinson and
searched his trailer, which is on a fenced lot with an enclosed
patio. Timmons saw investigators pull coolers, large popcorn tins
and a toolbox from Robinson's garden shed. Later, he said, police
towed away Robinson's pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson has another trailer on his property in Linn County,
which he bought Sept. 28, 1999, according to county records.
Records show that the 16.5 acres and the trailer, which included a
deck, were valued at $36,670.
</P>
<P>
   The property is about two miles north of a high school and is
surrounded by farmland near La Cygne.
</P>
<P>
   Corn and soybeans grow in fields around Robinson's land. Several
duck hunting clubs are near the property.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie McGuire, 61, lives near Robinson's land but had not met
him. She and her husband, Tom, moved to the area in recent years
from Mission Hills and built a house.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire said she occasionally saw a pickup truck outside
Robinson's trailer but had seen nothing suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``You move to the country and you don't expect anything like
this to happen,'' she said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE LAKERS' BRIDGE TO PROMISING FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Inside their locker room Sunday, Shaquille O'Neal
and Kobe Bryant quietly sat with their Laker teammates and listened
to Coach Phil Jackson's final instructions for Game 7.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe 20 yards away in a corridor of the Staples Center, Magic
Johnson held court before the deciding game of the Western
Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of playoff frustration, Johnson was wondering the
same as everyone who has watched O'Neal and Bryant grow and mature
the past four seasons: Were they ready to fuse the Lakers' magical
past with its promising future?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it means to Shaq,'' said Johnson, who led the
Lakers to their last finals in 1990. ``He wants to get that loser's
tag off his back. I know how much this means to him. It means a lot
to those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest fourth-quarter comeback in NBA history was still a
few hours away, the night the Lakers came back from 15 points down
in the final 10 minutes 28 seconds and shocked the Portland Trail
Blazers, 89-84, before the most raucous and unlaid-back L.A. crowd
anyone could remember.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had not yet scored 9 of his 18 points in the final
period, shelving his frustration at being mobbed by Blazers
underneath the basket so that he could find open teammates on the
perimeter with the game in the balance. It was long before he would
calmly collect on 8 of 12 free throws, including two with 2:44 left
that tied the score at 77-77.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had yet to put up an eye-opening line of 25 points, 11
rebounds, 7 assists and 4 blocked shots. He had not yet broken a
tie with a scintillating jump shot left of the free-throw line with
1:34 left or thrown that impossible lob pass to the right of the
rim with 41.3 seconds remaining that O'Neal threw down, the most
pressurized alley-oop dunk of any playoff series, ever.
</P>
<P>
   Before their heroics, O'Neal and Bryant were merely two young
all-stars trying to find their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For so long, Kobe and Shaq and all of us were in a mode of not
being able to prove ourselves when it mattered,'' Rick Fox said.
``After a while, that wears on you. I'm still processing all of it.
You come so far and you lose your way, and then you have to work so
hard to get back to where you were. We found our way. And we kept
going.''
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last vestige of Showtime left the Fabulous Forum and
the Magic stopped in 1990 many have tried to pass this franchise
off as a passable imitation. The Lakers of Shaq and Kobe were a
team of marketable faces, flair, the only consistent ratings
grabber after Michael Jordan retired.
</P>
<P>
   But they had this awful habit of wilting as the postseason wore
on. Whether Utah swept the Lakers in the 1998 conference finals or
San Antonio accomplished the feat in the second round of the 1999
playoffs, they always managed to die hard.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much that they lost but the way they lost that gave
the appearance of little character and resolve. How could a team
with the most awesome physical presence in the game and one of the
most exciting young players come apart at the hinges so easily? Why
weren't they more durable and resilient?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we doubted ourselves after every season,''
O'Neal said. ``But after a while, you read the newspapers and
listen to what people are saying about you. You can't help but let
that either get you down or motivate you to change people's
perceptions. That's what we did, changed people's perceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to happen in a blink, but the legwork was already
there on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though they fell behind early, Bryant was collaring rebounds in
the first half as if he were a power forward, swinging his elbows
to clear space among the Redwood Blazers. For all his talent and
highlight reels, he went after Bonzi Wells, Scottie Pippen and
Steve Smith on the defensive end as if only playing that end of the
floor mattered.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal took a while to find a rhythm and didn't lose his temper
against Arvydas Sabonis and the rest of Portland's front line, who
grabbed, fronted and bumped him to no end. He, too, worked hard on
both ends, at one point diving into the third row of seats to hunt
down a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   As the comeback began and their shots started to fall, there
would be no more meltdowns. It was just two veterans determined to
let a season of accomplishment slip away on their home floor. They
would go onto to face the Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the finals
Wednesday night at the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   In one quarter, the old issues died and they suddenly became
prohibitive favorites to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, when you get here, you've got to win it,''
Jackson said. ``We may have learned enough at this point to know
how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, pumping his fist and smiling, was almost as ecstatic as
O'Neal and Bryant after the improbable Game 7 victory that most of
Los Angeles is still buzzing about Sunday, the night the Lakers'
magical past fused seamlessly together with its promising future. &QL;

KICKING BACK IN THE NORTH OF SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
(Editors: The 3rd take is a 400-word guide to flights, hotels and
restaurants.) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we traveled west from Bilbao along the northern coast of
Spain, the landscape dulled. Behind us was the high drama of the
Pyrenees, which we had skirted. Behind us were the elegant,
well-ripened cities of San Sebastian and Bilbao. Before us lay, as
far as we knew, a rural area of Spain with an ancient religious
route leading to Santiago de Compostela and a climate like that of
England, hardly the Spain of reputation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, my friend and I were traveling on the A6, a major
highway, zipping along so that what we were taking in was like
frames of film, hardly enough to comprehend and consider. About two
hours west of Bilbao, in the town of Torrelavega, the highway
stopped. It was as if it had been sliced off at the end like
sausage, diverting speeding cars onto a much smaller, much slower
road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the highway ended right there, before we even
got to Asturias, the region where we were headed for four days at
the end of August. We swept through the seaside town of San Vicente
de la Barquera, compressed into a sliver of an inlet.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The road undulated between hills and the sea, offering us
tempting glimpses. But dimming ones. It was getting dark and the
roads were getting smaller, eventually narrowing to a single lane.
We had booked a room in a bed-and-breakfast in a converted mill,
which we had found on the Internet.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As we approached Tresgrandas, the town where our hotel was, we
were in for another surprise. Tresgrandas was no town. It was
barely a hamlet. As we turned down the lane leading to our
bed-and-breakfast, we were sure we had it all wrong. It was the
kind of grade you find on a double black diamond ski slope, not a
road, and it took us to what felt like the bottom of a well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But there was indeed a bed-and-breakfast and an enormous,
friendly and slobbery mastiff to greet us. We settled in, had
dinner and went to bed in our small rustic room. There were more
surprises in the morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asturias is incongruous with much of the rest of Spain. It is
green and damp and sprinkled with small farms. I sometimes felt
that I was in Northern California, sometimes in England or
Switzerland. The region has for the most part tried to avoid the
sort of development that would change the landscape, and the
visitors it draws are mostly Spaniards from the south and a few
British tourists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the area of Asturias and bits of Cantabria we were visiting,
there were no great resorts to speak of, no architectural works of
note by Gaudi, no wineries or great restaurants, and no well-known
museums. Other than a little hiking in the national forest, we
didn't have an agenda _ and as we discovered, we didn't need one.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our bed-and-breakfast was nestled in a valley of hills that
rolled like the sea. A 10-minute drive north and the land dropped
off into the ocean, much as it does in Dover, from high cliffs. A
10-minute drive south and we were in the bosom of the Picos de
Europa, a mountain range that explodes from the earth like an
iceberg on a calm sea. We could swim or go hiking or just take long
drives down the narrow passages carved through the mountains. We
did all three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, we woke to the cries of roosters and the rush of
water. The roosters were out in the yard and the water ran right
beneath the hotel, as it had when it was a flour mill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast was more than we could have wished for. The eggs were
from the hens on the property, the cheese from the sheep, the jams,
delicious reductions of fruits grown in the valley. The owners,
Luis Sanz and Carmen Garcia, raised the hens, made the cheese and
jams (pumpkin and orange, berry and peach) and even the bunuelos, a
kind of beignet, they served us. Each day the cheeses changed and
so did the jams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sanz and Garcia moved to Tresgrandas to escape the pressures of
city life in Madrid, where they were caterers. On their Internet
site, they recount how they restored the 18th-century mill. We were
charmed by it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sanz and Garcia run their hotel with its handful of rooms well
(just a few of the rooms were occupied when we were there, but
weekends are booked through next February), though they come across
more as idealists, determined to live close to the earth, than
hosts. Sanz, whom we saw most often, has lots of information to
share but you must work it out of him.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That first day we took a drive that began as a morning excursion
and lasted all day. We headed toward the Picos de Europa, intent on
driving along the Desfiladero de La Hermida, a gorge cutting
through the mountains near La Hermida. Getting there took us
through village after village, each its own historical collage. New
houses were latched to ruins, cars yielding to heifers and goats,
old women in housedresses yelling after brightly dressed children. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before we reached the gorge, we stopped at the Hostal Covadonga,
a hotel and restaurant in the center of Panes. The front porch was
filled with men wearing berets and smoking cigars, their faces
gray. I was the only woman there for lunch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We ordered beers and cocido, a stew of white beans, leeks, blood
sausage and ham. It was as thick as mud, and unbelievably good.
White cottony rolls were served to soak up the sauce. We sat out on
the veranda and ate quietly, listening to the music of the place _
the church bells, the clapping of dominoes and the talk of men
inside the restaurant. It was tempting to linger. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back on the road the hills rose and fell, then suddenly soared
vertically all around us. These were the Picos de Europa. The road
along the River Deva struggled and swerved through the gorge. At
points the mountains were so steep and so close together the day
became twilight. We drove and drove; it took us all afternoon on
the two-lane road to pass through the range, a distance of about 35
miles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the mountains again gave way to swells of green hills, we
stopped in Carmona, a small village with nothing particular to
offer other than a glimpse of the life of local farmers. We passed
two men carving wooden clogs, then stopped to watch a game similar
to boules. There was a healthy crowd of spectators, mostly older
men in berets and clogs or felt slippers, murmuring to one another
as the players tossed the ball with the grace and precision of
dancers.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   We went hiking in the mountains another day, this time pressing
by car further into the range, to Fuente De. Along the quiet,
scenic roads, we stopped in Lebena to see the Santa Maria, a
10th-century Mozarabic church, our only glimpse of the ancient
pilgrims' route to Santiago de Compostela. It sits dwarfed by a
rock face so magnificent and large that the church seems to cower
before it. In the capitals and cornices carvings of sun and stars
remain.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just outside the church is a small food shack, run by a man who
looks as if he just stumbled out of a tavern. He sells dated
postcards and tour books, and local cheeses and beer. The cheeses
sit under a towel in the open air with flies buzzing around. The
man cut us wedges of Cabrales and a smoked sheep's milk cheese, and
with his hands tore off a few pieces of baguette. Cabrales cheese
is traditionally made in Asturias, but it is increasingly difficult
to find made by artisan cheesemakers. These cheeses were it; they
were nutty, rich and had an aroma as potent as lilacs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was just the fuel we would need. At Fuente De the mountains
do not so much rise as scream out of the ground. A gondola carries
people up the 2,950-foot climb (the mountains rise 8,000 feet) in a
few minutes that felt like hours, for me at least. At the top,
there were hikers, paragliders and a number of people hanging out
on rocks taking in the vast, majestic view of the mountain range.
We hiked away from them, and soon were on open steep slopes of
pasture with a light wind cooling us, and carrying the songs of
bells on the cows and sheep in the hills. The air was thin and
clear; beyond lay a jagged, steel-colored horizon of mountains.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are hiking trails throughout the mountain range for all
skill levels. This challenging wander of a mile or so was more our
speed.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another day _ which was warm and just suggestively humid as most
of our days were _ we drove along the coast to Santi-llana del Mar,
a medieval town with cobblestone streets and architecture that is
remarkably consistent and unchanged. A beautiful town that knows
it, it is unfortunately littered with tourist shops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That excursion was one of a few mistakes we made. We also took a
drive to Comillas, a town along the coast, to see El Capricho (The
Whim), a house designed by Gaudi in 1885. It is wild and beautiful
like much of his work, but it is merely a shell. The interior has
been converted into an expensive restaurant.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We wasted a dinner at another ambitious restaurant in a small
country village. The meal was fine, but had very little to do with
Asturias or even Spanish food for that matter.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asturias is the kind of place where there is no artifice. The
people are friendly and generous, the food is simple and
satisfying, the landscape yours to admire. It reminded me of what I
had read about rural France in old travel books but have yet to
find there.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Our best experiences were those we had tooling around the
villages near our hotel. For lunch one day we stopped at the Meson
el Paso, a truck stop along the regional coastal road, E70. When we
entered, a woman turned on the lights and ambled back to the
kitchen. It did not look promising. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A waiter finally pulled himself from the television set in the
bar and told us the fish of the day. I began with arroz con
almejas, a dish of clams and rice in a bright green herb broth. My
friend had scrambled eggs with shrimp, pleurottes (a mushroom) and
roe. Both made us dizzy with pleasure. The shrimp were so fresh and
so perfectly cooked, they popped in your mouth and were sweet as
the sea. The mushrooms were nutty, the roe salty, the eggs like
those from Sanz's hen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next, we shared a daurade, or sea bass. It tasted, as my friend
said, ``as if they had stuck a frying pan out the back window and
it leapt in from the sea.'' We recovered at the Playa de la Franca,
a beach just down the road, a suggestion of Sanz. We loved it so
much we decided to spend our last day there as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The beach is public and lies in a deep, narrow cove surrounded
by high cliffs. When the tide is in, the beach is small and
enclosed, but as the tide goes out, it rolls out like a great long
carpet, allowing you to make your way along the shore and walk
through vast tunnels carved by the sea water into the cliffs. It is
a dream playground for children and there are plenty of them,
browned by the sun and gleeful. It was filled with Spanish families
on summer vacation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the back of the cove are a number of rundown shacks serving
food. We thought we would grab a simple bite, a sandwich and beer.
Seeing a menu of fish at one of them, we were skeptical, until a
man in chef's whites appeared. I thought a long day in the sun must
be playing tricks on my mind. But he helped us select a live crab,
lifting some from a cooler and poking them as they crept across the
counter. Then he cooked it for us.
</P>
<P>
   We sat in our wet bathing suits and bare feet, looking out onto
the beach. We had anchovies and peppers with the sweet crab, and a
plate of cheeses to finish. The chef then brought us orujo, a local
digestif.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We wore ourselves out in the waves, then took a nap before
dinner. Our last of the trip, it was at Casa Poli in nearby Puertas
de Vidiago. It is a sidreria, or restaurant where the local cider
and tapas are served. Locals will tell you that their sidra, or
cider, is like the cider made in Normandy. Don't believe them. It
is fruity, viscous and just a step up from vinegar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is so vigorously acidic that it is not even drunk straight.
To drink it the traditional way you must stand up holding the
bottle above your head, then pour it behind your back into a glass
held in your other hand. As the liquid falls and hits the glass _ a
rare occurrence _ it aerates and lightens, making it more
palatable. The idea is to pour just a little bit, a quarter inch or
so, into the glass, then drink it quickly while it's still good.
Whatever is not drunk in the first gulp is then poured into a
bucket beside the table. Luckily it's cheap _ cheap enough not to
perplex you too much about why the Asturians haven't just fixed the
flavor.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We may not have been drunk on sidra, but by this point we were
drunk on Asturias. It is difficult in Europe to feel you are in a
place that is somehow separate or undiscovered. But Asturias does
feel that way. Perhaps that is why they have left the highway to
the region severed the way it is _ a sign that fast-paced,
ambitious tourists should stop right there.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The closest airports are in Oviedo in Asturias and Santander in
Cantabria. There are also flights to Bilbao, two hours east of
Asturias. It is necessary to have a car. The best time to visit
Asturias is in summer, when it's the least rainy and you can hike
in the mountains and go to the beach. Fall and spring are also
fine, though the Atlantic may be too chilly for swimming. &QL; 
WHERE TO STAY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   El Molino de Tresgrandas, Tresgrandas, (34-985) 41-11-91,
www.molinotresgrandas .com, has eight rooms, some in the main
house, some in an attached cottage. All are simply furnished, with
tiled bathrooms. There are no views to speak of, but every room is
filled with the music of the stream running beneath the hotel. A
full breakfast with homemade jams and eggs from the henhouse costs
$4.65. Rooms are $52 plus 7 percent tax; the hotel is closed the
first two weeks in February.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Venta de Carmona, Barrio del Palacio, Carmona, (34-942)
72-80-57, stands like a grand villa in this small village. In fact,
its eight rooms, all with bathrooms, $46 a night, 7 percent tax
included, are all unpretentious, simple and spare; the hotel is
decorated with antiques and still lifes of fresh gourds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Casas de Aldea,'' available at local tourist offices, is a
guide to Spanish country houses that, like Venta de Carmona, have
been converted into hotels. &QL; 
WHERE TO EAT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meson el Paso de Buelna, (34-985) 41-12-05, is a small tavern on
Route N634 in Buelna, frequented by truck drivers. The small
restaurant serves extraordinary fresh fish, sauteed on its skin,

SCULPTOR LEONARD BASKIN, 77, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonard Baskin, a figurative sculptor and graphic artist whose
work varied from a Holocaust memorial to a prize-winning children's
book but dealt mostly with the human condition in angst-ridden
terms, died on Saturday in Northampton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin was 77 and lived in Northampton. He had been treated for
kidney problems for several months, said Richard Michelson, his
primary representative since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In an art world given to changing styles and continually updated
aesthetic agendas centering on abstraction, Baskin remained
steadfast in his belief in the superiority of figurative art and
the importance of mortality as a theme. His convictions brought him
honors and important commissions, including those for the bas
relief of a funeral cortege that he created for the Franklin Delano
Roosevelt Memorial in Washington and an anguished, heavily draped
seated cast-bronze figure, 7 feet tall, for the Ann Arbor Holocaust
Memorial in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Widely read and articulate, Baskin could be acidly funny,
referring to Pop Art, for example, as ``the inedible raised to the
level of the unspeakable.'' Or he could pontificate in biblical
sonorities, as in a frequently quoted statement published in Time
magazine: ``Our human frame, our gutted mansion, our enveloping
sack of beef and ash is yet a glory. Glorious in defining our
universal sodality and glorious in defining our utter uniqueness.
The human figure is the image of all men and of one man. It
contains all and can express all.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin's art did its best to keep up with this sense of urgency
and drama. In sculptures of wood, limestone or bronze, and the
large-scale wood block prints that may be his most lasting
achievement, his figures often had scabrous surfaces, appeared
bloated or malformed, and sometimes merged with animals. His
favorite figure was the owl, whose predatory habits fascinated him.
</P>
<P>
   If Baskin's figures did not appear to be actively suffering or
simply dead, they often appeared to be in numbed, introspective
states.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin was born in New Brunswick, N.J., the son of a rabbi who
moved his family to New York seven years later. By age 14 he knew
he wanted to be a sculptor; at 15 he began a two-year
apprenticeship to the sculptor Maurice Glickman. At 18 he won an
honorable mention for the Prix de Rome.
</P>
<P>
   He studied art at New York University's School of Architecture
and Applied Arts, and, on scholarship, at Yale University from 1941
to 1943. He discovered the illustrated books of William Blake in a
library at Yale, an encounter that inspired him both to teach
himself printing and, in 1942, to found the Gehenna Press, which
became noted for its fine typography and superbly illustrated
limited-edition books. Its first publication was a small book of
Baskin's own poems, titled ``On a Pyre of Withered Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific during the final
years of World War II and working for a period in the Merchant
Marine, Baskin returned to New York and earned his bachelor's
degree at the New School for Social Research in 1949. He then spent
a year studying at the Academie de la Grade Chaumiere in Paris, and
another year at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Florence, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Europe on a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1953, Baskin
found himself attracted to a variety of figurative sculpture,
including the effigy tomb sculpture of the Middle Ages, the early
Renaissance carving of Giovanni Pisano and the 19th- and
20th-century work of Rodin, Manzu and especially the German
Expressionist sculptor Ernst Barlach.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin had his first solo show in New York at the Grace
Borgenicht Gallery in 1953, exhibiting regularly there and with the
Boris Mirski Gallery in Boston throughout the 1950s and '60s. His
work figured prominently in the ``New Images of Man'' exhibition at
the Museum of Modern Art in New York and was included in the
biannual exhibitions in Sao Paulo in 1961 and Venice in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin taught sculpture and printmaking at Smith College in
Northampton, Mass., from 1953 until 1974 and at Hampshire College
in nearby Amherst from 1984 to 1994. He and his family lived in
England during the intervening decade.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin's most recent solo show was at the Salander O'Reilly
Galleries in Manhattan in 1997. His work is represented in public
collections across the country and has been the subject of numerous
retrospectives.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin was a lifelong collector of prints and old and rare
books, calling collecting ``the only activity I know of that
involves every one of the seven deadly sins, even sloth.'' His
obsession with books was more actively expressed in the dozens he
designed or illustrated. For the Gehenna Press, which published
more than 100 books and was still operating at the time of his
death, these included editions of Blake's ``Augeries of
Innocence,'' Euripedes' ``Hippolytos,'' and Ted Hughes' ``Primer of
Birds.''
</P>
<P>
   The books Baskin illustrated for other publishers included
several more collections of Hughes' poetry, as well as works by
Dante, Homer, Conrad, Swift, Tennyson, and by his first wife,
Esther Tane Baskin, who died in 1967. His illustrated children's
book ``Hosie's Alphabet'' won the Caldecott Medal in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin is survived by his wife, Lisa Unger Baskin; a son from
his first marriage, Tobias Baskin, of Columbia, Mo.; two children
from his second marriage, Hosea Baskin and Lucretia Baskin, of
Northampton, Mass.; a brother, Rabbi Bernard Baskin, of Hamilton,
Ontario; a sister, Pearl Rabinowitz, of Massapequa, N.Y., and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the broad range of his work, Baskin disdained color,
saying, ``Black and White is all I need.''
</P>
<P>
   He also did not depict women. ``The female form is useful for
some ideas,'' he said in 1964, ``but the colossal male is better
suited to the ghoulish ones I try to portray.''

MARLINS TAKE FIRST BASEMAN WITH FIRST PICK IN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone with professional baseball as his goal, the San Diego
area is apparently the place to live. Holding their annual draft of
amateur players Monday, major league teams selected six players
from that area, including two from the same high school, in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Gonzalez, a left-handed-hitting first baseman, was the
No. 1 pick in the draft, chosen by the Florida Marlins, and the
first of the five San Diego players taken.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who batted .645 and drove in 34 runs in 76 at-bats
this season, was given a $3 million signing bonus. Some baseball
people speculated that the Marlins had planned to take Scott Heard,
a catcher from Rancho Bernardo High School in San Diego, but that
Heard rejected their bonus offer.
</P>
<P>
   Al Avila, the club's scouting director, denied that economics
played a role in the decision. John Boggs, a San Diego area agent
who advised the Gonzalez family in the negotiations with the
Marlins, said the Marlins also denied that Heard had turned down $4
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they came to us,'' Boggs said by telephone from Miami,
``they said they had a figure, and if it was something we weren't
going to be comfortable with, they had other options. Adrian's real
focus was to get his career started. He made the ultimate decision.
He didn't want a protracted negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Heard went much lower in the first round than had been expected.
The Texas Rangers made him the 25th player selected. His
batterymate, Matt Wheatland, a right-hander, was the eighth player
drafted, going to the Detroit Tigers. Their selection marked only
the third time in the 35-year history of the draft that high school
teammates were selected in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel kind of blessed that I've had two kids like that
on the team,'' Sam Blalock, the Rancho Bernardo baseball coach,
said by telephone from San Diego. ``It's so nice to see such poised
and mature baseball players.''
</P>
<P>
   Also selected in the first round were Adam Johnson, a
right-handed pitcher from San Diego and California State University
at Fullerton, taken as the second pick by Minnesota; Shaun Boyd, a
high school second baseman from a San Diego suburb, taken as the
13th player by St. Louis; and Robert Stiehl, a catcher, chosen as
the 27th player by Houston. Stiehl attends El Camino Junior College
in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Wheatland, Heard and Boyd competed against each other this
season in the Palomar League of the North County Conference. Also
on a team in that league was Anthony Gwynn, son of the Padres' Tony
Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, whose high school is in the southern part of the
county, said having so many good players and teams in the area was
beneficial to him. ``You always look in paper to see how they're
doing, and you want to do better than them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our league is one of the toughest in the nation year
in and year out,'' said Blalock, whose team won the section title
for the second successive season. Yet another of his players, David
Giorgis, the right fielder, was selected by the Padres in the
eighth round.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' first-round selection, David Parrish, son of Lance,
the former Detroit catcher, was one of several sons of former major
leaguers drafted. The group also included shortstop Aaron Herr, son
of Tom, by Atlanta in the ``sandwich'' free-agent compensation
round between the first and second rounds; third baseman Lance
Niekro, son of Joe, by San Francisco in the second round; pitcher
Kyle Gross, son of Wayne, by the Giants in the fifth round; and
pitcher Jason Fingers, son of Rollie, by Kansas City in the 10th
round.

   THE HOUSE
</P>
<P>
   ENDORSEMENTS WITHDRAWN
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters union has withdrawn its endorsement of two
Democratic House members _ Lois Capps of California and Tom Sawyer
of Ohio _ because they supported the China trade bill. The move
could undercut labor's push to help Democrats regain control of the
House. But Bret Caldwell, a Teamsters spokesman, said the
1.4-million-member union, one of the largest in the AFL-CIO, was
more concerned about ``whether members of Congress will stand up
when it counts for working families.'' The endorsement withdrawals
were part of a reassessment of all 73 House Democrats who backed
the China bill. Other House Democrats who face a strong chance of
losing the Teamsters' endorsement, Caldwell said, include Martin T.
Meehan and Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, Tom Allen of Maine,
Sander M. Levin of Michigan and Dennis Moore of Kansas. The
Teamsters and the Auto Workers, which also opposed the trade deal,
are by far the strongest unions in Moore's district, which he won
by a razor-thin margin in 1998.

   THE STATES
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARIES IN 5 STATES
</P>
<P>
   Five states hold the last of the presidential primaries Tuesday,
their role about as useful to politics as the appendix is to
people, thanks to the big rush this year by many states to hold
early primaries. The five states are Alabama, Montana, New Jersey,
New Mexico and South Dakota. While some contests, notably the
Senate primaries in New Jersey, are expected to draw voters, there
is not likely to be a lot of enthusiasm for casting a Bush or Gore
vote. That was the case two weeks ago in the Kentucky primary,
where the turnout was just 14 percent of enrolled Democrats and 11
percent of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   GORE BYPASSES TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas decided to skip his
state's Republican convention because he is so far ahead in
presidential preference polls there. Now Vice President Al Gore
most likely will bypass the Texas Democratic Party's state
convention for, well, the same reason. Texas is going to be
``difficult'' for Gore in the fall, so he probably will not show
for the June 9-10 gathering, the state's Democratic leader, Molly
Beth Malcolm, told the Dallas Morning News recently. ``It makes
more sense,'' she said, ``that he would go to one of those states
where possibly he has a real shot at winning.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE REPUBLICANS
</P>
<P>
   HITTING GORE WHERE HE LIVES
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and officials with the Bush campaign have an
insatiable appetite for making fun of Vice President Al Gore's
retoolings, restylings and resolves to make sure that voters get to
know him better, and Monday they bit into some fresh meat. A Bush
campaign official, speaking to reporters in Austin, Tex., said that
one of the states in which the Democratic National Committee had
investigated the cost and availability of air time for biographical
television commercials about Gore was Tennessee. There's a certain
poetry to this, the official said. They're going to put a bio ad on
in Tennessee to reintroduce him to all of those hometown people who
have grown distant to him over the years. The official conceded
that some states on the list may be there to divert attention from
the real targets, and Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for the DNC, said
the committee had not made ``a final decision about if we'll go up,
when we'll go up, what we'll go up with and where we'll go up with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GREEN PARTY
</P>
<P>
   NADER CHOOSES RUNNING MATE
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader said over the weekend that if he wins the
presidential nomination of the Green Party, as is expected, he
wanted an American Indian activist, Winona LaDuke, on the ballot as
the party's candidate for vice president. LaDuke is a Harvard
graduate from the White Earth Indian Reservation in northwestern
Minnesota, where she farms and writes. She was Nader's running mate
four years ago. Ten years ago, she started the White Earth Land
Recovery Project, an effort to win back lands taken from
Minnesota's Objibwa tribe. Nader, who is running on a promise to
end corporate influence in government and put more power in the
hands of citizens, called LaDuke ``a very accomplished person.''
The Green Party holds its convention later this month. &QL;

SUPREME COURT'S VISITATION RULING GOES AGAINST GRANDPARENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday struck down as
``breathtakingly broad'' a Washington state law that allows anyone
_ including grandparents _ to petition for visitation rights to
children against their parents' wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The high court stressed that parents have a constitutional right
to raise their children free from government interference. But the
court did not strike down the other grandparent visitation laws
that exist in some variation in all 50 states, or set standards for
how those laws should protect the rights of parents. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Legal analysts said the 6-3 ruling will likely prompt state
legislatures and courts to examine whether the laws sufficiently
narrow a court's discretion in granting grandparents visitation
over a parent's objections.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling leaves Seattle-area grandparents Gary and
Jenifer Troxel without any legal claim to visitation with their two
granddaughters. They filed suit demanding overnight visitation with
the girls after their son Brad Troxel &UR;  &LR; killed himself &UR;  &LR;  in 1993 and
the girls' mother, Tommie Granville Wynn, began limiting _ but not
denying _ the grandparents' visits.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels were granted visitation by a Washington superior
court judge, but Granville appealed the decision. The case
ultimately reached the Washington Supreme Court, which ruled that
the state's third-party visitation statute unconstitutionally
interferes with the fundamental rights of parents to raise their
children.
</P>
<P>
   The broad Washington state law allows anyone, at any time, to
sue for court-ordered visits with other people's children. The law
does not require previous custody or any familial relationship, and
leaves the determination of the ``best interest of the child''
solely to the presiding judge. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The Troxels' attorney, Mark Olson, said Monday that his clients
would now approach the girls' mother for the one afternoon a month
of visitation she had originally offered before they sued.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Cheryl Matheis, director of state legislation for the
AARP, said there may be room to debate the Supreme Court's wording,
but that she believes the court struck down the Washington law on
its face, and as applied in the &UR;  &LR; Troxel case. AARP attorneys helped
write most of the grandparent visitation laws across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Supreme Court is saying to the legislatures is, if
you're going to write a third-party visitation statute, write
something with some standards defined,'' said Sanford Ain, a
Washington, D.C., family law attorney who wrote a brief in this
case for the American Association of Matrimonial Lawyers. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Tommie Granville Wynn was delighted with the decision, said
attorney Howard Goodfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision affirms what she has stated all along _ that fit
parents are the persons who get to make the decisions about when
and where their children visit with other people,'' Goodfriend
said. ``Even though it's an opinion on only one statute, it's going
to have some precedential effect on other statues.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote the controlling opinion,
noted that the ``demographic changes of the past century make it
difficult to speak of an average American family.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide enactment of nonparental visitation statutes is due
in part to states' recognition of the changing realities of the
American family, she wrote, because grandparents and other
relatives take on the duties of a parental nature in many
households. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that more than 2.5
million grandparents are raising their children's children.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Connor stressed that the 14th Amendment due process clause
preserves the interest of parents in the ``care, custody and
control of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as a parent adequately cares for his or her children
... there will normally be no reason for the state to inject itself
into the private realm of the family to further question the
ability of that parent to make the best decisions concerning the
rearing of that parent's children,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Troxels did not claim that Granville was an unfit parent,

MERRILL SAID TO BE IN TALKS TO PURCHASE HERZOG HEINE
</HEADLINE>
  By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to play a much bigger role in trading on the
Nasdaq stock market, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is in serious discussions
to buy Herzog Heine Geduld Inc. for nearly $1 billion, according to
people close to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal that could be announced as soon as Tuesday, Merrill is
negotiating to use its stock to buy Herzog, a private company based
in Jersey City that serves as an intermediary, or market maker,
between buyers and sellers of Nasdaq stocks. Herzog is the
third-biggest market maker in Nasdaq stocks and Merrill has been
plotting lately to expand its market-making business.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Merrill and of Herzog declined to comment on
the matter after it was reported Monday by the Dow Jones Newswires.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the Knight Trading Group, the No. 1 market maker with
18 percent of Nasdaq trades, fell 13 percent Monday, to $30.9375,
on concerns that an aggressive move by Merrill would divert some of
the flow of trades that go from Merrill and other brokerage firms
to Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Herzog, which handles about 9 percent of Nasdaq trades,
would represent a reversal for Merrill in a couple of ways: the
firm has sharply cut back its Nasdaq trading business in the last
few years and its executives have been reluctant to make any big
acquisitions after its last buying binge depressed its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq market, many firms can make a market in a
particular stock, by standing ready to buy shares from willing
sellers or sell shares to buyers. Market makers keep the difference
between what they pay sellers and what they receive from buyers, a
difference known as the spread.
</P>
<P>
   Spreads on Nasdaq trading shrank after the National Association
of Securities Dealers, which runs the Nasdaq market, put in place
new rules in the wake of lawsuits that contended that market makers
colluded to keep spreads unjustifiably high. The investigation
caused by those suits culminated in a $1 billion settlement paid by
dozens of Wall Street firms, including Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   With their trading profits drying up, some big firms chose to
make markets only in the most popular Nasdaq stocks, leaving
thousands of others to traditional market-making firms like Herzog.
Some technology-based newcomers, like Knight, formerly
Knight-Trimark, stepped in to the void and showed that market
making remained a profitable business. In recent weeks, Merrill,
the No. 6 market maker, has been telling traders that it planned to
quadruple the number of stocks in which it makes a market to about
2,000 from about 550. Merrill had planned to set up a Nasdaq
trading site in Jersey City that would serve as its beefed-up
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were divided on whether buying Herzog was a smart move
for Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When better to buy a Nasdaq market maker than after a Nasdaq
crash?'' said Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   He said Merrill appeared to be copying a model that has worked
well for its rival discount brokerage firm, Charles Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab routes many of its customers' Nasdaq stock trades to its
own Jersey City-based market-making operation in a practice known
as internalization that is becoming a buzzword on Wall Street.
Keeping trades in-house gives the firm more information about which
way stock prices are headed, data that it can use to trade for its
own account.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, the No. 2 market maker with 12 percent of Nasdaq trades,
has been a notable dissenter to proposals to create a central book
of all existing orders to buy and sell Nasdaq stocks. Merrill and
other big Wall Street firms had supported such a change, but lately
that support has been weakening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Merrill has a clear idea of where market reform is
going,'' Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Butte, a Bear, Stearns analyst, said that buying Herzog
would make Merrill a big market maker quickly. ``In making this
acquisition, they would look a lot more like Schwab,'' she said.
But, she added, market makers' profits are threatened again by the
Securities and Exchange Commission's plan to change the structure
of the U.S. stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, Butte has recommended against buying Knight
stock, in part, because she believes that the profits of pure
market makers are likely to be squeezed. Based on the price Herzog
reportedly would fetch, she said, Knight's stock price is much too
high.

HARRINGTON LEADS LOCAL CONTINGENT ON DRAFT'S FIRST DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His pitching prowess never in question, Matt
Harrington's prize for his stellar Palmdale High career and golden
right arm is being drafted by the Colorado Rockies _ where stellar
careers and golden arms go flying out of Coors Field along with
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm freaking relieved. I'm thrilled,'' Harrington said after
being chosen seventh overall in Monday's Major League Baseball
First-Year Player Draft. ``I don't have concerns. Maybe it'll make
me a better pitcher. I've got to make the same pitches, whether I'm
in Dodger Stadium or in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was the first local player taken and one of four
selected in the first round. Camarillo graduate Joe Borchard, a
Stanford outfielder, went 12th to the Chicago White Sox; UCLA
second baseman Chase Utley went to Philadelphia with the 15th pick
and the Mets took Loyola Marymount pitcher Billy Traber at No.16.
</P>
<P>
   Five other local college players, including Pepperdine catcher
Dane Sardinha (second round, 46th overall to Cincinnati) were
drafted before the next area high schooler, Highland of Palmdale
pitcher Matt Parris, taken in the sixth round (No.168 overall) by
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The first 20 rounds were Monday and the final 30 rounds are
today.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington had been featured on the cover of Baseball America
and mentioned in Sports Illustrated. There had been talk he would
go in the first five picks, so some might be surprised he was
available when Colorado drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: On Sunday, Minnesota, owner of the second pick,
called Harrington and offered him about $3 million to sign.
Baseball America reported online that Florida agreed to close to
that same amount with San Diego first baseman Adrian Gonzalez, who
the Marlins made the No.1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's parents, Bill and Sue, thought the Twins' offer was
fair but left the decision to their son. On advice from advisors
Tommy Tanzer and Jeff Kahn, Harrington declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, meanwhile, also called and told Harrington they
would pay him what he was worth, not basing his signing bonus on
the amounts other draft picks received. Harrington was satisfied
and went to school hoping he would be available when Colorado
picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockies are a better fit,'' Harrington said. ``The Twins
wanted to slot me and pay me less than No.1. In a lot of people's
opinion, he (Gonzalez) is not the No.1 guy. A lot of people thought
I was, so Tommy thought I should be paid (appropriately).''
</P>
<P>
   Borchard had a different dilemma: baseball or football?
</P>
<P>
   He could return to Stanford and be the Cardinal starting
quarterback this fall. Or he could sign for seven figures and play
for the White Sox. Or he could try and do both: Play a short summer
with Chicago and return to school for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to entertain that option,'' Borchard said in a
conference call, ``but I'm not sure what the White Sox feel about
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough decision, considering how much time I've devoted
to football. It's hard to give something like that up when you get
to take the reins, so to speak. When I play football, I miss summer
and fall (ball). From the end of June to Jan. 2, I don't pick up a
bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Borchard knows his future lies in baseball, unlike another
famous Stanford alum who chose football _ John Elway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about as signable as anyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Borchard, like Traber, didn't find out from the team that
drafted him. Traber knew the Internet carried the draft live, so he
logged on, only to find a blank page.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got a call from LMU coach Frank Cruz congratulating him.
Then he got calls from five friends who saw it on the Internet.
Then the Mets called. Then Traber couldn't reach his parents
because he didn't know their work numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a weird draft,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Utley agreed. He knew the Phillies were interested, but he also
knew teammate Bill Scott could be the first Bruin taken.
</P>
<P>
   Scott went in the sixth round, to Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get myself up in case I was disappointed,'' Utley
said. ``I was hoping for the best and it worked out great.'' &QL;

ELLIS CLARY, 85, BASEBALL LIFER WHOSE TALES RIVALED HIS PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ellis Clary, the archetype of the baseball lifer who wisecracked
his way through more than half a century in the game as a player,
manager, coach and one of its best-known scouts, died June 2 in
Valdosta, Ga. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Ellis could make a dog laugh,'' Spud Chandler, the
Yankee pitcher of the 1940s and fellow scout, once said.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind home plate on his scouting forays at ballparks in
Southern towns, Clary regaled fellow scouts with tales of playing
for the St. Louis Browns, usually the laughingstock of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   In the 52-year history of the franchise (now the Baltimore
Orioles), only one Browns team won a pennant _ the 1944 club, which
featured 18 players physically unfit for the World War II military.
</P>
<P>
   Clary, a ballplayer with good speed (he once raced, but lost to,
Jesse Owens in a 100-yard sprint exhibition) and a bad back keeping
him out of the armed forces, was a reserve infielder for those '44
Browns _ a team, he recalled, with hard drinkers and brawlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a terrible job it was for Luke Sewell to manage that
bunch of hyenas,'' Clary said at a 50th anniversary reunion
sponsored by the St. Louis Browns Fan Club. ``They drank anything
that would pour. If you went out with them, you wore a football
helmet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clary made his debut with the Washington Senators in 1942, went
to the Browns the next year, played with them through 1945, then
returned to the minors with a career batting average of .263 and a
host of stories.
</P>
<P>
   Spending most of his baseball career working for the Griffith
family, owner of the Senators and their successor, the Minnesota
Twins, Clary managed in the minors, was a coach with Washington
from 1955 to 1960, scouted for the Twins from 1962 to 1984, then
worked as a White Sox scout, and as a coach and scout for the Blue
Jays before retiring in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Myra, of Valdosta; four daughters,
Ellen Currie and Carol Herndon of Valdosta, and Janis Clary and
Karen Cole of Fayetteville, Ga.; and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Clary delighted in telling of his ballplaying misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we won the pennant, a guy wanted my glove,'' he once
said. ``He was the president of the Lipton Tea Co. He used that
glove to make the world's first flow-through tea bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Clary's spirits were seldom dimmed. Chandler recalled the time
Clary was rushed to a hospital in Mobile, Ala., after suffering a
severe heart attack. ``He motioned me over to his bed and whispered
_ he said, `Spud, I want you to do something for me.' I said,
`Anything.' He said, `I want you to go down and get the mileage off
that ambulance so I can turn it in on my expense report.''' &QL;

CHERNOBYL PLANT WILL SHUT DOWN, UKRAINE LEADER TELLS CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine _ The crippled Chernobyl power plant, site of the
worst nuclear accident in history, will be closed permanently on
Dec. 15, President Leonid Kuchma announced Monday during a brief
visit by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The move means that the fourth and final functioning reactor at
the plant, about 60 miles north of Kiev, will be taken off line and
shut. One reactor was destroyed in the catastrophic meltdown and
explosion in April 1986, a second burned in 1991 and a third was
closed in 1996 near the end of its safe operating lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 15,000 people have died in the intervening 14 years
as a result of the radiation that spewed into the atmosphere, a
toxic dose some scientists believe was equivalent to about 500
times that of the atomic bomb the United States dropped on
Hiroshima, Japan, in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred thirty-five thousand people were evacuated. Sharply
higher radiation levels were recorded across much of northern and
eastern Europe, and less severe increases were noted as far away as
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hopeful moment,'' Clinton said after he and Kuchma
toasted the Chernobyl announcement with champagne. ``It is also a
moment when we remember those who suffered as a result of the
accident there.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, Clinton spoke to tens of thousands of
Ukrainians in a plaza at St. Michael's Monastery but did not
mention the Chernobyl accident or Kuchma's new closure pledge.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. government source indicated the Chernobyl announcement
was more for international consumption, saying that Clinton omitted
comments on the upcoming closure from his remarks because the
reactor incident is a politically and personally sensitive issue in
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people got sick and died,'' the source said. ``There's
a pain in many Ukrainian hearts today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, ending a week-long European trip, then flew to
Washington. He is to remain in the U.S. capital only a day before
heading off for a quick Wednesday-Thursday trip to Japan for a
memorial service for former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   En route from Moscow to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, Air Force
One flew within sight of Chernobyl, its massive cooling towers
reflecting in the afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma had promised several years ago to close the fourth
reactor but reneged when wealthier nations did not make good on
pledges to help finance construction of new reactors. The reactor
destroyed in 1986 was quickly encased in a steel and concrete
``sarcophagus'' that is considered an inadequate final measure and
which some scientists believe could crack.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a new U.S. aid package of $78 million for new
containment projects at Chernobyl and $2 million for safety
measures at other nuclear power plants in Ukraine. Forty percent of
the electrical power generated in Ukraine is from nuclear plants.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma said Clinton agreed to make certain that donations from
the other leading industrial democracies, known as the G7
countries, are forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this will take place,'' Kuchma said. ``The aim of
this decision is to reduce nuclear risks in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   A so-called ``pledging conference'' to raise funds for a second
Chernobyl sarcophagus will be held at Berlin in July.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that G7 nations have worked since 1995 to
``mobilize'' about $2 billion through energy sector loans from
international financial institutions such as the World Bank. An
additional $1 billion in grants for Chernobyl site safety projects
has been provided by G7 nations
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the United States, the G7 nations are Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's visit approaching, Kuchma said Sunday that
Chernobyl ``must be stopped from all points of view, and first of
all from the point of view of security. I have no doubts about
that.''

JOHN MILLIS, 47, AIDE IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John I. Millis, a former case officer with the CIA
who for the last three years served as the top staff member of the
House Intelligence Committee, committed suicide on Sunday, the
police and congressional officials said Monday. He was 47 and lived
in Vienna, Va.
</P>
<P>
   George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, described
Millis as ``a tenacious advocate for a strong national intelligence
capability.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Fairfax City police said officers were
called to a motel at 8 p.m. Sunday because a man was threatening
suicide. Officer Jeff Morrison said that when the police arrived,
they found Millis dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot
wound. The police said they were investigating the death.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming a senior staff aide in Congress, Millis served
as a case officer for the CIA for nearly 13 years. In that period,
he lived in Pakistan, working to provide covert aid to Afghan
rebels who were fighting the Soviet army.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997 he was staff director of a special
congressional committee that investigated the Clinton
administration's approval of arms shipments from Iran to Muslim
forces in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   He was named staff director of the House Intelligence Committee,
the top staff position, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Linda.

EDITORIAL: MODEST GAINS IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 6:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Little progress on arms control was expected from Bill
Clinton's weekend visit to Moscow, and little occurred. President
Vladimir Putin of Russia acknowledged that there might soon be a
need to counter nuclear threats from unpredictable powers like
North Korea. But he did not soften his opposition to U.S. plans for
a national missile defense. Clinton agreed that there should be
significant new reductions in offensive missiles as part of a deal
that would also amend the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to
allow a limited defensive shield. But Clinton held back from
steeper cuts that Russia favors and the Pentagon resists.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, prospects for reaching agreement on these issues
during the remainder of Clinton's term do not look good. But with
more than seven months and at least three further meetings with
Putin before Clinton leaves office, both sides should keep working.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings saw some modest but important arms control
achievements. The United States and Russia agreed to safely dispose
of 34 metric tons of military plutonium each, enough for thousands
of nuclear warheads if smuggled to countries like Libya or Iraq. In
addition, an early warning station will be established in Moscow
staffed jointly by Russian and U.S. personnel to share information
on missile and space launches, reducing the danger of misreading
peaceful launches as surprise attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The most important disagreement is over U.S. plans for a
national missile defense. The Clinton administration favors a
strictly limited system usable only against smaller states. Russia
fears that such a system could later be upgraded to blunt some of
its own strategic missile force. If Russia's fears about missile
defense can be eased, Moscow would be eager to cut the number of
both sides' offensive missiles to 1,500 or lower. The Pentagon,
however, wants no fewer than 2,000 to 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is understandably reluctant to press military leaders on
this issue during an election campaign. But a reasonable case can
be made that the United States can safely meet all of its military
goals with somewhat fewer missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the administration should not rush to meet its own
artificial deadline for deciding whether to go ahead with building
such a system later this year. The technology has not yet been
adequately tested nor have the possibilities for diplomatic
agreement been exhausted. Clinton should not risk unraveling
existing treaties by moving too hastily to decide on missile
defenses.

 GLITCHES CAUSE INTEL TO DELAY RELEASE OF THRIFTY PROCESSOR  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the latest embarrassment related to its
attempt to move the PC world to a new type of memory, Intel on
Monday postponed the release of a new ultra-low-cost PC processor
from this summer to the first quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip, code-named Timna, is intended for consumer PCs
priced below $600. Until yesterday's disclosure, it was expected to
ship in time to go into new models for this year's back-to-school
and holiday seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major slip, but it's not going to hurt Intel's business
much,'' said Linley Gwennap, principal analyst at the Linley Group,
a Mountain View market-research company. ``They can continue to
supply the market segment Timna was aimed at with their Celeron
processors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What they may be losing,'' he added, ``is the first-mover
advantage _ the opportunity to jump in first with a fully
integrated chip.''
</P>
<P>
   Timna is supposed to reduce the overall cost of building a PC
because it incorporates several features that have previously
required separate chips, including circuitry to generate screen
graphics and to control the exchange of data with the computer's
memory. Via, a Taiwanese chipmaker that offers low-end
Intel-compatible processors, is planning similar integrated chips
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Intel is that Timna was designed to use a new
type of memory called RDRAM, instead of the SDRAM used in most PCs
today. Intel expected the new format to become the industry
standard by now, but adoption has been slower than expected. RDRAM
remains more expensive than SDRAM, which has made it a poor choice
for low-cost PCs.
</P>
<P>
   So Intel designed a new companion chip called a Memory
Translation Hub, or MTH, to enable Timna and other products
designed for RDRAM to work instead with the older, cheaper SDRAM
format.
</P>
<P>
   The MTH, however, has been plagued with technical glitches. Last
month, for example, Intel was forced to launch a
multimillion-dollar program to recall PC logic boards because of
crashes and freezes caused by the MTH.
</P>
<P>
   Intel had hoped to solve the problem by making quick changes to
the MTH. But yesterday, spokesman Mike Sullivan said the company
has now determined that the chip ``isn't going to meet our quality
standards.'' Instead, engineers will design a new part from the
ground up to perform the same tasks _ a process that will take
months.

 COMPROMISE MEDICARE DRUG BILL TO BE INTRODUCED  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hoping to break a Capitol Hill deadlock, Rep.
Anna Eshoo will introduce legislation Tuesday to give Medicare
beneficiaries a prescription drug benefit, positioning the
Atherton, Calif., Democrat's bill as a compromise between current
Democratic and Republican proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting drug expenses for seniors is an election year priority
for both parties, with Republicans fearful they'll alienate older
voters if they don't act, while Democrats want to retain control of
an issue that has been a potent political weapon for their party.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no consensus has jelled around any of the several
proposals floated by President Clinton and lawmakers from both
parties. Political observers believe that, although it may be too
late to pass a Medicare drug bill before Congress recesses, Eshoo's
bill has a chance of instigating a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe Anna's bill could be the platform for a
compromise,'' said Walter Moore, a lobbyist for Genentech Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Moore explained that Eshoo, whose Silicon Valley district
includes hundreds of biotech firms, is one of 60 so-called ``New
Democrats'' _ lawmakers who tend to side with business on economic
issues. With only a few weeks left to build a majority, Eshoo could
offer Republicans a palatable proposal, Moore said, plus enough
Democratic votes to inoculate the measure against a presidential
veto.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the Medicare drug issue begin with the fact that
a third of the nation's 39 million Medicare beneficiaries lack any
prescription drug coverage. Democrats have seized on the issue and
have crafted a series of proposals to placate seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Allen, D-Maine, and Rep. Pete Stark, D-Fremont, Calif.,
have proposed legislation to let Medicare beneficiaries buy drugs
at the price paid by the Veteran's Administration, which would
amount to a discount of at least 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry has opposed that approach as a form
of price controls, and the bill will probably go nowhere _ except
into campaign literature aimed at winning votes for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle have
taken a different approach. They want to add a Part D drug benefit
to Medicare. To get the benefit, seniors would pay a
still-to-be-defined premium. In return, Medicare would eventually
pay one-half of their drug expenses up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Clinton and Daschle approaches differ.
Clinton would offer no benefit above $5,000. Daschle's bill would
include what is called a stop-loss provision: Above $5,000,
Medicare would pay all of a Medicare beneficiary's drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo's bill builds on the Clinton and Daschle plans. It
includes the 50-50 coverage up to $5,000 as in the Clinton proposal
and also the stop-loss provision in the Daschle plan.
</P>
<P>
   To this Eshoo adds a feature designed to hold down the benefit's
overall cost, which has been estimated at as much as $200 billion
by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo would encourage several drug providers to compete in the
Medicare Part D market in each region of the country. Clinton and
Daschle would have just one Medicare drug provider per region. The
difference is subtle but critical, political and industry observers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Drug plans typically try to control costs by developing
formularies, or lists of preferred drugs. Whenever there are two or
more drugs that treat the same condition, drug plan managers go to
each manufacturer and demand a deep discount for choosing that
company's product.
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo's plan would preserve this competitive behavior, whereas
Daschle's and Clinton's single providers would carry all brands and
rely on purchasing power to hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volume purchasing won't work,'' said one biotech industry
lobbyist, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The only way to get
price breaks is to threaten drug manufacturers with loss of market
share by excluding them from the formulary.''
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo said she added the competitive feature out of concern that
if Congress enacts a Medicare drug benefit and program costs soar,
lawmakers would only come back and institute price controls on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be disastrous,'' she said. ``It would choke off the
supply of capital for research and development.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eshoo's approach also has drawbacks for Medicare
beneficiaries. What happens if a patient _ accustomed to a certain
manufacturer's drug _ joins a Part D plan that opts for a different
brand of pills?
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of older people have chronic medical conditions for
which they need to take daily medications, and they usually know
which medications work best,'' said John Rother, legislative
director of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), in
Washington, D.C. ``Which (brands of) medications end up being
covered by a Medicare drug plan becomes very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Eshoo's bill won't go far unless it appeals to
Republican lawmakers, who are in a bind over the whole Medicare
drug issue. Until recently, they've backed legislation that would
encourage seniors to join Medicare HMOs, which generally offer some
drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But with more insurers dropping Medicare, Republicans have had
to abandon that position and pledge to come up with a Medicare drug
benefit bill of their own. So far, however, they have not proposed
specific legislation. In any event, they would need Democratic
support and a deal with the Clinton administration to avoid a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The key Republican on the Medicare issue, Rep. Bill Thomas of
Bakersfield, is aware of Eshoo's proposal, but declined to comment
on it until she formally introduces the bill, which is expected to
happen tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Eshoo, meanwhile, is lining up Democratic co-sponsors like Texas
Rep. Martin Frost, the third-ranking member of the House democratic
leadership. Rother, the AARP lobbyist, said Eshoo must show House
Republicans she can deliver enough Democratic support to pass a
bill and get Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``A compromise could happen,'' Rother said, ``but we're running
out of time.''

 MONEYBAG: SUIT CLAIMS PENNY FOOLISH  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Q: As an active investor, I have received a fair
number of shareholder class-action notices over the years. Usually,
these come with many words printed in small type that tire the eyes
and brain.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I bother to fill out and send back these tedious forms
_ with lots of personal information _ I never hear further. I've
never received a check of any size. Should I just throw these
notices in the trash?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: If you never fill out a class-action form again, chances are you
won't lose much. These cases usually are settled _ after
interminable delays _ for only pennies per share. (You may yet get
a response to some of the forms you already have filed.)
</P>
<P>
   The suits serve mainly to enrich class-action lawyers, who stand
to receive perhaps a quarter of the entire settlement. In the case
of large companies, that can add up to hundreds of thousands and
even millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It's really a question of what you think your time is worth.
Often, the class-action forms require you to dig up and make copies
of ancient brokerage slips that confirm your stock ownership. If
you are willing to do that in hopes of getting back a few bucks
during the second administration of Al Gore or George W. Bush, go
ahead. But I get the impression that you aren't.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Stock Exchange
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: We recently unearthed a stock certificate for American Royalty
Trust dated June 7, 1985. I have been unable to find any
information regarding this company in my Web searches. Do you know
of it, or could you offer any ideas on how I could search for
information?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: According to documents found in the Dow Jones Interactive
database, American Royalty Trust of Houston, which earned royalties
from oil and gas production, was absorbed by Freeport-McMoRan Oil
and Gas Royalty Trust in a series of tender offers ending in 1988.
American Royalty holders received Freeport-McMoRan units rather
than cash.
</P>
<P>
   You should still be able to exchange your certificate with
Freeport-McMoRan. Try writing its shareholder relations department
at 712 Main St., Houston, TX 77002. Or call its transfer agent,
Chase Mellon, at (800) 635-9270.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Credit Conundrum
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have a credit card with a 13 percent interest charge, and a
total balance of about $30,000. I am tired of paying so much
interest and am considering selling my $18,000 stock portfolio _
which includes $11,000 in capital gains _ to liquidate part of the
debt. Does this make sense?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It depends on how good an investor you are. If your stock
portfolio is going to increase in value by significantly more than
13 percent annually, then it wouldn't make sense to take money out
of the portfolio to stop the credit-card drain.
</P>
<P>
   You don't say, but I'll assume that your capital gains are all
long term and that your tax bracket is high enough so that you must
pay the maximum 20 percent federal tax on long-term capital gains.
In that case, if you liquidate your $18,000 worth of stocks, you
will be left with roughly $15,000 after federal and state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If you then use the proceeds to pay off $15,000 worth of your
credit-card debt, you will reduce your annual interest payments by
$1,950.
</P>
<P>
   If, instead, you leave the stocks untouched and they gain in
value by 15 percent during the next 12 months, that will add $2,700
to the value of your portfolio. Even allowing for a combined 25
percent federal and state tax bite on these additional gains, you
will do better under this scenario than you would if you sell your
stocks and pay off debt.
</P>
<P>
   Also keep in mind that you won't ever have to pay capital-gains
taxes if you never sell the stocks _ and instead pass the portfolio
along to your heirs. Their cost basis for tax purposes will be the
value of the stocks on the day you die, rather than your own cost
basis. That's another good reason not to sell the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The catch here is that you must produce exceptionally strong
investment returns to offset the credit-card interest. Over the
long run, most investors earn less than 13 percent annually on
their portfolios.

 DAY TADING TAKES GUTS, QUICK FINGERS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Todd Beardsly doesn't like gambling. During a
recent trip to Las Vegas, he didn't make a single wager, spending
his time instead watching shows and cruising the Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsly related this as he rapidly purchased hundreds of shares
of Ciena Corp., watched the company's stock price move a little
higher and then just as quickly sold off his holding for a tidy
profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a gambler,'' he said, his eyes drifting over four
computer screens providing a constant flow of market data. ``It
just doesn't appeal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   What does appeal to Beardsly is the notion of turning a fast
buck by getting into and out of stocks at warp speed _ an activity
that the former San Jose house builder expects to earn him more
than $1 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Beardsly and the relatively few other successful day traders
like him are definitely the exception. Studies show that the vast
majority will lose their shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite such grim statistics, and despite a market that now
lacks much of the momentum of past years, would-be masters of the
universe continue flocking to join the ranks of day traders.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 100,000 of the approximately 8 million North
Americans who buy and sell stocks online are believed to be at
least part-time day traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When individuals hear that they can make a lot of money doing
this, they go for it,'' said Brett Trueman, a professor at the
University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to believe that anyone who day trades will
do well,'' he said. uncx ``But people still tend to focus on the
success stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Las Vegas,'' Trueman added. ``You might hear from
friends who made some money at the casinos, but you seldom hear
from all the rest who didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Casinos are an apt metaphor for day trading. While some gamblers
may have systems or the self-discipline to beat the odds, just
about everyone else who takes a seat at the green-felt tables will
end up being separated from his or her cash over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The North American Securities Administrators Association
determined in a recent report that 70 percent of day traders ``will
not only lose, but will almost certainly lose everything they
invest.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned
that ``most individual investors do not have the wealth, the time
or the temperament to make money and to sustain the devastating
losses that day trading can bring.''
</P>
<P>
   And still they come, lured by hopes of market riches and easy
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very risky,'' admitted Jimmy Hsu, manager of the Silicon
Valley branch of ProTrader, which operates a chain of 19
day-trading offices nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you talk to a guy who consistently pulls money out of the
market, and you can see that something is clicking _ they have
it,'' he said. ``It may seem like gambling to those who don't
understand, but not to those who do.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, when asked to arrange access to a day trader
in his shop, Hsu picked Beardsly, who has been with ProTrader for
just six months.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsly, as Hsu would say, has it. After a couple of months of
steady losses, he estimates he now makes an average $5,000 a day.
He is the Bay Area poster boy for day trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never work for a living again after doing this,''
Beardsly said during a brief lull in the action. ``Why would I?''
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, CNBC's market commentary blared from a TV. Other
traders tapped away at keyboards at other workstations. They joked
among themselves, occasionally cursing when a trade went sour.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsly likes the clubhouse atmosphere of the ProTrader office,
where each member puts up at least $50,000 to open a trading
account. He said being surrounded by fellow day traders provides a
support group when things are rough as well as an opportunity to
learn from others.
</P>
<P>
   At Beardsly's side sat his wife, Inna, who is learning the
ropes. She has been trading shares of Applied Materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it does,'' Inna said, clicking on a
description of the company. ``Semiconductors? I didn't know that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly unusual. Most day traders tend not to have a clue
about the stocks they trade, knowing only that certain ticker
symbols can be relied on to post wide swings in value, which is how
a day trader makes money.
</P>
<P>
   Beardsly has been trading Ciena's shares almost since day one.
On a typical day, he might move as many as 30,000 shares in and out
of his account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know anything about it,'' he said. ``I know
they make communications equipment. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, he entered a typo on his trading screen and instead
of buying Ciena, he mistakenly purchased shares in another company.
Beardsly quickly sold off the mystery company, pocketing a few
hundred dollars in accidental profit.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Not for Amateurs
</P>
<P>
   He makes it look so easy.
</P>
<P>
   And that's part of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally fun,'' said Joey Anuff, producer of the online
humor site Suck.com and author of the book ``Dumb Money: Adventures
of a Day Trader.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the more I day traded, the less money I had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anuff doesn't day trade any more and said he wouldn't advise
others to get into the game. ``It's just too intense for most
amateurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Split-second financial decisions will make me rich or ruin my
life,'' Anuff writes in his book. ``Can you grasp the agony? True
humiliation is knowing you missed a chance at effortless riches not
a year or a month ago, but five seconds ago.''
</P>
<P>
   A Lonely Profession
</P>
<P>
   That risk of humiliation was what kept Anuff from doing his
thing in a day-trading office. He preferred to wage his own
personal crusade for easy money from the privacy of his San
Francisco apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a deeply personal voyage,'' Anuff observed. ``Who
wants to do that in front of strangers?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most day traders feel the same way. According to the
Electronic Traders Association, an organization of day traders, up
to 10,000 day traders go at it on a full-time basis, usually at a
day-trading shop.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 90,000 others day trade on a part-time basis, often
from home, almost always alone. These are the ones who tend to go
bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge distinctions between the people who do this
full time _ the professionals _ and the ones who do it part time,''
said Randy Dale, branch manager of a day-trading office in Santa
Rosa called Market Wise. ``You cannot expect to succeed at this
part-time.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Anuff learned is that a day trader is not, as Beardsly
and others professed, merely ``taking money out of the market.''
Generally speaking, Anuff said, a day trader is going toe to toe
with other online traders, with the race going to the one with the
fastest connection and typing speed.
</P>
<P>
   Speed Does Matter
</P>
<P>
   As such, he noted that day traders who subscribe to services
providing real-time market access _ and pay between $9 and $19 in
commissions per trade _ are always out in front of active traders
using services like E-Trade, Schwab and Fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   Anuff refers to these people as ``E-Tards,'' and expresses
gratitude to them in his book for always being there, one or two
steps behind, ready to snap up whatever the faster day traders are
ready to unload.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed that day traders have places them at the top of the
food chain,'' said Market Wise's Dale. ``There are a lot of people
attempting to day trade with online brokerage accounts. That's a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet many people appear to be doing just that. According a
report from investment firm U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, a record
2.5 million new online brokerage accounts were opened in the first
quarter, and online trading volume surged 69 percent from the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At the biggest online broker, San Francisco's Charles Schwab,
its online customers alone made nearly 300,000 trades per day in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, that Dale sees day traders as being the most
ferocious predators in an increasingly crowded jungle. And these
predators will continue to prey on those who lack the speed to
outrun them.
</P>
<P>
   David and Goliath
</P>
<P>
   ``You could look at it like that,'' Beardsly said. ``But I don't
think of myself as playing against anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he sees himself as being in a constant struggle with
the institutional heavyweights that are buying and offering shares
on a second-by-second basis.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers ticked by on Beardsly's screen almost too fast to
follow. He stared intently, watching for opportunities before him
as quickly as his fingers could strike the keys.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the closing bell rang and trading came to an abrupt
halt. Surveying his performance for the day, Beardsly announced
that he had made $8,366 trading about 115,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive performance, and one that ProTrader employees
readily concede cannot be easily imitated by others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people calling themselves day traders who
shouldn't call themselves day traders,'' said Hsu, the branch
manager. ``But still they keep trading. Why? I don't know.''

 U.S. EMBRACED `INSANE' TRADING IDEA  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the mid-1980s, Philip Berber was a marketing
executive for a British software company doing hush-hush work for
the United Kingdom defense ministry when he experienced what he
calls ``a eureka moment.''
</P>
<P>
   His company had a contract to do submarine spotting, using
advanced technology that bounced signals off the ocean floor. The
company's artificial-intelligence software looked for patterns in
the squiggly lines generated by those signals, repetitions that
could distinguish a menacing enemy craft from, say, a big rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, what if that line were a stock price?,'' recalled
the 41-year-old Berber. ``It was one of those moments that changed
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Berber tried to interest Britain's brokerage firms in the
technology. What he got were some not-very-polite turndowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to one blue-blood firm in the City (London's Wall
Street) and I remember the gentleman's exact words: `Mr. Berber,'
he said, `We would much prefer to use our natural intelligence to
your artificial intelligence.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Discouraged by the reaction, the Dublin-born Berber moved to the
United States, where a small community of like-minded
entrepreneurs, known colloquially as ``quants,'' was pushing the
outer limits of computer technology and finance. Their goal: to
design computer programs that recognized patterns in the price
movements of securities or currency that could predict where those
prices would be at some future moment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Berber started his first company, Financia, to sell
computer programs based on that idea to money managers. Three years
later, he sold the company to a Texas financial software firm.
</P>
<P>
   After several years working as a quant at a money management
firm, Berber had another eureka moment.
</P>
<P>
   He was invited in 1995 to one of the first day-trading shops,
located in a Houston shopping mall. In those days, no stock
brokerage offered price-scanning software that could also carry out
trades.
</P>
<P>
   At the Houston firm, a customer checked moving stock prices on a
computer. If the customer wanted to trade, he shouted out the order
to a registered stockbroker sitting across the table.
</P>
<P>
   Berber decided to start a company, named CyBerCorp, that would
combine brokerage operations with price-scanning software, allowing
customers to directly access the market.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, where few imagined that computers could predict
prices in financial markets, ``I felt insane,'' Berber confided.
But here Berber turned his edge-of-the-envelope insights into
moneymaking businesses. In the United States, he said, ``I was no
longer insane.''

 ORDINARY INVESTORS MAY GET DIRECT MARKET ACCESS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Philip Berber stares at a PC screen filled with
an array of color-coded flashing lights. Stock prices pop up, then
disappear, next to the names of dozens of wholesale brokers trying
to buy or sell shares. Charts monitoring the market move at
dizzying speed.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like a computer game for 14-year-olds with short
attention spans. It's actually a popular stock-trading program for
active traders, full-time stock jockeys who buy and sell dozens of
times a day. Market experts say it represents the future of online
trading for ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
   To Berber, founder and chairman of CyBerCorp, the Austin, Texas,
electronic brokerage that offers the program to investors, the
software is nothing less than a weapon of war.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the stock market as a bloody pit where the naive are
mauled and only the strong survive. He has designed CyBerCorp's
program to turn a computer into the control panel of a finely tuned
fighting machine that scans the entire market for the best prices,
grabbing trades before the market big boys step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are like a Jedi warrior,'' said Berber, an intense,
bearded Irishman turned Texan. ``This enables you to fight for your
own stock order in among the professional traders.''
</P>
<P>
   CyBerCorp and a handful of rival online brokers are unraveling
the tangled web that is the stock market - where hundreds of
wholesale brokers and computerized networks quote a continually
changing stream of prices.
</P>
<P>
   By creating a unified, more-efficient market, their technology
promises to make it easier in the not-too-distant future for
average investors to trade shares at the prices they want, while
making it tougher for market pros to fleece the little guys.
</P>
<P>
   What firms like CyBerCorp are doing is bringing to individual
investors an advantage that only professionals sitting on Wall
Street trading desks previously enjoyed _ the ability to see the
prices every market participant is quoting at any point in time,
nimbly darting in and out to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, such ``direct-access`` technology is only of interest
to a small group of full-time speculators, the so-called day
traders of popular lore, who may pay several hundred dollars a
month to get this kind of market data.
</P>
<P>
   For such traders, who sometimes hold on to stocks for just a few
minutes, price differences of a few pennies per share could mean
the difference between profit and loss. They have fueled the growth
of small brokers that offer advanced price-scanning technology,
such as CyBerCorp, Tradescape and Tradecast.
</P>
<P>
   Now, market experts say, that technology is about to move into
the mainstream. Big-name online brokers are looking closely at
direct access and advanced market-scanning programs, trying to
figure out how to adapt them to the mass market. That interest was
highlighted earlier this year when Charles Schwab Corp., the No. 1
online broker, bought CyBerCorp for $487 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyperactive traders are defining the future of the
marketplace,'' said Rob Hegerty, analyst with Massachusetts
consulting firm TowerGroup. ``As day traders force the market to be
more efficient, down the road, that will affect the average
investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this does not mean millions of online investors will
suddenly want to know what a wholesale dealer in Chicago or an
electronic network in New York are selling Microsoft for. Quite the
contrary, most customers will be content to specify the price they
are willing to pay to buy shares, or willing to accept to sell
shares, and let their brokers do the hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not going to be a huge outcry of demand for this,''
said Credit Suiss First Boston analyst James Marks.
</P>
<P>
   But mainstream brokers are likely to use CyBerCorp-style
software in ways customers never see to ensure orders are executed
at the best possible price. ``It will be transparent, (but) they
will benefit,'' said Jim Hackley, a Schwab official who was
recently named CyBerCorp's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, CyBerCorp and its rivals use ``intelligent
order-routing'' software that not only scans prices throughout the
market, but also instantaneously figures out which broker is most
likely to fill the order. ``It should provide better execution,''
said TowerGroup's Hegerty.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the advantage of the software, it's important to
understand the current chaotic state of the stock market. Right
now, when a customer clicks in a trade, an online broker routes the
order to any of hundreds of destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for popular Nasdaq stocks at set prices _ so-called limit
orders _ generally go to computerized networks called ECNs. Orders
involving thinly traded or New York Stock Exchange shares, as well
as ``market'' orders with no set price, usually go to wholesale
brokerages called specialists or marketmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, under Security and Exchange Commission rules,
computerized networks and wholesale brokers are supposed to use
computer links to scan the entire market to find the best prices
for customers.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't always work out that way. Bottlenecks in the
system and the vagaries of broker behavior mean that customers
don't always get the best deal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, brokers are required to fill orders on a
first-come, first-served basis. But the SEC says some brokers
ignore the rule in order to take care of their best customers
first.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, retail online brokers have sweetheart arrangements
with specific wholesale dealers to which they give preferential
treatment. For example, Schwab, which owns the nation's
second-largest market-making firm, sends the bulk of market orders
from its customers to that subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   In a practice that is legal, but arguably corrupt, market-making
dealers pay retail brokers a kickback to send market orders their
way.
</P>
<P>
   Marketmakers earn their living from the gap between what they
pay for shares and what they sell them for, so an order that can be
executed at whatever price they set is valuable to them. Needless
to say, there is little incentive to pass the order off if a better
price turns up elsewhere in the market.
</P>
<P>
   For online brokerage customers, the current system often
produces unfilled limit orders that could have been executed and
trades that get done at less-than-optimal prices.
</P>
<P>
   On the limit-order side, federal officials have considered
cutting through the chaos by routing all orders through a single
computer network, nicknamed CLOB for central limit order book. But
some market pros maintain that CyBerCorp-style order routing
software accomplishes the same task by collating price information
from all market participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have a virtual central limit order book,'' said
Matt Andresen, president of Island, the No. 2 ECN. ``And there will
constantly be better and better versions.``
</P>
<P>
   The issue now is how quickly online brokers will adopt
CyBerCorp-style order-routing technology instead of directing
orders to traditional partners. ``That would end the conflict of
interest between the broker and investor'' inherent in the broker's
relationship with marketmakers, said Gary Craft, an analyst at
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab bought CyBerCorp to get its hands on technology demanded
by active traders, one of the most profitable customer segments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, market watchers point out that Schwab and its rivals
benefit hugely from the current system. Schwab in particular could
lose tens of millions in profit at its market-making subsidiary if
CyBerCorp-style technology became the norm for less-active
investors as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Integrating CyBerCorp technology would direct order flow away
from Schwab's (marketmaker),'' Craft said. ``Schwab has everything
to lose. It could cannibalize the existing preferential
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab now finds itself in the awkward situation of controlling
a technology that directly threatens its profits. Company officials
say only that they intend to keep all order-handling systems in
place for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Schwab wanted to, though, no one thinks it could
successfully limit CyBerCorp technology to the active trader
community while keeping the old system in place for the masses.
Rivals will soon get their own hands on the technology, which is
likely to spread throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Craft, for one, thinks the wisest course is to use the
technology to attract customers. ``I think a marketing strategy
will soon surround it. I can see someone advertising `We use
technology to get the best price for you.' ''

LAZIO FAILS TO GET SUPPORT OF INDEPENDENCE PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With REFORM-PARTY) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, failed Monday
night to win the nomination of the Independence Party, the New York
state wing of the Reform Party. The development could cost him
votes by splitting support among the candidates opposed to Hillary
Rodham Clinton, the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates within the Independence Party received the most
votes Monday at its nominating convention in Albany, N.Y., and the
party authorized a primary on Sept. 12 to determine which one would
be listed on its ballot. The party is torn by the kind of
infighting and factionalism that its national organization is
facing.
</P>
<P>
   The top vote-getter, Jeff Graham, a radio talk show host who was
mayor of Watertown for two terms, said he decided to run only after
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani dropped out of the race last month. Graham,
who said he believed that Giuliani would have been a sure bet for
the Independence Party nomination, received 63 percent of the vote
from the party's 266 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In the runoff, he faces Jeff Beller of Westerlo, near Albany,
the president of an advocacy group for alternative fuels, who
received 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a tight race, the third-party lines in New York state are
considered crucial. The Independence line can draw more than
100,000 voters. Lazio also won the Conservative Party endorsement
and Clinton the Liberal Party endorsement last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the week since his nomination as the Republican candidate,
Lazio has faced sticky questions about a possible association with
the Independence Party because Pat Buchanan, who has been accused
of making anti-Semitic remarks, stands a good chance of winning the
presidential nomination of the Reform Party. That means Lazio's
name would have been on the same ticket, had he received the
nomination Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, who had said that Buchanan was divisive, insisted late
last month that he would still accept the nomination while
expressing clear support for George W. Bush, the Republican
candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in an appearance before the Independence Party last
month, denounced Buchanan and refused any support from the party.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Lazio campaign noted the presence of a number
of Democratic Party operatives at the Independence Party
convention, leading some to conclude that Clinton's surrogates had
helped engineer Lazio's loss to divide her opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's campaign spokesman, acknowledged that
aides were present at the Independence convention but would not
comment on what, if any, active role they played. ``They were
observing,'' he said. ``They were watching democracy in action.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he believed that Lazio's poor showing had less to do
with his comments about Buchanan than his association with Jack
Essenberg, the Independence Party's former chairman, who gave up
his position last week after a court fight resulted in Lenora
Fulani, an avowed Marxist, and Frank M. MacKay wresting control of
the party. The two have aligned themselves with Buchanan. Graham,
who is backed by MacKay, said there was a perception among
delegates that Lazio was cultivating support from Essenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lazio was negotiating through Essenberg, and that didn't play
well with the state committee,'' said Sarah Lyons, a party
spokeswoman. ``He didn't have the sense to realize he was dealing
with the wrong person.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Flood, a spokesman for Lazio, said he was not aware of
contacts Lazio made with the party. ``He respects the party's
process,'' Flood said. ``It was the delegates' decision, and what
they decide to do is not have any major-party involvement. We
respect that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lazio finished fourth, with 1.3 percent of the vote, behind Abe
Hirschfeld, the eccentric Manhattan real estate developer and
perennial candidate for public office, who won 3 percent of the
delegates' votes.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's aides played down the turn of events Monday, saying he
had not aggressively sought the nomination, though he would have
welcomed it. Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat who also ran on the
Independence Party line in 1998, received 109,000 votes from the
party in his 10 percentage point victory over Alfonse D'Amato in
1998. There are about 170,000 people enrolled in the Independence
Party.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running against Lazio and a candidate from the
Independence Party, Clinton, viewed as the front-runner, is also
expected to face opposition from the Right to Life Party. The party
is holding a primary on Sept. 12 between Louis Wein, its candidate
for governor in 1990, and John Adofope, a telephone company
engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Party officials said their candidate would campaign
on a platform similar to that of the national Reform Party, which
supports changes intended to make politics more accessible to
everyday people, like same-day voter registration and a ban on
unregulated financial contributions to political parties.

CONE IS FAR FROM PERFECT IN MONTREAL
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Making the final out in David Cone's perfect game
last year ranked among the greatest moments of his career, Orlando
Cabrera said at the time. But slamming a game-winning homer off
Cone Monday night probably ranks a little higher on his personal
scale.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on short notice after shoulder stiffness sidelined
Ramiro Mendoza, Cone was pounded for six runs in six innings,
including Cabrera's tiebreaking three-run homer in the sixth, as
Montreal dumped the Yankees, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are 30-23, Montreal 31-23.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch was unable to play because of the recurring
problem in his left forearm. His status will be evaluated day to
day.
</P>
<P>
   Cone briefly considered a career in journalism before opting for
a more lucrative profession. But he served in the role of reporter
Monday afternoon, after accompanying Mendoza on the team bus to
Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza is reserved, but what Cone ascertained in their
conversation was that his teammate's right shoulder felt stiff.
Cone walked into the office of manager Joe Torre, delivered the
news about Mendoza and volunteered to pitch in his place. ``Strap
it on and go,'' Cone said minutes later, walking through the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos hit him immediately. With Montreal down by 2-0 in the
bottom of the first, Rondell White doubled before Cone hung a
slider to Vladimir Guerrero. Montreal's right fielder attacked the
ball with ferocity, seemingly rising out of his shoes as he swung
viciously. Estimated distance: 436 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Cone fell behind in the count continually, throwing a ball with
his first pitch to 14 of the first 19 batters, and the count was
2-0 when Lee Stevens singled in the third to score Guerrero, who
had doubled.
</P>
<P>
   The score was tied at that point, 3-3, only because of a
base-running gaffe by the Yankees and their serial failures with
runners on base. Ricky Ledee opened the game with a home run and
the Yankees scored another run in the inning, but they should have
had two more. Scott Brosius hit a two-out single with the bases
loaded, Bernie Williams trotting home with one run, Tino Martinez
rounding third. But center fielder Peter Bergeron threw to third
base to nail Jorge Posada _ and the tag was applied an instant
before Martinez ambled across home, meaning the inning was over
before Martinez stepped on the plate.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first of many scoring chances blown by the Yankees,
who stranded 35 runners in three games over the weekend in Atlanta.
They loaded the bases in the third and couldn't score, left one
runner in scoring position in the fourth and stranded two more in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Cone surrendered a single and hit a batter with a pitch with one
out in the sixth inning, and Cabrera came to bat. He had no chance
against Cone's swerving slider last July, something he has probably
been reminded of dozens of times, if he watches television. There
is that recurrent image of Cabrera popping up toward third and Cone
dropping to his knees as Brosius makes the final catch.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone's slider is not sharp these days, and when he fell
behind in the count, 2-0, to Cabrera in the sixth inning Monday
night, his pitch selection was limited. He threw a fastball,
Cabrera crushed it and paused as he watched the flight of the ball,
his eyes darting for an instant in Cone's direction. Redemption.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 23rd hit against Cone with runners in scoring
position this year; he surrendered 34 during the entire 1999
season. Cone said early in the season that he was searching for
answers, and now he is 1-6 after 12 starts and the search goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said the Yankees' trainers did not think Mendoza's injury
was serious, that he might miss the next few days and then return.
Mendoza has been a versatile pitcher for the Yankees, bouncing from
the rotation to the bullpen, but he has been unavailable to pitch
several times in the last few years because of stiffness in his
shoulder _ something that will undoubtedly be noted, along with his
record of success, by teams considering making a deal for him.
Teams looking at possible trades for Mendoza have been trailing the
right-hander, including the Kansas City Royals (Johnny Damon),
Cincinnati Reds (Dmitri Young) and the Houston Astros (Moises
Alou).
</P>
<P>
   The change will jumble the Yankees' pitching rotation. Cone was
supposed to pitch Tuesday, and must be replaced. Ted Lilly, one of
the pitchers acquired from Montreal in the Hideki Irabu deal, was
scratched from his scheduled start Monday evening in Ottawa, where
he was to pitch for Triple-A Columbus; the Yankees could opt to
promote him, or perhaps start the veteran Mike Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez is scheduled to pitch here Wednesday, which
means that Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Cone could be in line
to start against the Mets at Yankee Stadium this weekend. &QL;

ORIOLES' 3-RUN SEVENTH ENDS HAMPTON'S WINNING STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Hampton had dirt caked on his left knee, more
dirt on his right knee as he stomped around the mound like an angry
pitcher in the seventh inning Monday night. He had tamed the
Baltimore Orioles all evening, but things suddenly had changed and
Hampton was desperately trying to keep the Mets ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But Hampton failed. The Orioles blitzed the left-hander for
three runs in the seventh and defeated the Mets, 4-2, on a blustery
night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton had throttled Baltimore on one run and five hits and
seemed to be cruising toward his fifth consecutive victory, but he
crumbled and could not hold a one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   See him pitch, see him hit and see him run. That is the Hampton
the Mets always wanted, the feisty pitcher who refuses to give in
to hitters, who plays like a shortstop and who forces anyone
watching the game to stare right at him. That is where the action
will usually be when Hampton is pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The action was all around Hampton in the seventh Monday night
and he could not stop it from turning a game that was his into a
game that became Mike Mussina's, ending Hampton's winning streak as
well as Baltimore's five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton trudged to the mound in the seventh within nine outs of
another victory, but he never made it out of the inning. It started
with B.J. Surhoff's booming homer to left center field off an 0-1
fastball that tied the score, 2-2. The blast caused Hampton to
drift off the mound, turn toward center and cringe.
</P>
<P>
   After a single and a force out, Hampton walked Rich Amaral to
put runners on first and second. Hampton wound up tumbling to the
dirt after Ball 4 because he thought Mike Piazza might have to
unleash a throw to second to possibly get the runner, Mussina, who
was going on the 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike Bordick punched a single to center that knocked in
pinch-runner Delino DeShields to put the Orioles in front, 3-2,
Hampton was aggravated about surrendering the lead and he caught
Piazza's return throw with his bare left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton struck out Jeff Conine for the second out and jammed
Albert Belle with a fastball for what could have been the third
out. But Belle was strong enough to bloop the ball over first base
for a run-scoring double that made it, 4-2, and ended Hampton's
night.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who had been 4-0 with a 1.17 earned run average in his
past five starts, gave up four earned runs and nine hits in 6 2/3
innings. Mussina yielded two runs and three hits in the second, but
tamed the Mets on three hits over his other five innings in winning
for only the third time in 13 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The game had started well for Hampton. With two out and no one
on in the second, Melvin Mora bunted along the third-base line. Cal
Ripken Jr. made a nice barehanded pickup and an accurate
off-balance throw, but Mora beat it for a single. Normally, it
would be foolish for a No. 8 batter to attempt to bunt for a hit.
Not when Hampton is batting ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton is not like other pitchers because he is not an
automatic out. He smacked a grounder that nicked off a diving
Ripken's glove and trickled into left-center field, allowing Mora
to breeze into third and extending Hampton's hitting streak to five
games. He is 11 for 31 (.355) this season.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was the rookie Jason Tyner who had raved about Mussina
and reminded himself not to get psyched out when batting against
the outstanding right-hander he was used to seeing on television.
Mussina jumped ahead of Tyner with two quick strikes, but Tyner
sliced the next pitch to left field for a single that put the Mets
ahead, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mussina was the one who was psyched out because he walked
Derek Bell on four pitches to load the bases and then fell behind
Edgardo Alfonzo, 3-0. Mussina threw a strike and Alfonzo fouled off
two pitches as the count hung at 3-2, but Mussina unleashed another
ball to force in a run and make it, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, who botched a bases-loaded chance in the first when
Charles Johnson hit into an inning-ending double play, countered
against Hampton in the third. Amaral singled, stole second and
eventually scored on Belle's two-out single to right. But Hampton
stranded two more runners and maintained a 2-1 lead by retiring
Johnson. &QL;

TALKS REPORTED ON GERMAN BID FOR BRITISH INTERNET SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's largest Internet service provider, Freeserve
PLC, is in talks to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom's Internet arm,
T-Online International, according to executives close to the
discussions. Freeserve, not yet two years old, was the first in
Britain to market an Internet service with no online charges, a
business model that has been widely imitated.
</P>
<P>
   Freeserve and its parent, the Dixons Group PLC, a British
electronics retailer, have held preliminary talks with other
interested parties, including Terra Networks, the Internet unit of
Telefonica, along with the British cable company NTL Inc. and
British Telecommunications PLC, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   While the executives stressed that a deal was not yet imminent,
they said T-Online had expressed the most interest in Freeserve.
The two companies have discussed how much T-Online might pay for
Freeserve, but have yet to reach any agreement over price, the
executives said. Freeserve's current market capitalization is
almost $8 billion. The executives also cautioned that the companies
could decide to abandon the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Dixons, which owns 80 percent of Freeserve, formed it about a
year and half ago as a side bet to get into the Internet business.
It stunned competitors by quickly becoming Britain's most heavily
used Internet access provider, displacing AOL U.K., a unit of AOL
Europe, then a joint venture of America Online and the German media
giant Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   Freeserve's main innovation was to attract customers by not
charging a monthly subscription fee. In contrast to the United
States, where Internet access over a telephone line is relatively
inexpensive, users in Britain, as in most other European countries,
pay by the minute for local phone calls, in addition to the charge
from the Internet access provider.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of charging a subscription fee, Freeserve makes money by
sharing a percentage of the revenue generated by the cost of a
user's telephone call with the phone company. Freeserve also
derives revenue from advertising and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A deal with Freeserve would be a major boon for T-Online as it
tries to create a company that reaches beyond Germany to compete
with the likes of Terra Networks, which just acquired the
U.S.-based Internet company Lycos and also has operations in Latin
America.

JAIL ANNEX OVERRUNS, PRISONER RELEASE PROGRAM CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLENN E. RICE and MARK MORRIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jackson County's
legislative auditor on Monday harshly criticized millions of
dollars in cost overruns for construction of the new jail annex,
and the methods used to determine release of inmates to prevent
crowding.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among its other findings, the information criticized County
Executive Katheryn Shields, saying she had failed to include $3.4
million in her initial budget for furnishing the facility, buying
new information systems and relocating the Kansas City Board of
Election Commissioners, which was moved to make way for the annex.
</P>
<P>
   Shields' critics called for audits of the cost overruns and
release programs last year. They said Monday that the findings
showed a pattern of financial mismanagement and inattention to
public safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many dangerous criminals are released from the new jail
annex because of incompetence and mismanagement of the Shields
administration,'' said Victor Callahan, chairman of the county
Legislature. ``Another truth is that after the expenditure of $24.2
million dollars, the new jail is seriously over budget and
dangerously operated under capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said the Legislature would review the audits and press
Shields to make reforms. As for the cost overruns, he said the
Legislature would have to appropriate additional money if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The jail annex, which opened in July, was built to comply with
federal court orders to ease crowding. The project, which was
planned to add 196 beds, initially was budgeted at $18.7 million.
But the jail annex opened several months behind schedule and nearly
$6 million over budget.
</P>
<P>
   Before the audits were released Monday, Shields emphasized that
the jail annex had cost less than a $30 million version proposed by
her predecessor and had saved taxpayers millions in construction
and operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you read this (the audit) fairly, this is not a negative
audit,'' Shields said. ``They brought up some good points, but they
were not earthshaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields laid some of the blame for budget problems on the
Legislature and suggested the audits were politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative Auditor Kelly Markham Stegall, a lawyer and
certified public accountant, works for the Legislature and not the
county executive. And over Shields' objections, Missouri Auditor
Claire McCaskill's office assisted Stegall in the study of cost
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the future, the county should ensure that the budgets for
large construction projects are prepared in a detailed manner
during the planning phase of the project,'' Stegall wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Though the county's jail construction fund has about $800,000
left to meet outstanding bills, Stegall noted those could exceed $3
million. They include claims from an architect and a construction
company.
</P>
<P>
   Stegall also criticized $510,000 paid to contractors with
handwritten checks that would not have been recorded in the
county's electronic accounting system had she not found them last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Shields agreed that the checks should have been posted to the
electronic system on the day they were issued, and that steps were
being taken to correct that situation.
</P>
<P>
   Though the jail is under a federal court order to limit
crowding, Stegall said administrators should consider operating
nearer its 800-bed capacity, rather than its current limit of 725
inmates. By working with the higher limit, administrators would
have to make fewer choices about which inmates to release, Stegall
said.
</P>
<P>
   She also urged Shields to institute a stronger case-by-case
review of inmates before release to ensure public safety. Stegall
pointed to the case of an accused methamphetamine manufacturer who,
despite several arrests for drug possession and failing to appear
in court, was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current...system results in individuals being released
that have been judged to be a potential threat to the safety of the
community,'' Stegall wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Pam Taylor, the jail's population control
coordinator, noted that the system Stegall reviewed was seldom used
but had been accepted by the federal judge overseeing the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is intended as a rarely used last resort, not a daily
administrative tool,'' Taylor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The system used on a daily basis allows for a detailed review of
each prisoner before release, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan urged Taylor to keep better records on the number of
inmates who failed to make court appearances after release. Stegall
had noted that the county kept no such records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The county needs to start keeping track of the
failure-to-appear rate,'' Callahan said. ``How many more headlines
do we have to read? How many more victims have to be killed?''
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the courts, not her office, were responsible for
keeping those statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does a great disservice for the chairman (Callahan) to
paint a picture of danger when it is inaccurate,'' Shields said.
``It is very unfortunate and frustrating that he would choose to do
that.'' ( 30 )

EDITORIAL: PROTECTING PARENTAL RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 6:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has wisely affirmed a ruling by the Washington
state Supreme Court that a state statute goes too far in permitting
courts to grant grandparents visiting rights over a parent's
objections. The case, Troxel vs. Granville, raises the question of
whether and when states can intrude on parental rights to recognize
other family ties. It has been closely watched because family
structures are changing, and grandparents and other adults are
taking on parental roles.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states allow for grandparent visitation in some form. But
the Washington law, as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted in her
plurality opinion, is ``breathtakingly broad'' in that it allowed
``any person'' at ``any time'' to get visitation rights if the
court decided that visitation would ``serve the best interest of
the child.'' The court found that the law as applied in this case
unconstitutionally infringed on the fundamental parental rights of
a mother named Tommie Granville. A state judge ordered that
Granville's daughters be required to visit their paternal
grandparents without giving ``special weight'' to Granville's
views. The judge in effect substituted his judgment for hers.
</P>
<P>
   The court did not set a fixed rule for determining the
constitutionality of all visitation statutes. O'Connor said,
cautiously, that constitutionality turns on how any standard is
applied.

FORD, CLAYCOMO PLANT ARE EXPECTING ESCAPE TO BE A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ At Kansas City's auto
show earlier this year, an older man who was a Buick loyalist was
checking out the Ford Escape, the automaker's new small
sport-utility vehicle being built at the Claycomo, Mo., plant.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He confessed he had been planning to buy another passenger car,
but the new SUV had him reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. is banking on that type of thinking as it
prepares to launch the latest in its strong line of SUVs. The
Escape will represent Ford's entry into small SUVs, a niche of the
market that has been dominated by Honda, followed far behind by
DaimlerChrysler and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Honda is the perennial leader in small-SUV sales. Last year it
sold more than 120,000 CRVs. But early consumer reaction to the
Escape has analysts predicting that Ford eventually could overtake
Honda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the Escape to become the segment sales leader, taking
the top spot away from the CRV,'' said Tad Malesh, director of
North American sales forecasting for J.D. Power and Associates, an
automotive consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Escape's entry into the market could be
better. Gasoline prices are reaching record highs around the
country, interest rates are on the rise, consumer confidence is
slipping and sales of the huge SUVs are off. The effect of these
factors on overall SUV sales, however, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   SUV sales surpassed 3 million last year. Bigger SUVs are not
selling as well through the first part of 2000. However, the Ford
Explorer, the country's top-selling SUV, continues to outpace last
year's sales levels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford has been building Escapes at Claycomo for the past
several weeks, its official launch has not occurred and it
continues to receive fine-tuning on quality issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has said Escape will have a late spring or early summer
launch and will show up in dealer showrooms in August and
September. Union officials have indicated the launch could be as
early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   When Ford rolls out the Escape, it will culminate a two-year
process that began when Ford Chief Executive Jac Nasser announced
in July 1998 that the Escape would be built at Claycomo.
</P>
<P>
   Ford reportedly invested as much as $750 million in the Claycomo
facility in preparation for the Escape, adding 122,000 square feet
to the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Although union officers contend that the Escape has resulted in
the addition of several hundred production jobs, Ford officials
insist there has been little net gain of jobs at the plant. The
plant employs about 5,200 people, including 4,900 hourly employees.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Missouri aided Ford in its decision to bring the
new SUV to Claycomo. An enterprise zone was expanded that provided
a $16.6 million tax break, according to a spokeswoman with the
Missouri Department of Economic Development. In addition, Missouri
gave Ford training funds totaling $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ford already builds the top-selling F-series pickup at Claycomo,
where workers put in overtime as a way of life just to keep up with
demand. But Claycomo's passenger-car line that the Escape is
replacing has not been as busy during the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring the reliable-but-generic Tempo-Topaz models, Ford
launched the much-ballyhooed Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique in
1994 at Claycomo. After an extended period of hype proclaiming
Contour to be the ``world'' car with a $6 billion price-tag to
develop it, Ford saw Contour sales fall far short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   While the Contour received solid reviews for its quality,
critics said it was too similar, particularly in price, to the
popular Ford Taurus. The Contour suffered as Ford car buyers either
chose the Escort or Taurus, leaving Contour without a solid market
niche.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Contour-Mystique line was introduced during a
period in which Americans increasingly were turning away from
passenger cars and flocking to pickups and SUVs. The result was
that Ford's employees who built the Contour-Mystique spent several
weeks of the year off the job.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ford is replacing its passenger-car line at Claycomo with
the Escape and its Japanese version, the Mazda Tribute. Is Ford
making the same mistake again at Claycomo, producing another SUV as
the SUV market matures and gas prices surge? And is the Escape too
similar to the popular Explorer?
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry analysts and observers say no on both counts,
applauding Ford's entry into the small SUV market, and say they
consider the timing to be right.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 3 million SUVs sold last year represented a 15
percent jump from 1998. The American appetite for SUVs seemingly
has been insatiable the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ford said last month that it would cut production of
the Excursion, its biggest SUV, by 25 percent. That had some
observers predicting that with the rise in gas prices, the SUV
market had peaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see everybody look at (the Excursion) as an
indication that consumers no longer want SUVs'' said Malesh of J.D.
Power in Agoura Hills, Calif. ``There are some signs that the SUV
market is maturing, but there remain pockets of growth and pockets
where there's a slowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Malesh said there initially was a pent-up demand for the
Excursion when it was introduced late last year. People who could
afford it wanted the latest and biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat of a faddish segment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Malesh said rising gas prices are making the
biggest SUVs less attractive.
</P>
<P>
   All the better, he said, for the Escape, a small SUV that gets
24 miles per gallon on the highway. Meanwhile, the sale of small
SUVs continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot part of the market is what Ford is moving into with
the Escape,'' he said. ``There's no question that this vehicle has
a tremendous future in the long-term picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford also is upgrading the Explorer, adding a third row of
seats. That will provide some separation from the Escape in terms
of features and pricing, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Explorer is going where the Dodge Durango is,'' said David
Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive
Transportation at the University of Michigan. ``Ford certainly
doesn't want the Escape buyer to be somebody leaving the Explorer
or Expedition. They've done their internal analysis. Based on
Ford's historical success with SUVs, the Escape is going to be a
strong product.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford estimates that 70 percent of Escape buyers will be people
who previously owned passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a significant majority will be new customers,'' said
Stu Smith, the Escape brand manager for Ford. ``It's really going
to fill a need for people who have not purchased an SUV yet because
vehicles like the Explorer are too large.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Ford's selling points for the Escape will be that it is
being built on a car platform, giving it the driving
characteristics of an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to handle like a car, and it's going to be more
fuel-efficient than most SUVs,'' said George Magliano, director of
research for the WEFA Group in New York. ``It's got the best of
both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sight, co-owner of Bob Sight Ford in Lee's Summit, said he
has seven of his 10 Escapes already sold in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape will come in both front-wheel and four-wheel drive
models, but the car dealers expect the front-wheel version to be
very popular in this region.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get all the advantages of the front-wheel drive without
paying extra for the 4x4,'' said Mike Gerlt, new-car manager at Bob
Sight Ford. ``You get maybe one major snowfall a year here, so
people are looking for the front-wheel drive. It really fits this
environment and this area.''
</P>
<P>
   The Escape's front-wheel drive model begins at $18,160, and the
four-wheel drive begins at $19,785.
</P>
<P>
   Malesh of J.D. Power said Ford has priced the product
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Power is estimating that Ford will produce about 235,000
Escapes and Tributes in calendar year 2001. If the consulting firm
is accurate, the days of downtime for Ford's second line at
Claycomo may be a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reaction from consumers from the auto-show circuit was very
positive,'' said Jeff Schuster, J.D. Power's senior manager of
forecasting in Troy, Mich. ``We're expecting good (production)
volumes out of this program.'' ( 30 )

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 6:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone watching the hostage crisis in Luxembourg last week would
applaud the release of nursery school children and their caregivers
after a crazed gunman was shot by local police. But by using a
camera crew as camouflage for their gun and by shooting the suspect
who thought he was getting ready to give a television interview,
the Luxembourg police have now made it more dangerous for other
journalists to do their jobs and thus harder for them to get news
of critical importance.
</P>
<P>
   The agonizing 30-hour incident began when a man described as
psychologically troubled by Luxembourg police stormed into a
village day care center, taking 37 children and three teachers
hostage. When the gunman demanded time on television to air his
grievances about losing custody of his children, police borrowed
equipment from Radio Television Luxemburg to use as cover. They
then shot and disabled the gunman as he approached the mock crew
for his appointed ``interview.''
</P>
<P>
   While police celebrated the happy outcome, many experienced
journalists were understandably horrified at the way they went
about it. In their business of gathering information, journalists
must be armed only with the tools of their reporting trade, and
their sole task is to transmit as much truth and reality as
possible to their public audience. The singularity of that mission
is what makes it crucial that journalists are solely journalists,
not secret government agents or undercover police. Any confusion,
even for a good cause, can expand into more danger in the future
for people who already range across some of the most dangerous
territory in the world _ trying to convince rebel armies, for
example, that a press badge is a sign of neutrality, the camera is
not a threat and the reporter is not armed. Any erosion of
journalistic neutrality could limit the wide range of news and
information we have learned to expect from the international media.

DEVILS TAKE A 3-1 ADVANTAGE OVER TIRED AND DEMORALIZED STARS

<P>
   DALLAS _ Rookies are supposed to bide their time in the Stanley
Cup playoffs, settling for little ice time and minor roles. The
pressure of the championship round, especially, is supposed to be
for battle-tested veterans who are proven through years of
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have plenty of veterans, and they played well again
Monday night. But two significant goals were scored by rookies,
John Madden and Brian Rafalski. Both contributed to a 3-1 victory
that left the Devils one victory from the Stanley Cup. In the
four-of-seven games series, they lead the defending champions by 3
games to 1. The other goal, the first of a stunning comeback, was
scored by Sergei Brylin.
</P>
<P>
   The teams will not play Game 5 until Thursday night in
Continental Arena. By that time, the Devils should have a better
sense of the condition of Jason Arnott, their best forward in this
tournament. Late in the game, while the Devils were on a power
play, Arnott was hit in the face by Derian Hatcher, the big Dallas
defenseman and captain who is known for rough play.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott, walking unsteadily, had to be helped to the locker room
after Hatcher's hit Arnott in the head. Although it was difficult
to immediately ascertain the point of contact, it appeared that
both Hatcher's hands and the butt end of his stick came up to meet
Arnott. Curiously, although the incident occurred in full few of a
capacity crowd, no penalty was called by either referee, Kerry
Fraser or Bill McCreary.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils' domination in the third period was thorough and
breathtaking. They outshot the Stars by 31-17 in the game and by
15-4 in the third period. The Stars, an older team, looked
exhausted and demoralized, despite having opened the third period
with a 1-0 lead. But the Devils surged ahead with three goals in a
span of 3 minutes and 41 seconds by Brylin, Madden and Rafalski.
</P>
<P>
   Brylin scored at 2:27 on a rebound, finishing a Russian
combination with Alexander Mogilny and Vladimir Malakhov. Playing
one of his best games since joining the Devils in the second half
of the regular season, Malakhov took a pass from Mogilny, burst
into the Dallas zone, and passed back to Mogilny, whose shot was
stopped by Dallas goalie Ed Belfour. Brylin stabbed successfully at
the rebound to tie the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Madden, a rookie center and defensive specialist, scored while
shorthanded at 4:51 to give the Devils a 2-1 lead. During the
regular season, he had six shorthanded goals to lead the National
Hockey League. On this particular penalty-killing shift, it was his
second short-handed chance. After Ken Daneyko chipped the puck to
Sergei Nemchinov, Madden took the next pass and rushed down the ice
to beat the goalie with a wrist shot.
</P>
<P>
   Rafalski, another of the Devils four rookies who play regularly,
gave New Jersey a 3-1 lead at 6:08 after streaking in on Belfour
after a neutral zone turnover by Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The tight play and low scoring over the first two periods were
no surprise. Although the Devils won the first game by the flukey
score of 7-3, the next two games both ended at 2-1, with the Stars
winning Game 2 and the Devils winning Game 3. &UR;  &LR;  Back in the lineup
for Dallas was Jamie Langenbrunner, a right wing who had missed the
previous five games with a knee sprain. Langenbrunner was re-united
with his center, Nieuwendyk, who had been slumping, without a goal
or an assist this series.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks Monday morning, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock discussed
Nieuwendyk, who won the Conn Smythe trophy last season as the most
valuable player in the tournament as the Stars won the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody focuses on the goal-scoring,'' Hitchcock said.
``That wasn't the reason he won the Conn Smythe. He was an
emotional leader. He played out of character for two months. He was
physical. He fought. He was a gritty guy in the real critical
areas. If Nieuwendyk wades in, plays out of character again, then
we have got ourselves a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scoreless first period, neither Langebrunner nor
Nieuwendyk had a shot on goal. The teams exchanged lengthy spurts
of dominance, first the Devils, then the Stars, then the Devils
again. New Jersey failed to score on two consecutive power-play
attempts, the best chance being Randy McKay's short push from the
crease.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, the Dallas sniper, had good scoring chances in the
first minute of the period and again in the final minute. Skating
impressively for the Devils was Scott Niedermayer, who led rushes
from his defensive position.
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher, the Dallas defenseman, also joined the attack
for his side, moving deep into New Jersey ice, albeit at a slower
rate of speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars got a great scoring chance when four Devils converged
on Hull at the New Jersey blue line and he worked the puck low to
his linemate, Mike Modano. But as Modano moved in toward the net,
Brodeur forced the play by charging from his crease for a poke
check that left Modano tumbling to ice.
</P>
<P>
   At the first intermission, Nieuwendyk was asked in a television
interview about having Langenbrunner back. ``We had a lot of jump
that first period,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``He's an impact player. He
plays with a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk scored the only goal of the second period, on a power
play, and the Stars carried a 1-0 lead into the third period. The
Devils had the best of play in the middle period, keeping the Stars
from even shooting on goal for more than 10 minutes, a span that
included two Dallas power plays.
</P>
<P>
   But when Vladimir Malakhov of the Devils went off for
cross-checking at 16:38, the Stars mounted a concentrated attack.
The scored when Nieuwendyk planted himself in Brodeur's crease and
stayed there while Darryl Sydor fired the puck from the left point.
It caromed around Brodeur's skates and Nieuwendyk finished the play
by pushing the puck over the line at 18:02.

JUDGE WITHDRAWS FROM NUCLEAR SECRETS TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal judge who was to oversee the trial of a scientist
accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets from the Los Alamos
National Laboratory announced Monday that he is excusing himself
from the case to assume senior status.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John Edwards Conway of federal District
Court in Albuquerque, N.M., was scheduled to preside over the trial
of Wen Ho Lee, a Los Alamos National Laboratory physicist who is
accused of having illegally downloaded a mountain of highly
sensitive nuclear secrets with the intention of passing them to a
foreign power.
</P>
<P>
   Conway, 66, had earlier set Wednesday as the date for arguments
on a defense motion to suppress the warrant the government had
obtained to search Lee's home last year. He had also scheduled for
Monday a pivotal hearing on the defense motion that all the
classified information Lee is accused of downloading be admissible
in open court.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has vigorously denied the charges and has maintained that
nearly all the data he downloaded was already publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   Conway said in a statement that he had decided to take what is
known as senior status, a kind of semi-retirement which allows him
to decrease his case load and that he had chosen to drop out of the
Lee case. An experienced judge, Conway was appointed to the bench
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there and done that,'' Conway said of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was scheduled for Nov. 6, but that date has also been
canceled and the new date will be up to U.S. District Judge James
A. Parker, who as been assigned to replace Conway . Parker is
familiar with the case, having presided over a series of bail
hearings in January when Lee was denied bail because of the
government's contentions that he posed a threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   The change in judges came several weeks after the government's
unexpected announcement that it was replacing the lead prosecutor
in the case. Bob Gorence, an assistant U.S. attorney in
Albuquerque, had been in charge, but was replaced without
explanation with George Stamboulidis, an experienced organized
crime prosecutor from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to move as quickly as possible for an expedited
trial and hope to exonerate Lee,'' said Mark Holscher, one of Lee's
defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's office in Albuquerque said simply that the
announcement ``speaks for itself.''

LAKERS EVOLVING INTO CHAMPIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some changes are too subtle for the naked eye to
detect. The long-awaited transformation of the Lakers from fatally
unsound to finals-bound, could not be seen with a casual glance in
mid-January or even with a more pointed examination in April.
</P>
<P>
   The uniforms, still purple and gold. The faces, mostly the same.
More wins but no shortage of disappointments along the way _ always
another reminder that for the last decade, high expectations
usually were followed by disaster.
</P>
<P>
   A change was nevertheless taking place, even if there was no
obvious signal, nothing to scream, ``Champions in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's Game 7 victory in the Western Conference finals now
stands as the defining moment for this Lakers team. One
fourth-quarter comeback from 15 points down stands as one of the
greatest wins in Lakers history and as tangible evidence that this
group has indeed evolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've slowly taken another step,'' said fourth-year guard
Derek Fisher, ``in terms of establishing consistency, in terms of
establishing a tradition everybody wants to see us establish. And I
think (the victory) is another example of us growing into that
basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher knows about what Los Angeles and a franchise with a proud
history was waiting to see. He arrived as a rookie in the summer of
1996, along with rookie Kobe Bryant and free-agent signee Shaquille
O'Neal. The expectations accompanied that banner offseason.
</P>
<P>
   They have never been closer to fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of times we were thrusted into being the team
that we're supposed to be but really weren't quite ready to be that
team,'' Fisher said. ``But (Sunday), we took another step. And the
final step has not been taken yet, but this definitely helps us
going into the next round.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the finals step.
</P>
<P>
   As coach Phil Jackson noted with a quickly scrawled ``4 TO GO''
on the locker room dry-erase board, the Lakers are not yet
champions. But the overwhelming feeling is they have already passed
their greatest test. It seems unlikely that the Indiana Pacers _ or
any team, for that matter _ could push, pull, prod, fluster and
flummox the Lakers for seven games the way the Portland Trail
Blazers just did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope not,'' Rick Fox said with a laugh. ``No lack of respect
for the Pacers. You'd like to not have to deal with those ups and
downs like we did. But no one's going to give it to us. We're going
to have to go out and take it. We went out and took it (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   It was, Fox agreed, the most poise under pressure this team has
displayed ``since I've been here, even this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And that subtle change in the Lakers was at last revealed in
their facial expressions _ from Shaquille O'Neal's crazy-eyed,
mouth-gaping exuberance after his fourth-quarter slam dunk, to the
exhausted, dazed look of Fox, sitting at his locker, still in
uniform, 30 minutes after the 89-84 win was over.
</P>
<P>
   And in the joyous, boyish glee on the face of 21-year-old star
Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited,'' Bryant said. ``I'm extremely excited. I'm
playing for the whole thing, going to the big dance. It's something
I dreamed about all my 21 years. The moment is finally here, so I'm
just going to enjoy it. We're going to give it all we've got.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be anticlimactic from here. The Pacers don't have the
personnel to swarm O'Neal the way the Blazers did, nor are they as
deep and athletic as Portland.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers know better now than to underestimate anyone. And
the championship has yet to be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one remembers who finishes second 10 years down the road,''
said Jackson, seeking his seventh ring to go with six Chicago Bulls
championships. ``The reality is when you get here, you've got to
win it. And we may have learned enough at this point to know how to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But both of us, Indiana and us, are coming into this finals,
neither team having been in the finals. ... And I think it carries
some weight that Shaq has been in the finals and knows the
experience, and Brian Shaw also. And (Robert) Horry, of course
(Ron) Harper. So we have a little bit of experience as individuals
but not as a team. We have to build on what we did (Sunday) to be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was so emotionally and physically spent Sunday evening in
the wake of the win, he said he couldn't even remember things that
happened an hour before. He didn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only hope I feel this way a week and a half from now,
again,'' he said. ``I'm sure ... winning a championship, the level
of adrenaline and exhaustion will be even greater, but I'll take
it. I'll deal with it. I'll learn how to deal with it.'' &QL;

SPARKS' McCRIMMON FINDS HER NICHE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nikki McCrimmon honed her skills as a quick, defensive, flashy
guard on the school yards in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   It was her defensive intensity minus the flash that gave her the
nod as the Sparks backup point guard.
</P>
<P>
   McCrimmon was the Sparks fourth-round draft pick, but she beat
out Nicole Kubik, the first-round draft pick, and Felecity Willis,
who was picked up in the Sparks invitational tryout, for the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Nikki since the Say No Classic,'' Sparks coach
Michael Cooper said. ``I was going to give her a shot. She's a
gamer. She's defensive-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   In two games, McCrimmon have shown she can provide an offesive
boost, as well. She has 11 points with 3 of 4 attempts made from
the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can shot the ball. She just has to understand when to take
her shot,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   It's been two years since the former USC guard played
professionally. She started her pro career with the American
Basketball League's Long Beach StingRays before she was traded to
Atlanta. After the grass roots league folded in 1998 McCrimmon
supported herself by substitute teaching in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   But she never gave up on basketball. She trained on her own and
played pickup games to tune up her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited for a long time and nothing was given to me,''
McCrimmon said. ``Just because Lisa (Leslie) is here and I played
with Lisa and Coach (Marianne) Stanley is here that had no bearing
on me making the team. I just went out there and played hard.''
</P>
<P>
   That McCrimmon is playing in the league today is a tribute to
her persistence. With no agent, she made several requests to Renee
Brown, WNBA director of player personnel, about getting an
invitation to the combine in April. Eventually her pop calls paid
off.
</P>
<P>
   McCrimmon has shown a lot of maturity since her days in the ABL.
She's learned to be a role player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of mistakes playing in the ABL, things that I
needed to work on. Things that I didn't know that I know now as far
as attitude, being mentally tough. I'm older now. I learned from
the best and that's something that's going to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   No one's more aware of McCrimmon's progress than Sparks
assistant coach Marianne Stanley, who coached the wiry guard at
USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a maturity step for her,'' Stanley said. ``At least on
this team our needs are to have stability, quality play at the
point, taking care of the basketball, and making good decisions
here. That's what we need our point guards here to do. We don't
need her to be Allan Iverson. We have some tremendous talent in a
number of different positions. We need someone whose like the glue
that runs the engine that keeps in all together.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrimmon can't wait for the road trip to her New York when the
Sparks play the Liberty on June 25. As the youngest of eight,
she'll get a chance to visit her seven siblings and, time
permitting, go by the famous Ruckers Park in Harlem, where NBA
legends like Julius Erving have played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be grounded there. I need that street ball, to play out
there and talk to them, step away from being a professional athlete
and just be Nikki,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And when it's time to play New York, there will be a personal
cheering section reserved just for McCrimmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole of Harlem will be at Madison Square Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   SPARKS NOTES: The Sparks are 2-0 after defeating Minnesota 82-75
Saturday. ... Portland Fire, one of four expansion teams, is 1-1.
They extended three-time defending champion Houston to
double-overtime before losing 93-89 in their season opener. &QL;

NIEUWENDYK SCORES, BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO OVERCOME DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If Brett Hull doesn't score, the Dallas Stars don't
win, not even when Joe Nieuwendyk scores a point. It has been that
simple in the Stanley Cup finals thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in four games, Hull _ the leading scorer in the
playoffs this season _ has been held without a goal. The Stars have
lost all three times.
</P>
<P>
   In a pivotal Game 4, Hull went scoreless Monday night. And the
New Jersey Devils shook off Nieuwendyk's first goal of the finals
to score three goals in the first 6 minutes 8 seconds of the final
period and rally for a 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took a 3-1 lead in the best-of-7 series and can
capture the second Stanley Cup championship in their history when
the series resumes at Continental Arena on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he scored the Stars' only goal, the biggest Dallas
shot of the evening did not belong to Nieuwendyk. Nor did it come
from Hull, whose two goals in Game 2 paced the Stars to their only
victory. Instead, it was a cheap shot that emanated from the
forearms of defenseman Derian Hatcher, who knocked Jason Arnott out
of the game with 7 1/2 minutes left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars had come into the game 7-0 in these playoffs when
Nieuwendyk scored a point. The 30-year-old center, the most
valuable player of the playoffs last season, scored his first goal
of this season's finals here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk's first point of the finals came with 1 minute 52
seconds remaining in the second period. He scored it on the power
play, from behind Martin Brodeur in the crease, with a backhanded
sweep of a loose puck behind Brodeur's legs.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was Nieuwendyk's seventh of the playoffs this spring,
but it was also his first in six games. Nieuwendyk's resurgence
just happened to coincide with the return of his favorite linemate,
left wing Jamie Langenbrunner. The mere presence of Langenbrunner,
who had missed the last five games _ including the first three
games of the finals _ with a knee injury, seemed to light a fire
under Nieuwendyk Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But had the Stars not lost two of the first three games of the
finals, Langenbrunner never would have been playing Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock was gambling that Langenbrunner's
presence, even if it were at less than full strength, would give
the Stars a second line that the Devils must take seriously. The
Devils hadn't needed to take any line, other than Mike Modano's top
line, seriously thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk scored his goal on the power play, with Modano and
Hull as his linemates. Still, Nieuwendyk did have more life Monday
night. With Langenbrunner on his wing, he was definitely more
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of jump,'' Nieuwendyk admitted between periods.
``We spent a lot of time in their own end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an impact player,'' he said Langenbrunner. ``He plays
with a lot of energy. He's great to have in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were hoping that Langenbrunner, who has been out since
Game 5 of the Western Conference finals, could help dig Nieuwendyk
out of his funk. Nieuwendyk had not scored a point since
Langenbrunner injured his knee. The two teamed for 21 goals during
last season's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody says he adds goal scoring,'' Hitchcock said Monday
morning, when asked what Langenbrunner's return brings to his team.
``He's got one so far. Hopefully he can add to that. He's a gritty
guy. This is a gritty series.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first three games of the series, the Stars were a
one-line team. But even that line, with Modano centering for Hull
and Jere Lehtinen, had been no match for the Devils' top line of
Arnott centering for Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora for two of the
first three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, Jamie can bring back some chemistry and some
continuity,'' Hitchcock had said Monday morning. ``That was a very
good line when it played together. Unfortunately, we've had some
injured people on it. But it has always given us a big boost. If
Jamie is able, it could really help us.''
</P>
<P>
   It did for two periods. But, unfortunately for Dallas, it was
not enough. &QL;
