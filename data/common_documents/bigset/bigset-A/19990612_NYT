DEFOREST KELLEY, CREATOR OF DR. MCCOY ON `STAR TREK,' DIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., Teas)   By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times Nws Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DeForest Kelley, the crotchety country doctor who healed
countless human and nonhuman patients as Dr. Leonard McCoy on the
science fiction TV series ``Star Trek,'' died Friday at the Motion
Pictures and Television Fund Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 79,
and had last donned a space uniform in 1991 for yet another ``Star
Trek'' film sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Although he appeared in 150 earth-bound films and television
shows, including roles in the ``Lone Ranger,'' ``Gunsmoke'' and
``Bonanza,'' Kelley was best known as the crusty physician on the
USS Enterprise, known by Trekkies as ``Bones,'' who was Captain
James T. Kirk's confidante and Mr. Spock's occasional verbal
sparring partner.
</P>
<P>
   Most viewers remember him for a single phrase, addressed to Kirk
when asked to perform feats beyond his job description: ``Damn it
Jim,'' he would say with exasperation, ``I'm a just a country
doctor.'' The other line viewers could count on was ``He's dead,
Jim.''
</P>
<P>
   Through three decades of reruns and the six film sequels, McCoy
remained one of the most popular characters on the show and fans
appreciated his plain-spoken humanity, especially as a foil to
Spock's cool Vulcan logic.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gene Roddenberry cast him in ``Star Trek'' in 1966,
Kelley often played bad guys in police dramas or Westerns with
titles like ``Town Tamer'' and ``Apache Uprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Born on Jan. 20, 1920, in Atlanta as the son of a Baptist
minister, Kelley had planned on becoming a doctor just like the
uncle who had delivered him. But his family could not afford to
send him to medical school and he began singing on local radio
shows.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager he moved to Long Beach, Calif., where he lived
with an uncle. He worked as an elevator operator and an usher and
later performed in theater groups and on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, he lost out to Alan Ladd for the part of the baby-faced
killer in ``This Gun for Hire.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, while playing a beach bum in ``The Innocent Young
Man'' with the Long Beach Theater Group, he met the woman he would
marry, Carolyn Dowling, who co-starred in the play. The couple
celebrated their 54th wedding anniversary last year. She is his
only survivor.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army Air Forces in New Mexico during World
War II, he was transferred to Culver City to act in a Navy training
film, ``Time to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned into one of the biggest breaks of Kelley's career. A
Paramount scout spotted him in the film, which led to a three-year
contract with the studio producing low-budget movies.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, he appeared in a television pilot written by a
former police officer, Roddenberry. It did not sell, but it led to
the ``Star Trek'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek'' was canceled by NBC in 1969 because of poor
ratings, but it became popular in syndication in the 1970s. From
1979 to 1991, Kelley appeared in six ``Star Trek'' films and
delighted his fans by showing up at innumerable Star Trek
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country,'' he retired
from acting.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Houston Chronicle last year, Kelley
admitted that he never liked the science fiction genre and that he
never watched the sequel to the television series.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought his legacy would be, he said that had
inspired a great number of people to enter the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are doctors now, all kinds of doctors who save
lives,'' he said. ``That's something that very few people can say
they've done. I'm proud to say that I have.''

JOHN WHITING, ANTHROPOLOGIST AT HARVARD, DIES AT 90  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass. , Conn., Kenya, New Guinea)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Wesley Mayhew Whiting, a professor emeritus of social
anthropology at Harvard who studied learning processes and child
development in varying societies, died May 13 at home in Chilmark,
Mass., in the house where he was born on Martha's Vineyard. He was
90.
</P>
<P>
   Whiting and his wife of 60 years, Beatrice Blyth Whiting, a
fellow Harvard anthropologist, formed one of the most enduring
husband-wife teams in their discipline, and, although he retired
from teaching in 1978, they continued with a cross-cultural field
study of adolescence into the 1980s. His most important research
papers, with new introductions, were also reprinted after his
retirement, and in 1994 Cambridge University Press published
``Culture and Human Development,'' his memoir with selected papers.
</P>
<P>
   Whiting graduated in 1931 from Yale University, where he was
captain of the wrestling team, then went on to earn a doctorate in
sociology and anthropology there in 1938. He was on the staff of
the Institute of Human Relations at Yale until 1947, with time out
for wartime service in the Navy. He moved to Harvard's new
Laboratory of Human Development in the Graduate School of Education
in 1949, served as its director for a time and was named the first
Bigelow Professor of Education in 1960. He became professor of
social anthropology three years later.
</P>
<P>
   His field work led to the publication of ``Becoming a Kwoma:
Teaching and Learning in a New Guinea Tribe'' in 1941. His
comparative studies of child behavior and parental practices sought
out common features of human development in diverse societies.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife developed a course that became a training base
in comparative child development for generations of Harvard
graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitings also founded and directed the Child Development
Research Unit at the University of Nairobi, which conducted field
studies in Kenya and brought Kenyans to Harvard for graduate
training.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Whiting is survived by their daughter,
Susan Whiting of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

LEGAL SOFTWARE IS GETTING BETTER AND GETTING ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (rk) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger

<TEXT>
<P>
   About a year ago, a judge in Texas issued a summary judgment to
stop the distribution of Quicken Family Lawyer '99 in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quote me: This is sick,'' said Ann Stephens, president
of PC Data, a company that tracks the sale of software for personal
computers. ``Boy, these lawyers are sticking up for their own,
aren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   The battle is still going on, although not all lawyers are
``sticking up for their own.'' Rulings banning legal-help software
have been overturned on appeal. And about two months go, the
Supreme Court of Texas told the state bar's grievance committee,
which has been trying to run legal self-help software out of the
state, to stop hiding behind secretary rulings that no longer
apply.
</P>
<P>
   Nolo Press, a company that distributes self-help books and
software, said the ruling was a major victory and something it had
requested in previous pleadings.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers argue, legal software keeps getting better and
better. Software companies have been producing such programs for
about a decade now, and they're building on experience.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that you shouldn't consult with an attorney.
Nor does it mean that all wills can be drawn up using $30 software
and be able to withstand the attack of an irate nephew cut from the
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken Family Lawyer 2000 Deluxe goes beyond simple will
making. It contains thousands of documents, but narrows down the
ones needed through a series of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The program ($30; Windows) has an estate-planning section and a
``plain language'' law dictionary with more than 7,000 legal terms.
A book, ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wills and Estates,'' is
also included. The program also has a multimedia section where
Harvard Law School Professor Arthur Miller answers frequently asked
legal questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the documents included are: wills (eight basic
circumstances, including with or without children); consumer
(complaint letters to companies, credit card lost or stolen, small
claims worksheet); landlord/tenant; credit; health and medical
(living wills, organ donation, Medicare peer review); family and
personal; and government letters.
</P>
<P>
   An estate planning section allows custom plans tailored to
specific needs. Estate planning tips pop up each time a user goes
to the estate-planning section.
</P>
<P>
   It provides additional suggestions on which documents may be
helpful in protecting an estate, gives advice on how to avoid
probate expenses and has a guide for calculating net worth.
</P>
<P>
   For those with a small business, Quicken Business Lawyer 2000
Deluxe ($40; Windows) offers both legal documents and more than
1,000 business letters for business owners.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM contains business and marketing plans, cash-flow
projection work sheets, and lease agreements. (If all these don't
help out enough, there's a bankruptcy work sheet available, too.)
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Broderbund, the company that acquired the
Quicken line, said there were 11.6 million people in the United
States who reported self-employment earnings in 1995; the average
small business spends between $5,000 and $15,000 a year in legal
fees.

HEALTH-CARE INDUSTRY'S Y2K ACTIONS CALLED `WOEFULLY INADEQUATE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prepare for Y2K as you would an oncoming tornado, experts tell
us. But no one needs to remind Oklahoma nursing home administrator
Randy Musick of that.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, tornadoes cut a deadly swath across Oklahoma and into
Kansas, leaving 42 persons dead and millions of dollars in damage.
The storm put the small rural care facility and its residents
through the ultimate Y2K drill.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hospital, the emergency backup generator, phones,
cell phones and heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems
all failed. Outside, there was no electricity, natural gas, phones
or emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons learned?
</P>
<P>
   Heavy loads on a backup generator caused it to fail after three
days. Have power backups for the backups. Don't rely on cell phones
because the lines overloaded and failed. Instead, install a battery
backup to the existing phone system. Also, create contingency
contracts with alternative suppliers and buy more blankets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whether it's an F-5 tornado or the year
2000,'' Musick testified this week before the Senate Special Y2K
committee examining hospital emergency plans and medical device
compliance. ``We need to be equally prepared for both.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by other witnesses, however, the health-care industry
simply isn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Willemssen, the General Accounting Office's Y2K expert,
said the number of noncompliant biomedical devices reported on
manufacturers' Web sites, 4,445, is much larger than the number of
noncompliant devices they report to government regulators at the
Food and Drug Administration, 897.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the status of biomedical equipment is unknown because a
significant number of care providers do not respond to requests for
information, Willemssen said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to crack down, the FDA has said it will publish a
list of high-risk equipment. A draft list now contains about 70
devices, including a powered emergency ventilator, an infusion
pump, a blood-sugar test system and a fetal cardiac monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency also may issue public warnings or suggest
voluntary recalls if it finds medical devices that could
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, said Kevin Thurm, the Health and Human
Services deputy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In extreme cases, Thurm said, dangerous devices will be seized.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The health-care industry is ``woefully inadequate''
in its year 2000 preparations, said Senate Y2K committee spokesman
Don Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those rare industries that we've poked and
prodded and held hearings on and studied. And still, they are at
the same lack of readiness as they were six months ago,'' he said.
``It's rather dumbfounding.''
Drug supplies
</P>
<P>
   The President's Year 2000 Conversion Council and a host of
pharmaceutical officials will release guidelines on Monday
addressing whether consumers should stockpile prescription drugs
before Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there has been no common ground for consumer
advocates and drug-supply manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports recommends up to a two-month supply of
life-sustaining drugs. Drug suppliers say that's excessive and will
only create a self-fulfilling prophecy of shortages. They recommend
a two-week supply of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines will appear on the White House Y2K Web site _
{www.y2k.gov} _ early in the week.
No limits yet
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has again postponed a vote on a bill that would limit
class-action lawsuits from consumers or businesses whose computers
have Y2K breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure say the nation's high-tech companies
need legislative protection to avoid a flurry of lawsuits caused by
software or computers that malfunction after the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has been pushed by large corporations and the
high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has threatened to veto the measure, which was
supposed to come to a vote on Friday. Opponents contend the bill
would stop consumers and small businesses from recovering economic
losses in court.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unnamed congressional aides, /{The Washington Post/} said
holding the vote Tuesday, when Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates
and other CEOs are in Washington, will make it more difficult for
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to continue their
opposition to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint Economic Committee of Congress and the Business
Software Alliance are planning a joint meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
of Mississippi, said the postponement was not aimed at putting
pressure on Clinton and Gore.

STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR IN A CAMP, NOT A CLASSROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY BERRIOS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Unlike the soldiers who attacked the Jesse
James Farm near Kearney, Mo., in 1863, the ones Friday were
friendly visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in heavy wool jackets, long-sleeve wool shirts, denim
pants, wool hats and military-style boots, six cadets from
Wentworth Military Academy's Civil War Living History Camp gave a
two-hour demonstration to about 50 onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not every day you get to start a fire, shoot muskets and
learn about the 1800s,'' said 17-year-old cadet Capt. Robert
Teachenor as he stirred bacon and onions in a cast-iron skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Hibberd V.B. Kline, Wentworth's vice president of
administration, said the Living History Camp at the academy in
Lexington, Mo., represented a mythical military academy like
Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Va., in 1860.
</P>
<P>
   Students learn drill and tactics. They also study ``current
events'' from the time period, such as the Kansas-Nebraska Act.
</P>
<P>
   The program, in its first year, started June 5 and ends July 7.
It is open to boys ages 14-18, and not limited to Wentworth
students. The group will participate in a re-enactment of the
Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania July 2-4.
</P>
<P>
   The James farm, the site of Friday's demonstration, once was
attacked by Union soldiers in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Teachenor, a Wentworth senior, made ``cush,'' a
mixture of bacon, onions, zucchini, cornmeal and seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Prosser, 17 of Riverside, Calif., abstained from the meal
because he was a vegetarian. Prosser, a Wentworth junior, munched
on a carrot and a biscuit the soldiers called hardtack.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the camp, Prosser said, was making friends and
learning about the Civil War. The worst part was the uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets pretty hot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cadets agreed that shooting the muskets was the
``coolest'' part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Alexander, a 15-year-old high school sophomore visiting
from San Antonio, said she was impressed that the participants were
the same age as many Civil War soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot better to see it re-enacted than read it in a
history book,'' she said.

CHANGE IN ORDER AGREES WITH O'NEILL AS YANKS TOP MARLINS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ How is Albert Belle hitting? Paul O'Neill asked before
Friday's game. When told Belle's average was sinking below .250,
O'Neill thought about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' he said, grinning. ``I'm not the only one who's not
hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill may soon escape Belle's hell. Since being dropped from
the No. 3 spot to No. 5 in the New York Yankees' order, O'Neill has
begun spraying hits all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   He had a double, two singles and a walk, Jorge Posada drove in
five runs, and Orlando Hernandez, pitching his first game in South
Florida since his defection from Cuba, pitched 6 2/3 innings as the
Yankees beat the Florida Marlins, 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, was here to
watch and tell tales of the team's visit to the White House on
Thursday. When Steinbrenner and President Clinton descended the
steps together and ``Hail to the Chief'' was played, the president
turned to Steinbrenner and said, ``Don't get any ideas, it's not
for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the White House, anyway. But Steinbrenner reigns in the
Yankees' organization, and for now, he is projecting a patient
look, in spite of the team's relative mediocrity over the last
month. Because Joe Torre is the manager, Steinbrenner said, he is
sure the Yankees will play better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' Steinbrenner said. ``We're in first place,
playing the way we are. We're going to get turned around, and we're
getting close. Yeah, we're on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner agrees with Torre's recent lineup changes, the
demotion of O'Neill and Chuck Knoblauch's two-day assignment near
the bottom of the batting order. (Knoblauch returned to the top of
the Yankees' lineup Friday night.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shaking them up a little,'' said Steinbrenner, referring
to Torre. ``You take a guy like O'Neill. He's my supreme warrior,
he's the ultimate warrior, and he's having trouble. A little change
might not hurt. Knoblauch is another warrior. We've got a team full
of warriors. I think they proved that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as O'Neill said this week, this year is not last year and
the Yankees are not overwhelming. Florida's Brian Meadows, a
right-hander with a 5.07 ERA, had never allowed fewer than two runs
in his first 12 starts of the year, and yet he held the Yankees
hitless through the first three innings. Derek Jeter was the first
Yankee to reach base, with a one-out single in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied the score at 1-1 in the fifth, after O'Neill
pulled a double that skipped off the wall in right, took third on a
wild pitch and scored on Posada's groundout. Tino Martinez walked
to open the seventh inning against Meadows. With the Marlins' Kevin
Millar holding Martinez at first, O'Neill bounded a single through
the right side of the infield, Martinez taking third base.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows got ahead of Posada, no balls and two strikes, and like
other pitchers have done so successfully against Posada this year,
Meadows attempted to finish Posada with soft stuff, a change-up _
but left it high in the strike zone. Posada crushed a three-run
homer, giving Hernandez (7-5) a hefty advantage.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque, as Hernandez is known, walked into a restaurant with
his brother Livan here early Friday morning, and even past
midnight, the arrival of the Hernandez brothers _ Livan pitches for
the Marlins _ created a scene. They shook hands with restaurant
patrons, who recognized them instantly, Orlando grinning and
greeting.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he had signed a ball for a fan in another
city: Clinton asked for an autograph from Hernandez, and he
presented a jersey to the president. This is Hernandez's life in
the United States, just 18 months after defecting from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Hernandez brothers sat together for an interview with ESPN,
and Livan _ who will throw against the Yankees on Saturday _ was
asked what he thought about El Duque's defection from Cuba in a
boat. ``Lunacy,'' Livan answered. ``Just lunacy.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's here, and thriving. Hernandez, who always seems to
pitch well in the spotlight, allowed just two unearned runs,
changing speeds and throwing strikes. He also got his first hit, a
bunt single in the seventh inning. When he was relieved with two
out in the bottom of the inning, the fans stood and roared for him.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Worm.Explore.Zip computer bug has been
sneaky and mean, fooling some pretty savvy computer users and
devouring files on tens of thousands of computers this week.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of Worm sightings Thursday at such big-name
companies as General Electric, AT&AMP;T, Boeing, Compaq and even
Microsoft. But it appeared Friday that the bug, which disguises
itself as friendly e-mail, was being contained by computer
administrators across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Worm was tricky enough to claim a few victims who
probably should have known better, such as Steve Lunceford of
Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   When Lunceford tapped into Sprint's intranet, he read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, Steve! I got your email. I'll get back to you ASAP. In the
meantime, check out these documents.''
</P>
<P>
   When he did, his computer went kaput.
</P>
<P>
   ``It totally destroyed my drive,'' said Lunceford, who works at
a Sprint office in Washington but was in Kansas City Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost about two weeks of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunceford did catch the Worm fast enough to keep it from
spreading to other computers, which it does by sending a copy of
itself as a reply to any incoming e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Companywide, Sprint's network security staff caught the virus
early. Lunceford was one of only four Sprint employees affected.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the security staff at Cerner Corp., the North Kansas
City software maker, detected the virus early Thursday morning and
moved quickly to protect files and hard drives, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, about 5 percent of Cerner's computer files were
deleted, but all critical documents among them were recalled from
backup systems, said Jerry Smith, Cerner's business systems
director.
</P>
<P>
   Other heavy computer users in the Kansas City area appeared to
have ducked the virus, thanks in part to a combination of prompt
warnings and protective software.
</P>
<P>
   No one involved with the Silicon Prairie Technology Association
had reported any problems as of midafternoon Friday, said Susan E.
Catts, the organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   Spot checks Friday turned up no problems at such institutions as
Hallmark Cards, the Kansas City Board of Trade and Kansas City
Power &AMP; Light. The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce hadn't
heard of any troubles among its members as of midafternoon Friday,
said Dick Gibson, an executive there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most businesses are being very wise and warning employees not
to open any e-mail that looks suspicious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block Inc. learned of the problem early in the day and was
able to provide descriptions of the potentially damaging messages,
said Todd Ransom, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri and Kansas state government offices also reported no
problems, as did most area municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri uses antivirus software aggressively, ``and in fact
we've even seen a drop in problems during the last month,'' said
Kay Dinolfo, a spokeswoman in Jefferson City.
</P>
<P>
   The bug did show up on three or four government computers in
Overland Park, Kan., but anti-virus software stopped users from
opening the e-mail.

CLINTON HAILS B-2 AND ITS CREWS AT WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOB NOSTER, Mo. _ Basking in military victory over Yugoslavia,
President Clinton on Friday visited the home of the B-2 stealth
bomber to thank the crews of a ``truly remarkable aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton toured Whiteman Air Force Base east of Kansas City,
where the batlike B-2s took off and landed for their 30-hour,
round-trip sorties to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told airmen and their families in a crowded hangar: ``I
want you to know that we are very proud of you. Thanks to you, the
century is ending not with helpless indignation over such
unspeakable cruelty, but with its opposite, a ringing affirmation
by a free people of human dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
accepted terms of a peace agreement because of the B-2's ability to
wreak havoc.
</P>
<P>
   ``You made him do it,'' Clinton said, stressing each word.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was a day for warm embraces between the commander in
chief and some of the men he ordered into combat. The Whiteman
crowd cheered the president often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he said was beautiful,'' said Staff Sgt. Vurtis
Cunningham. ``I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before speaking, the president inspected the enormous B-2s.
Guided by two pilots, he climbed into the plane's cramped cockpit
and peered out a window.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated $2 billion bombers, designed for their quiet
flight and ability to avoid radar detection, proved remarkably
effective, the president said. The jets were among the first allied
planes to fly into hostile territory, where they dumped loads of
satellite-guided ``smart bombs'' on heavily guarded targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, (the Serbs) still don't know you were
there,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He drew a rousing cheer when he added that the 50 missions the
B-2s flew represented less than 1 percent of the total number of
missions flown in the conflict. But the B-2s dropped 11 percent of
the bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit was a moment of vindication _ for him and the
aircraft. The president was criticized for not defining the war's
objectives more clearly and for stipulating early on that he would
not use ground troops. Critics said that admission gave Milosevic a
strategic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know,'' he said, ``everybody in America was free to
tell me I was wrong about this from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   The B-2, meanwhile, was questioned for its enormous expense and
criticized that it would never live up to its billing. The first
B-2 was publicly displayed in 1988, but was not used in the Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an I-told-you-so day,'' said U.S. Rep. Ike Skelton of
Lexington, Mo., a Democrat who pushed hard for the money to build
the aircraft. ``The B-2 has modernized modern warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Whiteman is home to 10 of the aircraft, but only six were used
in eastern Europe. The others were either not ready for combat,
were undergoing maintenance or were being used for training, said
Brig. Gen. Leroy Barnidge.
</P>
<P>
   The president's visit to Whiteman included three segments: He
toured the plane, visited with about 50 crew members and family
members and delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton reminded the crowd that allied forces
achieved victory by the force of their bombs as well as the power
of their example. By fielding a diverse military, the forces
provided a ``stern rebuke on a daily basis'' to ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``His whole justification for power has been to tell the Serbian
people that...their country can only be great when everybody's just
like everybody else,'' the president said of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, look around here,'' Clinton said, his gaze sweeping the
room. ``You put the lie to that by the power of your example. And
make no mistake about that, it is even more powerful than the power
of our bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   On his flight from Washington, Clinton met for about an hour
with an 11-member congressional delegation that included five
members from Missouri and one from Kansas. Their discussion ranged
from Kosovo to China to Russia and the Mideast and, at one point,
turned to home health care.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton visited the base, a handful of protesters stood
outside the gates challenging the decision to bomb Serbia. They
held signs saying, ``Let's try setting a peaceful example (for the
kids)'' and ``Bombs do not produce peace or freedom.''

PLUMBERS BACK TO WORK AS UNION, COMPANIES REACH AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Striking plumbers in the Kansas City area
returned to work Friday, ending a 10-day walkout. Roofers, however,
remained off the job with more talks set for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Plumbers Local 8 ratified a new three-year contract
in a meeting Thursday evening, said Rick Wallace, Local 8's
business manager.
</P>
<P>
   About 650 area union plumbers will receive a $6.09 increase in
hourly wages and benefits over three years under the new agreement.
However, the economic package was not the issue that led to the
strike last week.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the plumbing companies, represented by the
Mechanical Contractors Association, were seeking to create a
pre-apprenticeship position that would pay less than what other
union plumbers earn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what was the big stumbling block for us,'' he said.
``Our members and the local were concerned that the language the
association wanted would undermine our apprenticeship program.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the association agreed to contract language that
satisfied the union.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Brandon, president of A.D. Jacobson &AMP; Co. and leader of
the association's negotiating committee, said no more than one or
two workers in the pre-apprenticeship position would be working on
any single project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we were out of work for eight (work) days, but
we'll try to make up for the lost time and get things going
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the plumbers union's first strike in 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a strike-happy bunch,'' Wallace said. ``But that's
how seriously our members took the issue over the apprenticeship
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Dunn, president and chief executive officer of J.E. Dunn
Construction Co., said many plumbers were back to work Friday and
that virtually all of them should return by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dunn remained concerned about the strike by Roofers
Local 20, which has about 400 members off the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``That situation remains tenuous,'' he said. ``We're still
monitoring that one closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hadel, Local 20's business manager, said a meeting between
the union and the Associated Roofers was scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The roofers are seeking wage and benefits gains as well as a
reversal of some work-rule concessions made in the 1980s, when the
construction market was depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both parties might present something new,'' he said.
``We'll have to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, work by other unionized construction workers
continues at various commercial projects because Local 20 has not
picketed those sites.

AMERICAN CENTURY LOSES FOUR PEOPLE FROM FUND TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Four of the five persons running the American
Century Select Fund resigned Thursday to join another mutual fund
family, Kansas City-based American Century said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fund co-managers Jean Ledford and Richard Welsh and two of the
three analysts assigned to the fund resigned late in the afternoon,
said Chris Doyle, an American Century spokesman. He said they have
been hired by First Union Corp., the Charlotte, N.C.-based banking
company that owns the Evergreen Funds.
</P>
<P>
   A First Union spokesman declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said the departing American Century managers and analysts
were not commenting Friday, pending an announcement from First
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Select, with $7 billion in assets, is American Century's
third-largest fund.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle said Jim Stowers III would step into the manager's seat at
Select. Stowers, American Century's chief executive officer,
already oversees the management of Select and the other growth
stock funds in the company's Twentieth Century group of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Terry Foster, who joined the Select team in 1997,
remains to work with Stowers, Doyle said. He said they would be
able to tap analysts of the company's other growth funds, too.
</P>
<P>
   The two Select Fund analysts who resigned are Rick Petran and
John Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   The manager shake-up is the second at Select in three years.
Ledford joined American Century in January 1997 to co-manage the
fund with Chuck Duboc. Duboc left in mid-1997 and was replaced by
Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time is that four-fifths of the team
managing Select leaves together.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Di Teresa, senior analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago,
said the unexpected departures short-circuit American Century's
practice of team fund management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea (behind a team approach) is if one person leaves it
shouldn't have that big an impact,'' Di Teresa said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that American Century lost another team when Dong
Zhang and Steve Colton left in June 1997 to join Phoenix Duff &AMP;
Phelps Inc., which runs the Phoenix Funds. They had been
co-managers of the American Century Equity Growth and American
Century Income &AMP; Growth funds. Colton also managed the American
Century Utilities Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Di Teresa said the Select Fund had been performing well since
Ledford joined. It had been ``narrowly'' beating the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 Index through its investments in large-company growth
stocks. Di Teresa noted that such stocks have been highly favored
on Wall Street until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the large-company growth stock funds at Evergreen
haven't been notably successful, Di Teresa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps Evergreen is looking for some help,'' he said.

MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER MAY GET DEATH PENALTY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 22-year-old man was convicted Friday of murdering
an off-duty police officer and the owner of a Queens check cashing
business during a robbery in 1996, and could face the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the second capital punishment case to be tried in Queens
since the death penalty was restored in New York state in 1995, the
jury will decide whether to sentence the killer, George Davis Bell,
to death.
</P>
<P>
   Queens District Attorney Richard Brown called the verdict ``more
than justified.'' He said that evidence of Bell's guilt presented
during the three-week trial was ``clearly overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's Capital Defender Office, which represented Bell,
said in a statement that Bell's defense team was ``deeply
disappointed by the verdict.'' Bell's lawyers had argued his
innocence, saying that a confession from Bell had been coerced by
detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Bell shot Officer Charles Davis and Ira Epstein
to death on the morning of Dec. 21, 1996, as they opened Epstein's
business, Astoria Boulevard Check Cashing.
</P>
<P>
   They presented testimony that Bell and an accomplice ambushed
the two men, forced them inside the business at gunpoint and
announced a robbery. But before either Davis, who was moonlighting
as a security guard, or Epstein could meet the demand for money,
Bell started shooting and killed both men. Bell and his accomplice
ran from the store empty handed.
</P>
<P>
   Bell was arrested a week after the shooting when another man who
prosecutors said was a lookout during the robbery was arrested on a
minor drug charge. During questioning, the man, John Mark Bigweh,
23, of Brooklyn, led investigators to conclude that he and four
others were involved in the attempted robbery of Epstein's
business. Three of them, including Bigweh, are awaiting a separate
trial, and the other has not been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The conviction of Bell follows the conviction in December of
James Allen Gordon, the first person in Queens to face the death
penalty since the reinstatement of capital punishment. The jury
spared the life of Gordon, who was convicted of killing three women
and trying to kill two others.

JOHN CALHOUN BAKER, 103, OHIO UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mass., Pa., N.J.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Calhoun Baker, president emeritus of Ohio University, who
guided it through the burgeoning enrollment when the veterans of
World War II surged in under the GI Bill, died June 9 at a
retirement community in Hightstown, N.J., where he moved three
years ago. A former resident of Essex Fells, N.J., he was 103.
</P>
<P>
   Baker retired in 1961 after 16 years as Ohio University's 14th
president, but he remained a figure on the Athens campus, whose
student center bears his name. He paid his last visit to be feted
there on his 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   He took up the presidency in 1945 with a mandate from Gov. Frank
Lausche to make room for the returning veterans. Enrollment grew
during his presidency to more than 8,000 students from 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Necessity made him one of the first college administrators to
develop the regional campus network to avoid overcrowding at
Athens. He oversaw the addition of 32 major buildings and the
start-up of ambitious research and doctoral programs.
</P>
<P>
   One of his initial decisions stopped the demolition of Cutler
Hall, which opened in 1818 and was the oldest academic building in
the Northwest Territory. It was restored and became the seat of
Ohio University's central administration.
</P>
<P>
   University president Robert Glidden said Baker ``was, in a
sense, the founder of modern Ohio University,'' from whose
initiatives grew the system of five regional campuses and the
University Foundation. Established in 1945 to finance research,
scholarships and grants, the foundation has raised more than $300
million since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Everett, Pa., Baker graduated from Juniata College in
1917 and earned a master's degree in business administration at
Harvard University in 1923. He was the author of several books and
many articles on business administration and, after his retirement
from Ohio University, served as a corporate director of several
companies.
</P>
<P>
   He started his career at the Harvard Business School as a
researcher, instructor, assistant dean and professor of business
administration. From 1939 to 1945 he served as associate dean of
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife endowed the Baker Peace Studies Program at Ohio
University in 1982. It was designed to promote peace studies as an
academic subject with lectures, conferences, exhibits and courses.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's wife, Elizabeth Evans Baker, died in 1990 after 57 years
of marriage. He is survived by three daughters, Elizabeth C. Baker,
Eleanor B. Steindler and Anne C. Baker, all of Manhattan, and two
grandchildren. &QL;

NYC CHARGES SEVERAL DOZEN IN A SCHEME ON BENEFITS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A police detective, four schoolteachers and a New
York City Transit employee were among dozens of government
employees and others charged Friday with cheating the city out of
more than $1.4 million dollars in unjustified housing subsidies or
welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth wave of charges in a continuing inquiry by the
Department of Investigation and the Manhattan district attorney's
office to root out people collecting undeserved benefits by lying
about their income or employment status.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation involves matching the names of more than
900,000 tenants of the New York City Housing Authority against the
city's payroll of 200,000 names and the welfare rolls of at least
1.6 million names, said Kevin Ryan, a spokesman for the Department
of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the investigation included people on the
city payroll earning more than $50,000, and 6 of the 59 people
charged were paid at least that much, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said those charged included Emily Hargrove, 40, a police
detective who has been on the force since 1981, has earned more
than $60,000 per year, and has received more than $24,000 in rent
subsidies for a Manhattan apartment. Hargrove has an unlisted
telephone number and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said that some of those charged who were not government
employees had forged the signatures of dead tenants to enable the
rent subsidies to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Those charged Friday were accused of receiving nearly $1.24
million in unmerited rent subsidies by lying about their assets. In
addition, 14 of them used similar deceit to obtain more than
$185,000 in welfare benefits, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges, from filing false documents to grand larceny, could
lead to prison terms as long as 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The accused are scheduled to surrender during the week beginning
June 21. The spokesman said the 28 public employees involved in the
fraud had been suspended and would probably be fired, and that they
would also be expelled from their publicly subsidized housing if
convicted on the criminal charges. He said a few had already moved
upstate or to New Jersey, but would be pursued for back rent.
</P>
<P>
   Government employees, including police officers, are not barred
from living in public housing in the city. ``They can live in the
city, they can live in the projects, but they just have to let us
know that they work for the Police Department,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   But they must meet the same criteria as anyone else for
subsidized housing, which includes both large projects and
apartments in smaller, privately owned buildings. Ryan said the
approximate income qualifications were less than $20,000 for one
person, less than $46,000 for a family of five, and about $70,000
for 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   The investigative method of matching computerized lists of
tenants, public employees and welfare rolls, first used in 1995,
has resulted in charges against at least 140 people, with 57
convicted and more than $600,000 in illegal payments restored, the
spokesman said.

   In the annals of U.S. presidents and the Balkans, an arc can be
traced from Bill Clinton back to Woodrow Wilson. At the Versailles
peace conference following World War I, Wilson arrived after
reviewing European history and then helped establish a new southern
Slavic state to fill the vacuum created by the collapse of the
Ottoman and Austrian empires. There is a famous moment in which
Wilson, the idealist, squatted on the floor with his experts over a
gigantic map of places he had never been. His wife walked in and
commented that they looked like boys playing a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alas,'' replied the president, looking up, ``it is the most
serious game ever undertaken.''
</P>
<P>
   A new round in the game has now started with the end of the war
in Yugoslavia and the troubling entry of Russian troops into
Kosovo. Liberated from Serbian administration but not yet a nation,
Kosovo is to be attached to but ``walled off'' from Yugoslavia.
Unhappily, the long-term stability of Kosovo's status may well
depend on Albanians and Serbs being ``walled off'' from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the crisis in Kosovo, there has been a
debate among intellectuals, historians and policy makers over
whether the violence has resulted from ancient ethnic hatreds or
modern manipulations by ruthless politicians. Clinton recently made
an extraordinary apology for once believing that the Balkans were a
place of ``centuries-old animosity'' impervious to change.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``after a great deal of time in these last six years
reading the real history of the Balkans,'' he said that he
regretted ``more than I can say'' having once felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   The president's current view is that although ethnic tensions
have long plagued the region, the murderous warfare in Kosovo has
been fomented by Slobodan Milosevic's demagoguery and opportunism.
Thursday night he again appealed indirectly to the Serbs to
overthrow their leaders, who he said ``could have kept Kosovo as a
part of your country without driving a single Kosovar family from
its home.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of ethnic hatred in the Balkans is relevant to the
kind of nation-building on which NATO and the United States have
embarked. At Versailles, Wilson and the European allies supported
the creation of a Slavic state encompassing various ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Today's wars involve Serbs, Croats and Muslims, all trying to
redress longstanding grievances. The vision of Clinton that people
of differing ethnic groups can live with each other is appealing to
Americans, but it might be a case of imposing an unworkable image
on an unwilling populace.
</P>
<P>
   While no one doubts Milosevic's ruthlessness, for instance, the
notion that Balkan hatred will subside without his manipulations is
hard to accept. Reports of longtime neighbors raping, murdering and
expelling their neighbors suggest that old hatreds lie so close to
the surface that it may not take much to bring them into the open.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years of Balkan turmoil, people who have felt
that the hatreds will never go away tend to oppose intervention.
Bismarck's famous comment in the 19th century that the Balkans were
``not worth the healthy bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier'' is
echoed by the statement attributed to Secretary of State James
Baker in the early 1990s that ``we don't have a dog in this
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no consensus on the issue of ethnic hatreds in the
dozens of books and articles published in the last few years, and
Clinton is not the only one to have changed his mind. Books by
journalists traveling among the people tend to emphasize the
deep-seated nature of the hatreds, while books focusing on politics
and history tend to emphasize the responsibility of leaders.
</P>
<P>
   As David Remnick pointed out in The New Yorker this week,
Clinton was influenced first by ``Balkan Ghosts,'' by Robert
Kaplan, published in 1993, a powerfully written work of reportage
that pays homage to Rebecca West's ``Black Lamb and Grey Falcon,''
published in 1941 and hailed by Kaplan as ``this century's greatest
travel book.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his diplomatic memoir, ``To End a War,'' Richard
Holbrooke criticizes both Kaplan and Ms. West for implying that
``nothing could be done by outsiders in a region so steeped in
ancient hatreds.'' He even laments the influence of the Kaplan book
on Clinton and others.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the president's favorite Balkan expert is said to be
the British journalist and scholar Noel Malcolm, who in ``Kosovo: A
Short History'' asserts that all the talk about ``ancient ethnic
hatreds'' is ``grossly misleading'' because of the history of
harmony among Muslims, Catholics and Orthodox Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome in Kosovo will be another chapter in the ongoing
conflict between two appealing ideas: self-determination and the
principle that ethnic groups can live together peacefully.
Self-determination has allowed the number of members of the United
Nations to grow from 156 to 185 in the last 10 years. The risk of
applying the principle of self-determination too broadly is that
the number may grow by scores or even hundreds in the years ahead.

SPORTS COLUMN: IF HIS OLD FRIEND RED   COULD SEE THEM NOW
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 50 years around the game, Fuzzy Levane
said, and he has never seen anything like this. He's never seen a
basketball team remake itself in a New York minute, and then keep
winning the way these Knicks have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking, `Is this a mirage, or what?''' Levane said.
</P>
<P>
   No mirage, not this time. In the span of six wacky weeks, the
Knicks have gone from out of the playoffs to the NBA finals. From
eighth to first in the Eastern Conference. From a dysfunctional
team of 12 to an inspirational armada of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Even a pair of discerning, 79-year-old, New York-trained eyes
could not see this coming. No one could, least of all the Indiana
Pacers, who went down for the count, 90-82, Friday night at Madison
Square Garden, even after the Knicks lost their on-court leader,
Larry Johnson, to an injured right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said Andrew ``Fuzzy'' Levane. ``What can
happen next?''
</P>
<P>
   The old scout _ who played at James Madison High School in
Brooklyn and then at St. John's and whose life is practically a
storybook on the subject of the city game _ only wishes that his
soul mate in sports, Red Holzman, had lived long enough to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the highs of a wild playoff ride have come the
saddest of moments when Levane, who has found himself looking over
to the area opposite the visitors' bench, where Red and Selma
Holzman used to sit, where the Hall of Fame coach would shoot him a
look, as if to say, ``Can you believe this?''
</P>
<P>
   Months have passed since Holzman's death and yet there are
particular plays, a Latrell Sprewell-led break, a Marcus Camby
block, when Levane experiences the familiar urge for eye contact,
when he can't believe that Holzman is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing I can't get out of my mind,'' he said.
``Every day, I've been feeling it, thinking, `What a shame.' I find
myself dialing his number and saying, `What the hell am I doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   They were basketball brothers, Levane and Holzman, who was
brought into the Knicks' organization as a scout in 1958, when
Levane was coach. Holzman nearly wound up grieving eight years ago,
Levane having suffered a ruptured aortic aneurysm on the drive home
after being inducted into the New York Basketball Hall of Fame.
Levane hung on, went back to scouring the basketball bush leagues,
looking for another Anthony Mason, another John Starks.
</P>
<P>
   At Holzman's funeral last November, Levane and some of the other
lifers like Dick McGuire wondered if the lockout had made it easier
for a man heartbroken by the recent loss of his wife to surrender
to leukemia. The thinking went that Holzman needed the Knicks for
therapy, but, as it turned out, maybe the Knicks needed their
patriarch more.
</P>
<P>
   With all the duplicity that resulted in Dave Checketts'
foot-stomping deposing of Ernie Grunfeld, Levane surmised that only
Holzman might have been able to prevent it. He was the unifying
front-office thread, the Knicks' moral compass. Grunfeld, Checketts
and Jeff Van Gundy worshiped his record, loved the man. This season
of paradoxical news breaks began, really, at a funeral chapel in
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   It is much too painful to dwell on what might have been, but
Levane has trouble stopping himself. He doesn't feel much like the
warm, Fuzzy character who would come bursting into a room with a
joke, a story, his hands conducting a symphony. He has been to too
many wakes and funerals lately. Selma Holzman's. Red's. His sister
Marie's. His old friend and St. John's teammate, Red Tough.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor tells him he is suffering from traumatic stress,
feeling the anxiety of getting old.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks,'' he said, ``are helping me.''
</P>
<P>
   The short season has turned into a story as long as Camby, the
Knicks' new star on the block, and it has all been medicine for the
mind. On the compelling subject of Camby, Levane went so far as to
draw comparisons with Russell, and he didn't mean Cazzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camby blocks the shot and keeps it in play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the controversy, the obstacles, the injuries, the
Pacers still couldn't win. What Larry Bird suspected after Game 5
was right. His team had every opportunity, but didn't have the
heart. The Knicks simply out-fought them in the fourth quarter,
with half-court defense that would have made Holzman proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know our half-court defense is excellent, `` Levane said,
``and I don't know if the guys out West have seen a lot of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense being what Holzman preached, Levane said that would be
the best of all tributes, figuring out a way to shut down Tim
Duncan and David Robinson, to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing about these Knicks is that the further they go,
the higher the odds seem to get. You just never know, though, and
it doesn't pay to dwell too long on why. ``Just appreciate what you
have,'' Fuzzy Levane said. He will take his own advice for the next
couple of weeks. With so much else gone, he is thanking his stars
that there are still games, championship games now, left to be
played.

HACKER U: COMPANY OFFERS TRAINING AGAINST COMPUTER INVADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ These aren't your father's accountants.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a button-down shirt among these Ernst &AMP; Young
staffers. Not one of them is toting a calculator or adding machine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, these employees of the Big Five accounting firm get a
little testy if you even ask whether they have an accounting
background.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Ernst &AMP; Young nerd squad. They aren't financial
accountants looking for weaknesses in their clients'
accounts-payable procedures. They're computer analysts looking for
holes in their clients' computer security systems and ways to hack
into their payroll.
</P>
<P>
   It's big business.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young has 30 employees in its Global Securities
Solutions Center in Kansas City, new headquarters for a national
and international computer security operation that has 700
employees worldwide. The operation expects to grow both here and
worldwide and take in about $60 million in 1999 _ up from $12
million three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as being the wave of the future,'' said Lisa
Schlosser, operations leader of eSecurity Solutions for Ernst &AMP;
Young.
</P>
<P>
   The program addresses computer security issues on several fronts
_ training information technology employees for clients; examining
corporate computer systems for potential holes; and moving in a
``quick response team'' if a hacker breaks into a client's computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   Even large corporations with well-protected computer systems are
ripe for a digital break-in, said Eric Schultze, a member of the
quick-response team and anti-hacking trainer for Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, Ernst &AMP; Young sends in its quick-response
unit _ a team of three or more hacking experts, including some with
law enforcement experience. The team has been called out three
times in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any large corporation you can almost guarantee they've
had a security breach somewhere,'' said George Kurtz, another
member of the Ernst &AMP; Young team.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the chance of such attacks, Ernst &AMP; Young has set up a
training program for its employees and for clients.
</P>
<P>
   This week, 30 Ernst &AMP; Young employees from around the country
and from Canada, Great Britain and Denmark attended the computer
hacking boot camp at the Kansas City center.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong program, called ``eXtreme hacking _ Defending your
site,'' is a $4,000 training course teaching ``the greatest hacks
out there today,'' Schultze said. And, of course, those who take
the class are taught how to protect security systems from those
computer break-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the class learn things like ``account cracking,''
``exploiting reciprocal trust,'' ``hijacking the GUI,'' and various
ways to break into a computer system and find user passwords. On
Thursday, Ernst &AMP; Young trainers showed fellow employees how a
hacker could hijack a client's computer _ even rebooting it
remotely _ using a Palm Pilot personal organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst &AMP; Young has held about 10 classes around the country in
the last year, mostly for the company's own employees. Similar
classes now are planned at the Kansas City center about once a
month, and the program is being opened to clients.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors arrive packing a storeroom's worth of boxes with
notebook computers, routers, networking equipment, servers and
other computer gear. The classroom is set up to simulate various
types of corporate computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said the classes grew out of a computer break-in at a
big software company. ``We showed the company stuff that amazed
them,'' he said. ``They said, `You guys can do that? Can you teach
us?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's grown into a security practice that includes 23
laboratories across the country, all connected to a lab in Kansas
City. The Kansas City lab includes every computer environment the
company can think of, so that the latest hacking _ or anti-hacking
_ tools can be tested before being deployed to other offices,
Schlosser said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial two-day course has become a weeklong anti-hacking
event with a combination of classroom lectures and hands-on
simulations that end with a hacker's version of a capture-the-flag
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Not just anyone with $4,000 will be able to take the class.
``Obviously, we do some screening,'' Schultze said. The class is
for ``white hat'' hackers _ those who hack to find vulnerabilities
in systems, not their ``black hat'' counterparts who hack to do
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Ernst &AMP; Young computer security team uses both easily
accessible hacking software tools and special programs developed by
the company.
</P>
<P>
   The team showed students how to hack into a corporate computer
using a Palm Pilot and a program called PALM VNC. Using the Palm
Pilot's small screen, a hacker could see the hacked computer's
desktop, and even when the cursor moved on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty cool hack,'' said Royce Willis, from Ernst &AMP;
Young's Chicago office.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz showed the group another hijacking software program,
called NetBus, that takes hacking a step further. Once a hacker
breaks into a computer and installs NetBus, the program lets the
hacker play sounds on the hacked computer, open the computer's
CD-ROM drive or turn on a microphone attached to the computer to
listen to what's being said in the room, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schultze said VNC, NetBus and dozens of similar programs were
created as administrative tools for computer systems
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any legitimate tool can be used for illegitimate purposes,''
Schultze said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Morgan, who traveled from Ernst &AMP; Young's office in Vienna,
Va., to take the class, said: ``Keeping up with this stuff is a
full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, something new is released into the wild. Hackers
are always one step ahead of us.''

<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ NATO troops entered Kosovo on Saturday as
dawn was breaking, hours after NATO was confounded by Russia's
surprise entry into Pristina, the capital, which the allied forces
plan to make their headquarters for returning a million local
Albanians to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   British paratroopers lifted off on schedule to secure strategic
hills overlooking the highway to Pristina, only 60 miles away
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO's main advance elements, led by a British armored
force, passed the border post here starting at 5:20 a.m. Brig.
Adrian Freer met with the Yugoslavs to discuss last-minute details,
then led his convoy, numbering about 2,000 troops, in toward
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   One paratrooper, Greg Lovell, passed by a refugee camp and said
``the elation on people's faces was just unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinook helicopters took off carrying troops swept across the
hilly landscape and up a river, sending off flares to deflect
missiles. Other members of the contingent here are from France,
Italy and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian troops' arrival in Pristina only hours before
had thrown the operation into doubt. The Russians, joyously greeted
by the remaining Serbs in Pristina, came from Bosnia, where they
were part of the U.N. peacekeeping contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Some armored vehicles had the Bosnia peacekeepers' insignia,
SFOR, hastily painted over by one letter to read KFOR, the initials
of the new Kosovo deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was a jittery day, with allied paratroopers and others at
first standing on alert to enter Kosovo to block the Russians, but
then backing off as senior Russian officials gave their word that
their troops would not move into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With that assurance, NATO tanks began rumbling through Macedonia
in the dark, and long columns of armored personnel carriers,
ambulances and other military vehicles snaked through the streets
to assembly points.
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for an advance party of British paratroopers in
helicopters to take the high ground on the hills overlooking the
main road to Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Then an advance element led by British troops of the 4th Armored
Corps, including the Irish Guards and a unit of Gurkha infantrymen,
were to lead the main convoy for Pristina. They were to be followed
by the other European and American units, who are to spread across
specific zones in Kosovo as the Yugoslavs withdraw according to an
11-day timetable.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night the border crossing at Blace, where hundreds of
thousands of refugees had been dumped from trains from Kosovo, was
quiet, and a refugee transit camp down the hill was all but shut
down.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hundred yards back, the allies' olive-drab military
vehicles assembled in the parking lot and cleared spaces around the
Europa '93 Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The French set up a communications post in a truck with towering
antennas. A tent was erected for the forward headquarters of the
British paratroopers and for an Italian unit with jaunty feather
cockades on their helmets.
</P>
<P>
   A little farther back, thousands of refugees from the Stankovic
I camp spilled out in long lines on the side of the road, kept more
or less in order by self-appointed monitors, to cheer the passing
NATO military vehicles and anyone that appeared even vaguely
associated with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``NA-TO, NA-TO,'' the crowds chanted, quickly following up with
chants for the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of the blue and white cars of the Macedonian
police, many of whom have abused the refugees, was greeted by
high-pitched hoots and jeers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have waited for this day,'' said Bekim Mustapha, 20, a
sentiment echoed by others in the crush around him.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Friday, allied forces were on the move in
northern Macedonia, heading to forward staging areas near the
mountainous border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A column of British and Italian military vehicles poured from
the military base near the airport at Petrovec in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Column after column of tanks rumbled along the main road here in
Macedonia's capital, 12 miles from the border crossing at Blace,
mixing with buses and cars during the evening's rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops planned to enter Kosovo from three directions, two
from Macedonia and another from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   British, Italian and German troops were to move north on the
main road between Skopje and Pristina, led by the British
paratroopers from from the 5th Airborne Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   French forces were to move from the city of Kumanovo, entering
Kosovo from the east, a route that would take them through Serbia
proper.
</P>
<P>
   A force led by German troops was to enter from Albania, crossing
the border on the road between Kukes and Prizren, an area of
intense fighting between Serbian forces and the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Just Friday, the German Parliament approved the deployment of
8,500 troops, the country's largest deployment since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans _ led by troops from the 82nd Airborne and, later,
the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, who continued to arrive at
bases outside Petrovec _ were not expected to play a major role in
the initial phases of the deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The intervention of NATO troops in Kosovo comes two days after
Yugoslav generals agreed to the alliance's conditions to withdraw
their forces from the province.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials said that the withdrawal had begun,
based on evidence from drone planes, some of them operating out of
Petrovec.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yugoslavs pull out, NATO forces will follow close behind.
</P>
<P>
   The operation faces myriad uncertainties, now most especially
the ultimate role of the Russian troops. There are also the rebels,
land mines and the thousands of Albanian refugees who never left
Kosovo but have been living for the most part in dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   NATO forces will ultimately total 45,000, plus several thousand
others from non-NATO nations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the U.S. Army's forces are from the 82nd Airborne, but
they have been supplemented by heavy armored units, including M1-A1
Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles and Howitzers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not real sure what we're going to see,'' said Sgt. Maj.
Gary Kalinofski, the 82nd's senior noncommissioned officer. ``But
if you put the pieces in place, everything else will fall into
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. James Kettner, a combat engineer, said his unit expected to
encounter mines, debris and other dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really expecting the worst,'' he said.

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman has reportedly offered the
job of New Jersey State Police superintendent to an Illinois law
enforcement commander, state officials said Friday. If he accepts
the position, he will become the first black to hold the top office
in the department, which has been tarnished by complaints of racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Andre Parker of the Illinois State Police, who has been
credited with leading the turnaround of the troubled East St. Louis
Police Department, has not yet said whether he will accept the
position of superintendent. But a Whitman administration official
and a state police commander, both speaking on the condition of
anonymity, confirmed that Parker had been offered the position,
which pays $90,563 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman and Attorney General John Farmer Jr. declined to discuss
the matter. But the Rev. Reginald Jackson, a civil rights leader
who has led a surge of protests since two state troopers shot three
unarmed black and Hispanic men during a traffic stop in April 1998,
said he was encouraged by reports that the governor had apparently
resisted pressure to promote a candidate from within the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news,'' Jackson said. ``I just hope it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than three months, the governor and her staff have been
searching for a new commander. This spring, the Whitman
administration acknowledged for the first time that troopers
routinely engaged in racial profiling, and outlined a series of
reforms that the incoming superintendent would be expected to
enact. The governor forced the previous superintendent, Col. Carl
Williams, to resign after he said in an interview that minorities
were chiefly to blame for New Jersey's drug problem.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department is investigating allegations that
white troopers targeted black and Hispanic motorists for stops
along New Jersey's highways. The Justice Department is also looking
into allegations that the department discriminated against minority
and female troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, 43, was considered a good candidate because of his
experience in East St. Louis, where he spent two years. In 1993,
Jim Edgar, the Illinois governor then, appointed Parker to the
position of director of public safety, after the state stepped in
to monitor the department, state officials said. Although city
officials and police commanders initially resisted the presence of
an outsider, Parker quickly solved labor problems, updated the
procedure manual and reorganized the department, bringing a speedy
drop in crime.
</P>
<P>
   Parker did not not return repeated phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   If Parker, a 20-year veteran of the Illinois State Police,
becomes the first black to head the 2,700-member New Jersey State
Police force, he is also likely to face resistance from some
officers and commanders in the predominantly white department. In a
succession of lawsuits and numerous public statements this year,
black and Hispanic troopers have described the force as a racially
polarized agency where discrimination is tolerated and where
promotions and choice assignments are disproportionately awarded to
whites. Williams has denied any such bias.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of supervisors also have been lobbying for the
promotion of an insider, and in recent weeks, several state
legislators have publicly urged Whitman to choose someone from
within the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   But civil rights activists have also been adamant in demanding
that the governor nominate an outsider.

TWO IN TEXAS ARE SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY IN BIN LADEN CASE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two Muslim men from Texas have been subpoenaed to
testify next week before a federal grand jury in Manhattan
investigating Osama bin Laden, who is a suspect in the U.S. embassy
bombings in Africa last year and other terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for each of the men have sharply criticized the
subpoenas, saying that the government is casting its net too
broadly over Muslims and engaging in guilt by association.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are friends of Wadih el-Hage of Arlington, Texas, who
was arrested last year on charges that he had conspired with bin
Laden in terrorist attacks on Americans abroad. el-Hage has been
described in an indictment as a former personal secretary to bin
Laden. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Texas men who received a subpoena is Moataz
Al-Hallak, the imam at the Islamic Society of Arlington, where
el-Hage was an active member. A federal prosecutor said in court
last spring that Al-Hallak ``has served as a contact between
members of the bin Laden organization,'' prompting an angry letter
from his lawyer to prosecutors, asking that they stop slandering
Al-Hallak by unfairly linking him to the suspected terrorist.
Al-Hallak has never been charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Stanley Cohen, said Friday that a prosecutor in the
office of Mary Jo White, the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, told him
that Al-Hallak was being asked to appear as a ``subject'' of the
investigation, which is one step lower than a ``target.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen criticized Ms. White's office Friday, saying that her
definition of subject is too broad. ``Anyone who can read a
newspaper article and recognize the name Osama bin Laden becomes a
subject'' of the investigation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Hadad, a spokesman for Ms. White, said there would be no
comment about the case or any of the criticisms by the defense
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he expected his client would be asked about his
relationship with el-Hage, and whether he knows bin Laden, whom he
does not. ``My client does not believe in violence, no matter what
the source,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He said Al-Hallak has not yet decided what he will do when he
appears before the grand jury, and whether he will answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The other witness who has received a subpoena was identified by
his lawyer as Khader Ibrahim. The lawyer described Ibrahim as a
friend of el-Hage who may once have hired him to work in one of his
tire shops in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Lynne Stewart, said she has been told that Ibrahim
was subpoenaed as a subject of the investigation. She said her
client had been interviewed repeatedly in Texas by agents of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, who visited him again last week
with a videotape of the aftermath of the embassy bombings. After he
watched it at their request, ``they said, `Will you speak with us
now?' He said, `No, I don't want to really speak with you any
further,' '' Ms. Stewart said. She said he was given the grand jury
subpoena the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is another round of Muslim-bashing,'' Ms. Stewart
said. Ibrahim has not been charged in the case, and she said he has
not been involved in any wrongdoing.

HERMOSILLO TO DEBUT WITH GALAXY TONIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Carlos Hermosillo seemed a little tired during a
recent training session at USC, but he insists he's ready to make
his season debut when the Los Angeles Galaxy plays host to Chicago
tonight at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need to check my blood, I'll show you later,'' he
joked. ``I feel very good. I took the time I needed to rest and now
I'm very anxious to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   But a word of caution to the popular Mexican striker: a world of
expectations await.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo just joined the team Wednesday _ two weeks after the
Mexican winter season _ and already he's addressing questions
regarding the Galaxy's lack of scoring and sagging attendance
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' he admitted. ``It's not only a challenge for me
but for all of us. As for the fans, they're very demanding. They
want to see goals and I don't blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos tried taking some of the pressure
off Hermosillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person like him comes in (late), people start thinking
of him as the savior, especially because of the situation we're in
now,'' Cienfuegos said. ``He's had his rest and he's barely getting
back into the rhythm ... so our troubles shouldn't fall on his
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo is asked to make immediate contributions to a Galaxy
team hampered by an MLS-low eight goals in 12 games in posting a
less-than-impressive 6-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Galaxy management hopes Hermosillo can lure back
the Hispanic audience. Los Angeles had a walk-up crowd of 18,000
for his debut last season, when a total of 33,383 turned out.
Averaging only 13,105 this season, the Galaxy is hoping for
something in the range of 20,000 for tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming into a good situation,'' Galaxy general manager
Sergio Del Prado said. ``We're obviously having trouble scoring and
he's one of the best scorers Mexico has ever had. He has a high
deal of credibility (with Latin fans) and has always been a good
spokesperson for soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo can ill-afford a start similar to last season's. He
didn't score until his 12th game _ but Los Angeles was winning and
scoring at the time, so few noticed his personal struggles.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old post-up striker admits there have been several
changes in his time away.
</P>
<P>
   Out are former coach Octavio Zambrano and midfielder Martin
Machon. In are former UCLA coach Sigi Schmid and recently acquired
midfielders Simon Elliott, Roy Myers and former UCLA striker Seth
George, who signed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different team than the one I was on last
year,'' Hermosillo said. ``To tell you the truth, it looks better
balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   With Cobi Jones and Robin Fraser out tonight (playing for the
U.S. national team in Sunday's friendly against Argentina),
Hermosillo will start alongside fellow striker Clint Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid welcomes a 6-foot-1 striker hovering around the
opponent's goal area.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us somebody we can play to in the box and somebody
who should be able to get on the end of crosses,'' Schmid said. ``I
think it's important we keep him as high as possible because he's
so dangerous (posting there).''

U.S. CRITICIZES BRONX HOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal health care regulators say they have found
serious problems with the way Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx runs
its emergency room, which is the city's busiest. Their criticisms
include poor assessment of the urgency of cases, waits of several
hours before patients see doctors and shoddy records on what
happens to many patients.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Health Care Financing administration, prepared
after a surprise visit to the hospital in March, cited one instance
in which a 56-year-old man with a history of high blood pressure
came into the emergency room complaining of chest pressure and a
nurse determined that he needed immediate treatment. Yet federal
investigators found ``no evidence that the patient was seen by a
physician until one hour after triage.''
</P>
<P>
   Another man, who had a history of drug abuse and mental illness,
complained of being suicidal and homicidal, the report said, but
was ``not seen by a physician until two hours after arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   The regulators' findings, first reported Friday in The New York
Post, included several similar examples, and suggested that the
sprawling public hospital had failed to resolve many problems that
had been found during three inspections last year.
</P>
<P>
   The findings also echoed concerns of many former physicians at
Lincoln since another Bronx hospital, St. Barnabas, began a
three-year contract last summer to provide medical services there.
Those former doctors, who were dismissed after St. Barnabas took
over, said that overly aggressive cost-cutting had hurt patient
care at the hospital, including the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Luis Marcos, president of the city's Health and Hospitals
Corp., vigorously disputed the conclusions of the report Friday,
saying that the hospital's problems were mostly cases of bad
record-keeping, not bad care.
</P>
<P>
   In many instances when federal officials said they found no
evidence that patients had been seen in a timely fashion, he said,
it was simply because records were incomplete. In other instances,
city officials said, the federal report left out important facts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the report cited an incident in which a 38-year-old
man died after he went to the emergency room in September asking
for insulin. He was found unconscious in a waiting area five hours
later. The report criticized the hospital for not classifying the
man as in urgent need of care.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials said Friday that his death was not a result
of lack of care, but of the patient's use of an illegal drug.
</P>
<P>
   After the man was examined by a nurse, an internal hospital memo
said, he went to a secluded area near a men's restroom and smoked
crack. He was found in cardiac arrest and died several days later,
the memo said. The city's Medical Examiner found that the chief
cause of death was acute cocaine intoxication, the hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital also said it had improved its patient security and
monitoring since the death.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos said that federal regulators had unfairly singled out
city hospitals for criticism. He said that when a nurse sees
patients and determines that they are not in urgent need of care,
waits of several hours to see doctors are sometimes unavoidable at
Lincoln, where the emergency room can be inundated by up to 400
patient visits a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some issue with waiting, but frankly, most emergency
rooms have waiting times,'' he said. ``I'm very, very comfortable
with the quality of care we deliver at Lincoln.'' &QL;

COOKSON LIVING LIFE-LONG DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Brent Cookson thought about the opportunity to live a
dream when he signed a minor-league, free-agent contract with the
Los Angeles Dodgers in January.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else thought anything of it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Dodgers' search for a healthy fourth outfielder, they
couldn't overlook the triple-crown numbers Cookson was putting up
in Triple-A Albuquerque. So in dire need of outfield depth, the
Dodgers promoted Cookson, a former Santa Paula High and Ventura
College star, before Friday's game with the Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Cookson's contract was purchased from Albuquerque. To make room
for him, the Dodgers designated infielder Chance Sanford, who
joined the Dodgers last Friday, for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Dodgers fan since I was 5 years old,'' said
Cookson, who also played at Long Beach State. ``I've been in
professional ball since 1991, but I've always dreamed of playing
for the Dodgers. It's always been my ultimate goal. The opportunity
(to sign) came about and I jumped at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cookson was in the midst of hitting .333 with 18
homers and 48 RBI, he wouldn't have received the call if the
Dodgers' outfield corps hadn't been depleted.
</P>
<P>
   The team spent the last two games with three healthy outfielders
and with fingers crossed that a fourth wasn't needed.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he would probably use the
right-handed Cookson as a designated hitter today against Oakland
left-hander Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Cookson was necessary because center fielder
Devon White (groin strain) won't be ready for outfield duty until
Sunday at the earliest, Johnson said. White was originally in
Friday's lineup, but Johnson scratched him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a fourth outfielder,'' Johnson said. ``This cold
weather, (White) was going to go, but I said no. I could go with
(Trenidad) Hubbard against the left-hander (today) and I have
another right-hander (Cookson) to go to. If I play (White), I'd
like to have another off day for him (afterward) and see how he
feels.''
</P>
<P>
   If Cookson, 29, starts, it won't be the first time in his
major-league career. He played 22 games for Kansas City in 1995. He
hit .143 with one double and five RBI before bouncing through the
minor leagues of Boston, Baltimore and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought me up for a reason, and that's to take care of
business,'' Cookson said. ``I was down there working my butt off so
I could get this call and get out of Triple-A as soon as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   DH difference: The trip to Oakland was the first interleague
game in which the Dodgers used the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a veteran manager who managed for two seasons with
Baltimore, said: ``The (designated hitter) in the AL is in the
middle of the lineup,'' Johnson said. ``We don't really know what
to do with the DH. We have pinch-hitters, and you really don't want
to redo your whole lineup for just one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen was the Dodgers' DH and batted eighth. John Jaha was
Oakland's DH and he batted cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's preference: Being back in an American League park and
playing by AL rules didn't exactly make Johnson giddy.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his feelings in playing by AL rules, he planted
his tongue into his cheek and said, ``Enthralled, baby.
Enthralled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I takes away a lot of the strategy,'' Johnson added. ``When to
take the pitcher out, when to use a pinch-hitter. There's not as
much.''

 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was the final buzzer and the signal to rejoice
over the impossible. The once-fractured and disjointed New York
Knicks _ a team that treated adversity and misfortune like
emotional allies right though Friday night's game _ grabbed onto
each other and danced on the court like kids bouncing on box
springs.
</P>
<P>
   They were on air after winning Game 6 of their Eastern
Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers, 90-82, Friday night
to win the series, 4-2 , and advance to the NBA finals against the
San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   They accomplished what seemed unthinkable for a team that was
mired in turmoil and on the verge of missing the playoffs in late
April. And what seemed improbable for a team that lost its
superstar, Patrick Ewing, to injury last week. And what appeared
bleak when the Game 3 hero, Larry Johnson, left Friday night's game
with a sprained knee midway through the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But as Madison Square Garden witnessed Friday night, nothing is
impossible for the Knicks on a journey that has been abetted by
good karma and inspired by the play of Marcus Camby. On this night,
his partner in producing another kind of miracle _ a victory
without Johnson _ was Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Camby scored 15 points and had eight rebounds, while Houston
added 32 points. As time slipped off the clock, coach Jeff Van
Gundy embraced Houston. He then put a fist in the air toward Camby.
Undaunted by the magnitude of the game, a very loose Camby was
omnipresent as he grabbed rebounds, flew in for tip-ins, blocked
shots and altered the trajectory of jumpers taken by Rik Smits and
Reggie Miller.
</P>
<P>
   He slipped in and around the Pacers, weaving to be everywhere at
once. His defensive presence was only topped by the offense Houston
came up with to counter whatever the Pacers could generate on a
night when Miller could not muster a big shot. Miller shot 3 for 18
with just eight points.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, the team picked to win it all before the season
began, walked off crestfallen with coach Larry Bird. The Knicks
were the team carrying itself with the confidence of a champion.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear the Knicks were not going to let their chance to
reach the NBA finals for the first time since 1994 go. Houston was
not going to let it happen. He drove the basket and came up with a
3-point play with 3 minutes 53 seconds left to give the Knicks a
76-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Pacers threatened to tighten the pressure, either
Houston or Camby came right back with a huge play. On a missed
layup by Chris Childs, Camby sliced through the air from nowhere
for a put-back that sent the crowd into a frenzy with 2:50 left and
the Knicks ahead, 80-76.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks held their edge from there as chants of ``Jeff Van
Gundy'' rang through the building in the final seconds as another
show of support for a coach who has not had job security since the
early weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   There was silence in what had been a raucous Garden when Travis
Best rolled into Johnson's right knee as he came down from a finger
roll with 6:03 left in the first half. Curled up on the baseline,
Johnson was writhing in pain for several minutes while Van Gundy
and the team physician, Norman Scott, hovered over him.
</P>
<P>
   Without putting pressure on his right leg, Johnson grimaced as
he was helped to the locker room by Chris Dudley and Herb Williams.
And a sick feeling sank into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   What now? The Knicks had already lost Ewing to a torn Achilles'
tendon after Game 2. Their remaining low-post presence _ and their
four-point miracle worker from Game 3 _ was on the way to Beth
Israel North Division for a magnetic resonance imaging test after
spraining the ligaments in his right knee. It was the same knee he
sprained March 30 against the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the uneasiness of Johnson's injury, there was still a
very lively Camby. And as long as he was still creating the kind of
havoc he did in the first half, and as long as Miller was missing
for the Pacers, there was still a chance for the Knicks. Instead of
folding in Johnson's absence, they went on a 13-9 run to end the
first half with a 41-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That adrenaline rush vanished at the start of the third quarter
as the Pacers scored 11 straight points to take a five-point lead.
But that roll came to a halt once Camby re-entered the game and
started to fluster the Pacers all over again. Just his presence on
the floor seemed to rattle them.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had no answer for Camby, who took a missed layup by
Latrell Sprewell and put it back in to tie the score at 51-51 with
4:20 left in the third. Houston was also on fire, taking it upon
himself to score around the struggling Miller and fill the
offensive void left by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, some way, the Knicks were doing what they have done the
entire series. They were hanging close. In Games 1, 3 and 5, they
kept within striking range and ended up winning as the Pacers fell
apart in the final two minutes. They were doing better than that
against a tentative opponent that could not seize the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   With Houston scoring nine points and Camby coming up with plays
on defense, the Knicks were tied with the Pacers after the third,
59-59.
</P>
<P>
   It took a quarter, but the early jitters that seemed to grip the
Knicks at the beginning of the night disappeared in a hurry. There
was so much riding on this game for the Knicks _ vindication for
Sprewell and Camby and for a team many doubted, a $3.5 million
contract extension for Van Gundy as a reward, and the need to close
out the Pacers without having to travel back to Indiana _ it was
almost understandable for the players to be tight at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   As off as Miller was, so was Sprewell, who shot 3 for 12 in the
first half. But after Sprewell botched plays and even lost a ball
off his foot on a fast break, after Houston and Sprewell hit just
three of their first 21 shots, the Knicks were able to force a
couple of turnovers and get a few fast-break points to gain a head
of steam to pull within three, 17-14, after the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That momentum rocked the Pacers. The Knicks started the second
by leaning on Johnson in the post and went on a 10-1 run while the
Pacers were turning the ball over and committing fouls. Houston
seemed to feed off Camby's energy and ended the first half with 14
points after starting 1 for 7. Johnson also started to play well
with Camby beside him until his knee gave way beneath Best in a
sober moment in the second quarter.

SPORTS COLUMN: THIS DRAMA HAS ONLY ONE HERO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few events can reduce New York to small-town
giddiness, but these new Knicks have broken through the
sophisticated veneer of the city and shrunk it to a quaint village
mad about its local team. Now, with a 90-82 victory Friday night,
the team is Eastern Conference champion, and this cool city known
for its aloofness is going absolutely wild.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks continue to play out an improbable drama that
playwrights wouldn't have dared to craft: disparate players led
through the wilderness by an aging star who, like Moses, collapses
with the Promised Land just in view. The team is carried on the
shoulders of two vilified players, and all this transpires in the
context of a front office feud with players cleverly used as pawns
and shields by an underdog coach hanging on to his job by a thread.
</P>
<P>
   Then a critical game is won on a miracle shot after the whistle.
Friday night, Larry Johnson, who had hit that shot, was injured,
yet that simply heightened the drama of the Knicks' Game 6 victory.
</P>
<P>
   This Knicks' season is an improvised script in progress,
collectively written by journalists, who have taken turns
fashioning characters and developing story lines. With each new
scene, the plot thickens even as it becomes more elastic, more
intricate, each new scene more bizarre than the last. Now the magic
ride continues; the Knicks begin the championship series in San
Antonio on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now the time has come to name the hero of this drama. Suddenly
this fluid script-by-committee has hit a snag. Latrell Sprewell _
who scored 20 points last night _ is the hero; the dilemma is, how
can the character so positively cast as the villain end up as the
hero?
</P>
<P>
   He can't. So Marcus Camby, the young dynamo off the bench, has
become the leading light. This, in itself, is a wild twist. Camby
was maligned last summer and for most of the season by the very
people who now sing his praises since he has played like a demon in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was _ and still is _ a political prisoner whose style,
attitude and baggage make a lot of people nervous. From the time
Sprewell made national news a year and a half ago for attacking his
coach, until January when he held an introductory news conference
in Rye, N.Y., there has been resistance and ambivalence, from the
coach and from many who tell the story of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell attacked his coach; Sprewell boycotted practice after a
popular teammate was traded; Sprewell used a racial epithet against
Oakland police officers who he felt stopped him because he is black
_ this two years before racial profiling by the police became a
national issue.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who steps away from the passion of the moment and
looks at this season clearly must concede that Sprewell has
provided phenomenal energy and in stretches has been an
extraordinary player.
</P>
<P>
   To a team that often looked over its shoulder and was overtaken
by what was gaining, Sprewell introduced a relentless attack,
stamina and endurance, physically and psychologically. Sprewell,
kept in check by the Pacers' long arms and long bodies for much of
the game, still managed to score six of the Knicks' final 10 points
when the game was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell has transformed the Knicks into an aggressive,
offense-oriented team that no longer frets about how to stop the
opposition, but makes the opposition fret about how to stop the
Knicks in transition.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell even put pressure on the coaching staff, not simply to
put him into the starting lineup but also to let the team evolve
into what it naturally is. As the coach grew increasingly dependent
on Sprewell's energy, and as his own job status became precarious,
Van Gundy let go.
</P>
<P>
   And he is still learning how to let go. Van Gundy started Camby
in the second half of Game 3 and started Sprewell for Game 4 and
stuck with him in Game 5. With Grunfeld safely out of the way, Van
Gundy's moves are like the last-second confession that comes too
late to save the death row inmate.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 4 on Monday, Sprewell was dismally out of sync in his
first start in months. Camby played great, but the Knicks lost. The
critics were swift and predictably knee jerk: Sprewell plays no
defense; he allowed the savvy Chris Mullin to roast him; he's good
only in transition; put him back on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5, Sprewell scored 29 points and reduced Mullin to
putty. The spin was that the coach is a genius and Camby is the
hero and Sprewell gained redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the coach is beginning to look like a genius and Camby is
playing heroically.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: Sprewell is the hero of this drama. &QL;

   NRA-WOES (Washington) _ After years of struggling with debt,

   COLLEGE-ADMISSIONS (Undated) _ The signs have been evident for
several months: top high school seniors rejected by colleges of
their choice, second-tier institutions overwhelmed with excellent
applications, state universities raising admission requirements.
Now, interviews with scores of college and school officials and
preliminary statistics, appear to confirm what stunned high school
seniors and their parents suspect: that the college application
season just ended was the most competitive in the nation's history.

   ANGELES-CALLGIRLS (Los Angeles) _ Police say they have busted

Northern California became the first shelter in the country to
implant the chips in all animals put up for adoption. Since then,
the technology has reunited more than 1,000 pets with their owners.
The practice has taken off in recent years, as the three big

morning, the cream of the Los Angeles political establishment could

sprawling, car-crazed city hardly ever do: riding the subway. And
not just any subway, but the five spanking new stops under

   KOSOVO-CLINTON (Whiteman AFB, Mo.) _ President Clinton came to

possibility another Sukarno may be the next leader of Indonesia. By
Mark Landler.

<P>
   BEIRUT-BEACHES (Beirut) _ Before the civil war, Beirut was known
as the Paris of the Middle East. In some ways, it still deserves
its slightly libertine reputation. But, particularly in mostly
Muslim West Beirut, that culture has always been overlaid by more
conservative strands, including ideas about what should and not be
seen when it comes to female flesh. Thus, there is segregation on
the sexes on Beirut's famed beaches. By Douglas Jehl. WITH PHOTO.

VAUGHN FAILED TO LURE JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ They hugged each other during batting practice
Friday afternoon, something the Anaheim Angels would have liked to
see more often this season.
</P>
<P>
   But unfortunately for the Angels, Mo Vaughn and Randy Johnson
are not teammates. After the Angels signed Vaughn to a six-year,
$80 million deal Nov. 25, they pursued Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson reportedly chose the Angels only to change his mind and
sign a four-year, $53 million with the Diamondbacks, despite the
efforts of Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Johnson developed a friendship when Vaughn played in
Boston and Johnson in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the type of player he is and what he means to a
ballclub, Vaughn said. ``I tried to get him to come here, but
sometimes family is more important.
</P>
<P>
   So just how did Johnson, who lives in Paradise Valley, a suburb
of Phoenix, and Vaughn become friends?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm the only left-hander that faces him, Vaughn said.
``It's a little thing we got going. It takes a certain attitude
(for a left-handed hitter) to stand in there against him. You have
to respect him because he's so tough, so nasty. We became friends
because I never backed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in Boston or Seattle, he always looked over and
tipped his cap out of respect. He's the toughest in the business.
When I did face him it settled me down for the rest of the season.
Because after you faced him, you could walk up there with
confidence against anybody.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Help could soon be on the way for the Angels, though it's not
quite what they've been waiting for.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon and Jim Edmonds still have a ways to go until they
are healthy enough to play, but the Angels might get some
desperately needed punch in the lineup from Matt Luke, who began
playing at triple-A Edmonton earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   In five games through Thursday, Luke is 9-for-18 with five
homers and 15 RBIs. He hadn't played since spring training because
of a strained back, an injury he sustained lifting weights during
the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great power, but we've got to find out how healthy he
is, manager Terry Collins said. ``He's been out two months, we've
got to make sure he's OK.
</P>
<P>
   Luke spent most of last season with the Dodgers, hitting .236
with 12 homers and 34 RBIs in 102 games.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina played four innings for single-A Lake
Elsinore on Friday night, going 0 for 3 at the plate and making one
putout and one assist on defense. In two games for the Storm,
DiSarcina is 1 for 4 with a walk. He is expected to DH
tonight. &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Marcel Lachemann, formerly the Angels pitching coach and
currently the organization's minor league field coordinator, has
been named pitching coach for the USA Pan Am Games baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Lachemann was named as a replacement for Dave Wallace, who was
named the pitching coach of the Mets last week.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Diamondbacks play the second game of their
three-game series tonight beginning at 7:05. Chuck Finley (4-6,
4.35 ERA) will start for Anaheim against Arizona's Andy Benes (4-5,
5.40).

   BELLINGHAM, Wash. _ After more than an hour of computer problems
and shutting, then trying to restart, its 400-mile fuel pipeline,
Olympic Pipe Line Co. officials got a call from an employee
Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Kiene, a chemist who happened to be in the area, was
checking the pipeline in Bellingham and smelled gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, Kiene called Olympic Pipe Line Co. offices in
Renton again to say he was running from a wall of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Flames raced about a mile down Whatcom Creek, nearly reaching
Interstate 5, scorching everything in their path and killing a
teenager and two boys.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion that prevailed Thursday did not end Friday, as
investigators began to try to pinpoint the cause of the rupture and
subsequent fire that reached temperatures as high as 2,000 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither investigators nor the company could offer an
explanation. Kiene Friday night declined to talk about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Spot fires continued to flare up Friday, meaning investigators
from the National Transportation Safety Board couldn't get close to
line, which ruptured where it jogs around a Bellingham
water-treatment plant.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were able to identify the victims of one of the
nation's worst gasoline pipeline accidents as Liam Wood, 18, whose
body was found near the creek late Thursday, and Wade King and
Stephen Tsiorvas, two 10-year-olds who were playing near the creek
when it exploded in flames. The younger boys died early Friday at
Seattle's Harborview Medical Center. All three suffered severe
burns.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials say the 16-inch pipeline poured out 84,000 to
277,000 gallons of gasoline in 14 to 16 minutes Thursday afternoon,
enough fuel to float 4 inches deep on top of the creek.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators will try to determine what happened to the line,
which was buried 7 to 8 feet. An official with the NTSB, the agency
charged with investigating pipeline accidents, said nothing
indicated that the line was deliberately punctured. But he said no
cause has been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the source of ignition been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible that we'll never know what the cause is,'' said
Randy Carroll, deputy police chief in Bellingham, a city of 60,000
about 90 miles north of Seattle. He said he could not rule out
reports the 10-year-olds were seen playing with fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   According to an oil industry report released in May, outside
forces _ typically someone digging _ cause 38 percent of all oil
pipeline leaks. Officials said there was no construction in the
area Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The next most-likely cause is corrosion, which accounts for 20
percent of leaks, according to the report by New York consultant
Cheryl Trench. Companies try to guard against corrosion with a
variety of sensors and typically check every five years to
determine the thickness of pipes, federal regulators said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic pipeline, which bisects Washington from the Canadian
border to the Columbia River, was built in the 1950s, and was
buried in 1966. A company test in 1996 showed the pipe was thinner
than when built, but still within tolerable limits, said Joann
Hamick, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Olympic say one question that must be answered is why
it took the company so long to discover the leak.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said Friday the pipeline shut down at 3:25
p.m. because of a computer problem apparently unrelated to the
rupture. The problem cropped up as the company redirected the flow
from the line to a storage terminal on Harbor Island.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, 378,000 gallons of gasoline an hour were flowing
through the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Workers traced the problem, but the pipeline wasn't restarted
until about 4:30 p.m., when the pressure had dropped dramatically,
Hamick said.
</P>
<P>
   At about that time, Bellingham firefighters were already
investigating reports of a gasoline smell in the creek. They found
a vapor cloud 10 feet in the air. It shimmered, much like the
horizon on a hot day.
</P>
<P>
   Kiene, the Olympic employee, reported the fumes at 4:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In his second call, ``he said he was running from the scene. It
was on fire,'' Hamick said.
</P>
<P>
   Sensors never indicated a leak, though Olympic executives said
Friday the drop in pressure was probably a result of the leak.
Still, they had no explanation for the leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to question the adequacy of the detection system,''
said Charles Batten, who for 23 years investigated pipeline
accidents for the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   He is now a consultant and working with property owners and
cities trying to stop Olympic from building a new pipeline over the
Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators performed routine inspections of the pipeline
and the company, in 1985, 1987, 1990, 1995 and in March of this
year. The pipeline safety regulators at the U.S. Transporation
Department took part in a spill-response test with Olympic last
year, said Richard Felder, DOT's associate administrator for
pipeline safety.
</P>
<P>
   In all those inspections, regulators never cited Olympic for
violating rules, Felder said, although in March they raised some
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the company, regulators reminded the company to
keep its right-of-way clean of brush so that it could be inspected
from the air, and to follow procedures as it adopted operating
rules from the companies that own it.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators also noted corrosion on valve bolts. Felder said the
valve, which was in a vault that had filled with water, is 13 miles
away from Thursday's rupture and is ``an isolated incident.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There doesn't appear to be a relationship between the letter
and the incident (on Thursday),'' Felder added.
</P>
<P>
   But he also noted that pipeline accidents have occurred at other
companies with equally clean records.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic is jointly operated by several companies. Equilon
Enterprises, the managing partner, also operates an Anacortes
refinery where an explosion in November killed six workers.
</P>
<P>
   The leak itself is typical in an industry that moves 525 billion
gallons of oil a year through pipelines. Indeed, oil pipelines have
had an average of 197 leaks a year.
</P>
<P>
   What was unusual about the Bellingham leak is the devastating
fire afterward. A check of the NTSB's data base showed several oil
pipeline accidents in recent years, but only one other fire.
</P>
<P>
   That occurred in October 1994 when eight pipelines ruptured
during flooding of the San Jacinto River near Houston. Like Whatcom
Creek, the river ignited, injuring 547 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really need to have enough of a concentration of flammable
vapor and an ignition source,'' said Michele Joy, general counsel
for the Association of Pipe Lines, an industry group based in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rarely happens since spills occur over a large area and
the vapors dissipate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fires are uncommon,'' said Trench, who performed the pipeline
safety study released in May. ``And, Lord knows, so are these
fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   But the oil pipelines that criss-cross the nation present the
potential of more San Jacintos and Whatcom Creeks. The problem,
said Batten, the former NTSB official, is that neither the
regulators nor the industry seem to be taking much heed.
</P>
<P>
   Situations like those in Bellingham, where people live next to
pipelines, are common. Federal regulators have no rules about how
far away people have to build from pipelines, Felder said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies do typically have 100 feet of right of way. But
federal regulators leave it up to zoning by local government to
decide how close people can build, Felder said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, suburban developments and other growth have brought
housing to areas that were rural when many pipelines were built in
the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has been warning about the proximity of pipelines and
homes since 1983, Batten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only going to get worse,'' Batten said. ``We do need this
product transported into urban areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipeline companies use all manner of systems to detect leaks,
including sensors that ``hear'' the leak of oil and others that
signal the escape of hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic uses pressure and temperature data fed into a computer
model that is supposed to detect changes as small as 1 percent of
flow. However, Batten said he has yet to be convinced the system is
that sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   The company also uses visual inspections, including weekly
overflights.
</P>
<P>
   Pipelines can be shut down manually, often by turning large
wheels to close a series of stop valves. The stop valve nearest to
Thursday's rupture was one-tenth of a mile away.
</P>

Lange contributed to this report.

`BABY DOLL' LIVED MODESTLY WHILE IN L.A., POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As the brains behind a call-girl empire for the
rich and famous from Los Angeles to Europe, Jody ``Baby Doll''
Gibson could have afforded to stay just about anywhere, police say.
</P>
<P>
   She chose a $100-a-night hotel room in the Van Nuys in L.A.'s
San Fernando Valley, and she always made sure to use her AAA card
for the 10 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   It is this picture of modest living that began to emerge Friday,
a day after police announced her arrest on suspicion of running the
largest prostitution ring since ``Hollywood Madam'' Heidi Fleiss'.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives say she pimped for 34 girls in 16 states and at least
six more in Europe, with a client list that included Hollywood
actors, Fortune 500 executives and even a professional athlete.
They paid from $500 to $3,000 per night or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are no Joe Blow actors. They're people who are known,''
said Los Angeles police Lt. Mike Felix.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, investigators pored over the lists and later attended
an adult entertainment convention at the Los Angeles Convention
Center in hopes of finding pornographic actresses believed to be
have worked for Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they'll be buzzing about Gibson's operation,'' Felix
said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said she did most of her business by mail, the
Internet and phone. She used mail drops in Toluca Lake and Blythe,
near her home in Palo Verde, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   And when in Los Angeles, she stayed at the Airtel Plaza Hotel in
Van Nuys two to three days a month, said hotel spokesman Jack
McGrath.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in business attire, Gibson blended in with other
business people and families at the hotel next to Van Nuys Airport,
McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't look flashy or grungy,'' McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson began frequenting the hotel at the beginning of 1998 and
last stayed there Tuesday night, always paying her bill with an
American Express card and using her own credit cards for phone
calls, McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel staff never reported any problems or unusual traffic
to Gibson's room, McGrath said. ``We never saw her with anybody
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're surprised that this allegedly was going on. It certainly
was a big surprise because this guest never gave an appearance that
she was in this sort of business,'' McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, whose driver's license identifies her as Jody Babydol
Diane Gibson, lives in Palo Verde, a small retirement village on
the California-Arizona border and hard beside the Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   Several people there who regularly ran into the blonde said
heads would turn on the street to admire her beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta look at her. She's sexy. She'd go into the post
office and she'd say hello. Sometimes, she'd order a
double-espresso and baklava,'' said a restaurant owner who declined
to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Her neighbors said they wondered about the mysterious woman who
turned heads when she drove by in her teal Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very beautiful woman. She's the kind of person you
just can't take your eyes off of,'' said Jeanette Hyduke, a real
estate agent for Palo Verde Land. ``Even though she's a woman,
women would turn their heads. She's really quite stunning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyduke said Gibson has lived over a year in a ``little red
fishing cabin'' with a front porch that overlooks a lagoon. She
also has a ``huge black dog in front of her yard.''
</P>
<P>
   But police say she had a secret: Sometimes using the alias
``Sasha,'' she had run a thriving hooker ring since at least the
late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was booked at the Van Nuys jail and was released on
$25,000 bail. She is scheduled to be arraigned at the West Los
Angeles Courthouse on June 29, detectives said.

A TOWN, TWO SCHOOLS LEFT REELING AFTER DEATHS OF THREE YOUTHS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BELLINGHAM, Wash. _ With only one day of classes remaining in
the school year, Friday should have been a day of sunny field trips
and lighthearted yearbook signing at two Bellingham schools.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, teachers and students at Roosevelt Elementary cried
over the deaths of two 10-year-old classmates killed in the
Thursday afternoon pipeline explosion in Whatcom State Park. Across
town at a high school still reeling from three student deaths in
March, Sehome students mourned a newly graduated senior killed in
the same blast.
</P>
<P>
   Outside both schools and across the Bellingham School District,
flags were lowered to half staff in memory of 10-year-olds Wade
King and Stephen Tsiorvas and Class of '99 graduate, Liam Wood. All
three died of burns sustained in the explosion and fire in this
city of 60,000 about 90 miles north of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels the loss so keenly I don't know if we'll see
any game faces today,'' said Bill Attebery, director of the crisis
response team that descended on Roosevelt Elementary early Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen grief counselors, substitute teachers and
volunteers gathered nearly an hour before students arrived.
</P>
<P>
   While the teachers and students mourned two well-liked,
``high-energy boys,'' wisps of brown smoke still smudged the
cloudless blue sky over the nearby state park. The two friends died
while playing in Whatcom Creek, where the fire raced after the
pipeline exploded. Wood apparently died while fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Stephanie Sadler, who began her morning greeting
crying teachers, later comforted children devastated by the loss of
two classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being hit by a 2x4,'' she said, wiping her face, as
yellow school buses began dropping off students, many of whom fell
into the arms of waiting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Many students and parents, who had learned almost as soon as
they woke up Friday that Wade had died overnight, learned as they
arrived at school that Stephen also had died.
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the parking lot, a father and daughter sat on the
tailgate of the family pickup truck. Dad sipped coffee from a mug,
trying to explain death at a young age to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they said just one of them had died,'' the girl wailed.
When the school bell chimed, the pair were still sitting there. One
asking, the other searching for elusive answers.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents accompanied their children into the school. Some
arrived late, to find the usual tardy slip replaced by a warm hug.
</P>
<P>
   One young mother reined in her emotions as she walked her
daughter into school. After she learned that the second of the two
boys had died, she broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wade King and Stephen Tsiorvas were ``very athletic, high
energy kids'' who brought home good marks, charmed their teachers
and made friends easily, Sadler, the principal, said.
</P>
<P>
   Wade, who received an orange and black, ``trick'' bike from his
parents when he celebrated his 10th birthday only six days before
his death, was remembered at the only school he'd ever attended as
``a spirited little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime family friend and neighbor Nancy Cooley, whom Wade
referred to as ``Aunt Nancy,'' spoke sadly of a Dairy Queen sundae
she was keeping in her freezer for Wade. She'd bought it to
celebrate his birthday, but he'd been so busy with baseball
practice that he hadn't had time to eat it yet.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jack, described Wade as ``having a smile that loved
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents Mary and Frank King, older brother Jason and older
sister Traci are ``doing OK,'' Nancy Cooley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard, but we're trying to make them strong,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, who had known Wade since kindergarten, said Wade was
``the kind of boy who would get himself into something, but he'd
just make you laugh. He had such a joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen, who would have turned 11 this summer, was likewise
remembered by his school principal as a little boy who loved life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Wade and Stephen do something, they do it with every
heart and soul,'' she explained. ``Both of them, they were kids who
played hard: basketball, soccer, running ... doing what kids are
supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Across town on the sprawling Sehome campus where Liam Wood
completed senior exams last week, students remembered him as a
talented musician.
</P>
<P>
   Wood played violin in the school's advanced orchestra and won
over classmates and teachers with a ready laugh and easy nature. In
a handful of yearbook pictures, a smiling Wood is recognizable by
the deep dimple in his left cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow violinist Lauren Beven, a junior, said Liam was an avid
fisherman and rock-climber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's good that he was doing what he loved when he
died,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sehome, with a student body of 1,700, is still mourning the loss
of three other students killed earlier in the school year. The
teens, three 17-year-old boys in the school's junior class, were
killed in a highway collision in late March.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a tough situation,'' Principal Larry Brown said.
``This school has dealt with death and dying too much this year.''

APPLAUSE, AND WALKOUTS, FOR COLLEGE REMARKS BY CONVICTED KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACK HOPKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ The Evergreen State College's graduating class
politely applauded Maureen Faulkner Friday and then whooped,
cheered and gave a standing ovation to the man convicted of
murdering her policeman-husband.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a dozen seniors walked out of their own graduation
ceremony in protest of the controversial decision to invite Mumia
Abu-Jamal to give a tape-recorded address from his death row cell
in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen more _ one of them a police officer who took off
his green graduation gown to reveal his law enforcement uniform
underneath _ stood and symbolically turned their backs to the
podium and bowed their heads in protest.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the nearly 900 members of the graduating class
overwhelmingly rejected Faulkner's request that they walk out of
the ceremony during the playing of Abu-Jamal's tape during
commencement on the tree-lined campus near Olympia.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreen President Jane Jervis mentioned Faulkner's presence
during opening remarks to students and guests attending the 28th
annual ceremony. That was what sparked the restrained applause for
the Philadelphia woman.
</P>
<P>
   Jervis, who has come under fire from some state legislators and
the law enforcement community for allowing the Abu-Jamal tape,
defended the college's decision to permit the convicted killer to
take part in the ceremony in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   The college often invites controversial people to speak, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not to agree with, to endorse or to glorify the
speaker,'' Jervis said. ``But if we listen only to those we agree
with, we may only speak with ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner, who asked college officials if she could be added to
the list of speakers after learning of Abu-Jamal's taped message,
was not allowed to address the students.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't satisfy Faulkner, whose husband, Daniel, was killed
while on duty on Dec. 9, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sad day that I have to be here and I feel very
sorry for the students,'' said Faulkner, who stood on the sidewalk
a short distance away from the graduation ceremony, holding a sign
that said Abu-Jamal had murdered her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Four people testified during Abu-Jamal's trial that they saw the
black man shoot the white officer at close range. The gun that was
used to kill the officer was registered to Abu-Jamal, who was
arrested at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal has been on death row since 1982. No execution date
has been set. He is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system _ and
efforts to win a new trial _ have given him worldwide attention. A
symbol for death penalty opponents, Abu-Jamal wants a new trial on
grounds that the prosecution withheld evidence, the judge was
biased and his defense counsel was ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Maureen Faulkner accused college officials of being
``irresponsible'' in allowing the playing of Abu-Jamal's tape and
said she should have been given equal time to tell graduating
students about the impact the killing had on her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 17 years ago, Jamal silenced my husband. ... His life was
snuffed out. What about his voice?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Campus police officers walked up to her as she spoke to
bystanders, police officers and the media. They gave her carnations
and expressed their support.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of placard-carrying demonstrators from both sides were
present for the ceremony and heard Abu-Jamal's plea for the
students to become revolutionaries and fight injustice.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12-minute tape, Abu-Jamal said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why was it right for people to revolt against the British
because of taxation without representation and somehow wrong for
truly unrepresented Africans in America to revolt against America?
</P>
<P>
   ``For any repressed people, revolution, according to the
Declaration of Independence, is a right.''
</P>
<P>
   He later added: ``Live lives of opposition to the deadening
status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   Students had their choice of wearing yellow ribbons to show
support for Abu-Jamal or blue ribbons to show support for
law-enforcement officers when they arrived for the ceremony under
brilliant sunshine, blue skies and storm clouds of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who chose ribbons went for the yellow ones.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Abu-Jamal supporters was new graduate Stephanie
Guilloud, who was a member of the student committee that chose
Abu-Jamal as one of its speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal was an appropriate speaker, she said, because he
raised public consciousness of the disparate treatment given to
minorities in the criminal justice system and other important
social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unprecedented opportunity to hear a censored and
silenced voice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all students agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am against the tape being played,'' said Ripp Campbell of
Shelton, who received her bachelor's degree Friday. ``This is just
not the forum. And on a personal level, my mother was murdered on
the streets of New York. This is a day that I should be happy. But
the day is being tainted by this controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke was the students' first choice to give the
keynote address at the commencement ceremony. But he bowed out when
he heard Abu-Jamal would be part of the program. The college
replaced him with a popular faculty member, Stephanie Coontz.
</P>
<P>
   Art Costantino, the college's vice president for student
affairs, said before the ceremony that Evergreen has taken heat
from a few of its donors because of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had some donors writing or e-mailing us, saying they
would no longer be supporting the college,'' he said. The amount
lost has totaled ``probably a couple of thousand dollars. At this
point it hasn't been a major problem for us. But we do not like to
lose even one friend of the college,'' he said.

   BELLINGHAM, Wash. _ Two days ago, the sloping banks of Whatcom
Creek were lush with ferns and huckleberry bushes. Willowy alders
and thick old cedars and Douglas firs shaded its cold, rushing
water well-populated with fish in their early stages of life _
resident cutthroat and rainbow trout, kokanee, coho salmon and even
lamprey eels.
</P>
<P>
   But the gasoline-fueled fire that raced furiously down a
mile-and-a-half of this popular city greenway Thursday obliterated
almost everything it touched.
</P>
<P>
   Spill response crews from the state Department of Ecology and
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn't begin assessing the
extent of the biological and environmental damage until late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But they could confirm that fish hadn't fared well in the
inferno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing from some of our biologists that the water got to
lethal temperatures, in the 80s and perhaps even higher,'' said
Gene Tillett, manager of the hatcheries division for the state
Department of Fish and Wildlife. ``That is way too hot for salmon,
and really too hot for most fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillett said if a complete kill of the fish is confirmed, the
creek would likely see some years with depressed runs of trout and
salmon species in the future. And with the disappearance of the
vegetation that has kept the stream's water cold, fish species
could struggle over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   On a walk along a half-mile of the singed creek side Friday,
hundreds of salmon fry, most likely juvenile coho and chinook, were
floating blackened in the water. Every tree in sight was charred
and leafless, and the creek's rock outcroppings looked as if they
had been spray-painted black. The industrial smell of gasoline,
like plastic melting on an open fire, hung in the air and was acid
on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   And the creek was strangely silent; there were no birds calling
in the morning sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just feels horrible that this beautiful area has been
altered like this,'' said Crina Hoyer, an educator with ReSources,
a Whatcom County environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   Merle Jefferson, the natural resource director for the Lummi
Indian Nation, estimated Friday that it will take the scorched area
three to four years to recover most of its basic vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   The Lummi's 13,000-acre reservation is about seven miles
southwest of the creek. Jefferson spent most of his day worrying
that gasoline from the spill might affect the tribe's vast oyster
and manila clam beds off the shore of the reservation in Bellingham
Bay. But a flight over the bay found that the gasoline didn't
appear to have come close to the beds. The tribe is planning tests
of newly harvested shellfish over the weekend to confirm the beds
have not been contaminated, Jefferson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked along the beaches of the reservation this morning,
but so far we haven't gotten any effects from the (explosion),'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But given his tribe's dependence on income from shellfishing,
Jefferson said he was furious the flow of gasoline wasn't checked
more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have got to be more safeguards and engineering put to
into this system, because this was uncalled for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the city's water supply was not contaminated by the
gasoline spill, said Tony Seman, the utilities superintendent for
water distribution at the Bellingham Public Works Departments. He
said the explosion did not affect the pipelines that bring water
from Lake Whatcom to 70,000 customers. It did however, blow out
five pumps near the creek, which left about 6,000 households in
nearby neighborhoods on strict orders to conserve water. Seman said
three of the five pumps should be operational again by Monday. But
over the weekend, he was urging all city residents to conserve
water.

ANGELS ROUTED BY DIAMONDBACKS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There were those who scoffed when Randy
Johnson said he signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks because he
thought they could win right away.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who also strongly considered the Anaheim Angels,
apparently knew what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson watching from the bench _ he's not pitching in the
series _ the Diamondbacks routed the Angels 12-2 before 37,042 at
Edison Field on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona leads the NL West by three games over the Giants, while
the Angels fell further into last place in the AL West, 8{ games
behind the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been all he was cracked up to be _ he's 8-2 with a
3.15 ERA and 143 strikeouts, tied with Boston's Pedro Martinez for
the major-league lead. But the Diamondbacks showed the Angels that
it takes more than the Big Unit to put up big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitcher Armando Reynoso (4-1) shut the Angels out
on five hits in eight innings. No Angels baserunner reached third
until Troy Glaus' two-out, two-run homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks went into the game leading the National League
in hitting (.286) and runs scored. Angels starter Ken Hill (3-5)
kept his team in the game through five innings, but it all came
apart in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the sixth, Steve Finley's two-run homer made it
5-0 and Hill was gone. But reliever Mike Magnante made sure it was
over, giving up four more runs in what turned out to be a six-run
inning and a 9-0 Arizona lead.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the only thing keeping the fans around was the
fireworks show scheduled for after the game.

VERO BEACH TO HAVE DODGERS AT LEAST ONE MORE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ The Los Angeles Dodgers spent 51 springs training at
Dodgertown, and they'll spend at least one more.
</P>
<P>
   With negotiations almost non-existent for the past month with
representatives in Arizona, the Dodgers are readying for a return
to Vero Beach, Fla., for spring training 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would imagine because of the time issue, that's a reasonable
assumption,'' Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano said Friday.
``I'm not absolutely certain about it, but it's reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Dodgers officials, requesting anonymity, said the decision
to return to Dodgertown for at least one more season is final, if
for no other reason than an adequate and comparable facility
couldn't be constructed in time for the mid-February reporting date
for pitchers and catchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be another year (at Dodgertown). There's no question
about that,'' a Dodgers official said. ``It's what happens
afterward that matters now.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said negotiations will continue with Vero Beach and
Indian River County in Florida, as well as the Fort McDowell Indian
Community near Phoenix as the Dodgers search for a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   However, no longer are the Dodgers seeking a quick resolution so
they can be ready for spring training 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what the time frame is to make a decision, but we
don't have to make a decision today to be ready by 2001,'' Graziano
said. ``We're basically in the same situation we were four or five
months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Dodgers were contemplating moving to new
facilities in Arizona or staying in Florida and renovating
Dodgertown. They thought a decision would be reached by now.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush threw a curve in the plans when he
recently vetoed a bill that would have allocated $7.5 million to go
toward the purchase and renovation of Dodgertown, cutting the
available money from $20 million to $12.5 million. Graziano said
the Dodgers probably would have signed a long-term deal to remain
at Dodgertown if that bill was signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the $7.5 million, the Vero Beach deal was getting tough
to beat,'' Graziano said.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said the Dodgers will continue discussions with Florida
officials and with representatives from the Fort McDowell Indian
Community in Arizona. He said there would have to be guaranteed
money down the road for future renovations at Dodgertown to keep
the team there long-term.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, the only team to own their spring training
facility, want a more modern complex. Specifically, they want a
cloverleaf-type practice field setup, on-site housing, an upgraded
weight room and a 10,000-12,000 seat stadium. Antiquated Holman
Stadium seats only 6,500.
</P>
<P>
   Fort McDowell remains a possibility, but the Yavapai Tribe,
which owns the land, is trying to get state and county aid to help
finance a $35 million deal.

WHO'S BEST NO ISSUE BETWEEN GRIFFEY, BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer

<P>
   SEATTLE _ The career arcs of Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds
crossed again Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   One going up.
</P>
<P>
   One going down.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Kingdome collision to speak of, just a little 7-3
interleague win over the San Francisco Giants. But the intersection
has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's best players in the final decade of the millennium
are still at the top of their games, so distinctions are not
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonds, 35 next month, is two days off elbow surgery that
cost him 47 games. Griffey, 29, is leading the majors in home runs,
near a career best in batting average and still smothers more
fields than a Redmond software monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   About the only way Griffey and Bonds can be divided is by the
calendar, baseball's most relentless, consistent player.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before the game where he was in his career at 29, Bonds
said, ``Well, in '90 I was MVP, in '92 I was MVP. In '93, there was
another one.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Bonds' favorite exposition on his career, since only seven
other players in history can make such a claim, none of whom are
active.
</P>
<P>
   But the honors occurred at the front end of the decade. In a
culture where yesterday qualifies as ancient history, Bonds'
greatness is seen by the attention-span-challenged as prehistoric.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonds put it, ``Things have died down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, the '97 American League MVP, is putting up the kind of
season that could leave him trailing Bonds by one in major personal
hardware. The competition might make for a nice little rivalry.
Except that they aren't in the same league, aren't quite the same
age, and they've completely screwed it up by enjoying each other's
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took me out to dinner when I was 17,'' Griffey said of
their first meeting. ``I think it was his rookie year. We just
talked family. We don't talk much baseball. Just like now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll call him a few times in the offseason, sometimes write
him letters. Family's always the main topic, but I do get on him
about his golf game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't right now because he's got a bad elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   As sons of major league stars of the same era, the talk is
unlike any they can have with other friends.
</P>
<P>
   The offspring of baseball history are busy making their own. In
the arcane category of best father-son hitters in major league
annals, Bobby (332) and Barry (415) Bonds are first with 747, which
is 222 ahead of runners-up Griffey Senior (152) and Junior (373).
</P>
<P>
   Health permitting, Griffey may have up to a decade more to run
down the Bondses. To hear Barry tell it, Griffey will have a much
better chance of he stays in the AL, for a reason few but Bonds
might appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walks,'' he said. ``If he were in the National League, he'd
walk so much more, he'd be bored. It's something every good
National League hitter will go through _ McGwire, Sosa, Sheffield,
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk 150 times, you miss out on a lot of
oppportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds last year had 130 walks, and had a career high of 151 in
'96. In fact, Bonds has never had an injury-free year since '91 in
which he has walked less than 107 times.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's high was 96 in 1993, and he hasn't had more than 78
thereafter, including 76.
</P>
<P>
   It happened again Friday, when the only two walks given up in an
otherwise solid game by Mariner starter Jamie Moyer were to Bonds.
Even after the long layoff, Bonds remains the Giants' most
dangerous hitter on a team that entered Friday night 13th in NL
team batting average.
</P>
<P>
   As most seamheaded schoolchildren know, Griffey cannot be
pitched around, not with Edgar Martinez (.317) and Butch Huskey
(.359) backing him with heavy cannon.
</P>
<P>
   There's also one other thing that doesn't happen with Griffey,
in the opinion of the first player to reach a career 400 in stolen
bases and home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't steal bases,'' Bonds said. ``That's the only thing
he doesn't do. But in the American League, he doesn't have to. They
don't manufacture as many runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might have been different if I hadn't worn myself down by base
stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Griffey stole a career high 20 last year, just eight less
than Bonds. Of course, Bonds would suggest that he was also worn
down by playing left field in Candlestick Park, where the wind does
to fly balls what kittens do to yarn balls.
</P>
<P>
   Said the seven-time Gold Glove winner: ``I've always said if you
can play left field there, you can play anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey would counter that Bonds hasn't lived until he's played
center field behind the Mariner pitching staff, which can be akin
to running a marathon a week. And the running must be done on the
Kingdome surface, which is slightly harder than a Randy Johnson
stare.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. This kind of back and forth sounds like the vague
outlines of a rivalry. It's the sort of thing that can lead to
discussion about who owns this baseball decade, about who is
ascending and who is descending. About whose daddy was better.
</P>
<P>
   We'll certainly have none of that kind of talk around here.
</P>
<P>
   At least, not after this weekend.
</P>

DODGERS ROUTED BY A'S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ In a season of ugly for Los Angeles Dodgers
left-hander Carlos Perez, this was Medusa.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, twice yanked from starts before finishing the fourth
inning, couldn't make it out of the third this time.
</P>
<P>
   He was bombarded for a season-high eight runs in 21/3 innings as
the Dodgers were defeated by the Oakland Athletics 12-6 at the
Oakland Coliseum on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland shortstop Miguel Tejada hit three homers and drove in a
career-high five runs. He hit two-run homers off Perez and Onan
Masaoka and a solo shot off Doug Bochtler in the seventh. It was
the first multihomer game of Tejada's career.
</P>
<P>
   Perez's quick unraveling came a few hours after Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson talked for the umpteenth time about what he'd like
from Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see him start pitching with confidence, go after
guys a little bit more,'' Johnson said. ``He's really not the kind
of pitcher who should go five or six pitches on a hitter. Either
they hit it or they don't. That kind of pitcher should be
pitch-efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Ummm, pitch-efficient? Like 79 pitches to record seven outs. Or
one out every 11.3 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   All eight runs were earned off Perez. He gave up six hits and
walked four. It was the fifth time this season he's given up at
least six earned runs and in his last two starts he's allowed 15
earned runs in nine innings. The A's knocked him out during a
six-run third inning, capped by Tejada's second homer.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros homered for the second
straight game, though it didn't seem to matter. His two-run shot
came in the sixth with the Dodgers trailing 9-1. The Dodgers added
three more runs in the seventh inning on Jose Vizcaino's three-run
double to pull within 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Perez came through with nothing and left little but sheer
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to wonder about Perez isn't how he'll perform in
his next scheduled start, which is Wednesday against Pittsburgh,
but if he'll make the start. The Dodgers don't have many options in
the way of other starters, but right-hander Jamie Arnold did throw
61/3 innings of one-hit ball in his only start this season.
</P>
<P>
   Perez was well on his way to his eighth loss in 10 decisions.
His already astronomic ERA is now out of the universe and is light
years away from respectability at 7.18. It's the highest among
starters in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Perez began down that path in the first inning against the
Dodgers. He walked leadoff man Tony Phillips on five pitches and
Tejada then hit a 1-1 pitch into the second deck in left field to
give the A's a 2-0 lead before Perez recorded an out.
</P>
<P>
   The A's began the third inning with a walk to Matt Stairs and
Olmedo Saenz singled. Grieve struck out, but Mike MacFarlane
doubled inside third base to score two. Ryan Christenson then hit
Perez's next pitch over the left-field fence to give the A's a 7-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Only then did the Dodgers' bullpen get busy and after Perez
walked Phillips _ his third plate appearance in three innings _
Johnson lifted him in favor of Onan Masaoka. And the left-hander
allowed a two-run homer to Tejada as Oakland went ahead 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   Karros hit his ninth homer of the season in the sixth before the
Dodgers took a significant chunk out of the lead in the seventh on
Vizcaino's three-run double off reliever Tim Worrell to make it
9-6.

A-ROD JUST `85 PERCENT' DESPITE MONSTER MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They passed around cake in the Seattle clubhouse
before Friday night's game, a thank you for the previous day's
charity function.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Mariners needed another reason to partake in this
high-caloric endeavor, they could have celebrated Alex Rodriguez's
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   It was one month ago Friday night that the All-Star shortstop
came off the disabled list, returning from arthroscopic knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And what a month it was.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Friday night's interleague series opener against San
Francisco, Rodriguez was hitting .360 with 10 home runs and 20
RBIs, with his entire offensive outburst coming in a 30-day span. A
Hall of Fame month.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Rodriguez insists he's still not himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm not 100 percent, but I'm still on the right
track to be 100 percent right after the All-Star break,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If not completely healed, what then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five percent. You can't ignore the fact that I just had
knee surgery,'' Rodriguez responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he say 185 percent?'' third baseman Russ Davis said.
``Could have fooled me.''
</P>
<P>
   With the knee under repair, Rodriguez says he's still missing
speed and explosiveness. He feels somewhat limited defensively,
either chasing balls into the hole at short or up the middle. He
doesn't expect to steal 40 bases this season either (he has four).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot of room for improvement,'' he said. ``I
still think I can still keep getting better. But I've had a pretty
good stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez acknowledges his exemplary offensive stats so far
could mislead people into assuming he's as good as new.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you can't gauge everything by numbers,'' the shortstop
cautioned. ``Sure it's a numbers game, but you can hit a ball
incredibly hard for a month and have nothing to show for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella says Rodriguez only needs to run a little
better to be the player of old.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will come,'' Piniella said. ``He's not pushing it. He's
done a heckuva job with the bat and the glove. I just want him to
take it easy once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   PART-TIME WORK: The Giants are considering using All-Star left
fielder Barry Bonds, back just two games from elbow surgery, as a
designated hitter for the first time in Sunday's series finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something in our plans, but we'll see how he feels,''
Giants manager Dusty Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with interleague play in use for two years before this
season, Baker said he's never before been tempted to try Bonds at
DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``No need to,'' Baker said. ``He wants to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds just winked and smiled Friday when asked about the
possibility of batting only.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever think about those things,'' Bonds said. ``Dusty's
the manager, he makes those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it wouldn't look good on the resume or land him a job
in the American League when he gets old, the slugger replied, ``I
play in the National League. I'm just here for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   OUTPATIENT UPDATE: Pitcher Mark Leiter was back in the M's
clubhouse Friday, five weeks after having rotator cuff surgery. His
outlook was decidedly mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be worse,'' Leiter said. ``I could be dying.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran right-hander, who rejoined his teammates on the
recent road trip, said his spirits weren't great. He was hoping for
a miracle and wanted to hear his recovery might be a matter of
months. He got the worst-case scenario: 12 to 18 months, if that.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, 36, said the injury has made him reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me thankful for as long as I've got to pitch,'' the
pitcher said. ``I was fortunate not to have my career end eight to
10 years ago. I know it's not going to last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   BAT MAN: Former big league pitcher Ken Brett was back on the
mound Friday at the Kingdome, throwing batting practice for
Mariners hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Comeback, maybe?
</P>
<P>
   Good business, the 50-year-old Brett answered.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing his bat business, he asked Mariners president Chuck
Armstrong what it would take to sell him three dozen bats for a
trial run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I will buy three dozen bats if you pitch batting
practice,''' Brett said. ``I think I impressed Lou (Piniella). I
want Lou to activate me for one game at the end of the season, so I
can get my pension current.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett, who will handle Fox broadcasting duties Saturday for a
national telecast, recently moved his family to Spokane to be near
his business interests, which include the Brett Bros. bat company
and baseball, soccer and hockey franchises.
</P>
<P>
   BLOOMQUIST SIGNED: The Mariners signed eight of their June draft
picks, including 21-year-old infielder Willie Bloomquist from Port
Orchard, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomquist, an All-America selection and Pac-10 Player of the
Year as an Arizona State junior, batted .394 with 10 home runs, 84
RBIs and 32 stolen bases this season.
</P>
<P>
   The M's also signed infielders Justin Leone and Oscar Ramirez,
pitchers Steven Kent, Wayne Hamilton and Timothy Burton and
outfielders Sean Parnell and Kristoffer Gundrum.
</P>
<P>
   CHARITABLE ACTS: The 14th annual Cystic Fibrosis/Mariners Care
Golf Tournament, chaired by M's right fielder Jay Buhner, had its
most successful year. Held for the first time at The Golf Club at
Newcastle in Bellevue, it raised more than $360,000 for cystic
fibrosis research.

ANGELS ROUTED BY DIAMONDBACKS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There were those who scoffed when Randy
Johnson said he signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks because he
thought they could win right away.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who also strongly considered the Anaheim Angels,
apparently knew what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson watching from the bench _ he's not pitching in the
series _ the Diamondbacks routed the Angels, 12-2, before 37,042 at
Edison Field Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got beat, they hammered us, Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``I can't think of a night we've had like that all
year. You're going to have bad days, and today was a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona leads the N.L. West by three games over the Giants,
while the Angels fell further into last-place in the A.L. West, 8
1/2 games behind the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been all he's cracked up to be -- he's 8-2 with a
3.15 ERA and 143 strikeouts, tied with Boston's Pedro Martinez for
the major league lead. But the Diamondbacks showed the Angels that
it takes more than the Big Unit to put up big numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitcher Armando Reynoso (4-1) shut the Angels out
on five hits in eight innings. No Angels baserunner reached third
until Troy Glaus' two-out, two-run homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can pitch, Collins said. ``He changes speeds, give you
different looks, he never throws the same thing in any particular
count.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell, Kelly Stinnett and Steve Finley each homered for
Arizona, which went into the game leading the National League in
hitting (.286) and runs scored. Angels starter Ken Hill (3-5) kept
his team in the game through five innings, but it all came apart in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the sixth, Steve Finley's two-run homer made it
5-0 and Hill was gone. But reliever Mike Magnante made sure it was
over, giving up four more runs in what turned out to be a six-run
inning and a 9-0 Arizona lead.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the only thing keeping the fans around was the
fireworks show scheduled for after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who gave up five runs and nine hits in 5 1/3 innings, said
his velocity was down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any pop on the ball, Hill said. ``My velocity
topped out at 88-, 87-mph. I made mistakes and I paid for them. The
hitters over there will make you pay in this league. I didn't feel
good warming up.
</P>

METS TOSS ASIDE PIAZZA'S COMEBACK SCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets, who seem to thrive on stress lately, nearly
pulled another one out of the confusion Friday night on another day
of chaos at Shea Stadium. But this time they wound up deflated
after a ninth-inning comeback and lost, 3-2, to the Boston Red Sox
in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco allowed a run-scoring single to John Valentin in the
12th as the Mets' four-game winning streak and the Red Sox's
five-game losing streak ended.
</P>
<P>
   With his teen-age days adviser Ted Williams in the house as the
guest of honor, Mike Piazza slammed a two-run home run off Boston's
closer, Tom Gordon, in the bottom of the ninth to tie the score at
2-2.
</P>
<P>
   But three innings later, Benny Agbayani failed to field
Valentin's single to left field cleanly as Jose Offerman scored
from second base, and the Mets' second consecutive ninth-inning
comeback went for naught.
</P>
<P>
   All this came in the aftermath of general manager Steve
Phillips' admission on Thursday that the Mets would consider
releasing Bobby Bonilla and absorbing the rest of the $9.5 million
they owe him. Early in the evening, reporters flocked to Bonilla,
then Phillips, then manager Bobby Valentine, whom Bonilla has been
feuding with since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to put their troubles behind them, the three met in
Valentine's office shortly before the game, only hours after the
Mets' manager was issued a two-game suspension by the National
League for not leaving the dugout area after being ejected
Wednesday night. Valentine said Bonilla wanted to get back on the
field and contribute, and indeed he did before the night was over.
</P>
<P>
   When the off-the-field business were ended, it was time to honor
Williams, whose former team was in town in the season that marks
the 60th anniversary of his rookie season with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With Yogi Berra among the baseball dignitaries participating in
the ceremony, Williams was driven out to the pitcher's mound in a
golf cart by Tom Seaver and introduced by Tommy Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who first met Williams when Piazza was a teen-ager
(Lasorda helped set up the meeting), stood at first on the infield
grass as he awaited Williams' ceremonial first pitch. But the
80-year-old Williams waved Piazza back behind the plate and then
fired a perfect strike to the All-Star catcher to the delight of
the 36,700 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii gave the struggling Mets' rotation its fifth
consecutive quality start. He lasted eight innings, the longest
outing by a Mets starter this season, allowing eight hits and two
runs. But 23-year-old Brian Rose was even better for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In his fifth start of the season, Rose, a rookie right-hander
who is undefeated in three decisions with two victories over the
Yankees and one over Cleveland, limited the Mets to just three
singles in seven shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Manager Jimy Williams decided to lift Rose at the
beginning of the eighth. On came the left-hander Mark Guthrie.
Valentine countered with the right-handed-hitting Agbayani, who
grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Next up was Bonilla, pinch-hitting for Yoshii. Bonilla quieted
the crowd for an instant by rifling a 3-1 pitch for a single up the
middle, but the booing resumed. Bonilla was immediately lifted for
a pinch-runner and Valentine exchanged a high-five with him in the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine had benched Bonilla earlier this week and he then
refused to enter a game as a pinch-hitter. On Wednesday, Valentine
refused to ask Bonilla to pinch-hit against Toronto after a
pre-game shouting match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still figuring it out,'' Valentine said of the
relationship. ``But I'm not worried about it. It's a situation I'll
deal with. I'm not so sure it's as out of hand as it may seem to
be. This is a regrettable situation that I think can go away as
quickly as it came.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla said he could live with a part-time role. And he
insisted he wants to remain a Met. ``Absolutely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla's single Friday night might have endeared him to a few
more fans, but it did not lead to a run, and the Mets were still
down by 2-0 entering the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   On came Gordon. After converting a major league-record 54
consecutive save opportunities, he had blown his first one in more
than a year last Saturday. John Olerud greeted Gordon with a single
over short, and Piazza belted a 1-0 fastball over the left-field
bleachers. It was his 12th home run, it extended his hitting streak
to 15 games and it tied the game at 2-2, giving Gordon another
blown save.

RED SOX BEAT METS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took seven pitchers _ six after seven shutout
innings from starter Brian Rose _ and John Valentin's two-out RBI
single in the 12th inning to end a five-game losing streak for the
Red Sox, who held on for a 3-2 win over the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But even on a night Rheal Cormier struck out Robin Ventura with
the bases loaded in the 10th, Jim Corsi notched his first win with
a scoreless 11th, and John Wasdin tight-roped his way through the
12th for his first save of 1999, the news was not good out of the
Sox bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gordon, who blew his second save opportunity in six days
after running up 54 straight in almost 14 months, will be flying
back to Boston Saturday to undergo an MRI on his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who came into the ninth with a 2-0 lead but gave up a
two-run home run to Mets strongman Mike Piazza that cleared the
left-field bleachers and traveled an estimated 429 feet, admitted
afterward that his elbow ``still nags me.'' The fastball he threw
to Piazza was clocked at 87 miles per hour, well below his usual
velocity, and manager Jimy Williams announced after the game that
Gordon would be going home.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Saberhagen, who cut his left foot and took five stitches
after stepping on glass at a team party he hosted at his home
Thursday, may be forced onto the disabled list to make room for
reinforcements for Saturday afternoon's game, unless the Sox elect
to disable Gordon without waiting for the results of his MRI.
Saberhagen already had been ruled out of his scheduled start
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of outings I've been fighting myself, trying
to get loose,'' Gordon said. ``Some days I feel good, some days I
don't. I'm trying to battle through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is new. God knows this is new. I'm frustrated with
myself. I don't know. I really don't know. I've got to get to the
point where I can feel better. (The elbow) still nags me. That's
something we're starting to look into.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who lifted Gordon for Cormier immediately after the
home run, told reporters that the Sox closer was going home after
meeting in his office with Sox general manager Dan Duquette, who
was making one of his infrequent road appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid has been trying,'' Williams said. ``He's given
everything he's got. He loves to compete out there. I feel for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Gordon gave up a two-run, ninth-inning double to
Javy Lopez of the Braves, a hit that ended his save streak. Friday
night, he went 3-and-0 to John Olerud, the first batter he faced,
before Olerud ultimately lined a full-count fastball over Nomar
Garciaparra's head.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza followed with his 12th home run, which extended his
hitting streak to 15 games and came on the same night that Shea was
visited by Sox Hall of Famer Ted Williams, who once gave Piazza a
private batting lesson when he was a kid, and by Tom Lasorda,
Piazza's honorary godfather from his hometown of Norristown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe his command hasn't been quite as consistent, but up
until tonight his stuff was good,'' Williams said when asked if
he'd detected Gordon wasn't right even before Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Might the Sox place Gordon on the DL even before the MRI?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what the MRI is, what the doctors say. Let them make
that judgment,'' Williams said. ``There are different avenues that
can be taken. Let's wait and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jason Varitek, asked if Gordon was hurting, said: ``Only
he knows. I honestly can't answer that for him. Obviously, when
he's throwing as hard as he usually does, he's a different pitcher,
and (Piazza) doesn't get a chance to stand there and watch it go
out.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the Sox bullpen, which had endured hard times
during the losing streak, picked up Gordon on an night he blew
back-to-back saves for the first time since he became a reliever 22
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed that plain and simple,'' Varitek said of the rest
of the relief corps. ``I think the only thing the bullpen has been
lacking is confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin walked Edgardo Alfonzo and Piazza before Ventura hit a
one-hop smash to first baseman Brian Daubach for the final out.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox winning rally began in the 12th with a pinch single by
Damon Buford, who stole second and took third on Piazza's throwing
error. Buford was cut down at the plate when Jose Offerman grounded
to shortstop Luis Lopez with the infield drawn in, but Offerman
hustled his way to second during the rundown, putting himself in
position to score on Valentin's hit.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who had missed the last two games with a strained
groin, was hitless in five at-bats before driving a 2-and-2 pitch
through the left side to score Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine said afterward he thought of having
Franco intentionally walk Valentin to set up a lefty-lefty matchup
against Daubach, the ex-Mets farmhand who earlier hit his sixth
home run in 15 games to account for the second Sox run.
</P>
<P>
   But when pitching coach Dave Wallace put the question to Franco,
the Mets' closer opted to pitch to Valentin.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wallace) said, `Which one do you want?' and I said,
`Valentin,' '' Franco said, ``I said, `I'll feed him a steady diet
of changeups.' But the last one went back over the plate and he hit
it.''

KNICKS BEAT PACERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fans were on their feet for the final three
minutes, swept up in the emotion of the moment, saluting a team
that wouldn't die. The New York Knicks lost another big-time player
Friday night but won another big-time game and are going to the NBA
Finals. The mere suggestion of that a month ago would have been
deemed utterly irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   With Allan Houston (32 points) leading the way, the Knicks
completed a 4-2 series upset over the Indiana Pacers with a 90-82
victory at raucous Madison Square Garden. Now that the
eighth-seeded Knicks have completed their Eastern stampede by
ousting the first, second, and fourth seeds, they will meet the San
Antonio Spurs for the NBA title starting Wednesday, which gives
their city plenty of time to party and the players time to
celebrate, reflect, rest, and gear up for one more upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and Spurs did not meet in the regular season. New
York is in the Finals for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put what this means into words,'' said Houston, who
made eight of nine shots in the second half after a cold start and
went 47 minutes. ``We've accomplished something but not everything.
Still, I was trying to picture what the scene was going to be like
when there were still 25 seconds left in the game. It's something I
can't describe.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was costly, however. Larry Johnson sprained
ligaments in his right knee midway through the second quarter and
didn't return. His status for the Finals is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   But winning the conference championship was a windfall for
beleaguered coach Jeff Van Gundy, who automatically gets an extra
year added to his contract, worth $3.5 million, as well as a
$500,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about me. It's sweet for the team and the
organization,'' Van Gundy said, looking relieved and even jubilant
for the first time in this series. ``I'm very proud of our guys,
how they kept fighting through this game and, basically, all year.
Sometimes, that's overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, meanwhile, fell into the same spell that had doomed
Miami and Atlanta before it. The Pacers lost twice at home and were
outplayed by a team that, in this series finale, was without two of
its biggest guns, having also lost Patrick Ewing after Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' said coach Larry Bird, ``I'm very disappointed in
the way we played this series. It seemed like we always had three
guys who played well when we needed five or six.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, who loves to play in New York, shot a pathetic 3
for 18 _ and one of those three was a dunk. He did not score in the
fourth quarter and finished with 8 points. ``Horrendous,'' he said
of his shooting. ``Just horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rik Smits fouled out after scoring 20 points. Chris Mullin
didn't even have a field goal in 24 invisible minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This marked the fourth time in the last six years that the
Pacers have lost in the conference finals _ the second time to the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, it was a certifiable upset. The Pacers entered
this series having gone 7-0 in the first two rounds and looking
every bit like the conference favorite. The Knicks, meanwhile, were
alive thanks only to a benevolent roll in Game 5 against Miami in
the first round and to the sheer ineptitude of the Hawks in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, however, established themselves as anything but
pushovers by winning Game 1 in Market Square Arena. They also won
Game 5 in the same building. They have faced adversity all season,
from the corporate intrigue to players whining about roles to
injuries. Johnson, who had played big roles in wins in Games 3 and
5, left with 6:03 remaining in the first half after Indiana's
Travis Best clipped him in the knee. The Garden instantaneously
went to hush mode for several minutes as Johnson lay in a fetal
position under the basket. X-rays were negative and he was taken to
a hospital for an MRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, it takes a toll on the team,'' Van Gundy said of
Johnson's loss. ``But our guys fought.''
</P>
<P>
   Did they ever. And the Pacers wimped out. They had no answer for
Latrell Sprewell, who recovered from a horrible start and finished
with 20 points. Marcus Camby, who Bird said was the best player in
the series, came through again with 15 points, 9 rebounds, and 3
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   In a tight game, with each team spurting and sputtering, it was
a 6-0 burst that sealed things for the Knicks. With New York
leading, 78-76, Camby followed a Chris Childs miss. And then, four
possessions later, he was fouled and made two biggies. Sprewell
then completed the burst, which gave the Knicks their biggest lead
(84-76) with 1:22 left. The Pacers went quietly, as was the case
all series, never getting closer than 5 the rest of the way.

TED HAS A BALL IN NY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Friday night was ``Ted Williams Night'' at Shea
Stadium. They called it a celebration of the 60th aniversary of his
rookie season, and the greatest hitter who ever lived threw out the
first ball before the Red Sox' 3-2 victory in 12 innings over the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm is like always, not very good,'' said Teddy Ballgame,
now 80 and utilizing the aid of a walker.
</P>
<P>
   Ted will have to ice his arm for the next month to get ready for
another first-ball toss when the last All-Star Game of the century
is played at Fenway Park one month from Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, going back to Boston will be big,'' the Splendid
Splinter said in his hotel suite Friday afternoon. ``Hell, there's
a bunch of memories there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams did a battery of interviews early Friday. He chatted
with Fox-TV, answered questions for the Mets' promotional
department, then rested with a glass of ice water and commented on
some more topics.
</P>
<P>
   Ted wore down as the morning stretched into afternoon. A series
of strokes and a broken hip have put him behind in the count. Fans
across the country might remember an unfortunate interview he did
on the ``Today'' show after Joe DiMaggio died. In an unflattering
setting, under bright lights, at an early hour, Williams appeared
sleepy and confused. Such was not the case Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good, but I get tired easy,'' he said. ``And I
sometimes have a hard time getting through the day. When there's no
game at night, that's a bad day. Not too much going on.''
</P>
<P>
   He was in town as a favor to Mets owner Nelson Doubleday and to
promote the Hall of Fame candidacy of Shoeless Joe Jackson. Teddy
Ballgame is quite passionate about the Jackson topic, and he'd
hoped to meet with baseball commissioner Bud Selig. Bud couldn't
make it, which is a little curious. It's beginning to look as if
Selig is dodging the Joe Jackson shakers the same way John
Harrington shuns those Save Fenway zealots.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and his people have worked up an eight-page manifesto
pushing Jackson for Cooperstown. Space doesn't permit furnishing
too many of the details, but the thrust is that Jackson was never
convicted in a court of law, played hard in the 1919 World Series,
and fully paid his debt to society and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here, more than anything else, to just say what I can to
create a little excitement about Joe Jackson,'' said Williams.
``And I think he's gonna get in. I go back to 1936 with Joe
Jackson. I asked Eddie Collins in 1936 to tell me about Joe
Jackson. He dropped his head and he paused three or four seconds,
and then he lifted his head toward the sky and said, `Boy, what a
player he was.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the thing about Joe Jackson: He never was convicted in
court. Twice he was acquitted. He never, ever said a bad thing
about baseball. His record is absolutely on top. It makes you
wonder. You got to at least think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never met him. We used to go by his house in South Carolina.
We'd be playing near Atlanta at the end of spring training. I never
did go up to say hello. Joe Cronin, my manager, was always trying
to get me to meet old players. I got introduced to Walter Johnson.
And I got introduced to Judge (Kenesaw Mountain) Landis through
Cronin, and I met Ty Cobb through Cronin.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7:25 Friday night, Williams entered Shea in a golf cart
driven by Tom Seaver. Fans stood as Marines saluted the Splendid
Splinter. Ralph Kiner presented Ted with a silver bat. Ted gave a
brief tribute to New York baseball fans and owners, then said the
best team he ever played for was ``the US Marines.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams stood with his arm wrapped around Rusty Staub while the
anthem was sung by a Marine major. Then, supported by Staub and
Seaver, Williams urged former hitting pupil Mike Piazza to back up,
and he lofted a strike to the Met catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Tossing first balls is nothing new for Ted. In the last two
years he's performed the feat in his native city, San Diego, and
his current home state of Florida. He threw out the first ball the
last time the All-Star Game was played at Fenway, in 1961, but said
he had no recollection of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Ted still takes pride in his five-year-old prediction that Dan
Duquette was going to be a ``secret weapon'' for the Red Sox. Now
he says the same thing about Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are two secret weapons they have, and I knew it. Nobody
else knew it, but I knew it. I watch 'em every time I have a
chance. I like a lot of their players. (John) Valentin, I love.
(Nomar) Garciaparra, I love. What a player he is. What a hitter he
is. Jeez, I just hope he doesn't get hurt. He's a good kid. And
that little outfielder, (Damon) Buford, is good. And the other guy
who is a hell of a hitter is (Reggie) Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he wants to see the model of the new Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston deserves a new ballpark,'' he said. ``I haven't seen
the new plan, but I'm glad to hear they got the sun setting in the
same direction. That's one thing they're doing right. Just imagine
the money they've lost over 40 years by not being able to get that
extra ten or twelve thousand in the ballpark. With that, they can
compete with anybody. Now it's hard to compete with these guys that
are making nine jillion bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and his son, John Henry, Saturday will fly to Detroit
to be part of a golf tournament honoring the late Hank Greenberg.
Next month, before coming to Boston, Williams and his entourage
will be in Iowa for a Joe Jackson event at the original Field of
Dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Ted's particularly proud of his son's booming Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too smart,'' said the dad. ``He's got 50 people working
for him. I keep asking myself, `How'd he get so damn smart?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ted and your humble correspondent talked about how the Web seems
to be taking over the world. I told Ted that my wife sometimes
shops for groceries over the Net. He wanted to know how much extra
that would cost.
</P>
<P>
   He said he still watches a ton of TV, which keeps him current .
. . and opinionated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get discouraged,'' he said. ``There's nothing smooth or
running nice in the (expletive) world. Jeez. I would take that
Mananovich (sic) or whatever the hell his name is (Yugoslavian
president Slobodan Milosevic) and I would insist that NATO and the
World Court do something. He's a (expletive). I think that's the
way to shorten this thing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not above name-dropping, I told Ted I'd sat with former
Congressman Joe Kennedy on my flight to New York. I told him that
Joe said hello, but we all know that Ted is a staunch Republican
who campaigned for Richard Nixon in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know Kennedy didn't beat Nixon, either,'' Ted reminded me,
making an obvious reference to Richard Daley's infamous Cook County
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Ted was tiring. He ordered a coke and some chocolate ice cream
from room service. Time for me to go home and let the greatest
hitter who ever lived eat his ice cream and take a nap.

KNICKS HAVE BLOSSOMED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You don't have to love 'em, but you sure have to
respect the way they're playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks are going to the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   You know the time-honored NBA reference to the ``Second
Season?'' What's going on with the Knicks is more like a second
lifetime. Ever since blowing Game 4 of the first-round series with
Miami right here in Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks have
been involved in as bizarre and amazing and inexplicable a playoff
story as the NBA has ever seen. They were one possession away from
elimination in Game 5, one debatable sideline out-of-bounds call,
really. And then Allan Houston got The Bounce on that game's final
shot. Since then, just about nothing concerning the New York Knicks
makes any sense.
</P>
<P>
   They played the final four games of this series without Patrick
Ewing. No problem. Friday night they played the final 2 1/2 periods
without Larry Johnson, who sprained ligaments in his right knee. No
problem. Nothing was going to deter them. They just kept playing
their game, and with Friday night's 90-82 victory, they will be in
the Finals, the first No. 8 seed ever to make that statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers have no excuses. The Knicks beat them. Fair.
Square. In. Out. Right side up. Upside down. New York took whatever
Indiana had to offer in this series and spit it right back. You
might not want to take a few of these guys home to mother, but
right now you'd want them in your trench.
</P>
<P>
   This has to be an unimaginably crushing blow to the Pacers, who
had been deemed the heirs apparent to Chicago's Eastern Conference
supremacy before the season began, and who had begun the playoffs
with seven consecutive victories over Orlando and Philadelphia. But
they were shaky from the very start in this series, losing Game 1
at home, blowing a 17-point lead before pulling out Game 2 on two
dubious Reggie Miller free throws, and then squandering an 8-point
lead in the late stages of Game 3, the affair that ended as
improbably as any playoff game has ever ended when Johnson came up
with a 4-point play. Indiana also coughed up a 14-point
first-period lead in Game 5 in their own building and just to make
this whole thing nicely circular and symmetrical, they couldn't
make the most of an early 9-point lead Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   And who could feel worse in the world of sport this morning than
Miller. The man who has proclaimed just how much he enjoys being
the enemy was poison to his own fans and teammates with a 3-for-18
performance Friday night. Truth be told, it looked even uglier than
that, since one of those three hoops was a sneakaway dunk following
a first-period New York turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but a Reggie Miller type did show up Friday night, only it
wasn't Reggie Miller. It was Houston, who played a lot like the
coach of Indiana used to play in these type of games, pouring in 32
points. He did it with smooth jumpers and aggressive moves to the
hoop. He had 25 of the first 64, if you can believe that. Then
again, with this Knicks team, you can believe just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that the game began to turn in New York's
favor when coach Jeff Van Gundy called on Marcus Camby to reenter
the game in the third period. The Pacers had come out of the blocks
strong in the second half, ripping off the first 11 points to move
from a 6-point deficit to a 46-41 advantage. At that point Van
Gundy knew the game was in danger of slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   Camby did what he has done the entire series. He got on the
boards. He ran the floor. He floated around on defense. He proved
to be the Matchup From Hell. There was never anything a Smits,
Davis, or McKey could do with him. The final numbers Friday night
were 15 points and 9 rebounds, but the effect was incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens against the favored Spurs when the Finals
begin Wednesday night in the Alamodome, this game was the final
vindication for deposed general manager Ernie Grunfeld, who made
the deal with Toronto to import Camby, and who then had to battle
his own coach in order to get him in the lineup. Van Gundy has to
know just how much he owes Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about thanks and gratitude. Words and feelings. But
I could just as easily be talking about cold, hard cash. For with
this victory, Jeff Van Gundy has been enriched by $4 million. Agent
Rob Ades negotiated a clause in Van Gundy's contract that gives him
an automatic one-year contract extension at $3.5 million through
the 2000-01 season should the Knicks make the Finals. There is also
a nice little $500,000 bonus in there for Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   The coach now can think about trading in his Honda Civic. Either
that, or he can give it to Grunfeld. Or he can take him out to
dinner. But he's got to do something. No Camby, no trip to the
Finals. And no bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Logic dictates that this story ends with San Antonio blowing out
the Knicks. Well, bleep logic. As far as the Knicks are concerned,
logic was put on waivers about three weeks ago.

WHO'S BEST NO ISSUE BETWEEN GRIFFEY, BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (subs to fix 76 walks `past two seasons' plus other editing
fixes)

<P>
   SEATTLE _ The career arcs of Ken Griffey Jr. and Barry Bonds
crossed again Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   One going up.
</P>
<P>
   One going down.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Kingdome collision to speak of, just a little 7-3
interleague win over the San Francisco Giants. But the intersection
has been made.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's best players in the final decade of the millennium
are still at the top of their games, so distinctions are not
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonds, 35 next month, is two days off elbow surgery that
cost him 47 games. Griffey, 29, is leading the majors in home runs,
near a career best in batting average and still smothers more
fields than a Redmond software monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   About the only way Griffey and Bonds can be divided is by the
calendar, baseball's most relentless, consistent player.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before the game where he was in his career at 29, Bonds
said, ``Well, in '90 I was MVP, in '92 I was MVP. In '93, there was
another one.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Bonds' favorite exposition on his career, since only seven
other players in history can make such a claim, none of whom are
active.
</P>
<P>
   But the honors occurred at the front end of the decade. In a
culture where yesterday qualifies as ancient history, Bonds'
greatness is seen by the attention-span-challenged as prehistoric.
</P>
<P>
   As Bonds put it, ``Things have died down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, the '97 American League MVP, is putting up the kind of
season that could leave him trailing Bonds by one in major personal
hardware. The competition might make for a nice little rivalry.
Except that they aren't in the same league, aren't quite the same
age, and they've completely screwed it up by enjoying each other's
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took me out to dinner when I was 17,'' Griffey said of
their first meeting. ``I think it was his rookie year. We just
talked family. We don't talk much baseball. Just like now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll call him a few times in the offseason, sometimes write
him letters. Family's always the main topic, but I do get on him
about his golf game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't right now because he's got a bad elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   As sons of major league stars of the same era, the talk is
unlike any they can have with other friends.
</P>
<P>
   The offspring of baseball history are busy making their own. In
the arcane category of best father-son hitters in major league
annals, Bobby (332) and Barry (415) Bonds are first with 747, which
is 222 ahead of runners-up Griffey Senior (152) and Junior (373).
</P>
<P>
   Health permitting, Griffey may have up to a decade more to run
down the Bondses. To hear Barry tell it, Griffey will have a much
better chance if he stays in the AL, for a reason few but Bonds
might appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walks,'' he said. ``If he were in the National League, he'd
walk so much more, he'd be bored. It's something every good
National League hitter will go through _ McGwire, Sosa, Sheffield,
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk 150 times, you miss out on a lot of
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonds last year had 130 walks, and had a career high of 151 in
'96. In fact, Bonds has never had an injury-free year since '91 in
which he has walked less than 107 times.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's high was 96 in 1993, and he hasn't had more than 78
thereafter, including 76 the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It happened again Friday, when the only two walks given up in an
otherwise solid game by Mariner starter Jamie Moyer were to Bonds.
Even after the long layoff, Bonds remains the Giants' most
dangerous hitter on a team that entered Friday night 13th in NL
team batting average.
</P>
<P>
   As most seamheaded schoolchildren know, Griffey cannot be
pitched around, not with Edgar Martinez (.317) and Butch Huskey
(.359) backing him with heavy cannon.
</P>
<P>
   There's also one other thing that doesn't happen with Griffey,
in the opinion of the first player to reach a career 400 in stolen
bases and home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't steal bases,'' Bonds said. ``That's the only thing
he doesn't do. But in the American League, he doesn't have to. They
don't manufacture as many runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Might have been different if I hadn't worn myself down by base
stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Griffey stole a career high 20 last year, just eight less
than Bonds. Of course, Bonds would suggest that he was also worn
down by playing left field in Candlestick Park, where the wind does
to fly balls what kittens do to yarn balls.
</P>
<P>
   Said the seven-time Gold Glove winner: ``I've always said if you
can play left field there, you can play anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey would counter that Bonds hasn't lived until he's played
center field behind the Mariner pitching staff, which can be akin
to running a marathon a week. And the running must be done on the
Kingdome surface, which is slightly harder than a Randy Johnson
stare.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. This kind of back and forth sounds like the vague
outlines of a rivalry. It's the sort of thing that can lead to
discussion about who owns this baseball decade, about who is
ascending and who is descending. About whose daddy was better.
</P>
<P>
   We'll certainly have none of that kind of talk around here.
</P>
<P>
   At least, not after this weekend.
</P>

SIX-RUN FIRST SENDS MARINERS PAST GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seems like every time the San Francisco Giants call on
their Gardner these days, the grass doesn't get mowed and hedges
are unevenly trimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, things got untidy real quick, with the Mariners
scoring six first-inning runs off Mark Gardner in a 7-3 victory
over their interleague guests before a crowd of 29,527 at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a good matchup from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, fighting shoulder soreness that forced him onto the
disabled list in April, hadn't won in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had jumped on opposing pitchers for first at-bat
runs in three consecutive games, including another six-spot Tuesday
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Ten batters through the Seattle lineup Friday, weeds had
sprouted all over Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the first, Edgar Martinez slugged a two-run
home run, David Bell singled home two runs and Dan Wilson got a
gift two-run double, providing the Mariner push mower, Jamie Moyer,
with plenty of backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned,'' said Gardner, a veteran with 78 big league
victories entering the season but winless in five decisions this
year. ``All I can do is go out there and try and pitch well. Today,
I didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, with one or two starts remaining at the Kingdome before
his team vacates it for new digs, has no worries these days. Even
his concrete surroundings look good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like it here,'' said the lefty, now 26-12 as a
Mariner at the Dome. ``But it doesn't matter if I like it here or
not; we're not staying here. I've had success here. Why, I don't
know. This isn't a very forgiving ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer (7-4) posted his sixth victory in a row, and won for the
sixth consecutive start, in his typical efficient fashion. The
lefty pitched into the eighth inning for the fourth consecutive
outing, scattering seven hits and the three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Through the middle innings, Moyer retired 13 batters in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first inning, he didn't have the changeup he usually
has, but as the game went on, he was able to develop it,'' catcher
Wilson said. ``He just pitched the way Jamie usually pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardner had no such success, though he came within a pitch of
leaving the first inning unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran San Francisco pitcher made an interleague mistake,
hanging a 3-2, two-out offering on the outside of the plate to
Martinez. The ball sailed 374 feet into the stands, finding the
glove of an appreciative male fan standing in the right-field
concourse. With Alex Rodriguez aboard for taking a pitch off the
hip, Martinez's 11th homer put the Mariners up 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled, the Giants right-hander walked the next batter, Butch
Huskey, on four pitches. David Segui singled. Russ Davis walked,
loading the bases. Still time for Gardner to reach the dugout with
minimal damage. But Bell wouldn't let him. Bell lined an 0-1 pitch
into left field, scoring two more and leaving two on.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner was in obvious need of help. None was in the offing.
Wilson sent a fly ball to center. Giants center fielder F.P.
Santangelo raced in two steps before realizing he should have
backpedaled. He made a futile stab at the ball as it went over his
head and rolled to the wall. As two runs scored easily to make it
6-0, Santangelo stood with his back to the plate while Gardner
paced the mound in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I hit it good, but I thought he was going to catch
it,'' Wilson said. ``For whatever reason, I saw it land. And I was
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners pushed across another run in the fourth. Wilson got
a legitimate double this time, nearly missing a homer to left.
Brian Hunter bunted for a basehit, moving Wilson to third, and
Rodriguez lofted a sacrifice fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also provided a defensive boost in the third when he slid
into his own dugout to catch a Barry Bonds pop foul, the ball
barely missing the edge of the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great play, wasn't it,'' Moyer said. ``That was a
pick-me-up for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another was a game-ending, double-play grounder with the bases
loaded, induced by Mariner closer Jose Mesa against his former
team, good for Mesa's 12th save.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, weed killer.

DODGERS ROUTED BY ATHLETICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ In a season of ugly for Los Angeles Dodgers
left-hander Carlos Perez, this was Medusa.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, twice yanked from starts before finishing the fourth
inning, couldn't make it out of the third this time.
</P>
<P>
   He was bombarded for a season-high eight runs in 21/3 innings as
the Dodgers were trounced by the Oakland Athletics 12-6 Friday at
the Oakland Coliseum. The Dodgers again dipped below .500 at 29-30.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland shortstop Miguel Tejada hit three homers and drove in a
career-high five runs. He hit two-run homers off Perez and Onan
Masaoka and hit a solo shot off Doug Bochtler in the seventh. It
was the first multihomer game of Tejada's career.
</P>
<P>
   Perez gave up six hits and walked four. It was the fifth time
this season he's given up at least six earned runs this season and
in his last two starts he's allowed 15 earned runs in nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much you can say about it when you're not making the
progress you were making (with Perez),'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``When he gets behind and comes in there, it's Katy
bar the door. I don't know where we go with him from here.''
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is the bullpen, but that would have happened
already if Johnson had confidence in another starter. But he said
with starter Darren Dreifort, loser of three straight, not pitching
well either, it leaves Johnson with rookies Jamie Arnold or Onan
Masaoka as possible spot starters.
</P>
<P>
   Masaoka's been used only in relief and Arnold made one spot
start. He pitched 62/3 innings of one-hit ball filling in for Perez
against Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You consider everything,'' Johnson said. ``We either need to
get better or I have to make a change. It's that simple. If I
thought that was the solution and I felt we had somebody who was
ready to step in for a start or two, I'd go that route.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez's unraveling came quickly and only a few hours Johnson
talked for the umpteenth time about how Perez needs to pitch with
more confidence and be more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   So Perez (2-8) responded by throwing 79 pitches to record seven
outs. Or one out every 11.3 pitches. Perez's already astronomic ERA
is light years from respectability. At 7.18, it's the highest among
starters in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a tough situation,'' Perez said. ``I've never been like
that in my career. Even in the minor leagues. When I think I'm
going to make a good pitch, they hit the ball good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I'm thinking I want to do better. I'm used to
throwing a lot of nine-inning (games), but I haven't even finished
seven innings this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's got right to him on Tejada's two-run homer with none out
in the first inning. In the third inning, the A's scored six times.
Ryan Christenson hit a two-run homer off Perez and Tejada capped
the inning with a two-run shot off Masaoka. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

SCANDALS AND NEW ATTITUDES CHANGING IRELAND'S CHURCH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ As times change in Ireland, so too does the
influence of the Roman Catholic Church, once the ineffable,
undisputed authority of life here.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland still looks and feels like Western Europe's most
Catholic country _ an estimated 90 percent of its 3.6 million
people consider themselves practicing churchgoers, people still
cross themselves when they pass a church, most have ashes daubed on
their foreheads on Ash Wednesday and flock to churches on Easter.
Angelus bells calling the faithful to prayer still ring twice daily
on national radio and television.
</P>
<P>
   But as the ``Celtic tiger'' economy roars, propelling Ireland
into the league of the world's 25 richest nations, the country has
become not only richer, but less formally religious, much like the
rest of Western Europe. That shift, combined with a series of sex
scandals involving Roman Catholic priests and bishops, has left the
church searching for a new role, something more akin to spiritual
adviser than rigid arbiter of social and sexual mores.
</P>
<P>
   The church hierarchy, challenged by changing public attitudes on
issues such as contraception, divorce and abortion, has come, as it
were, down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops, once aloof, now answer questions about the sex
scandals, many of which have involved child molestation. They
apologize, and in some cases pay reparations. Voting on matters
such as abortion or divorce, many bishops now say, is a matter of
individual conscience, not _ as the church used to suggest _ a way
to commit mortal sin or court eternal damnation. Even suicides are
no longer condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Older, more conservative bishops are heard less, and the church
is slowly taking up the art of public relations. In the Dublin
Archdiocese, where one-third of the population lives, the Rev. John
Dardis, a 42-year-old Jesuit with a master's degree in
communications from Syracuse University, is the spokesman for
Archbishop Desmond Connell, who is considered a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is struggling, the bishops are struggling to find
their voice in Ireland today,'' Dardis said. ``The question is
whether Ireland will go the way of Western Europe. As Europe has
become more materially prosperous, the rate of religious practice
has fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's Ireland, he said, ``many people feel it's not cool to
be Catholic. The reaction to organized religion is that it is
oppressive, out of touch.'' Only about half the country's nominal
Catholics attend Mass on Sunday, and fewer go to confession
regularly, he added. The Irish, he said, have forgotten about the
essential work the church did in education and medical care over
the centuries. The church today is still very much a voice for and
protector of more than 100,000 unemployed and others left behind by
the economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Championing the underdogs has not shielded the church, however,
from liberal, anticlerical challenges from an increasing number of
young Irish or from the weakening of church authority on sexual
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Condoms are widely available. The ban on divorce was removed in
a referendum three years ago. While abortion is virtually banned
here, there is a growing minority of people who want to change the
constitution so that abortions might be legal in cases of rape and
incest. Irish law permits abortion only when the life of the
mother, as distinguished from her health, is threatened by
pregnancy. A threat of suicide is a valid ground for abortion.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 Irish women go to Britain each year for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been a decline in young men choosing the
priesthood, once a prestigious calling.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the church has had to respond to the sex
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen families are suing the church for damages for
child abuse alleged to have been done by priests 10 and 20 years
ago, and many priests say they now will not touch a child
affectionately, even in the child's home in front of parents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, it was disclosed that the bishop of Galway, Eamonn
Casey, had fathered a son by an American. Since then, scores of
cases of sexual abuse of children by priests have come to light. In
March, the Rev. Sean Fortune, in County Wexford, south of Dublin,
committed suicide 10 days before the start of his trial on 29
counts of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the nation was appalled by two cases involving clergy
and sex crimes. In one, a former nun, Nora Wall, 51, was convicted
of assisting in the rape of a 10-year-old girl at the child-care
center that she had been running.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, lawyers for a 79-year-old retired priest, the
Rev. Turlough Connolly, said he had made a substantial payment to a
woman, Geraldine O'Neill, who then withdrew her formal civil
complaint that he had assaulted her last year.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in church authority was epitomized by a recent
uproar over a statement on contraception by Connell. The archbishop
suggested, in effect, that the unplanned children of parents who
did not use artificial birth control methods were better, happier
children than those of parents who did use contraceptives. Church
officials quickly said his words were unfortunate and not intended
to offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bishop raises an eyebrow on a question, it is felt by
many people that `This is this bishop telling us what to do again.
How dare he?''' Dardis said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the church's problems recently in a Dublin dormitory,
six university students, all in their early 20s, said they all have
relatives, mostly over 40, who are priests, but would never
consider following suit. Not one of the students is a regular
churchgoer; one is an agnostic from a Catholic family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celibacy,'' said Michael Geaney, a pharmacy student, ``that's
a tough one for most of us.'' The others, students of law and
medicine, nodded agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Two medical students, Donal Brennan and William Kinsella, said
that if abortion were legalized in Ireland, they would overcome
their personal opposition, and perform the procedure, despite the
church's description of it as murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't listen to the church's views on social issues, on
contemporary affairs, '' said Alec Molloy, an insurance law
student.
</P>
<P>
   Geaney said, ``Young people still believe there is a God. But
they don't see themselves as practicing Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Deasy, the agnostic, who is a law student, predicted,
however, that the church would soon gain increased public support.
``There has been a media feeding frenzy on the scandals,'' he said.
``They're turning the church into an underdog. The time is right
for some kind of resurgence in the church's role.''
</P>
<P>
   Dardis concurred. ``The scandals came along and they have been
damaging,'' he said. ``But people still see a need for faith in
their lives.''

   ``There's a hunger for spirituality, a search for what is deeper
and a skepticism about all institutions, and this all comes
together at a crucial time. We are struggling to find our voice at
the end of this millennium.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ ``People say I look like a monkey,'' the
president of Indonesia, B.J. Habibie, told an audience of
schoolteachers not long ago. ``But I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange moment of lese-majeste, described with a
bemused shake of the head by Habibie's minister of education,
Juwono Sudarsono. But this man, at once utterly un-self-conscious,
effervescent, impulsive, scatterbrained, hyperactive and charming,
is one of the most puzzling ever to rise to the forefront of public
life in Indonesia, and one of the least understood.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man who in the short space of one year overturned
much of the repressive legacy of his predecessor and mentor,
Suharto, and brought Indonesia galloping toward free elections and
a new era of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Or is he?
</P>
<P>
   Is Habibie responsible for freeing the press, bringing new
respect for human rights and allowing dozens of political parties
to compete on a newly open electoral playing field?
</P>
<P>
   Or was he simply running scared, a weak leader helpless before a
tidal wave of reform that swept all the country's politicians along
with it?
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday's parliamentary election was the capstone on a year
of far-reaching transition that followed Suharto's forced
resignation in May 1998. Already, people here seem to be taking
their new freedoms for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of Monday's vote is still unclear, with vote
counting painfully slow. Whatever the result, Habibie is very
likely to remain one of the leading candidates for president in an
electoral assembly that will meet later this year, although few
people, even in his own party, are touting him as a great reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Most Indonesians seem rather to think that reform belongs to
them, not to Habibie _ that it is a huge national movement born out
of decades of frustration and that no one leader can lay claim to
it.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can, perhaps, it may be Suharto himself, who fostered
the economic development that allowed the nation to mature, to
learn and then to reject his paternalistic form of leadership. In a
way, the new post-Suharto era is also an extension of the old
Suharto era, which ended in a blaze of violent protest that forced
its maker from office.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Lev, an expert on Indonesia at the University of
Washington, said, ``It's hard to point to anything Habibie has come
up with on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All he did, basically, was to recognize a whole bunch of faits
accomplis,'' he said. ``Free expression was hardly a gift; there
was no way to stop it. He was under terrific pressure to come up
with new laws, to get people out of jail and so on. These are
concessions more than anything else. The guidance came from the
streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's post-colonial founder, Sukarno, was a father figure
who gave Indonesia its identity. His successor, Suharto, developed
the bureaucracy and brought economic growth. It will be the turn of
the next president to begin the process of implanting democratic
institutions and the rule of law, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, some analysts concede, Habibie may have been the
right man for the moment _ pragmatic, optimistic and well versed in
democratic values from his many years working as an aerospace
engineer in West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Even his political weakness may have been an advantage, Juwono
said. ``In this period of openness, the last thing you want is a
strong president. In a way, you could say his weakness is his
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also true that Habibie's weakness is his weakness. By
his nature, Habibie is a hard man to take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   A shocking contrast to his studiously enigmatic predecessor and
mentor, Habibie seems to be bubbling over with ideas that his aides
say are sometimes brilliant, sometimes nutty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Habibie's problem as president is that people neither respect
him nor fear him,'' a Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a particular handicap in a nation that is accustomed to
being governed by a powerful personality.
</P>
<P>
   Juwono, who was also a Cabinet minister under Suharto, seemed
still to be under his spell, speaking of ``the density of his
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would stare you in the face and create a sense of awe,''
Juwono recalled in a recent interview. ``It was his presence and
his stare. He looked right through you. Every five years, 1,000
people met in a congress and there was not one who was brave enough
to stand up and say, `Enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie has another problem. Correctly or not, most people see
him as a vestige of a despised old order who must be pushed aside
before the country can truly move on.
</P>
<P>
   His personal association with Suharto is strong. Suharto
virtually adopted him as a boy and later brought him into public
service as his minister for Technology and Development. Three
months before he resigned, Suharto named his friend to be vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unanswered puzzle here. Though he was one of
Suharto's oldest and closest friends and most obedient servants, it
was Habibie who began almost from his first day in office uprooting
the structure Suharto had built over three decades in power.
</P>
<P>
   Although he remained studiously respectful of Suharto in his
public comments, there may have been a personal rupture at the end.
Aides say Habibie was badly hurt by a public display of disdain
when Suharto presented his vice presidency as a sort of sick joke
on the country.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto warned critics explicitly, in so many words, ``Watch
out. If you drive me from power this is what you'll get.''
</P>
<P>
   The international financial markets responded in kind. It was on
the day Habibie was named vice president that the currency, the
rupiah, fell to its lowest point, 17,000 to the dollar, less than
one-sixth of its earlier value.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's claims to being a reformer have two weak points, both
of them connected to Suharto's legacy. First, his government has
dodged and prevaricated in the face of public calls for an
investigation of Suharto's stolen wealth. Second, he has allowed
the military to evade calls for thorough investigations of past
misconduct, putting only a few low-ranking officers on trial.
</P>
<P>
   From one perspective, Habibie has virtually defined his
presidency by overturning the Suharto legacy. But from another, he
has shied away from directly challenging the abuses of the
government of which he was a key member.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes and today's political battles fade, people here
may begin to remember Habibie with affection as an eager and
well-meaning man who met the needs of his day.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, he gave Indonesians the freedom to laugh again,
particularly at their president, and he laughed along with them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about criticisms that Habibie's possible successor as
president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, may not be smart enough, a
television commentator, Wimar Witoelar, offered a witticism that is
now repeated everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have a rocket scientist as president,'' he said,
``and look where we are now.''

SWISS VOTE SUNDAY ON SALARY PROTECTIONS FOR NEW MOTHERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The Swiss will decide on Sunday whether to provide new
mothers with the kind of salary protections that every other
Western European country affords women after they give birth.
</P>
<P>
   While such benefits are tenuous in the United States, they are
common in Europe. Only Switzerland fails to guarantee a woman's
salary following childbirth _ even though it requires by law that
women take eight weeks off after having a baby.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands grants new mothers between 16 and 68 weeks off
at 100 percent guaranteed salary. Britain allows 18 weeks at 90
percent of wages, Austria allows up to two years at reduced wages,
with a guarantee of the same job back, and the Scandinavian
countries all have generous benefits. Even tiny Liechtenstein
guarantees new mothers 12 weeks off at 80 percent pay.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that money for the new benefits would come from
state coffers, which are strained by above-average unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would require employers to grant a 14-week leave at
80 percent salary and allow mothers in lower income families _
regardless of whether they work _ a certain sum for ``maternity
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is part of a packet of options, including whether
to toughen Swiss asylum laws and to continue to subsidize heroin
treatment, being put before voters in Switzerland's direct
democracy system.
</P>
<P>
   The maternity benefits were approved in principle in 1945, but
the Swiss have voted down three attempts _ in 1971, 1984 and 1987 _
to put the policy into practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were a Nobel Prize for patience, it would be given to
Swiss women,'' Switzerland's president, Ruth Dreifuss, said in
launching a campaign for the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real maternity benefit for a young woman today,
even though it was promised to her grandmother,'' she said.
``Fifty-four years of waiting, that's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   She and the justice minister, Ruth Metzler _ neither of whom
have children _ have campaigned energetically for the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Among its opponents is a conservative, Veronique Fontana, a
mother and lawyer in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a family choice,'' she said in an interview. ``I worry
when people tell me this will make the difference whether they have
a child or not.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that most Swiss women are insured against income loss
after pregnancy and that welfare benefits are already generous.
</P>
<P>
   Some Swiss women already benefit from ample maternity plans. For
instance, the canton of Vaud, just east of Geneva, allows women 16
weeks of leave at full salary. According to government statistics,
employers in Switzerland provide maternity benefits totaling some
$225 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   But workplace conditions vary widely in Switzerland, where
federal statistics say that women are often paid up to 30 percent
less than men.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits' backers say the annual cost, estimated at $333
million, could be met from surplus government funds and a small
sales tax increase. Employers are fighting against the benefits,
arguing that they would add to labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, on Mother's Day, Ms. Dreifuss told a rally that
women should be able to become mothers without worrying about
money. Her call came two days after a poll indicated that most
voters favored increasing maternity support. Later polls have been
less definitive.

INDIA AND PAKISTAN DISCUSS BORDER CLASHES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI _ The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan met
Saturday for the first time since fighting broke out along their
border last month, but did not agree on ways to lessen tensions
between the two nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   India has asserted that insurgents who crossed into Indian
territory in the disputed Kashmir region are Islamic militants
supported by Pakistan and accompanied by Pakistani troops. Pakistan
denies the accusation and describes the insurgents as indigenous
fighters determined to free Kashmir and its mostly Muslim
population from Indian rule.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is the first confrontation between India and
Pakistan, who have fought three wars since gaining independence
from Britain in 1947, since both countries successfully tested
nuclear weapons last year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's meeting was welcomed as a sign that the fighting in
Kashmir is not likely to escalate into full-scale war.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh of India insisted
that Pakistan immediately arrange for the withdrawal of all
insurgents from Indian territory. He rejected what he said were
Pakistani suggestions that the border running through Kashmir is
unclear and needs to be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   According to his aides, Singh told his Pakistani counterpart,
Sartaj Aziz, that the border ``is well defined and well delineated
on authentic maps signed by military authorities of both
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of growing regional concern over the Kashmir
crisis, Aziz arrived in New Delhi after a one-day trip to China,
which he called ``a time-tested and steadfast friend of Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   The two foreign ministers met for about 70 minutes, and
afterward Aziz met for half an hour with Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee. Before the meetings began, Aziz said he regretted India's
decision to try dislodging the insurgents by force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope India would prefer dialogue rather than a military
option or a military solution to this escalation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy fighting is reportedly continuing in the rugged mountains
of Kashmir. Indian officers said their forces had recaptured a
strategic outcropping at Batalik in a seven-hour battle Friday that
cost the lives of 23 insurgents and 15 Indian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Reports in the Indian press said there was ``frenzied military
activity'' on several fronts as Indian troops sought to block new
efforts at infiltration from the Pakistani side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Angry demonstrators shouted epithets at Aziz as he arrived for
the talks Saturday. They reflected rising emotions here in the wake
of new accusations the government has made against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Singh said at a news conference on Friday that
the bodies of six Indian soldiers returned by Pakistan this week
showed signs of torture. He called the episode ``a reversion to
barbarous medievalism'' and said: ``I feel outraged, I feel
personally violated that the dignity of the Indian soldier has been
subjected to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan issued a statement rejecting the ``absurd allegation''
of torture and called it ``a crude attempt to malign Pakistan and
its armed forces.'' A Pakistani military spokesman said the six
Indians were killed last month ``while they were trying to make an
ingress into Pakistani territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indian authorities also released what they said were
transcripts of intercepted conversations between two of Pakistan's
top military commanders. The transcripts depict the officers
speaking as if they had full knowledge of the insurgents' operation
and were actively involved in planning it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire reason for the success of this operation was the
total secrecy,'' Gen. Mohammed Aziz, the chief of Pakistan's
general staff, was quoted as having told the army commander, Gen.
Parvez Musharraf, on May 29. ``So the priority is to accord
confidentiality to insure success.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Singh said Indian intelligence agencies had
approved release of the transcripts to ``pre-empt any designs that
Pakistan may be nurturing about obscuring the central issue of
their involvement, complicity and continued support of the an armed
intrusion and aggression in which Pakistani troops are
participating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmir dispute is increasingly stirring regional concern.
Aziz said that during his talks in Beijing, Chinese leaders had
assured him of their ``deep and abiding interest in and support for
the sovereignty, territorial integrity, independence and security
of Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent reference to China, a leading opposition figure
here, Mohan Prakash, asserted that the Kashmir intrusion was part
of a ``larger conspiracy'' and said, ``Some other countries are
engaged in a strategy of dividing the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Another opposition leader, Sonia Gandhi, visited hospitals in
Kashmir on Saturday. She told wounded soldiers that she was sure
their comrades would soon ``dislodge all Pakistani intruders from
Indian soil.''

A SOARING HOMICIDE RATE MOVES BRAZIL TO PROPOSE BAN ON GUNS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Colo.)   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Over the outraged protests of a nascent
gun lobby, a new state law prohibiting the sale of firearms has
gone into effect here. In Brasilia, President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso wants to go even further: His government has introduced
fast-track legislation that would completely ban the possession of
arms throughout this nation of 165 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In proportion to its population, Brazil has the world's highest
rate of homicides committed with guns, according to a U.N. study
published last year. But recent shootings around the country and
the school massacre in Littleton, Colo., have galvanized the
Brazilian government into pushing for what would be one of the most
restrictive gun control systems anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to offer an example to the entire world,'' Justice
Minister Renan Calheiros said in a telephone interview this week.
``We know that this will not entirely resolve the problem of
violence in Brazilian society. But it is a concrete and courageous
first step toward combating the problem, a radical measure that
shows we are serious about confronting the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the United States, this nation has a history of cowboys and
explorers pushing to open a rugged frontier. While government
records indicate that there are only two million legally registered
guns in Brazil, estimates of the number of unregistered weapons
range as high as 20 million, and in rural areas there is a strong
hunting tradition, more out of necessity than for sport.
</P>
<P>
   But large cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro suffer from
levels of violence even higher than those of American cities. In
1997, for instance, an average of 13 people were slain in Sao Paulo
every day, nearly 90 percent of them with guns, compared with fewer
than three a day in New York City, a bit more than half the size of
Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
   In an episode in April that particularly disturbed Brazilians
because it seemed to echo the Littleton massacre, a student in a
Sao Paulo suburb was killed by a stray bullet as she was leaving
classes. The gunman, who was not captured, had come to the school
to settle accounts with a group of girls who had quarreled with his
sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many other 14-year-old girls are going to have to die
before the government does something?'' a brother of the victim,
Jandira Martins, asked at her funeral, parts of which were
televised.
</P>
<P>
   Tulio Kahn, research director of the U.N.s' Latin American
Institute for Crime Prevention, said two things were driving the
effort to prohibit totally the possession and sale of arms in
Brazil. ``One is the shootings in the schools in the United
States,'' he said, ``and the other is that Fernando Henrique
Cardoso visited England in 1997 and returned impressed by the
rigorous system of gun control he saw there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rio de Janeiro State law, which went into effect on June 7,
prohibits the sale of guns and ammunition to anyone but police
officers and security companies. In a widely publicized ``blitz''
of stores that had been selling guns, the police even arrested a
lawyer who was trying to buy a new supply of bullets for a hand gun
he had at home.
</P>
<P>
   The federal legislation, which is expected to be voted on within
a month, is even more drastic. It would not only prohibit the sales
of arms throughout the country, but would also require gun owners
to turn over all firearms in their possession, including antiques.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which even opponents say they expect will pass, calls
for owners to be compensated, provided they surrender their weapons
within a one-year grace period. After that, carrying a firearm
would be a crime without bail and punishable by a jail sentence of
up to two years; airlines and bus companies that accept armed
passengers would be subject to fines of as much as $115,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is to deal with crime at its roots,'' Calheiros
said. ``We too have a problem of violence increasing in our
schools, but we also want to prevent the pointless violence that is
the cause of so many murders in Brazil: the traffic dispute, the
argument in a bar or soccer stadium, the gun a child finds in a
drawer.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure, however, maintain that it is a
demagogic exercise doomed to failure. Roberto Jefferson, a
congressman who says he will vote against the restrictions,
compared the effort to ``trying to promote morality and proper
behavior by prohibiting women from wearing bikinis on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Arruda, a spokesman for the newly formed National
Association of Gun Owners and Retailers, said, ``We don't have a
Second Amendment like you do in the U.S., but this proposal is
totally unconstitutional ... and we are going to challenge it in
the courts.''

HOW ONE ARIZONA DISTRICT PROFITS FROM CHARTER SCHOOLS

<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGLEY, Ariz. _ The transformation of the Higley Elementary
District, a tiny one-school district out where Phoenix's sprawl
gives way to cows and corn, began two years ago with an unlikely
plan to build a school whose central feature would be a hockey
rink.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had passed the nation's most liberal law authorizing
charter schools in 1994, and a Higley school board member who plays
ice hockey, knowing the huge demand for a rink time, thought it
would be great to start a new school, supported by taxpayers, that
offered figure-skating and hockey instruction.
</P>
<P>
   While the hockey school never materialized, those discussions
moved Higley's superintendent, Larry C. Likes, to another plan:
using the state's new law to earn money for his struggling district
by chartering schools throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in a striking illustration of how charter schools can
stir innovation in the most unexpected places, the Higley district
has one small elementary school for its own students and two dozen
charter schools scattered across Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Most states _ including New York, where the first charter
schools are to open in the fall _ are just beginning to grapple
with a future in which families will be able to choose among dozens
of public schools operating under charters that hold them to state
standards, but give them freedom to experiment and independence in
hiring and spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona is already living it. The state now has more than
300 charter schools, more than 70 in Phoenix alone, serving nearly
5 percent of all students.
</P>
<P>
   The schools are mushrooming all over, from the River of Life
Church in Phoenix to a concrete dome on a Navajo reservation. There
are charter schools for students at risk, for pregnant students,
for those who want back-to-basics curriculums, or performing arts.
Some are run by parents, some by experienced educators; some have
no certified teachers at all, and some are even run by companies
operating schools for profit.
</P>
<P>
   States differ widely in who can grant and oversee the charter,
or contract, for a new school. Arizona offers three options. Two
state boards award the overwhelming majority of charters.
</P>
<P>
   But any local district can also issue charters _ and that was
Higley's opportunity. Few districts have shown interest in
chartering schools, which they see as extra competition, extra work
and if a charter school fails, as some have, a source of negative
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   For Higley, issuing charters was an entrepreneurial act. The
district decided to raise money for its 260-pupil elementary school
by chartering schools and charging a percentage of their annual
budget for overseeing them.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one Higley charter schools opened their doors last fall,
four spent the year in planning, and this spring the district
granted five more charters. The schools earned Higley about
$350,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the hockey rink, some educators say, Likes may be
pushing the charter-school movement onto untested ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard what Higley was planning, we were concerned
about insuring quality,'' said the state superintendent of public
instruction, Lisa Graham Keegan, a strong advocate of school
choice. ``I called Larry and said, `Just make sure you have a way
to vet these schools.' But I think they have done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's debate over school choice and how the burgeoning
experiments with charters and vouchers will affect public
education, Likes is in a unique position _ squarely, positively, on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   As superintendent of a cash-strapped district, he understands
the challenges of public education, the budget issues, the
discipline problems, the difficulties of finding certified math
teachers. He has even lost students to two state-chartered schools
within his own district.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he is a powerful force in the charter
movement, responsible for an array of schools that siphon thousands
of students, and millions of dollars, from other districts. No
wonder that some education officials call Likes ``the charter
king,'' an honor somewhat akin to being President Ronald Reagan's
``welfare queen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most public schools are very anti-charter, so there's still
some bitterness,'' Likes said. ``I understand that, as a
superintendent. You don't want to lose students, and not have the
resources to expand your budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as someone in both worlds, I think public schools have to
get over thinking we can be all things to all people. There are a
lot of kids for whom public school just doesn't work, and I'm
tickled to see all the neat things the charters we've put out there
are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's large school districts may not be tickled, but they
are getting used to the new competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace has changed in Arizona, and it's a new ball
game,'' said James Zaharis, superintendent of the 71,000-student
Mesa School District, Arizona's largest, which has lost about 2,000
students to charter schools, including the Sequoia School, the
largest Higley charter. ``We all have to adapt and be responsive.
Larry's been very astute.''
</P>
<P>
   Likes described how he warmed to the idea of issuing charters to
earn money for school computers for his district:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was originally very reluctant. There had to be a revenue
stream or there was no reason to do it. I knew it would be a lot of
work, and I knew some districts that had gotten into chartering had
run into trouble, and the last thing we needed was negative
headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've been terribly cash-strapped for years, and if this
was a way to get us the technology we needed, I was willing to take
a look. When parents here asked why we were getting into this whole
charter thing, I told them it was to pay for our computers, and
they were satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   As word spread that Higley would consider granting charters,
both existing schools and groups looking to start new schools began
lining up for applications.
</P>
<P>
   Some chose Higley because of a quirk in the state law that
reimburses transportation costs differently for schools chartered
by local districts and schools chartered by a state board. The
state-chartered schools get a flat payment per student, while the
local districts are paid per mile, yielding more money for schools
whose students commute from far away.
</P>
<P>
   Other schools come for Likes' decades of education experience,
first in Illinois and then, since 1981, as a principal and business
manager in Arizona schools. ``Larry's been there, done that,'' said
Adele Ferrini, the director of the Learning Institute, a small
Phoenix school that features computer-assisted learning for at-risk
students.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferrini formerly taught at the large public high school in
Tempe and created the Learning Institute precisely to help the kind
of students she said fell through the cracks there. She got her
original charter from another district, but switched to Higley this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have questions,'' Ms. Ferrini said, ``you're calling
someone else who's in the trenches with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Likes requires Higley-chartered schools to work with a private
accounting firm, which oversees their budgets and payrolls. He
requires representatives of each school to attend four meetings a
year, and he visits the schools, though in the first year he got
through only one round of visits because the schools are so far
flung. Next year he is hoping to hire someone to help him.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Institute, in what used to be warehouse space in
back of a biodegradable cleaning-solvent business, consists of a
couple of computer labs, a couple of meeting rooms, and nothing
much that looks like a classroom. Each student is assessed upon
entering the school, and from then on, spends about half of each
day at the computer, choosing from a menu of individualized
lessons. During a recent visit, one young man was multiplying
fractions, while at the next computer a younger girl did a
punctuation drill, then a geography lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Adults circulate, ready to help whenever a young person is
stymied, bored, or just in need of a change of pace. While there
are no traditional periods, the day is broken up by classes in
``life skills,'' art and karate. Some students come in the morning,
others in the afternoon, and each follows a different program,
reflecting skills and interests.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Nepa, a parent who works at the school, said it had
been a blessing for her boys, Justin and Cody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep school a challenge if you're trying to teach
the same thing to 30 kids, who all go at different paces,'' Ms.
Nepa said. ``Here there's not the peer pressure or the competition,
because there's no expectation that everyone should be at the same
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferrini, an experienced educator, calls Higley only rarely.
But Likes receives calls nearly every day from the founder of the
Phoenix Academy for the Performing Arts, Don Haynes, a retired US
West technician with no education background.
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning, the query was whether or not the academy,
whose principal left midyear, should expand to full-day
kindergarten next year.
</P>
<P>
   In Higley, Likes listened to the question, leaned back and
advised caution: ``You know, Don, just because you decide to offer
all-day kindergarten, the kids' attention span doesn't get any
longer. You have to think about what you're going to do about a nap
and what you're going to do with them all afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Higley charter in Phoenix, Westland School, existed as a
small family-oriented private school _ run by volunteers who
charged minimal tuition _ before the charter law. For Westland,
which has 230 students and a long waiting list, the law offered a
chance at receiving state money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kathy Couch, a mother of eight who runs the school, said
the staff decided to wait out the first year, concerned that state
financing would carry too many restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In Westland's portable classrooms and trailers, students of
different ages, backgrounds and achievement levels mix easily, and
it is not uncommon to see an older student helping in the
kindergarten or a teacher's 3-year old playing in the sixth-grade
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Ferrini's school is high-tech and computer-based, Ms.
Couch's is more ``The Waltons.'' Most of the teachers have children
attending the school, and the Couch family is much in evidence. The
sheer variety of the charters is the whole point, Likes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tell them how to run things,'' he said. ``These
schools can try out their ideas, and anyone who doesn't like them
doesn't have to go there.''

`SUPERMAX' ISOLATES THE `WORSE OF THE WORST' FROM FEDERAL PRISONS

 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Colo. _ Holding 378 of the nation's most dangerous
prisoners here, the ``Alcatraz of the Rockies'' is as quiet as a
monastery.
</P>
<P>
   Walking down an empty, fluorescent-lit hallway, a visitor does
not hear shouts called across cellblocks, prisoners banging on
bars, or even the murmur of a radio.
</P>
<P>
   In this bland beige building that looks like a corporate campus
at the foot of the Wet Mountains, the federal Bureau of Prisons
seeks to modify violent prisoners by entombing them in isolation
cells for up to 23 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Known officially as the Administrative Maximum Facility but
locally as Super Max, the prison has won national attention for its
``bomber wing,'' a unit that keeps under multiple locks and keys
Timothy J. McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, Theodore J.
Kaczynski, the Unabomber, and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the mastermind of
the World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But the real work is with the ``worst of the worst'' from the
100,000 inmates of the federal prison system. Of the men sent here,
in what officials call a control unit prison, 35 percent have
committed murder in prison, 41 percent have tried to escape, and 85
percent have committed assaults in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is behavior that gets you in here, and behavior that will
get you out,'' Blake R. Davis, executive assistant to the warden,
said, explaining the ``step down'' program designed to return
cooperative prisoners back to normal prisons in three years.
</P>
<P>
   After four and half years of operation, the $60 million prison
has proved successful, Davis said. Almost 75 prisoners have
graduated from the prison. By concentrating highly violent
prisoners here, prison violence has dropped across the federal
prison system.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, well-behaved prisoners can, in their third
year, earn the right to be out of their cells for 14 hours a day,
to eat meals in a prison cafeteria, and to work making chair seats
in a prison factory.
</P>
<P>
   About 57 maximum security units in 42 states now hold about 1
percent of the nation's 1.8 million prisoners, according to the
National Campaign to Stop Control Unit Prisons, a group opposed to
the use of solitary confinement. Started about 15 years ago, these
prisons largely restrict prisoners to their cells 23 hours a day,
and allow a prisoner to move outside the cell only with leg irons,
handcuffs and an escort of two or three guards.
</P>
<P>
   Here, movement is regulated by 1,400 electronically-controlled
gates and watched over by 168 television monitors. With almost one
prison employee for each prisoner, it costs about $50,000 a year to
incarcerate a prisoner here, far higher than the average cost in
other prisons.
</P>
<P>
   To Angela Davis, a group member who protested outside this
maximum security prison shortly after it opened, control unit
prisons are throwbacks to penitentiaries of the early 19th century
where a prisoner was locked in a stone cell with a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic because the penitentiary system began in the early
1800s with solitary confinement as a rehabilitative strategy, an
alternative to corporal punishment,'' said Ms. Davis, a history
professor at University of California at Santa Cruz. ``The
etymology of the word penitentiary is `penitence.' Prison was seen
as a way to be in touch with God. It was a silent regimen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis said the psychological effects of isolation are the
same, whether for a prisoner in 19th century cell, or for a
prisoner here, locked in a suicide-proofed cell, watching anger
management classes on a black and white television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles Dickens visited penitentiaries and saw that it created
the worst kind of mental illness to hold people in isolation for
many, many years,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis, the prison spokesman, said that the average prisoner
here talks to about 10 people a day, including his case manager and
his counselor. Asked about the mental impact of isolation, he said,
``We have no evidence to show that people are deteriorating.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence K. Feitell, lawyer for one inmate, Luis Felipe, the
leader of the Latin Kings gang in New York, retorted, ``Receiving
food through a slot, handed out by a prison guard, I don't consider
that contact.''
</P>
<P>
   The isolation has taken a toll on Felipe, the lawyer said. ``He
has retreated into himself, that is where the destruction of his
personality is taking place,'' Feitell said from New York. ``He has
deteriorated to the extent where he prefers to stay in his cell. He
takes no recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with two prisoners here yielded different views on
the isolation system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prolonged isolation is the worst punishment you can put on a
human being,'' said Raymond Luc Levasseur, who has served 10 years
of a 45-year sentence for his involvement in a left-wing bombing
campaign around New York in the 1970s. ``The common denominator
among prisoners is rage, pent-up anger, frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people stay in their cells, and they won't come out for
recreation,'' he said. ``They get anti-social. They get jumpy, get
enraged when they deal with people.''
</P>
<P>
   While Levasseur, 52, expects to graduate to a less-restrictive
prison this year, Charles Voyde Harrelson, 61, the father of the
actor Woody Harrelson, is serving two consecutive life sentences
for murdering a federal judge 20 years ago. ``I don't care to leave
here to go to another penitentiary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't particularly dislike my own company and I do like the
peace and quiet,'' said Harrelson, whose son is seeking to win a
new trial for him. Noting that the last prison he was in had ``no
shower in the room and a lot of noise,'' he added, ``Peace and
quiet here is paramount for people like me who like to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for people who can't read and write it must be pure
hell,'' continued Harrelson, who had swung his bulky, jumpsuited
frame on a table to better hear a visitor's voice, distorted by a
microphone. ``They designed this place for sensory deprivation.
It's an Orwellian experience.''
</P>
<P>
   From their cell windows, prisoners can only see a patch of sky.
But in recreation pens, some prisoners can get a reminder that they
are in Colorado. Bernard V. Kleiman, lawyer for Yousef, the Trade
Center bomber, said: ``They can look up and see the sky. If they go
to one end and look at an angle, they can see the mountains.''

STUDY FINDS RESEGREGATION IN U.S. SCHOOLS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Kan., Mass., R.I., Wis., Fla., Okla., Md., Del.)  By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forty-five years after the Supreme Court ruling Brown vs. Board
of Education forced the desegregation of the nation's schools, a
process of school resegregation is advancing across the country,
especially for blacks in the South and for Hispanic Americans
everywhere, according to a new Harvard University study.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Harvard Graduate School of Education's Civil
Rights Project found that at a time when nonwhites represent a
rapidly growing segment of the school-age population, their contact
with whites in school has been diminishing yearly for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the researchers found, there is a close correlation
between school districts with few whites and those with high rates
of poverty, which is linked to lower educational achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Resegregation in American Schools'' by Gary
Orfield, a Harvard professor of education, and John T. Yun, a
doctoral candidate in education at Harvard, places the blame for
the shift on court decisions freeing school districts from
desegregation orders and growing public indifference to the role of
education in racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are clearly in a period,'' the report says, ``when many
policymakers, courts and opinion makers assume that desegregation
is no longer necessary, or that it will be accomplished somehow
without need of any deliberate plan. Polls show that most white
Americans believe that equal educational opportunity is being
provided. National political leaders have largely ignored the
growth of segregation in the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Chester E. Finn, Jr., a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute
and a prominent conservative voice on education, said the study
made him feel like he was living in a time warp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Orfield must be the only American who still thinks that
integration for its own sake is an important societal goal,'' Finn
said. ``Almost everybody else is interested in whether kids are
going to good schools where they are safe and learning to read. The
price of forced busing and other forms of social engineering is too
high to pay when there are more urgent crises facing this country's
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is the latest in a series issued since the 1970s by
Orfield and various colleagues. The two most recent ones, in 1995
and 1997, noted the start of the resegregation trend that he now
says has advanced to a dangerous point.
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on data from the U. S. Bureau of the Census and
the federal government's National Center for Education Statistics,
says that the shift is occurring as the Hispanic share of the
school population has risen 218 percent, the black portion has
grown by a fifth and the white share has decreased by a sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern in the South is most noteworthy, the report said.
Until the early 1960s, no blacks attended schools that were
majority white and then the number rose rapidly so that in 1988,
43.5 percent of black students in the South attended majority white
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The trend then began reversing after a shift in the political
and judicial climates of the 1980s. By the 1996-97 school year, the
last year for which there are data, the portion of southern blacks
in majority white schools had dropped to 34.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern has been reflected across the country. Most states
with substantial black enrollments increased integration in the
1970s, but showed a rise in segregation between the mid-1980s and
1996. The largest increases in segregation occurred in Rhode
Island, Wisconsin, Florida, Oklahoma, Maryland, Delaware and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic Americans, who are soon to become the largest minority
group in the country, attend the most severely segregated schools,
the report says. In 1996-97, three quarters attended schools with
over 50 percent nonwhite student populations, up from 64.3 percent
in 1968-69.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that while Hispanic-and African-Americans were
moving increasingly out of major cities into suburbs, those suburbs
were also heavily segregated with average nonwhite enrollments of
between 60 and 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whites are described in the report as the most isolated. On
average, white students attend schools with classmates who are 81
percent white.
</P>
<P>
   The animus behind the 1954 Brown decision was that schools could
not be separate and equal. Yet, the report says, the nation is now
headed to a system that ignores that contradiction. It argues that
the Clinton administration has done nothing to stop the trend and
calls on it to lead a counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   It concludes, ``We are floating back toward an educational
pattern that has never in the nation's history produced equal and
successful schools. There is no good evidence that it will work
now.''

TERM LIMITS IN MICHIGAN SHIFTS POWER AND REVERSES ROLES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Mary Ann Middaugh had been an aide in the Michigan
Statehouse for a quarter-century when her husband, state Rep. James
Middaugh, was forced out of office after 16 years by the state's
term limits law. Middaugh left last year, but she stayed: After
all, she won the race to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   The other 63 who lost their Michigan House seats last year when
the 1992 term limits law took effect have landed all over the
political map. Several are in local political posts _ sheriffs or
judges or county commissioners _ and many have gone back to being
the teachers or lawyers they were before they were first elected.
Some moved to different buildings in Lansing, the state capital,
where they were appointed by the governor to state jobs, became
lobbyists or took jobs as aides to those still in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kinds of funny things have happened with term limits,''
said Ken R. Sikkema, who in 12 years rose to be House Republican
leader and then was tossed out by term limits. He successfully ran
for an open state Senate seat, and now he is a freshman senator who
can serve until 2006, when term limits will force him out of that
office, too.
</P>
<P>
   Term limit fever swept across the country in the 1990s, with
advocates calling for an end to the near-permanent political
careers of those who had lost touch with their constituents. The
Michigan law, passed as a ballot initiative in 1992, limits
legislators to three two-year terms in the House and two four-year
terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on both sides of the issue agree it is too soon to tell
what the effects of the limits will be on a national scale. But
here in Michigan, where the House found itself with a freshman
membership of 58 percent last year, and the Senate will see a
turnover of at least 84 percent in a few years, the consequences
are beginning to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant is a kind of role reversal, with
institutional memory and power flowing from elected legislators to
other people who have been around longer: staff members, state
bureaucrats, the governor, lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Many freshmen ``don't know and they don't know that they don't
know'' how to get things done, said state Sen. John J.H. Schwarz, a
Republican from Battle Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Term limits are going to make lions out of lobbyists, and the
good lobbyists don't like that,'' said Schwarz, who after 16 years
will be turned out by term limits in 2002, when he plans to go back
to his district and resume practicing medicine. ``They don't think
they should be the trainers of last resort'' for new legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Lt. Gov. Dick Posthumus, said they thought term
limits had had a positive effect. Posthumus was a Republican state
senator from the Grand Rapids area for 16 years until Gov. John
Engler named him lieutenant governor last year. His appointment
made room for Sikkema to move to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see legislators coming in wanting to move their agenda
quicker,'' Posthumus said. ``The pace is a little quicker and the
quality of the new legislators coming in has actually improved.''
</P>
<P>
   W. Frank Fountain, senior vice president for government affairs
at the DaimlerChrysler Corp., the big automaker, said he had been
impressed by the caliber of the freshmen. ``We were all afraid of
what term limits were going to do to the Legislature,'' Fountain
said. ``I don't think the Legislature has missed a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Others think the term limits have had mixed results _ good in
the short term and bad in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those swept out of the Statehouse by term limits needed
to move on, said Mario L. Morrow, a Detroit political consultant.
``A lot of them had lost touch with the reality of their
constituents, and their ideas were old ideas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term effects could be problematic, Morrow said.
``What do legislators need when they first come to Lansing?
Knowledge, understanding and money, and the lobbyists have all
three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether good or bad, what happened in the Michigan House in the
1998 elections is likely to be repeated soon in the Senate, where
at least 32 of the 38 senators will be freshmen after the 2002
election, the first time incumbent senators will feel the sting of
term limits. This year, 64 of the 110 House members are freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits used to be rare, but have become common in recent
years. In 1990, just three states had term-limit laws. Now, 21
states have similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   Mark P. Petracca, chairman of the political science department
at the University of California at Irvine, said it was too early to
tell the full impact of term limits, which he favors. But Petracca
said that in California, where in 1990 voters passed term limits
that took effect in 1996, more candidates are running, there are
fewer uncontested primaries and general elections, and the margins
between winners and losers has shrunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Term limits have led to more competitive elections for the
state Legislature,'' Petracca said. ``That there may be other
negative consequences is without a doubt, but competitive elections
are pretty important for making accountability possible and
responsiveness possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause, the public-affairs lobbying organization that has
long opposed term limits, agrees that competitive elections are
good, but argues that term limits are not the way to get them. ``We
just don't see that term limits is going to create something
better,'' said Edwin H. Davis, director for state issues at Common
Cause. ``The better solution is to make sure that the elections are
more competitive'' by changing the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of the limits in Michigan, Sikkema said, is that
legislators spend more time raising money to compete in the
contested elections.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, freshmen legislators face a steep learning curve.
``We can see right now the difference between the experience of the
House and the Senate,'' said Sarah L. Hubbard, a lobbyist for the
Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many members of the Republican-led House lack the
experience and know-how to push their own agenda through, they
often look to Gov. John Engler, a Republican, for guidance, Ms.
Hubbard said. Because there are so many new members, it is hard to
predict how they will vote on issues, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is more work for lobbyists, Ms. Hubbard disputes
the notion that they have more influence. ``So far we're
frustrated,'' Ms. Hubbard said, because there are so many new
legislators to get to know.
</P>
<P>
   Some expect that voters will be asked to extend the term limits
to 12 years in both the House and Senate, to give new legislators a
longer time to learn their jobs before leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Many incumbents who now face term limits support that extension.
</P>
<P>
   Burton Leland, who spent 18 years representing Detroit in the
House before term limits ended his time there, laments the loss of
institutional knowledge and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be experts who will know a lot about a
particular subject,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Leland defeated an incumbent state senator, and now
he is one of the longest-serving legislators in Lansing. ``I'm one
of the last of the Mohicans,'' Leland said.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. In 2006, he will be forced from his Senate seat by
term limits.

<P>
   For the last eight years, the United States' economic boom,
which has made so many Americans rich and self-confident, has been
noteworthy for those it has left out: the people at the bottom of
the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, that's changed. Unemployment rates among blacks and
Hispanic people, though still high compared with that for whites,
are at or near record lows. Joblessness among high school dropouts
has fallen to about half the rate in 1992. And wages for the lowest
paid are rising faster than inflation for the first time in
decades.
</P>
<P>
   That's important because the last generation produced an
underclass of people so poor, discouraged and alienated that they
were thought to exist almost outside the general economy. The
conventional wisdom has been that the country could get richer or
poorer, and the number of jobs could rise or fall, but a large
swath of the poor would be left out.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently that wisdom held true, but now prosperity is
trickling down to the underclass. Imagine that the economy
continues to flourish. The question then becomes how far down the
ladder economic benefits will reach. Economists aren't sure, but
they are gathering statistical tidbits, tossing in some educated
hunches and producing some interesting predictions, however
tentative.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the nation's stunning 4.2 percent unemployment rate,
which is lower than at any time since the late 1960s, when the
economy was artificially buoyed by government spending on the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps overall unemployment cannot fall much more, no matter
how tight the labor market becomes. The number of workers who are
temporarily unemployed appears to have been squeezed to a minimum.
And many of the long-term unemployed _ those who persistently look
for work but can't find it _ will remain unattractive to employers
no matter how big the boom.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another category of people, including single
mothers and young black men with few skills and little education,
who appear willing to seize the new opportunities that a robust
economy is creating.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the best economic conditions, there are people who
are temporarily out of work. At any moment, some workers quit their
jobs. Others get fired. Students and spouses leave school and home
to find their first jobs. All these people need time to find
attractive jobs. Economists call this frictional unemployment and
say it is a necessary feature of labor markets and nothing to fret
about.
</P>
<P>
   In the supercharged economy of the 1960s, about 2 percent of the
labor force was unemployed for fewer than five weeks. Today the
percentage is about the same. So perhaps the time between jobs for
qualified workers has contracted as much as it can, suggesting that
further economic growth will produce little additional employment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hall of Stanford University, after studying business
cycles and current unemployment data, has concluded, ``Anyone who
wants a job and is plausibly attractive to employers can find a job
within a half-dozen weeks of searching.'' This may sound cavalier,
given the fact that about 5 million people say they can't find
suitable work. But economists across the political spectrum share
Hall's view.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the long-term unemployed _ those who can't get
hired even in the tightest labor markets. These people may be
poorly educated, or have spotty work records or a history of crime.
They may live in urban areas too far from suburban jobs for which
they might qualify.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many of the long-term unemployed would find
work if the economy continues to prosper. In the late 1960s, about
0.2 percent of the work force was unemployed for six months or
more. Today the figure is three times as high. This suggests that a
healthy economy alone may be incapable of reducing long-term
unemployment to the levels achieved in the 1960s. This group might
need other kinds of help like government-provided training or
subsidized jobs, though the record of such programs is hardly
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   But if statistics for the temporary and long-term unemployed
suggest that joblessness may have been driven as low as it can go,
another jobless category appears to hold promise: the non-employed.
</P>
<P>
   This group includes all the unemployed plus those who don't
bother looking for work and thus aren't counted among the jobless.
These people may choose not to work, or may be physically or
mentally incapable of holding jobs. Or they may be discouraged from
seeking work because employers constantly reject their applications
or because they are offered inadequate wages.
</P>
<P>
   Among men aged 25 to 55, the non-employment rate is about 11
percent, compared with about 6 percent during the 1960s. Since
there is no strong evidence that the rate of physical and mental
disability has risen, it's worth asking whether the extra 5
percentage points _ several million people _ can be helped by a
growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Topel and Kevin Murphy of the University of Chicago think
so. They say that most of those who dropped out of the labor force
since the 1960s were low-skilled workers who gave up looking for
jobs, because of plummeting wages.
</P>
<P>
   Among men without a college education, wages have fallen about
25 percent over the past 25 years after inflation is taken into
account. But for the last two years wages for these workers have
risen by 2 percent or 3 percent after inflation. Further economic
expansion could bring a continued rise in pay and an attractive
alternative for millions who have left the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Other economists are more skeptical. A recent study by Richard
Freeman of Harvard University and William Rodgers III of the
College of William and Mary found that even in areas of the country
with very tight labor markets, overall non-employment rates barely
budged throughout the 1990s. That might suggest that relatively few
nonworking Americans would be drawn to work by an expanding
economy.

   And Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution notes that income

insurance payments, are much higher now than in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Freeman-Rodgers study cites one group that has made
significant gains in tight labor markets: young black men without a
college education, whose non-employment rate fell from 48 percent
to 36 percent between 1992 and 1998. Though adult men barely
registered gains in employment or earnings in the regions with
tight labor markets, the earnings of young men _ including blacks
without a college education _ rose by about 10 percent.

   Burtless points to another disadvantaged group that has been

rate fell from 43 percent to 31 percent from 1992 to 1998. Burtless
says that sharp improvement is a result in part of welfare reform
but also of a healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one encouraging reading of the tea leaves, even if it's
unlikely that overall unemployment will dip much further: Those
groups in the worst economic shape _ unskilled young black men and
single mothers _ respond well to tight labor markets and would
benefit from future economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   And economists note that as more young black men and single
mothers are absorbed into the labor force, they will gain work
experience that will prove attractive to future employers and help
them weather the next recession.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy has started to do for these groups what
government training programs have not accomplished: provide
substantially higher earnings and employment. And if the economic
boom continues for a few years, there is a chance it will do
wonders for the disadvantaged workers who need help the most.

TWO VIEWS OF INHUMANITY SPLIT THE WORLD

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was a signal week for the West, no doubt about it.
Fifty-four long years after the Holocaust revelations, the United
States and Europe had finally said ``enough,'' and struck a blow
against a revival of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian ethnic cleansers were now routed; ethnic Albanians would
be spared further murders and rapes. Germany was exorcising a few
of its Nazi ghosts. Human rights had been elevated to a military
priority and a pre-eminent Western value.
</P>
<P>
   There was so much to applaud _ European unity, American
technology, British spine, the stiff upper lips of the Greeks and
Italians _ that it was easy to overlook the fact that much of the
world was sitting on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, flush with victory over communism and inhumanity,
think ever more reflexively that their values are the world's. In
economics, that often is true. But to many other nations, the
Kosovo atrocities that Germany equated with its own past and
President Clinton labeled ``vicious'' and ``terrifying'' were just
the broken eggs of yet another national omelet, and the West was a
self-righteous, ever-more-meddlesome cook.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the nations that see Kosovo this way is Russia, and
that is hardly a harbinger of smooth sailing in future efforts to
right moral wrongs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   True, Russia joined the diplomatic effort to force a Serbian
retreat from Kosovo, giving that effort the final push that allowed
78 days of bombing to end. And afterward, it ostentatiously
insisted on a role in the peacekeeping that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the same thing as saying Russia shares the
West's view that Kosovo is a turning point away from ethnic blood
baths and toward harmony, even if at Western gunpoint. Quite the
opposite: The war only underscored the deep ideological divide
between an idealistic New World bent on ending inhumanity and an
Old World equally fatalistic about unending conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson tried to bridge that gap 81 years ago at
Versailles, and failed. These days, his faith in internationalist
ideals seems to be shared _ at least in their own back yard _ by
the same British, French and Germans who were that day's
nationalist cynics.
</P>
<P>
   Go much beyond Central Europe, however, and the world still
seems rooted at Versailles, dismissing the notion of universal
human rights as wonderful in concept, and a foolish vanity in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   So the anti-West club is a big one _ not just perennial bad
actors like Syria, Libya and Iraq, but rivals like China and even
democracies like Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
   They are not motivated by love for Slobodan Milosevic _ by and
large, they also find him and his tactics repulsive _ but by a
conviction that bloodlettings like the one in Kosovo are internal
matters; that it's arrogant and foolish to thrust yourself into
someone else's war; that the safe and even humane course for the
world usually is to let the two sides duke it out alone.
</P>
<P>
   Put baldly, there is also a yawning gap between the West and
much of the world on the value of a single life. Much of the world
is still Hobbesian, looking to strongmen to impose order on lives
that are nasty, brutish and short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the concept that the state as an entity is much more
important than the life of one human being,'' said Yevgenia Albats,
an author and independent journalist who writes about human rights
issues here. ``Pinochet is a hero in the press here. For a lot of
writers, the fact that he killed 100,000 people before Chile had
its economic miracle is just not a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The West finds such views alien. But this war's epiphany may be
that a lot of people around the world who drink Guinness, buy IBM
preferred and drive Audis just don't buy into Western notions of
rights and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Russians, who by temperament, history and current
attitudes are proving themselves the great case study for such
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only different countries; we're living in different
dimensions,'' Leonid Dobrokhotov, an informal adviser to the
Russian Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, said in a recent
interview. ``We have a completely different understanding of
values. We're a very independent-minded people. Yes, maybe Saddam
Hussein is the wrong guy. But let him live in his own country. If
the Iraqis like it, it's their business. If they want to take him
away and hang him, it's also their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has absorbed this ideological slap in the face
before, most recently from the Chinese. But the United States
expects rebuffs from dictatorships like China. It is those
new-found democrats, the Russians, who brought the message home in
capital letters by turning overnight from ideological soulmates to
embittered critics.
</P>
<P>
   The first, most familiar explanation was that the Russians are
the historic big Slavic brother to the Serbs. But that is only part
of the story, and maybe not a big part. Moscow and Belgrade, after
all, were estranged for most of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   No, more is at play here. In the words of the Russian government
_ and in the minds of many ordinary Russians _ it was NATO, not the
Milosevic regime, that was a criminal organization, and NATO's air
war, not ethnic cleansing, that was a humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Russian backlash is rooted in part in Moscow's
frustration at having to stand idly by at the drubbing of a country
in its own back yard by its former enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But for Americans to view Moscow's anger as purely a political
temper tantrum would be as mistaken as it is for Russians to view
Kosovo as a Western land grab. For the truth is that Russians see
Milosevic and Kosovo through an entirely different lens from the
United States and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic cleansing and forced migration are not exactly unknowns
to Russians. Pogroms forced 1.5 million Russian Jews to flee at the
turn of the century. And Nikita Khrushchev forcibly moved so many
Russians to Kazakhstan that by 1959 native Kazakhs made up less
than a third of the population.
</P>
<P>
   From Stalin on, Soviet policy was to dilute the Soviet Union's
80-odd ethnic groups by moving Russian citizens onto their
territories, evicting them from homelands and drawing borders so as
to split large ethnic groups in two.
</P>
<P>
   Those carefully planned policies went south when the Soviet
Union began to collapse, and nationalist strongmen began to take
control. In 1988, U.N. officials say, a half-million Armenians and
Azerbaijanis were driven back to homelands in each others' nations.
In 1989, 60,000 Meskhetian Turks were forced out of Uzbekistan and
Kyrgyzstan. In 1992 the Ossetians threw out tens of thousands of
Inguish; hundreds of thousands of Tajiks fled Tajikistan. In 1995
scores of thousands died in a civil war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russians rapidly _ and correctly _ point out that these frenzies
of ethnic retribution went virtually unnoticed by ordinary
Westerners, and drew little more than hand-wringing from Western
governments. And they wonder what is so different about Yugoslavia.

   ``Look at the leaders of almost all the newly independent
states,'' said Sergei Rogov, the director of the government's
Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada. ``Like Milosevic, they used to
be leaders of the Communist Party before the collapse of
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you look at how they treat the ethnic minorities in the
newly independent states, you'll see that Milosevic fits the
pattern,'' he added. ``He's not perceived as something
outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Western Europe he is. Of course part of that is because
Serbia is so close. Even as he declared victory on Thursday,
Clinton added a caveat to the lessons of Kosovo for future ethnic
cleansers: The world will act, he said, when ``we can do something
about it.'' But here, too, even more is at play.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat, democratization and integration into Europe brought the
Germans full circle. Unchecked slaughter in Bosnia and Rwanda
shamed their neighbors into action. And now Western Europe has no
stomach to watch Milosevic revive the bad memories, setting off
ethnic expulsion and slaughters to consolidate the power of Serbs
who don't like their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Is that a step forward or a foolish vanity? Kosovo will be safe
for Albanians, it seems, which is what 78 days of bombing were all
about.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody knows how many will return. Milosevic remains
entrenched in Belgrade. Russia, burning at the popular notion that
it has been a shill for NATO, is balking at Western efforts to
oversee peacekeeping. And there is a new danger that radical
Albanians will exact revenge on ordinary Serbs, starting the cycle
anew.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the Old World argument _ everyone does it, the world
works this way, a few thousand Serbs or Albanians aren't important,
it's none of our business _ seem almost attractive, even logical.
It is not hard to envision the Russians nodding and saying, ``Told
you so.''
</P>
<P>
   Better to remember, however, that in attitude, if not behavior,
Russia today is roughly where Britain, Germany and France were 81
years ago. It took World War II to change the West's mind about
inhumanity, and 50 years more to make that change of mind a
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Albats, the journalist, says her nation needs time, too.
``This is still imperial Russia,'' she said. ``It's still the
Soviet Union. The generation ruling this nation grew up in the
Soviet Union, and you can't expect people to change their minds the
way you change a rule on private property. But another generation
is coming.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ It was a signal week for the West, no doubt about it.
Fifty-four long years after the Holocaust revelations, the United
States and Europe had finally said ``enough,'' and struck a blow
against a revival of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian ethnic cleansers were now routed; ethnic Albanians would
be spared further murders and rapes. Germany was exorcising a few
of its Nazi ghosts. Human rights had been elevated to a military
priority and a pre-eminent Western value.
</P>
<P>
   There was so much to applaud _ European unity, American
technology, British spine, the stiff upper lips of the Greeks and
Italians _ that it was easy to overlook the fact that much of the
world was sitting on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, flush with victory over communism and inhumanity,
think ever more reflexively that their values are the world's. In
economics, that often is true. But to many other nations, the
Kosovo atrocities that Germany equated with its own past and
President Clinton labeled ``vicious'' and ``terrifying'' were just
the broken eggs of yet another national omelet, and the West was a
self-righteous, ever-more-meddlesome cook.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the nations that see Kosovo this way is Russia, and
that is hardly a harbinger of smooth sailing in future efforts to
right moral wrongs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   True, Russia joined the diplomatic effort to force a Serbian
retreat from Kosovo, giving that effort the final push that allowed
78 days of bombing to end. And afterward, it ostentatiously
insisted on a role in the peacekeeping that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the same thing as saying Russia shares the
West's view that Kosovo is a turning point away from ethnic blood
baths and toward harmony, even if at Western gunpoint. Quite the
opposite: The war only underscored the deep ideological divide
between an idealistic New World bent on ending inhumanity and an
Old World equally fatalistic about unending conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson tried to bridge that gap 81 years ago at
Versailles, and failed. These days, his faith in internationalist
ideals seems to be shared _ at least in their own back yard _ by
the same British, French and Germans who were that day's
nationalist cynics.
</P>
<P>
   Go much beyond Central Europe, however, and the world still
seems rooted at Versailles, dismissing the notion of universal
human rights as wonderful in concept, and a foolish vanity in
practice.
</P>
<P>
   So the anti-West club is a big one _ not just perennial bad
actors like Syria, Libya and Iraq, but rivals like China and even
democracies like Russia and India.
</P>
<P>
   They are not motivated by love for Slobodan Milosevic _ by and
large, they also find him and his tactics repulsive _ but by a
conviction that bloodlettings like the one in Kosovo are internal
matters; that it's arrogant and foolish to thrust yourself into
someone else's war; that the safe and even humane course for the
world usually is to let the two sides duke it out alone.
</P>
<P>
   Put baldly, there is also a yawning gap between the West and
much of the world on the value of a single life. Much of the world
is still Hobbesian, looking to strongmen to impose order on lives
that are nasty, brutish and short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the concept that the state as an entity is much more
important than the life of one human being,'' said Yevgenia Albats,
an author and independent journalist who writes about human rights
issues here. ``Pinochet is a hero in the press here. For a lot of
writers, the fact that he killed 100,000 people before Chile had
its economic miracle is just not a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The West finds such views alien. But this war's epiphany may be
that a lot of people around the world who drink Guinness, buy IBM
preferred and drive Audis just don't buy into Western notions of
rights and responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Russians, who by temperament, history and current
attitudes are proving themselves the great case study for such
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not only different countries; we're living in different
dimensions,'' Leonid Dobrokhotov, an informal adviser to the
Russian Communist Party leader, Gennady Zyuganov, said in a recent
interview. ``We have a completely different understanding of
values. We're a very independent-minded people. Yes, maybe Saddam
Hussein is the wrong guy. But let him live in his own country. If
the Iraqis like it, it's their business. If they want to take him
away and hang him, it's also their business.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has absorbed this ideological slap in the face
before, most recently from the Chinese. But the United States
expects rebuffs from dictatorships like China. It is those
new-found democrats, the Russians, who brought the message home in
capital letters by turning overnight from ideological soulmates to
embittered critics.
</P>
<P>
   The first, most familiar explanation was that the Russians are
the historic big Slavic brother to the Serbs. But that is only part
of the story, and maybe not a big part. Moscow and Belgrade, after
all, were estranged for most of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   No, more is at play here. In the words of the Russian government
_ and in the minds of many ordinary Russians _ it was NATO, not the
Milosevic regime, that was a criminal organization, and NATO's air
war, not ethnic cleansing, that was a humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Russian backlash is rooted in part in Moscow's
frustration at having to stand idly by at the drubbing of a country
in its own back yard by its former enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But for Americans to view Moscow's anger as purely a political
temper tantrum would be as mistaken as it is for Russians to view
Kosovo as a Western land grab. For the truth is that Russians see
Milosevic and Kosovo through an entirely different lens from the
United States and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic cleansing and forced migration are not exactly unknowns
to Russians. Pogroms forced 1.5 million Russian Jews to flee at the
turn of the century. And Nikita Khrushchev forcibly moved so many
Russians to Kazakhstan that by 1959 native Kazakhs made up less
than a third of the population.
</P>
<P>
   From Stalin on, Soviet policy was to dilute the Soviet Union's
80-odd ethnic groups by moving Russian citizens onto their
territories, evicting them from homelands and drawing borders so as
to split large ethnic groups in two.
</P>
<P>
   Those carefully planned policies went south when the Soviet
Union began to collapse, and nationalist strongmen began to take
control. In 1988, U.N. officials say, a half-million Armenians and
Azerbaijanis were driven back to homelands in each others' nations.
In 1989, 60,000 Meskhetian Turks were forced out of Uzbekistan and
Kyrgyzstan. In 1992 the Ossetians threw out tens of thousands of
Inguish; hundreds of thousands of Tajiks fled Tajikistan. In 1995
scores of thousands died in a civil war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russians rapidly _ and correctly _ point out that these frenzies
of ethnic retribution went virtually unnoticed by ordinary
Westerners, and drew little more than hand-wringing from Western
governments. And they wonder what is so different about Yugoslavia.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ When he was a much younger man, Jose
Concepcion once found himself holding up a bullet and peering at it
through his thick glasses. ``They are shooting at us,'' he said,
more incredulous than afraid. That was 13 years ago in the
Philippines, when Concepcion and other partisans of democracy were
learning how to face down a dictator, and how a dictator fights
back.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he and scores of others are bringing such lessons to
places like Indonesia, applying them and building on them in the
growing number of emerging democracies. One of the founders of the
National Movement for Free Elections, known by the acronym Namfrel,
Concepcion helped end the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
That experience helped him and others fashion a new instrument for
the spread of democracy: the independent, citizen-led
election-watch group.
</P>
<P>
   Vote-monitoring groups sponsored by the United Nations or the
United States or by independent American organizations have become
a fairly familiar sight in countries conducting elections for the
first time. But Concepcion's movement is different: These are
home-grown groups that take it upon themselves to visit neighboring
countries, help them launch democracies, and leave behind similar
home-grown groups to help the fledgling free society grow.
</P>
<P>
   So last week Concepcion was in Jakarta with a Namfrel delegation
keeping an eye on Indonesia's first free election in 44 years and
simultaneously training local poll-watchers to start a
self-sustaining effort here. Also here were scores of men and women
from other nations who were in effect his students.
</P>
<P>
   Following the example set in the Philippines, they had already
helped bring democratic elections to their own countries. Now, like
Concepcion, they were sharing the benefits of their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Feroz Hassan, for example, was here from Bangladesh, where he
helped found the Fair Election Monitoring Alliance in 1995, with
help and advice from Namfrel. ``They brought the idea and gave us
the training,'' he said. Hassan then took his poll-watch experience
to Kenya before coming to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lachmansingh was here from Guyana, where he formed the
Electoral Assistance Bureau in 1991. ``People were getting quite
fed up,'' he said. ``Elections were rigged on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, he too went abroad, helping monitor elections in the
West Bank in 1995, in Sri Lanka in 1996 and 1997 and in Cambodia
last year before coming here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the same anywhere you go,'' he said. ``Always in
people's mind is hope and a desire for change and democracy, which
they associate first with democratic elections. People often have
unrealistic expectations, but always there is that basic ingredient
of hope which propels concerned citizens to want to make a
contribution. Call it patriotism, saintliness, bravery _ martyrdom
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The religious imagery seemed apt. These are today's secular
missionaries, spreading the democratic faith in a time of mass
conversion around the world. They have carried the gospel of
democratic possibilities to places as far-flung as Yemen, Nigeria,
Panama, Taiwan, Romania, Bulgaria, Chile, Haiti, Nicaragua, Kenya
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the poll-watch groups they helped found remained
in place after the election was over, transforming themselves into
good-government watchdog organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a life-and-death choice, almost,'' said Lachmansingh.
``In Guyana, every single year of my life had been lived under an
authoritarian government. I was prepared to die for this. This is
something you have to do. You want your children to grow up and
have a better life than you've had.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But if democracy is something of a secular religion these days,
Hassan bridled at a suggestion that it is somehow a particularly
American creed. Democracy, he said, is a political belief that is
every bit as fundamental to an Asian or African.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider that democracy is defined by America only or
that it is biased toward American policy,'' he said. And as it
spreads around the world, he added, it is becoming redefined by its
many new practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that democracy is an American imposition is a not
uncommon misperception, Lachmansingh said. ``You know, your country
has a bad name,'' he told an American reporter. ``People talk about
an American agenda, and you almost always have to deal with that:
Who are you? Are you an American organization? What's your
agenda?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the monitoring groups play many different roles
depending on the situation in each country.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, Hassan said, the priorities were to restore
confidence in the electoral process, to encourage larger-scale
participation and to deter fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In Guyana, Lachmansingh's group analyzed and discredited a voter
list so far removed from reality that people made jokes about it.
</P>
<P>
   In Sri Lanka, where elections were conducted relatively freely,
poll watchers guarded against violence that turned voting days into
a time of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   And after popular unrest forced the resignation of the
autocratic leader Suharto last fall, Indonesia faced most of the
challenges of an emerging democracy: intimidation, fraud,
disorganization and the lack of a culture of free choice. Even now,
with the results of last Monday's vote still not fully tallied, the
possibility of postelection violence hangs over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a very simple but very difficult cultural lesson that
must be learned in order to make free elections work, said Dumaria
Tampubolon, a statistician with Rectors Forum, one of the largest
of 99 local groups that have registered to monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
   People must learn to lose,'' she said. Otherwise, elections
simply become the spark for more conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Poll watchers themselves remain at risk from people who have not
yet learned the concept of neutrality, said Smita Notosusanto, the
executive director of a local poll-watch group called Unfrel, which
has fielded about 100,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our volunteers are students, and they are threatened
from both sides,'' she said. ``The police and military in some
areas intimidate our volunteers just because they are students. On
the other side, the biggest challenge right now is that students
are facing threats from their friends who are against the holding
of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, she said, some of these people are right to
mistrust her volunteers. Until they signed up for poll-watch duty,
many of the students were angrily demonstrating against the current
government.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them are not prepared to believe that the government
could win in a fair election. ``I'm not sure I can convince my
students to accept the results even if they cannot confirm any
violations,'' Ms. Smita said.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion pronounced himself pleased last week with Indonesia's
experiment in democracy, despite its rough edges. ``Generally
speaking, it was a free and fair and peaceful election,'' he said.
``Now it is up to the Indonesian people to work together to improve
the life of the people. After five more years they can fight
again.''

has a bad name,'' he told an American reporter. ``People talk about
an American agenda, and you almost always have to deal with that:
Who are you? Are you an American organization? What's your
agenda?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the monitoring groups play many different roles
depending on the situation in each country.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangladesh, Hassan said, the priorities were to restore
confidence in the electoral process, to encourage larger-scale
participation and to deter fraud.
</P>
<P>
   In Guyana, Lachmansingh's group analyzed and discredited a voter
list so far removed from reality that people made jokes about it.
</P>
<P>
   In Sri Lanka, where elections were conducted relatively freely,
poll watchers guarded against violence that turned voting days into
a time of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   And after popular unrest forced the resignation of the
autocratic leader Suharto last fall, Indonesia faced most of the
challenges of an emerging democracy: intimidation, fraud,
disorganization and the lack of a culture of free choice. Even now,
with the results of last Monday's vote still not fully tallied, the
possibility of postelection violence hangs over the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There is a very simple but very difficult cultural lesson that
must be learned in order to make free elections work, said Dumaria
Tampubolon, a statistician with Rectors Forum, one of the largest
of 99 local groups that have registered to monitor the election.
</P>
<P>
   People must learn to lose,'' she said. Otherwise, elections
simply become the spark for more conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Poll watchers themselves remain at risk from people who have not
yet learned the concept of neutrality, said Smita Notosusanto, the
executive director of a local poll-watch group called Unfrel, which
has fielded about 100,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our volunteers are students, and they are threatened
from both sides,'' she said. ``The police and military in some
areas intimidate our volunteers just because they are students. On
the other side, the biggest challenge right now is that students
are facing threats from their friends who are against the holding
of the election.''
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, she said, some of these people are right to
mistrust her volunteers. Until they signed up for poll-watch duty,
many of the students were angrily demonstrating against the current
government.
</P>
<P>
   And many of them are not prepared to believe that the government
could win in a fair election. ``I'm not sure I can convince my
students to accept the results even if they cannot confirm any
violations,'' Ms. Smita said.
</P>
<P>
   Concepcion pronounced himself pleased last week with Indonesia's
experiment in democracy, despite its rough edges. ``Generally
speaking, it was a free and fair and peaceful election,'' he said.
``Now it is up to the Indonesian people to work together to improve
the life of the people. After five more years they can fight
again.''

   WASHINGTON _ With a brother who died of a heart attack and two
parents who had strokes, it came as no surprise to Joanne Best
that, at age 60, she had developed heart disease. The surprise came
at the drugstore counter, when Ms. Best, of Concord, Calif., tried
to refill her prescription for Norvasc, the medication that kept
her blood pressure under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the insurance doesn't pay,'' she said. ``It wasn't
on the formulary.'' Her doctor switched her to nifedipine, a
different drug in the class known as calcium channel blockers. But
the new medicine isn't working, and last week the doctor doubled
the dose. ``It's very scary,'' Ms. Best said. ``This could be a
matter of life and death with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed-care executives call what happened to Ms. Best
``formulary management,'' or ``therapeutic substitution.'' Consumer
advocates use a less flattering term: ``drug switching.''
</P>
<P>
   With more drugs on pharmacy shelves than ever before, and with
more prescriptions being written each year, officials at the Food
and Drug Administration are growing increasingly concerned about
deaths and injuries caused by medications.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention is being paid to medication mix-ups and other
pharmaceutical errors. But many people don't realize that
pharmacists, at the behest of insurance companies, intentionally
switch medications all the time, with potentially harmful
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   These switches do not involve replacing brand-name drugs with
generics, which pharmacists are allowed to do unless the doctor
writes ``dispense as written'' or ``D.A.W.,'' on the prescription.
Rather, one chemical entity is substituted for another; the drugs
may treat the same disorder but have entirely different side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   The practice is particularly common with some of the most often
prescribed medications: anti-depressants, high-blood-pressure
medication and cholesterol-lowering drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Often the switching, which is done to save money, is harmless.
But for some people, particularly those who have been on an
established therapy for a long time, the changes can cause
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very dangerous and it is rampant,'' said Dr. Raymond
Woosley, chairman of the pharmacology department at the Georgetown
University Medical Center. ``This counters everything we teach in
medicine, which is, `Know a few drugs, know them well, pick the
best medicine for your patient, don't change unless it is medically
indicated.'''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that doctors should know a few drugs and know them well
was the original concept behind formularies, or restricted lists of
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an old concept,'' said Susan Winckler, director of policy
and legislation at the American Pharmaceutical Association, a
pharmacists' trade group, ``and in a hospital setting it allowed
physicians and other prescribers to get used to a limited number of
drugs. Managed care has taken that concept from the hospital to the
community environment, and we are not quite sure that the
translation has worked as well as it could.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates say it is not working at all. Howard
Metzenbaum, the former Democratic senator from Ohio who is now
chairman of the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit
organization in Washington, described drug switching as ``an evil
practice.'' He would like to see Congress ban it, but said, ``My
guess is we'd have a hell of an uphill battle.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 report titled ``Pharmaceutical Payola,'' Mark Green,
the New York City public advocate, cited a string of complaints
about drug switching that had been sent to the FDA. A 63-year-old
woman developed a joint condition after switching
cholesterol-lowering drugs; a 29-year-old schizophrenic ``began
exhibiting bruises and swelling'' after changing medications, and
an 86-year-old woman who traded one high-blood-pressure pill for
another suffered ``nausea, weakness and shakiness.''
</P>
<P>
   And even when there is no harm, pharmacists and doctors say, the
switching is a nuisance. ``That's where the nightmare in pharmacy
comes in,'' said Bruce Roberts, the owner of Leesburg Pharmacy in
Leesburg, Va. ``First we have to determine what they will cover.
Then we have to call the physician and get authorization. Most
physicians are so beat down by managed care that they say, `OK.'''
But when the doctor refuses, he said, ``You have to get back on the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefits managers, who serve as middlemen between drug
companies and health plans, say the wrangling is worth it. Drug
costs are spiraling upward; the pharmaceutical industry's revenues
are estimated at $91.8 billion this year, up from $38.5 billion in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Medications play such a big role in modern medicine, health
economists say, that some health plans are now paying more for
pharmaceuticals than for hospital visits. Switching is so important
in keeping costs down that benefits managers pay pharmacists a
premium for dispensing drugs that are on a company's formulary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We estimate that we save our clients over $1 billion a year in
prescription drug costs,'' said Kevin Colgan, a spokesman for
Merck-Medco Managed Care, which administers prescription drug
benefits for more than 51 million people. He said no one is
pressured to switch; doctors are simply ``presented with an
opportunity to help the health plan to save money.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent of the time, he said, they agree. Patients who
don't like it, Colgan said, have another option: ``They can always
pay for it themselves, out of pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of thinking enrages Ms. Best, who said she already
pays a $200 monthly premium for health insurance. Paying for
Norvasc would cost her an additional $80 a month.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens when the insurance company and the drug company
are one and the same? When Merck, the pharmaceutical giant,
purchased Medco in 1993, critics complained that the parent company
would steer its own drugs to the benefits management firm, a wholly
owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Federal Trade Commission agreed; an investigation
found that Medco had given favorable treatment to Merck products.
Without admitting wrongdoing, Merck-Medco signed a consent
agreement that required it to maintain an ``open formulary,'' a
practice Colgan said the company already had in place.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, some wonder how much money is really being saved by
all this switching, and at what cost. Green, the New York City
public advocate, concluded that drug switching is ``likely to mean
that a patient does not get well as fast,'' which drives up
health-care costs from additional doctors' visits.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathryn Bennett, who treats Ms. Best, has reached the same
conclusion. ``Now she is taking this medication twice a day,'' the
doctor said, ``which may well be more expensive than what she was
taking before.''

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ A British transport plane crashed only 300
yards from a large refugee camp here late on Friday night, sending
refugees running as the fuel and ammunition on board exploded over
and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They finally signed this agreement and we were supposed to go
back to Kosovo,'' said Izer Berisha, 50, whose tent looks out onto
the plane's burnt tail, poking out of the sloping grain field where
it landed. ``And when we saw the plane and the flames and the
explosions _ oh, my God. I thought this was the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one, either among the 12-member crew or on the ground,
was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky,'' said Kristina Torgeson, a spokeswoman for
Doctors Without Borders, the aid group that runs the camp of 5,900
people. ``It was so close.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash came amid stepped-up military activity here, as NATO
forces prepared to go into Kosovo from the same southwestern route
that some 450,000 ethnic Albanians used to escape from their homes
to here. Some time Saturday _ on the day that the first NATO
soldiers entered Kosovo from Macedonia to the east _ a convoy of
300 or so trucks carrying 1,500 German soldiers is expected to roll
across the pot-holed roads toward the border.
</P>
<P>
   As early as Sunday, the troops are expected to cross the border,
across the region where some of the worst fighting of the war took
place, to the southern Kosovo city of Prizren. An advance party was
supposed to arrive Saturday, but Lt. Col. Helge Eriksen, a
spokesman for NATO troops in Albania, said they were delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crash underscored again the problems _ and dangers _
of having so many refugees packed in so close to the various
fighting factions of the conflict: The city of Kukes is only 10
miles from the border, where NATO planes had been bombing Kosovo
for several weeks, and within easy range of Serbian artillery.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksen said he did not know the cause of the crash and was
intentionally vague about what exactly the British military plane,
a C-130 transport plane, was doing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He would say only that it was on a ``military'' mission and that
most of the 12 people on board were British soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the soldiers hurt his leg in the crash; others suffered
from light burns and respiratory problems, Eriksen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the plane crashed at 11:10 p.m. Friday, shortly after
takeoff from an airstrip less than a mile away from the camp. The
plane clipped a stone wall six feet high before dropping into the
field, and Saturday one of the landing wheels as well as another
piece of metal lay between the wall and the rest of the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the plane screeched down into the field,
exploding several times after it hit. Camp officials evacuated some
500 refugees that lived in the tents nearest the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very, very scared,'' said Elfije Sahitaj, 34, whose
seven children were sleeping in the first row of tents facing the
plane crash. ``It was really hard to wake them up. We ran with no
shoes on or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in very great danger,'' she said. ``It was luck that
he stopped there.''
</P>
<P>
   Several witnesses said the plane had circled over the camp at
least twice and appeared to be in trouble because it was flying
unusually low. Berisha said the engine was making loud noises. He
said the pilot appeared to turn the plane away from the camp before
it crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot didn't want to crash here,'' said Atni Burduri, 30,
who was sitting on a bench facing the field where plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said soldiers from the United Arab Emirates, as well
as the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebel group fighting Serbian
forces inside Kosovo, rushed to the burning plane and pulled out
the passengers.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Teresa Oliver remembers when her block of North
Castle Street was tidy and picturesque, its handsome brick houses
lined up in an unbroken row, their marble steps gleaming from a
combination of soft soap and hard scrubbing. In the evenings, their
work done, families sat out on the sidewalks in webbed folding
chairs with their beers, laughing while their children played
around them.
</P>
<P>
   But that was almost 20 years ago. Now, the chairs and families
are gone. Now the city plans to tear down the 20 row houses on Mrs.
Oliver's east-side block.
</P>
<P>
   ``This used to be, well, just a real solid neighborhood,'' she
said, standing on her stone stoop in time-honored Baltimore
fashion. So were the blocks along Edmondson Avenue, on the west
side of town, where dozens of three-story row houses have been
knocked into rubble. Windows of abandoned houses that still stand
are stoppered with plywood or nothing at all; lace curtains fly in
tatters, ripped by the wind. Marble steps lie broken in half.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore has declared war on huge swaths of its formerly
treasured row houses, whose distinctive architecture has sheltered
waves of immigrants and the city's working-class for over a
century, but which city officials describe as derelict. More than
4,000 row houses have been bulldozed in the last three years,
virtually all in poor neighborhoods, part of the city
administration's mission to remove unsafe urban eyesores. Thousands
more have been abandoned and will be demolished. The city has no
plan to replace them and is not yet sure what it will do with the
empty land.
</P>
<P>
   Census tracts show about 66,000 houses in the center city. If
demolition continues as planned, the city will have torn down 20
percent of them by the year 2004, in what preservationists assert
is a disorganized rush to destruction and city officials describe
as an urgent necessity. The designated houses are usually vacant
and always rundown, they say, sometimes serving as crack houses and
headquarters for drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked the communities what is your worst problem _ and
we've tried to respond with the wrecking ball,'' said Daniel P.
Henson III, the city housing commissioner. ``I want to get rid of
11,000 of the worst between now and 2003.''
</P>
<P>
   But preservationists like Richard Moe, president of the National
Trust for Historic Preservation, shudder at the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The destruction of these historic row houses will result in a
loss of a major part of Baltimore's identity, its greatest asset,''
Moe said.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Scully, professor emeritus of architecture at Yale,
praised the form of Baltimore's row houses, ``their doors and
windows showing the scale of human use.''
</P>
<P>
   The style of Baltimore's row houses _ stretching north and
south, east and west in seemingly unbroken patterns _ has been
toasted by Frances Trollope and H.L. Mencken, commemorated in film
by Alfred Hitchcock and John Waters and relished by the millions of
travelers who gazed down at their flat roofs from the
Boston-Washington express train.
</P>
<P>
   Built for newly arriving Poles, Italians and Irish in the mid-
and late-19th century, these narrow houses remained largely
undisturbed while glossy tourist hotels and a model baseball
stadium were erected down by the harbor, where an increasing number
of visitors flock to see the Orioles baseball team and enjoy the
paddle-it-yourself harbor skiffs.
</P>
<P>
   But Baltimore, like many older cities, _ Philadelphia, Detroit
and St. Louis, among them _ has been losing population at an
alarming rate. The population drain has resulted in 11,705
abandoned houses, said Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 city residents a month are moving out, notably
African-American workers moving to the suburbs in Baltimore County,
following the white exodus in the 1960s and 70s to the land of
horse farms and better schools. From 1980 to 1990, 76,000 people
migrated to the county and of those, 57,000 were black.
</P>
<P>
   In a trend urbanists refer to as ``undercrowding,'' Baltimore
City's population plummeted to about 657,000 in 1997 from 950,000
in 1960, according to city planning documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we'll have a net loss of about 6,000 people,'' said
Henson, who grew up in a West Baltimore row house but moved his
family to a house with a lawn and a pool near the county line.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's problems, while common to other American cities, are
more pronounced, said Douglas Rae, a professor of urban management
at Yale who coined the term ``undercrowding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Baltimore's very heavy reliance on row houses sets it apart,''
Professor Rae said. ``Also the scale of the population loss is
larger. And finally, the intensive suburban development in the
county is more extreme than most other cities facing
undercrowding.''
</P>
<P>
   The poor, inner-city neighborhoods began to deteriorate visibly
in the late 1970s. Rows of houses started to show their age and a
few were boarded up. But since then the changes have accelerated.
Hensen said that by the early 80s, sizable chunks of West Baltimore
and East Baltimore and parts of North-Central Baltimore near Johns
Hopkins Hospital had lost much of their sense of neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the lowest test scores, the highest incidence of
crime, and the most trash to be removed from their alleys,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent visit to West Baltimore, the parlor floor of one
empty sky-blue house was littered with used syringes.
</P>
<P>
   The Schmoke administration, elected in 1987, made the
renaissance of Sandtown-Winchester, a 72-block neighborhood of row
houses in West Baltimore, its priority, with a $70 million
investment in schools and job programs.
</P>
<P>
   Henson conceded that ``we're just getting to the point where
we're starting to think about bricks and mortar.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials are not thinking about restoring the old row
houses; they are mostly thinking of tearing them down. Today, whole
blocks lie in rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Officials contend that not enough people are moving to
Baltimore, and those who are _ ``urbanites or empty nesters,''
Henson said _ do not want an antique row house unless it is near
the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the price of restored row houses in
waterfront manufacturing areas has tripled or quadrupled. Canton,
once a seedy warehouse area east of the glamorous harborside
renewal, now has row-house prices of $150,000 _ compared with the
virtually valueless houses in West Baltimore and parts of East
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the older neighborhoods that are suffering.'' said
Vincent P. Quayle, founder and director of the St. Ambrose Housing
Association, a community group that encourages home ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a market for these older houses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not presently,'' Quayle said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the city demolished Lafayette Court, a public housing
high rise, it built air-conditioned row houses clustered along
cul-de-sacs, just like the suburban dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't want three-story houses,'' Schmoke said. ``They
wanted two-story houses with modern conveniences _ and yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Another deterrent to rehabilitation of the old houses has been
the expense: $85,000 to $100,000 for each full-scale renovation. An
average mid-block row house costs $30,000 to demolish, which
includes shoring up the survivors on either side with cinder block
and mortar.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the Schmoke administration got what it was seeking
from the state Legislature: a speeded-up demolition process under
which the city can get approval from a judge to demolish a block
when 70 percent of its housing is vacant, rather than wait for the
block to empty.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Samuels, a housing lawyer with the American Civil
Liberties Union, called the city's demolitions ``completely
planless _ the last slap in the face for the mostly elderly
homeowners left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a steam roller,'' Ms. Samuels said of the bill's
passage, which allots only seven days' eviction notice.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Samuels said she feared the bill will speed up the the
deterioration and abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all, if you lived in a block with significant vacancies,
would you put on a new roof?'' she asked. ``Not if you knew your
house could be seized in seven days, you wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmoke, who has announced that he will not run for a fourth
term, said of the new law, which will take effect in October: `On
my good days, I look at it as an opportunity for renewal. On my bad
days, I'm just depressed a little about the loss of population.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Oliver, 62, , ``I feel as if I had been done a great
injustice.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The city bought her house for $13,000 in a forced sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had got burned out in `92,'' she said, ``and I took all the
insurance money and put it back into the walls, the paint, the
insides.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, she refused to leave the house, which she and her late
husband bought in 1981, from her husband's aunt and uncle, who had
lived there since 1954. For three years, she fought the eviction,
and watched her neighbors move. Finally, she took the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a fixed income and these houses on all sides are
vacant,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks, she said, ``with the storms, the water
came running down in my basement and my hot water tank rusted
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big rats are tearing around,'' she added.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Gorham, who heads a block association in West Baltimore,
worries about the people being displaced. But like many community
leaders, she supports the demolitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The houses are being demolished in order to create a different
kind of environment and I think it's good,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of demolition always point to the an innovative solution
offered in the 70s by Robert C. Embry Jr., then Baltimore's housing
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Embry earned national plaudits for a program in which the city
took over whole neighborhoods of mostly vacant houses and sold them
to prospective homeowners for $1, offering 3 percent fix-up loan.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint as secretary of housing and urban development
under President Jimmy Carter, Embry has returned to Baltimore as
head of the Abell Foundation, set up to foster better schools and
housing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In his office recently, overlooking the model Orioles' stadium,
Embry said the $1 house program could still work _ not where
deterioration is far-gone, but in solid neighborhoods like
Patterson Park, where houses are just beginning to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to entice new center-city dwellers this spring, the Abell
Foundation and the Patterson Park Association, a neighborhood
group, started a program that guarantees the value of a row house
for five years, no matter how much prices may drop.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Hayward, a preservationist and the co-author with
Charles Belfoure of ``The Baltimore Rowhouse,'' scheduled for
publication in July by Princeton Architectural Press, says the city
is ``misguided'' in its demolition approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we know the population will continue to decline?'' Ms.
Howard said. ``How do we know these houses won't come back into
fashion?''
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists also worry about elegant neighborhoods like
Union Square, where Mencken lived and where ``For Sale'' signs have
sprouted in the windows of the superb brownstones. A gentrified row
of pastel-painted brick houses, each with a similar hand-made flag
hanging from its cornice, is starting to fray: the pale paint is
flaking off, a window pane is missing, and a ``No Trespassing''
notice is stuck in a window.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is reaching out for solutions for hard-hit
neighborhoods. Early this year, the city and the Historic East
Baltimore Community Action Coalition picked an area near Johns
Hopkins Hospital and held a design competition.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two winning entries, from Glatting Jackson, an
architectural firm in Orlando, Fla., proposed lining the old alley
streets with new garage buildings, with apartments overhead. The
other entry, by A. Nelessen of Princeton, N.J., called for 50
percent of the narrow houses to be renovated, with some joined
together to make loft-like spaces. Houses also incorporated
garages, that symbol of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to compete with the suburbs, you have to offer
amenities like garages,'' said Rob Inerfeld, program coordinator
for the Neighborhood Design Center. ``When most of Baltimore was
built, people didn't drive.''
</P>
<P>
   To William Rees Morrish, director of the Design Center for
American Landscape at the University of Minnesota, and a juror for
Baltimore's design competition, the row-house problem is an
ecological one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals, when their shells grow obsolete, they shed the shell
and move on,'' he said. ``Many row houses have reached the point
where they're falling down and the city has to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Henson, the aggressive campaigner for demolition, is
sad. How does he feel when he drives through his old neighborhood
in West Baltimore and sees the rubble and ruin?
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel so bad,'' Henson said, ``I want to cry.''

   NEW YORK _ The guest list was top drawer, headed by President
Clinton and both of New York's Democratic senators. But even with
that political star power, hardly anyone wanted to come to
Geraldine Ferraro's $1,000-a-person fund-raiser to pay off her
campaign debts. So late last month, just 48 hours before curtain
time, she called the whole thing off.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly $1 million in debt after having raised $8 million
for her failed Senate primary bids in 1998 and 1992 _ including
$400,000 from her own pocket _ Ferraro has joined the ranks of
unsuccessful candidates who discover that beyond the humiliation of
defeat lies another harsh reality: a mountain of debt, with few
easy prospects for paying it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the optimum circumstances,'' Ferraro said in an
interview. ``And we still couldn't push the event forward to raise
money. This is a tough place to be in. I'm just tired of asking
people for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they are well-known faces or ordinary people who run for
Congress, losing candidates find that just because the election is
over, that doesn't mean the fund raising stops. But if it was tough
raising money in the heat of a campaign, try fund raising after
Election Day, as the bills from pollsters, the telephone company
and poster makers keep rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonse D'Amato spent $24.2 million in his losing bid to keep
his Senate seat last year. Now he's left with $300,000 in debts,
and the donors who supported him when he was in office are nowhere
to be seen _ or have already given him the maximum $2,000 allowed
by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in office, it's no big deal to raise money,''
said D'Amato, whose fund-raising prowess in the Senate was
legendary. Now the Wall Street executives and powerful New Yorkers
who once supported him have moved on. ``People's priorities are to
help the incumbent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To pay off debts, D'Amato has sent two direct-mail letters
begging for donations. ``My mother always told me to own up and pay
debts and that's what we are trying to do,'' said D'Amato, reading
from the text of one letter. So far, the letters have brought in
only around $30,000, D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is a collision of two facts of life about
campaigning. It costs more than ever to run for Congress _ last
year was the most expensive midterm election, breaking the $1
billion barrier. At the same time, donors _ whether ordinary
citizens or lobbyists _ cannot donate more than $2,000 per
election.
</P>
<P>
   This means that losing candidates have to seek out new donors
who either never gave to them before Election Day or have not
``maxed out,'' in campaign-finance parlance, and given their entire
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that there should be a change in the law to
allow separate postelection fund-raising committees, like a legal
defense fund,'' Ferraro said. ``This would allow a losing campaign
to set up a committee to pay off debt. I've had lots of people
sending me checks, and I've had to send the money back to them
because they've already maxed out to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Other big names with big debt include Rep. Lauch Faircloth, who
spent $9.4 million and lost his North Carolina Senate seat. He's
$1.7 million in debt and has sent out letters to North Carolina
businessmen soliciting funds. Legendary among debt-laden
politicians is Sen. John Glenn, who is still trying to raise money
to pay off $2.5 million from his failed 1984 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing if you are still in politics,'' said Ken Gross,
an election-law attorney in Washington. ``But once you are not
going to run again, it becomes nearly impossible. Look at John
Glenn. He is truly famous. He is a hero and, for those reasons, he
might have some hope of raising money. But even he has had
insurmountable difficulties in doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's tough for Glenn, what about unknown candidates like Paul
Barby, a Democrat from Oklahoma who failed in his bid for a House
seat and now owes $570,000. ``I have no choice but to eat it,'' he
said. ``There is no way to recoup it unless I go begging.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turnham, a salesman who lost a race for a House seat in
Alabama is paying off his $50,000 debt from his household budget.
``With what I've paid back, I could have sent my kids to a nice
four-year college,'' he said. ``It really takes the Horatio Alger
element out of running for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Any money lent by candidates to their own campaigns doesn't have
to be paid off. Candidates can absorb that loss personally, though
it cannot be claimed as a tax deduction. Money owed to vendors, by
federal law, must be paid back, either through donations or
personally, though the law allows any candidate, after the
election, to negotiate these sums down to a lower level.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, leftover campaign debts can linger on for years,
with the Federal Election Commission slow to pursue candidates to
get them to pay vendors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, many losing candidates say paying off bills is a matter
of personal pride. Scott West, a university administrator in
Wisconsin who failed last year to upset David Obey, the ranking
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, has used his own
money to whittle down his $120,000 campaign debt to $60,000 by
expanding his consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an honorable person and I've got to raise those dollars,''
West said. ``We had trouble raising money when I had a chance to
win. Getting people to back you up after the fact is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the opposite case: Incumbents who leave office
with large campaign war chests. Since 1993, they have been unable
to use this money on personal expenses and must give it either to
other candidates or to charity. For many who leave Congress, this
nest egg is invaluable, especially if they turn to lobbying, as
many do, and need cash to spread around Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who stepped down last year as
House speaker and is now a Washington lobbyist, left office with
$400,000. He has given $30,000 to charity and says he gets ``four
or five'' requests a day from debt-laden incumbent officeholders
for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played golf the other day with Tom Davis,'' said Livingston,
referring to the Republican congressman from Virginia, ``and he had
lots of ideas on how to spend the money.''

begging for donations. ``My mother always told me to own up and pay
debts and that's what we are trying to do,'' said D'Amato, reading
from the text of one letter. So far, the letters have brought in
only around $30,000, D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is a collision of two facts of life about
campaigning. It costs more than ever to run for Congress _ last
year was the most expensive midterm election, breaking the $1
billion barrier. At the same time, donors _ whether ordinary
citizens or lobbyists _ cannot donate more than $2,000 per
election.
</P>
<P>
   This means that losing candidates have to seek out new donors
who either never gave to them before Election Day or have not
``maxed out,'' in campaign-finance parlance, and given their entire
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling that there should be a change in the law to
allow separate postelection fund-raising committees, like a legal
defense fund,'' Ferraro said. ``This would allow a losing campaign
to set up a committee to pay off debt. I've had lots of people
sending me checks, and I've had to send the money back to them
because they've already maxed out to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Other big names with big debt include Rep. Lauch Faircloth, who
spent $9.4 million and lost his North Carolina Senate seat. He's
$1.7 million in debt and has sent out letters to North Carolina
businessmen soliciting funds. Legendary among debt-laden
politicians is Sen. John Glenn, who is still trying to raise money
to pay off $2.5 million from his failed 1984 presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing if you are still in politics,'' said Ken Gross,
an election-law attorney in Washington. ``But once you are not
going to run again, it becomes nearly impossible. Look at John
Glenn. He is truly famous. He is a hero and, for those reasons, he
might have some hope of raising money. But even he has had
insurmountable difficulties in doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's tough for Glenn, what about unknown candidates like Paul
Barby, a Democrat from Oklahoma who failed in his bid for a House
seat and now owes $570,000. ``I have no choice but to eat it,'' he
said. ``There is no way to recoup it unless I go begging.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turnham, a salesman who lost a race for a House seat in
Alabama is paying off his $50,000 debt from his household budget.
``With what I've paid back, I could have sent my kids to a nice
four-year college,'' he said. ``It really takes the Horatio Alger
element out of running for Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Any money lent by candidates to their own campaigns doesn't have
to be paid off. Candidates can absorb that loss personally, though
it cannot be claimed as a tax deduction. Money owed to vendors, by
federal law, must be paid back, either through donations or
personally, though the law allows any candidate, after the
election, to negotiate these sums down to a lower level.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, leftover campaign debts can linger on for years,
with the Federal Election Commission slow to pursue candidates to
get them to pay vendors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, many losing candidates say paying off bills is a matter
of personal pride. Scott West, a university administrator in
Wisconsin who failed last year to upset David Obey, the ranking
Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, has used his own
money to whittle down his $120,000 campaign debt to $60,000 by
expanding his consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an honorable person and I've got to raise those dollars,''
West said. ``We had trouble raising money when I had a chance to
win. Getting people to back you up after the fact is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the opposite case: Incumbents who leave office
with large campaign war chests. Since 1993, they have been unable
to use this money on personal expenses and must give it either to
other candidates or to charity. For many who leave Congress, this
nest egg is invaluable, especially if they turn to lobbying, as
many do, and need cash to spread around Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who stepped down last year as
House speaker and is now a Washington lobbyist, left office with
$400,000. He has given $30,000 to charity and says he gets ``four
or five'' requests a day from debt-laden incumbent officeholders
for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played golf the other day with Tom Davis,'' said Livingston,
referring to the Republican congressman from Virginia, ``and he had
lots of ideas on how to spend the money.''

FACING NEW INFLUX, SWISS TO VOTE ON LIMITING ASYLUM-SEEKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BERN, Switzerland _ The hospitality of Switzerland, which over
the past decades has been home to a sizable population of Albanian
Kosovar guest workers, will be tested Sunday when its citizens vote
on whether to react to a rising number of refugees by tightening
asylum laws.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss opinion has varied widely about Kosovo Albanian refugees
who _ fleeing increasingly brutal Serbian aggression _ have been
drawn here over the last 16 months, not only by geographic
proximity but also by relatives who have been working in the Alpine
country for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, many Swiss outspokenly opposed the new arrivals,
fearing serious crime would come with them, since Kosovo has been
linked to the international drug trade. For example, European
police say that a well-established heroin-smuggling route runs
through Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But this spring, there was an outpouring of money and sympathy
in reaction to the Serbian expulsion of Kosovo Albanians from their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when Swiss President Ruth Dreifuss visited a refugee
camp in Macedonia, she brought back 20 Albanian Kosovars, mostly
women and children, all of whom had relatives in Switzerland.
Newspapers greeted her impromptu action as upholding the nation's
humanitarian ideals, while opposition politicians accused her of a
``kindergarten'' gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Those reactions reflect the dichotomy between Switzerland's
humanitarian traditions and its time-honored aversion to outsiders.
This tension surfaced in the early 1990s, when many Bosnians fled
to Switzerland, and again with the influx of Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, more than 20,000 refugees have
sought asylum in Switzerland, with that number expected to surpass
60,000 by the end of 1999. According to United Nations figures,
Germany and Switzerland have sheltered the largest number of
Albanian Kosovars. Per 100,000 inhabitants, the Swiss have accepted
four times as many as Germany, which has the greatest overall
number of Kosovo refugees but is a much larger country.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the vote on asylum laws has taken place in the
shadow of revelations in recent years that Switzerland turned away
as many as 40,000 refugees during World War II. Swiss Jews last
year publicly urged the government not to deport any Kosovo
Albanians who were refused asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the earlier Bosnian arrivals, most Albanian
Kosovars arriving here have relatives among the 180,000 Albanians
who already live in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Xhavit Hetemi, who left southern Kosovo in 1979, were
invited here to work. Hetemi has worked steadily in construction in
Switzerland's capital. These guest workers have lived in the
country long enough to be permanent legal residents, meaning that
they believe that their relatives have the right to remain here at
least until Kosovo is safe again for them to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the years that I have been here, I never heard anything bad
about Albanians,'' Hetemi, 58, said. ``We were considered good and
honest workers, until now.'' He was alluding to reports in some
German-language Swiss newspapers depicting Albanian Kosovars as
drug dealers and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been trying to whip up anti-foreigner sentiment,''
said Suzanne Auer, of the Swiss Organization for Aid to Refugees in
Bern. Her group recently issued a study indicating that criminality
among asylum seekers was mostly in the categories of minor thefts
and burglaries, not drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that Kosovo Albanians are criminals, when nine
out of 10 are behaving correctly, is very bad for the community,''
said Roger Schneeberger, spokesman for the federal refugee office.
``But,'' he added, ``there are people applying for asylum who, in
reality, are here to sell drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greater long-term worry is that Switzerland has been
used as a staging ground for the armed Albanians of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. Last fall, police broke up a weapons smuggling
ring, seizing a half-ton of ammunition and guns said to be bound
for Kosovo. This followed the discovery of bank accounts controlled
by the separatist rebel group, which were frozen by the Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to cope with the refugee inflow, the Swiss government has
set, and canceled, three deadlines to return Albanian Kosovars
home. Local press reports have highlighted the slow pace at which
Swiss officials in Macedonia have processed applications from
Kosovo refugees there seeking to come to Switzerland. Swiss
authorities eventually announced they would accept Kosovo Albanians
at least until the situation in the Serbian province stabilizes _ a
move last taken during the 1992-95 Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   These actions contrast with generous public donations to help
refugees and the government's commitment of more than $34 million
in aid, including building camps for up to 15,000 refugees in
Albania and 25,000 in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The revised asylum law up for voter approval would enshrine the
government's right to declare certain groups eligible for entry
into the country, thus eliminating individual refugee reviews and
saving money. But critics fear that this wholesale admissions
process will undercut the refugees' right to make their case for
individual persecution, which is necessary to be granted permanent
asylum in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Voters must also decide whether to give a retroactive rubber
stamp to emergency measures taken last year as the Kosovo refugee
inflow was gathering steam. Those measures allow rapid ejection of
people without identity papers, in order to foil entry by those who
are actually economic immigrants, said Urs Arn, of the federal
refugee office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are abuses,'' agreed Ms. Auer, of the refugee aid group.
``But can you imagine being Albanian and going to the Serbian
police for identity papers? It's just not possible.''

   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ ExperTelligence, a high-tech firm based
here, has attracted a century-old, low-tech information source to
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ExperTelligence's WebData.com _ a collection of more than 3,000
databases on the Internet _ has agreed to an exclusive deal with
The World Almanac, the 130-year-old encyclopedia publisher. About
half of the encyclopedia's information, including graphics and
photographs, will be available on WebData. com (www. WebData.com),
company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible collection of data ... very
educational-oriented,'' said Denison Bollay, president and chief
executive officer of ExperTelligence. ``And there will be a lot of
transformation from the book (encyclopedia) version to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   WebData's encyclopedia connection _ available through an
encyclopedia icon, keyword searches or numerous other ways _ will
ease ``knowledge workers and fact finders'' with information, said
Robert Reali, executive vice president of ExperTelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The free searches will begin this summer, Reali said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Almanac has been providing authoritative up-to-date,
high-quality information and we think there's a great fit between
what World Almanac and WebData.com can offer to information
seekers,'' said Robert Famighetti, vice president and editorial
director of PRIMEDIA Reference Inc., the publisher of the
encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal were not released. But both
companies will benefit from banner advertising, with revenue
increasing on the number of ``hits'' _ or visitors _ to the
encyclopedia connection on WebData.com.

   WASHINGTON _ Bad news for Chinese generals: The U.S. Commerce
Department has just determined that the new Sony Playstation II,
available later this year, is powered by an American-made chip so
powerful that Washington would have to be notified before it could
be shipped to China.
</P>
<P>
   If the final destination were a company, institute or household
linked to the Chinese military, a lengthy review would be required
to make sure America's most sophisticated technology does not fall
into the hands of bomb makers.
</P>
<P>
   But any Chinese officer determined to play out his fantasies on
a state-of-the-art Sony _ perhaps simulating a naval attack to
retake Taiwan? _ has other options. He could simply send his
teen-agers over to shop at any of the five Toys ``R'' Us stores in
Hong Kong, which is still considered a safe place to send advanced
technology even though it reverted to China two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the Playstation is bandied about a lot in
Washington these days as one more example of how disconnected the
politics of controlling high-tech exports is from the realities of
a marketplace that reinvents itself every six months.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the disclosures about Chinese espionage, there
has been daily talk on Capitol Hill about crackdowns on the export
of American technology, not only nuclear secrets from the labs,
which everyone agrees must be locked up, but also the computing
power that would help the Chinese simulate nuclear explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The Playstation is only the tip of the chip. Over the next 12
months American computer and semiconductor makers are planning to
roll out a series of new products, with code names like Willamette
and Merced, that blow wildly past the limits Washington has used to
define a supercomputer that needs to be guarded.
</P>
<P>
   By year's end, says Andrew Grove, chairman of Intel Corp.,
``You'll be spending $1,200 at CompUSA for a computer that, if the
rules aren't changed, we may not be able to ship to China.'' Or to
Israel, Russia, India or 50 other nations subject to strict
controls.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the Clinton administration in a bind. Just as it is
defending itself against charges of letting technology out the
door, the computer industry's top executives were visiting Capitol
Hill and the White House last week asking for a relaxation of the
export rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under their proposal, the definition of a high-performance
computer requiring government approval for export to those 50
countries would be increased sixfold to 12,300 MTOPS (millions of
theoretical operations per second) from 2,000 now. Otherwise, they
warn, Europe and Japan will eat their lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the Clinton administration agree that the current limits
are too strict given today's technology. The president could ease
the restrictions with a stroke of his pen, but he must give
Congress six months to review the decision. Nowadays, though, one
White House official lamented, ``We'd be giving ammo to anyone who
believes that we are helping arm potential enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   What the computer industry seeks is a fundamental rethinking of
what kind of technology it makes sense to control. During the Cold
War that issue seemed relatively straightforward: The most powerful
Cray supercomputers and their Japanese rivals were clearly off
limits for shipments to the likes of the old Soviet Union and
China.
</P>
<P>
   But Crays were produced in limited numbers, and when they were
sold to countries whose intentions might be less than honorable,
part of the deal was that they would be accompanied by a full-time
technical expert who, in theory, also served as a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   But the motto of last week's Silicon Valley visitors, who
included some big donors to Democratic and Republican causes, is
``Yesterday's supercomputer is today's laptop.'' They have a point:
A $20 million Cray X-MP, state of the art in the mid-1980s, had
about the power of a 1999 personal computer equipped with a
relatively fast version of Intel's Pentium II chip.
</P>
<P>
   That Pentium is, of course, passe. By the end of this year Intel
projects that a high-end Pentium III chip will perform 1,600 MTOPS,
well above the current limit for microprocessors that can be
shipped to China and similar countries.
</P>
<P>
   Then come Willamette and Merced, chips that Dell, Compaq, IBM
and others plan to put in clusters of two or four in forthcoming
machines. These computers would operate at upward of 12,000 MTOPS,
or more than six times the current threshold for export controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that there are going to be millions of these
computers produced,'' said Lewis Platt, the president and chief
executive of Hewlett-Packard, who led the lobbying effort here.
``There comes a moment when a technology is so widely available
that the kind of limits that we put in place just a few years ago
simply don't make any sense anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The two main authors of the report on China's espionage efforts,
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., and Norm Dicks, D-Wash., sympathize
but insist it is time to revive the Cold War organization that
limited exports, the Committee on Multilateral Export Controls. It
went out of business in 1994, replaced by a weak accord that allows
most countries to ship whatever they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Export controls remain essential because even as China has
stolen some of our most important secrets, it has not yet obtained
everything it needs to exploit them,'' Cox and Dicks wrote last
week in The Wall Street Journal. Europe and Japan, however, see the
threat differently; they worry more about America's technological
supremacy than about what happens when China gets the Merced. They
are reluctant to re-institute cold-war controls.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable. The Gartner Group, a computer industry
consulting group, projects that within three years the Chinese will
be buying nearly 400,000 multi-processor personal computers a year,
to say nothing of Sony Playstations.

U.S. GENERAL SAYS NATO CAN ORDER RUSSIANS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Taking a tough line toward Russian troops
who moved into Pristina without NATO's approval Friday night, the
alliance's top general warned Saturday that the commander of the
NATO peacekeeping force had authority to order them to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wesley Clark, the American commander of NATO forces in
Europe, said here that the allies would welcome Russian
participation in the force, but only under a command arrangement
with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we're going to be able to work this out in the
fashion soldiers normally do,'' he said, playing down any threat of
armed confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, commander of the NATO
force entering Kosovo, known as KFOR, would be in charge under the
terms of the agreement reached with Serbian generals this week on
how their forces would withdraw from Kosovo and let 50,000 allied
peacekeepers come in.
</P>
<P>
   Under that military agreement, Clark emphasized, the NATO
commander ``has the authority to direct all operations on the
ground to control all facilities and can tell forces, all forces,
any forces, to redeploy and move.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By virtue of the fact that the Russian vehicles have been
marked with KFOR lettering,'' he added, ``one would assume that
they recognize this authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, like other officials here, said there was no cause for
worry about clashes between the Russians and other peacekeepers,
who did not delay their entry into Kosovo early Saturday morning
because of the unexpected Russian arrival in Pristina in the middle
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   But the allies did not conceal their bafflement and displeasure
at the Russian unit's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would describe it as more or less a quartering party,''
Clark said in characterizing the Russian forces _ one with the
ability to stake out but not defend a position. ``It was an element
that was pulled out of another command unit that was sent racing
along to apparently move to an airfield to do some mission, we
can't imagine what, in an uncoordinated fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to be an isolated element that's out there by
itself,'' he added, ``and I'm sure it will have to be brought into
the design of the overall mode of NATO and Russian work in KFOR.''
</P>
<P>
   About 200 of the soldiers, he said, had unilaterally dropped
their duties with the NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia and headed
off for Kosovo instead, without giving advance notice to the U.S.
general under whose command they were serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this was not in keeping, and the lack of notification
was not in keeping with agreements that were established three and
a half years ago when this force was put in place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The allies are hoping that the Russians will eventually agree to
a special arrangement like the one they have in Bosnia, where the
1,200 Russian troops are deployed in a U.S.-commanded sector but do
not technically report to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still our firm intention that there should be a single,
unified command structure under Sir Michael Jackson,'' said NATO
spokesman Jamie Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has so far refused to agree to put troops directly under
his command, but talks in Moscow on possible arrangements continued
Saturday with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, and Clark
said Russian officers remained in contact with their NATO
peacekeeper counterparts as well.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, NATO made light of the dramatic standoff with the
Russians, accepting the Russian Foreign Ministry's proffered
explanation that the troop move had been a ``mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the Russians to be part of the force,'' Shea said,
``and we clearly see that Russia wants to be part of the force. Of
course, we have to work out the precise coordination arrangements,
that's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Friday night, before the surprising news from
Pristina, ``From a military standpoint, I think Russia has military
capacities that could provide some significant assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some allied diplomats and military officers expressed anger at
the Russian move. ``There's not going to be any fait accompli,''
one senior diplomat said, ``and the Russians are not going to be
stationed or given a sector in Pristina just because they are
there. This is a political game, not a military challenge, but it's
disturbing enough. Nobody's in a state of alarm, but there's a lot
of queasiness.''
</P>
<P>
   At allied headquarters, officials were concerned about what they
saw as either the flagrant deceit of the Russian Foreign Ministry
or, equally worrisome to them, the lack of civilian control over
Moscow's military.
</P>
<P>
   Allied peacekeepers started moving into Kosovo in force at 5:10
a.m. as planned despite the news of the Russian arrival in
Pristina, Shea said, after having delayed the start of the
operation 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Friday night that the allies had agreed to the delay
at the request of Serbian officers, who had asked for more time to
get heavy equipment together in western Kosovo and clear obstacles
from the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one allied diplomat said, there were questions about
whether the Serbs had asked for the delay to give the Russians time
to get to Pristina before the allies did.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clark said Saturday afternoon, the Serbs had
withdrawn about 10 percent of their tanks, 30 percent of their
artillery and mortars, and 12 percent of their 40,000 soldiers,
police officers and paramilitary troops so far under the agreement,
which gives them 11 days from last Thursday to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Now the allies are forced to confront the changed nature of
their relationship with Russia, which until the bombing of Serbia
began March 24 had seemed to be improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just shows once again that the Russians are not
interested in building a security relationship with NATO,'' one
officer said. ``What they are trying to do is put obstacles in
NATO's way at every turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Hungary, a new NATO ally that had granted permission Friday for
Russian transport planes to fly over its territory to Belgrade,
withdrew that permission Saturday after discovering that the planes
would apparently contain troops in uniform rather than food and
medicine for refugees, a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that there's a lot of explaining that has to be done
at many levels,'' Clark said Saturday.

ANALYSIS: THE MUDDLE IN MOSCOW _ WHO'S GIVING THE ORDERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ There are but two conclusions that can be drawn from
Russia's abrupt and befuddled deployment of troops in Kosovo,
neither of them reassuring. One is that President Boris Yeltsin no
longer has full control of his government. The other is that he
does.
</P>
<P>
   If critical government organs like the Defense Ministry are
free-lancing Russian foreign policy, as seemed all too possible
Friday night, then a struggle to peel away Yeltsin's powers almost
surely is under way, with ominous implications for democracy here
and Russia's rocky relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
   But if Yeltsin either hatched or blessed the troop deployment
plans, as appeared more likely Saturday, the implications are
hardly more comforting. It would mean that Russia's 68-year-old
president tossed aside obligations under an international peace
agreement barely a week old without even consulting his foreign
minister, much less the other parties to the accord.
</P>
<P>
   And that suggests that Russia in Yeltsin's final year as
president is an increasingly unreliable and unstable nation, driven
more by domestic politics and anti-West nationalism than by any
internal compass.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who could settle the matter, has remained silent. A
Kremlin official on Saturday evening refused to say who issued the
order, suggesting that some better explanation would be forthcoming
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian politicians themselves confess confusion over what the
Kremlin is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's commotion in Western capitals is quite justified,''
said a member of the foreign affairs committee of the lower house
of parliament, Vladimir Averchev, ``because it's not clear who
makes decisions in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, the incident appears to be the most troubling
episode in what has become Yeltsin's stock pattern of conduct: a
penchant for secrecy, surprise and sometimes Byzantine intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately or otherwise, the president has become so secretive
about major policy decisions, and so cryptic in explaining them,
that many politicians here suspect that he is really parroting the
commands of one or more shadowy Rasputins.
</P>
<P>
   But that seems out of character for Yeltsin, who is nothing if
not strong-willed and jealous of his powers. Nobody outside his
inner circle really knows, however, because Yeltsin seldom explains
his surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has that been more apparent than in domestic affairs,
where he stunned the nation in May by firing the popular Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and then ignited an internal struggle
over his successor by dividing power in the next government between
rival camps.
</P>
<P>
   One camp is led by former Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, who
has contended that he enjoys Yeltsin's support. The other includes
the financier Boris Berezovsky, who was under indictment and
investigation for financial misdeeds before Yeltsin fired Primakov,
and has since enjoyed a remarkable rehabilitation. Berezovsky, too,
claims Yeltsin's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, typically, has sent mixed signals. He told legislators
twice in May that he would appoint Berezovsky's favorite, Railroad
Minister Nikolai Aksyonenko, as his prime minister _ and then,
hours later, appointed Chubais' favorite, Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin, to the post.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin's Cabinet has been racked since then by power
struggles as Aksyonenko contended he had a mandate to control the
nation's economic policy, Stepashin's choice for that job resigned
in protest and his successor reclaimed some of that command.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's domestic agenda has slowed to a crawl as the rivals
debate economic plans, like a 2 percent levy on corporations that
was immediately dubbed a slush fund for next year's presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is accepted as fact here that a battle is under way within
the government to control economic policy _ and thus the nation's
wealth _ in order to finance the presidential race of next year's
favored candidate.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Yeltsin has been studiously quiet on the subject
of rivalries, except to say that they do not exist and that
Stepashin's government is a harmonious one.
</P>
<P>
   The latest flap bears all the earmarks of the domestic
situation, except that its international ramifications are far more
troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's conduct of the policy in Kosovo became increasingly
vague as the weeks of bombing dragged on, to the point where it was
not clear in the past week whether his top advisers were even
paying him much heed.
</P>
<P>
   After the president's personal envoy, Victor Chernomyrdin,
sealed the deal for the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo
last week, Yeltsin congratulated him for a job well done.
</P>
<P>
   But in discussions with parliament, the president's deputy
foreign minister disassociated his agency from the accord, saying
it was a cave-in to NATO demands. Senior military officials
privately called the agreement traitorous, and one of the Defense
Ministry's representatives at the talks, Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov,
said publicly that it was up to the public to decide whether
Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin had betrayed their country.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin met these attacks with official silence, a response that
has only placed the origins of this weekend's troop movement _ and
his control over events _ in even more doubt.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious is that some key Kremlin officials were left in
the dark when the decision was made to send an advance force of
some 200 Russian paratroopers to Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov initially said that the deployment
was a mistake and that the troops would be withdrawn, suggesting
that the Defense Ministry had acted on its own. But as dawn broke
and the troops stayed put, military officials issued their own
statement saying the troop movement was cleared at the highest
level.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, Chernomyrdin, said that he was not told in
advance about the deployment, either.
</P>
<P>
   There are growing hints, through press leaks and other sources,
that Yeltsin was in fact behind the entire move. But no one on the
outside appears to know for sure because the Kremlin refuses to
acknowledge it. Nor is it clear whether there are plans to deploy
still more troops, as has been rumored. Asked Saturday who was
responsible for the decision, Chernomyrdin replied: ``You will
learn from the president. He will say everything.''

NATO UNITS ENTER KOSOVO BUT RUSSIANS HOLD POSITION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KACANIK, Yugoslavia _ Some 4,000 NATO troops and armored
vehicles moved methodically into Kosovo early Saturday morning,
hours after a few hundred Russian soldiers infuriated and startled
Washington by driving into Pristina, the Kosovo capital, and taking
up positions at the military airport there.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing squabbling between Moscow and the West took
some luster off NATO's triumphal entry into the blasted province
after a 78-day bombing campaign, which succeeded in forcing the
Yugoslav government to cede effective control over Kosovo and allow
the eventual return of nearly a million refugees to what remains of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   As Yugoslav and Serbian army and police units continued to pull
out of the province, soldiers of the British 1st Battalion of the
Parachute Regiment, in combat fatigues and burgundy berets, landed
in Kosovo from Macedonia by helicopter about 5:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   They touched down about 15 miles into Kosovo to secure the main
road to Pristina as heavier-lift helicopters brought in jeeps and
armored personnel carriers to Kacanik. Later, infantry units,
including members of the Gurkha rifle regiment, began to move
slowly up the hot, dusty road toward Pristina, the Kosovo capital.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly the same time, some 1,200 French troops moved into
Kosovo to the east, but were apparently making slow progress over
heavily mined, rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Paul Gibson, commander of the British parachute
battalion, said his troops disarmed about 30 civilians and had
cordial discussions with Yugoslav army officers.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said he told a local commander of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, Xhabir Zhadku, to order his men ``to unload their weapons and
to shoulder them.'' Gibson said the commander told him he had 500
men, ``which was exaggerated'' by a factor of 10.
</P>
<P>
   He said Zhadku engaged him in a political discussion, saying,
``We've come this far, and we intend to get independence.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops, as the main part of this peacekeeping mission
authorized by the U.N. Security Council, are committed to
demilitarize the rebels and preserve Kosovo's status as a sovereign
part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Other British officers said they were allowing all uniformed
personnel to keep their weapons and were disarming civilians. But
they took sidearms from Yugoslav border control officers and gave
them a military escort to move north to Pristina. Customs officers
were allowed to remain at the crossing from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Adrian Freer, the overall regimental commander, said, ``The
operation is going reasonably well and I'm happy.'' Seventeen years
ago, he said, he took part in the decisive battle of the Falklands
war between Britain and Argentina, the capture of Mount Longden.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian troops camped in Pristina at Slatina Airport,
intended to be the headquarters for the entire KFOR, or Kosovo
Force, presented another military and diplomatic quandary for NATO.
NATO commanders considered an airborne operation early Saturday
morning to seize the airport from the Russians, British officers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Friday, the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said
that the entry by Russian forces into Kosovo was a mistake and that
they would withdraw. But a senior Russian officer said Saturday
morning that his troops, which moved into Kosovo from peacekeeping
duties in Bosnia, intended to stay in place as part of the
international security force.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to give his full name, but he was addressed as
``general,'' and he said that the Russians would be in Kosovo ``a
long time,'' and that more Russian troops would come.
</P>
<P>
   The race for Pristina had bizarre aspects, but the Russian
entrance into the capital created great enthusiasm among ordinary
Serbs, who greeted the Russians like a liberating army at about
1:30 Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs, many of whom are afraid of revenge from returning
Albanians, and are considering leaving here, yelled slogans of
gratitude to the Russians, and for President Boris Yeltsin. They
cheered, chanted and threw flowers at the Russian troops, and fired
hundreds of rounds of ammunition into the air for hours in
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, the streets of central Pristina were littered
with empty shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how much Belgrade, or the Kremlin,
had orchestrated the Russian move. The Russian military is angry
over Moscow's role in pushing the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, to give in to most of NATO's key demands, and has
insisted on having its own command structure if it is to
participate in the Kosovo force.
</P>
<P>
   One Yugoslav official said Saturday that the race between East
and West to Pristina was a pale comparison to the race to conquer
Hitler's Berlin as the Nazi regime collapsed. It reminded him, he
said, of Marx's dictum that history repeats itself, ``the first
time as tragedy, and the second as farce.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the Russian voice would soon become muted
in Kosovo's affairs as the rest of the NATO-led force moved into
the province and hundreds of thousands of Albanians began to return
to their homes, aided by thousands of foreign refugee workers.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But for poor Serbs from the western part of the province, close
to the Albanian border, events have been anything but farcical.
Thousands have already left for Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, near the airport, a column of poor Serbs from
Djakovica, a few miles from the Albanian border, waited for the
Serbian police to let them continue out of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Vukosav Slavkovic, 86, had just left the home of his
grandparents to travel with his family in a tiny red Yugo car to
relatives near Kragujevac. A battered suitcase sat on the roof,
with a large blanket. ``I left everything, a house and furniture,''
Slavkovic said. ``This is what we took, one blanket.''
</P>
<P>
   He was distraught and angry. ``When the Serbs had a state 600
years ago, Indians were hunting in California,'' he said. ``Why are
we guilty?''
</P>
<P>
   Every Serb from Djakovica would leave, said Dijana Ranlenovic,
21, who was fleeing with her family. ``In our whole building of
more than 40 apartments, just two Serb families are still there,''
she said, ``and they are refugees from Croatia.''
</P>
<P>
   The police tried to persuade the Djakovica Serbs to remain in
Kosovo, taking some of the families to houses where local Serbs
were prepared to let them stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are brothers, and if you leave tomorrow, we will also have
to leave,'' pleaded a local Serb, Milka Simonovic. ``If we have to
go later, let's go together.''
</P>
<P>
   As they talked, another long column of Yugoslav army vehicles
and soldiers moved up the road toward Pristina and then Serbia,
clearing out before the slow advance of NATO troops who were moving
up the same road, 50 miles behind.

<P>
   When the eminent politician Sir Robert Chiltern worries, he
bites his lip, and for most of ``An Ideal Husband,'' the Oscar
Wilde play that comes to the screen this week, he has plenty to
worry about. He is threatened with exposure for having sold a
government secret to a stock exchange speculator.
</P>
<P>
   The deed, done years before the curtain rises, laid the
foundation for Sir Robert's wealth and career as well as for a
witty play. Exposure now, at the height of his prospects, would
ruin his reputation and destroy his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   A century after the debut of ``An Ideal Husband,'' Wilde's
portrait of a successful politician trying to slip out of
humiliation retains a certain currency, while the portrait of his
wife seems like a daguerreotype that has faded from fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert's readiness to commit a new offense in an effort to
cover up an old one bears comparison with current events. Though he
doesn't resort to charges of a right-wing conspiracy, he denounces
any who would criticize him as ``men who, each one of them, have
worse secrets in their own lives.'' Take that, Congress!
</P>
<P>
   Like generations of lip-biters, Sir Robert tries to talk his way
out of trouble by glossing over his act: ``The affair to which you
allude was no more than a speculation. The House of Commons had not
yet passed the bill; it might have been rejected.'' But, alas,
there is an incriminating letter afloat that even a glib politician
would be hard put to explain. (Victorian playwrights had to make do
without the evidence of a stained frock.)
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert, along with the play, is saved by some mechanics of
19th-century melodrama, but he is almost done in by his moralizing
wife, for whom he represents the ideal husband. To his explanation
that ``Sooner or later in political life one has to compromise,''
she instructs him in female psychology straight out of romance
fiction: ``Robert, men can love what is beneath them, things
unworthy, stained, dishonored. We women worship when we love and
when we lose our worship, we lose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with being a threat to her husband, Lady Chiltern's
worshipful attitude is an offense to feminism, which was astir at
the time. She is assuredly no model for today's achieving woman. If
she had political ambitions of her own, say to run for senator from
New York; if she had a career, perhaps as an Arkansas lawyer, that
brought her into dubious company; if she had made surprising
amounts of money in problematic ways, then she might well have
collaborated sensibly in the cover-up, although at the expense of
an enjoyable plot.
</P>
<P>
   But what prudent spouse with the slightest acquaintance with
politics would advance the dangerous proposition ``that a person
who has once been guilty of a dishonest and dishonorable action may
be guilty of it a second time, and should be shunned''? An
invitation to voters?
</P>
<P>
   As Lady Chiltern, more bent on saving her husband's soul than
his career, urges him into assured destruction, she preaches, ``I
don't think you realize sufficiently, Robert, that you have brought
into the political life of our time a nobler atmosphere, an inner
attitude towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher
ideals.'' Some consolation for a man whose career is going down the
drain.
</P>
<P>
   Today's more knowing spouse would surely be found off the
pedestal and at rallies celebrating her husband's record of
accomplishment: The economy is perking, the electorate is tranquil.
And anyway, the offense was small. Sir Robert claims he did not
make much money on the deal after all, that he has since given away
far more in public charities. To which his friend Lord Goring, who
utters Wilde's best lines, cracks: ``In public charities? Dear me!
What a lot of harm you must have done, Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lord Goring asks, ``How could you have sold yourself for
money?'' Sir Robert produces one of those parsings that have lately
become famous: ``I did not sell myself for money. I bought success
at a great price. That is all.'' Oscar! Thou shouldst be living at
this hour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wilde's own attitude, delivered via Lord Goring, combines what
today's audience might dismiss as a dated and dreamy depiction of
women's role in public life with an acute view of the politician's
reason for being. ``Failure to Robert would be the very mire of
shame,'' he warns Lady Chiltern. ``Power is his passion. He would
lose everything, even his power to love.'' No contemporary woman
requires such a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   The discerning Lord Goring could not fail to note that these
days the sexes are equally prone to the appeals of power and
ambition, which can make for ideal bedfellows as the campaign grows
hot.

<P>
   When the eminent politician Sir Robert Chiltern worries, he
bites his lip, and for most of ``An Ideal Husband,'' the Oscar
Wilde play that comes to the screen this week, he has plenty to
worry about. He is threatened with exposure for having sold a
government secret to a stock exchange speculator.
</P>
<P>
   The deed, done years before the curtain rises, laid the
foundation for Sir Robert's wealth and career as well as for a
witty play. Exposure now, at the height of his prospects, would
ruin his reputation and destroy his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   A century after the debut of ``An Ideal Husband,'' Wilde's
portrait of a successful politician trying to slip out of
humiliation retains a certain currency, while the portrait of his
wife seems like a daguerreotype that has faded from fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert's readiness to commit a new offense in an effort to
cover up an old one bears comparison with current events. Though he
doesn't resort to charges of a right-wing conspiracy, he denounces
any who would criticize him as ``men who, each one of them, have
worse secrets in their own lives.'' Take that, Congress!
</P>
<P>
   Like generations of lip-biters, Sir Robert tries to talk his way
out of trouble by glossing over his act: ``The affair to which you
allude was no more than a speculation. The House of Commons had not
yet passed the bill; it might have been rejected.'' But, alas,
there is an incriminating letter afloat that even a glib politician
would be hard put to explain. (Victorian playwrights had to make do
without the evidence of a stained frock.)
</P>
<P>
   Sir Robert, along with the play, is saved by some mechanics of
19th-century melodrama, but he is almost done in by his moralizing
wife, for whom he represents the ideal husband. To his explanation
that ``Sooner or later in political life one has to compromise,''
she instructs him in female psychology straight out of romance
fiction: ``Robert, men can love what is beneath them, things
unworthy, stained, dishonored. We women worship when we love and
when we lose our worship, we lose everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with being a threat to her husband, Lady Chiltern's
worshipful attitude is an offense to feminism, which was astir at
the time. She is assuredly no model for today's achieving woman. If
she had political ambitions of her own, say to run for senator from
New York; if she had a career, perhaps as an Arkansas lawyer, that
brought her into dubious company; if she had made surprising
amounts of money in problematic ways, then she might well have
collaborated sensibly in the cover-up, although at the expense of
an enjoyable plot.
</P>
<P>
   But what prudent spouse with the slightest acquaintance with
politics would advance the dangerous proposition ``that a person
who has once been guilty of a dishonest and dishonorable action may
be guilty of it a second time, and should be shunned''? An
invitation to voters?
</P>
<P>
   As Lady Chiltern, more bent on saving her husband's soul than
his career, urges him into assured destruction, she preaches, ``I
don't think you realize sufficiently, Robert, that you have brought
into the political life of our time a nobler atmosphere, an inner
attitude towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher
ideals.'' Some consolation for a man whose career is going down the
drain.
</P>
<P>
   Today's more knowing spouse would surely be found off the
pedestal and at rallies celebrating her husband's record of
accomplishment: The economy is perking, the electorate is tranquil.
And anyway, the offense was small. Sir Robert claims he did not
make much money on the deal after all, that he has since given away
far more in public charities. To which his friend Lord Goring, who
utters Wilde's best lines, cracks: ``In public charities? Dear me!
What a lot of harm you must have done, Robert.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lord Goring asks, ``How could you have sold yourself for
money?'' Sir Robert produces one of those parsings that have lately
become famous: ``I did not sell myself for money. I bought success
at a great price. That is all.'' Oscar! Thou shouldst be living at
this hour.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wilde's own attitude, delivered via Lord Goring, combines what
today's audience might dismiss as a dated and dreamy depiction of
women's role in public life with an acute view of the politician's
reason for being. ``Failure to Robert would be the very mire of
shame,'' he warns Lady Chiltern. ``Power is his passion. He would
lose everything, even his power to love.'' No contemporary woman
requires such a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   The discerning Lord Goring could not fail to note that these
days the sexes are equally prone to the appeals of power and
ambition, which can make for ideal bedfellows as the campaign grows
hot.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Broken bands of showers will reach the coast from southern New
England to North Carolina on Sunday as weak low pressure drifts
near the Virginia Coast. Clouds will spread as far west as the
central Appalachians as onshore winds draw ocean moisture inland.
Meanwhile, ample sunshine and very warm conditions will persist
from northern New England through the eastern Ohio Valley where
afternoon temperatures near 90 will be common.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry air will cover a large area from the Southeastern States
to the Great Lakes. Scattered afternoon showers and thunderstorms
will erupt in the humid air mass during the heat of the afternoon
especially in the southern Mississippi Valley and near the Gulf of
Mexico Coast. Weak high-level winds will result in some slow-moving
thunderstorms which will produce local flooding rain. Farther
north, some potent storms will also develop from central Missouri
to the central Great Lakes States as a cold front arrives from the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler and less humid air will follow a front over the northern
parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley. Farther south, some
strong thunderstorms with areas of torrential rain will develop
from the eastern slopes of the central and southern Rockies to
western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interior West will be very warm with plentiful
sunshine, although some afternoon clouds will develop over many
mountain peaks in central and northern sections.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Arlene with central winds around 50 mph will
drift over the central Atlantic around 500 miles southeast of
Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Summer In Buffalo
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, N.Y., sunshine is abundant in the summer, but heat
is uncommon. On Friday, the mercury at the Buffalo surged to 90
degrees marking the first time since August 19, 1995, that the
90-degree threshold had been reached. Nearby Lake Erie, which is
the breeding ground for Buffalo's famous winter snows, is also
responsible for the pleasant summer climate. Prevailing breezes
from the cool waters typically keep temperatures in the upper 70s
during summer days and discourage the growth of cumulus clouds. On
Friday, winds from the southeast brought the unusual heat to
Buffalo.

U.S. TRIES TO SORT OUT RUSSIAN MOVE IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials expressed
puzzlement Saturday over the premature entry of Russian troops into
Kosovo on Friday but said they hoped it would turn out to be only a
``blip'' in the unfolding deployment of a large allied peacekeeping
force in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton scheduled a telephone call to Russian
President Boris Yeltsin but it was not expected to occur until
Sunday, the White House said. High-level talks between military and
foreign-affairs officials continued Saturday in an attempt to sort
out the muddle.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the administration publicly projected no sense of
urgency, adopting the same tone as NATO's leadership, the
continuing presence of Russian troops at the airport near Pristina,
Kosovo's capital, and their welcome by Serbian residents of the
area contrasted starkly with the White House's depiction of the
development as a mistake, a trivial matter or a mere enigma.
</P>
<P>
   The defense attache at the Russian Embassy in Belgium sent a
letter Saturday to the NATO Commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, informing
him that a vanguard element of Russian troops has been deployed at
the Pristina airport, officials said in Washington. The letter
suggested that the decision by the Russian troops to enter Kosovo
was not a mistake, as Russian officials _ and their Western
counterparts _ had said earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said that while the Russian troops
remained at the airport in Pristina, British troops had seized
control of the airfield and the surrounding region.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is that they're still there,'' the official said
of the Russian forces. ``Perhaps they trying to make some kind of
point, but we don't know what it is. They made public assurances on
television last night that they were leaving, but it appears
they're staying.''
</P>
<P>
   While officials said they were perplexed by the developments,
there was an expectation at the White House on Saturday that the
problem would be sorted out within the next day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confusion over Russian motives in Kosovo, the United
States held military-to-military talks with Russians throughout the
day to hammer out precise details of the Russian role in the
peacekeeping mission. Brig. Gen. George W. Casey of the Pentagon's
Policy and Planning staff and several Russian generals flew
together Saturday from Moscow to Macedonia aboard an American
military plane to continue those discussions, according to Kenneth
H. Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd very much like to work with the Russians in a mutually
cooperative and effective way,'' Bacon said. ``We worked this out
very well with the Russians in Bosnia and we expect to work it out
in Kosovo. They played a fundamental role in getting the peace
agreement in Kosovo. Now we'd like them to play a fundamental role
in implementing the agreement.``
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Casey is exploring Russian ideas about the unified
command required under the U.N. Security Council agreement and
where Russian troops will be stationed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those talks, and the talks in Moscow, are moving in the right
direction,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary.
``What shouldn't get lost in all of this is that KFOR deployed
today. That's the important news.''
</P>
<P>
   One senior official said that the Russians appeared to be
sending simultaneous and ambiguous signals to NATO, to the restive
Russian parliament and to the Serbian people. He said that, for the
moment, officials in Washington were not terribly concerned about
the Russian move. But he said that uncertainty about Moscow's
motives had cast at least a temporary pall over the entry of
American and European troops into the shattered Yugoslav province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our military people are all that worked up about
this,'' a senior administration aide said Saturday. ``They don't
like the idea they were lied to by the Russians. But on the other
hand, there's a lot going on in the Russian government, so who the
hell knows what they're up to.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that the Russian force's
operational security was good enough on Friday to prevent the U.S.
intelligence community from intercepting any communications
ordering the troops into Kosovo. Officials say they are not sure
whether any orders were issued from senior commanders at the last
minute to the troops because they have no intercepts to study. It
is possible they were working off orders issued earlier to avoid
interception by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they do not believe all of the
Russian troops that are planned for deployment to Kosovo will come
from the contingent in Bosnia, but officials interviewed Saturday
morning could not say how many Russian troops are expected.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The confusion over the timing and location of the deployment of
Russian troops in Kosovo arose from the unexpectedly abrupt end of
the air campaign and the vague terms under which the conflict
ended. NATO and the Russians had not yet agreed on Moscow's role in
the peacekeeping operation or on the complex issues of command and
control of forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow might have been trying to settle some of those questions
pre-emptively by dispatching its troops to Pristina, an
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still undetermined is where Russian troops will be stationed in
Kosovo, which for now has been divided into five military sectors
to be supervised by the Americans, British, French, Germans and
Italians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know ultimately where the Russians will be,'' a
senior official here said. ``All the sectors will have
participation by a number of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   But this official emphasized that wherever the Russian forces
are stationed, they will be under NATO command, even if the
alliance has to devise some sort of fig leaf to disguise the fact
that Russian troops are reporting to a NATO officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a unified command structure, I can assure you,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration aide said that the sense in
Washington on Saturday was that the perplexing Russian move was at
worst a temporary hurdle at the outset of a long military and
humanitarian operation. Moscow never approved of the NATO bombing
of Serbia, a historical ally of Russia, and might feel the need to
assert its independence from the alliance for domestic political
consumption and to signal its sympathy to the Serb populace, this
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear whether this is a stunt or something serious,''
the official said. ``But we're trying not to get distracted by
something that in the long run won't be important. We hope it's
just a blip.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is trying to devise a
way for the Russians to take part in the peacekeeping operation in
a way that does not violate the unity of command, this aide said.
He said that Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov were trying
to persuade the political leadership of the Russian parliament that
Russian troops will not be answering to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a serious problem in the Duma,'' he said, referring
to Russia's lower house of parliament. ``They're trying to show
that they're playing a real role but not taking orders from NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the first reaction in Washington to the
arrival of Russian troops in Pristina was surprise and anger.
</P>
<P>
   But those feelings soon gave way to puzzlement over Russian
motives and a determination to move forward with military and
diplomatic talks to resolve the matter and speed the entry of
Western forces into Kosovo.

   WASHINGTON _ The future leadership of the U.S. Embassy in
Luxembourg, a landlocked European duchy with about as many people
as Oklahoma City, might seem an unlikely issue to pit the White
House against the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But the appointment of a gay San Francisco businessman as the
new U.S. ambassador there has provoked a clash between two of the
most venerable _ and arguably most anachronistic _ traditions of
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the right of the White House to make government
appointments during congressional recesses without Senate
confirmation vs. the right of individual senators to block any
nomination that comes before them. Recess appointments vs.
nomination holds.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably safe to say that the Founding Fathers never
envisioned this type of showdown. The concepts of both recess
appointments and nomination holds reflect the interests of a
different era of American history. When the Founding Fathers sat
down to hammer out the Constitution, they believed that Congress
would often be out of session, with lawmakers returning to their
states by horse and buggy, and out of contact for weeks or months
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   So they came up with the idea of recess appointments, enabling
the president to make important appointments _ Cabinet members,
ambassadors, judges _ when Congress was not in session and senators
were not available to give their ``advice and consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Senate meets most of the year, and members travel by
jet and can be back in Washington for an important vote within
hours. But still, the recess appointment privilege lives on, and
presidents continue to use _ and possibly abuse _ their power to
push through appointments that would otherwise never be approved by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The current struggle began when President Clinton used the
Senate's Memorial Day recess as an opportunity to appoint James
Hormel as the nation's first openly gay ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   He sent Hormel to Luxembourg without seeking Senate approval
under a 32-word clause in the Constitution that permits the
president ``to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the
recess of the Senate.'' Hormel can serve until the end of the next
session of Congress, which is likely to be the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Hormel, heir to his family's meat-processing
fortune and a prominent backer of gay-rights groups, caused a furor
among conservative Senate Republicans who had opposed the
nomination because of his sexual orientation when it was first
offered two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And many Republicans complained that the appointment amounted to
pandering to gay-rights organizations that are expected to provide
important backing to Vice President Gore in the next year's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, one outraged Republican, Sen. James Inhofe of
Oklahoma, invoked the traditional privilege of any senator to block
_ or hold _ Senate approval for nominations by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While nomination holds in the Senate are not enshrined in the
Constitution, they have nearly as long a history as recess
appointments, and reflect the view of early members of the Senate
that the body should operate by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe, known for both stubbornness and fierce conservatism,
accused Hormel of promoting a ``gay agenda'' and vowed to block all
White House nominations until he receives a commitment from Clinton
to strictly limit the use of recess appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The move could delay Senate confirmation for both Lawrence
Summers to be treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke to be the
next chief diplomat at the United Nations. If Inhofe insists and is
willing to block every presidential nomination that comes to the
Senate floor, he can only be stopped, under Senate rules, by a vote
of 60 members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Controversy over recess appointments dates from the earliest
days of the Republic. President George Washington used a Senate
recess in the summer of 1795 to appoint John Rutledge of South
Carolina as chief justice, knowing that the majority Federalists in
the Senate were hostile to Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge had presided over only two cases as chief justice when
the Senate returned from its recess that fall and, presented by
Washington with a formal nomination, voted to reject it, forcing
Rutledge from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower placed three justices on the
Supreme Court during recesses: Earl Warren, William Brennan and
Potter Stewart, all of whom were later confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan made liberal use of the power and granted 239
recess appointments, prompting a fight with the Senate similar to
the one involving Inhofe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was then majority
leader, placed holds on nearly 6,000 presidential nominations in
protest over what he described as Reagan's effort to circumvent
Congress with recess appointments. Reagan eventually agreed to
limit the appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dove, the Senate's parliamentarian, said the use of
nomination holds reflects the Senate's view of itself as a place of
cautious deliberation, where all voices will be heard and where a
senator from a small, underpopulated state has as much power as a
senator from the largest state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the system works amazing well,'' Dove said. ``Senators
are normally very restrained in the use of their powers because
they need to form alliances if they want to get things done. From
an idea of pure democracy, that's why the Senate is here _ to force
consensus.''

Constitution, they have nearly as long a history as recess
appointments, and reflect the view of early members of the Senate
that the body should operate by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Inhofe, known for both stubbornness and fierce conservatism,
accused Hormel of promoting a ``gay agenda'' and vowed to block all
White House nominations until he receives a commitment from Clinton
to strictly limit the use of recess appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The move could delay Senate confirmation for both Lawrence
Summers to be treasury secretary and Richard Holbrooke to be the
next chief diplomat at the United Nations. If Inhofe insists and is
willing to block every presidential nomination that comes to the
Senate floor, he can only be stopped, under Senate rules, by a vote
of 60 members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Controversy over recess appointments dates from the earliest
days of the Republic. President George Washington used a Senate
recess in the summer of 1795 to appoint John Rutledge of South
Carolina as chief justice, knowing that the majority Federalists in
the Senate were hostile to Rutledge.
</P>
<P>
   Rutledge had presided over only two cases as chief justice when
the Senate returned from its recess that fall and, presented by
Washington with a formal nomination, voted to reject it, forcing
Rutledge from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower placed three justices on the
Supreme Court during recesses: Earl Warren, William Brennan and
Potter Stewart, all of whom were later confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan made liberal use of the power and granted 239
recess appointments, prompting a fight with the Senate similar to
the one involving Inhofe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was then majority
leader, placed holds on nearly 6,000 presidential nominations in
protest over what he described as Reagan's effort to circumvent
Congress with recess appointments. Reagan eventually agreed to
limit the appointments.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dove, the Senate's parliamentarian, said the use of
nomination holds reflects the Senate's view of itself as a place of
cautious deliberation, where all voices will be heard and where a
senator from a small, underpopulated state has as much power as a
senator from the largest state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the system works amazing well,'' Dove said. ``Senators
are normally very restrained in the use of their powers because
they need to form alliances if they want to get things done. From
an idea of pure democracy, that's why the Senate is here _ to force
consensus.''

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ During the flurry of NATO meetings that have
accompanied the Kosovo crisis, a strange sight has been seen
several times. The foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey, the
alliance's bitterest rivals, have huddled for private talks.
</P>
<P>
   They have discussed ways to bring Yugoslav leaders to the
negotiating table, plans for sheltering refugees and ideas about
increasing the weight of NATO's southeastern flank. In fact, they
have discussed just about everything but the issue that people want
them to discuss: Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
   Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said after one
conference that he and his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, have
``very good personal communication.'' He even said he was open to
``new ideas and proposals'' to resolve the issues that have divided
the two nations for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo crisis has underlined once more how closely Greek and
Turkish strategic interests coincide. Both would benefit enormously
from stability in the Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. Yet,
in one of the most persistent and puzzling anomalies of modern
geopolitics, their dispute remains seemingly intractable. Though
joined by geography and history, they are divided by one of the
world's angriest and longest-running blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   The feud has taken a turn for the worse in recent months,
following the capture of Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah Ocalan.
Ocalan, who is reviled in Turkey as a terrorist responsible for
thousands of deaths, was found to have been living under the
protection of Greek diplomats in Kenya. Turkish leaders accused
Greece of supporting a mass murderer in an effort to sow chaos in
Turkey. Greek leaders shot back, calling Turkey a thinly disguised
military dictatorship that brought the Kurdish problem on itself
through discrimination and repression.
</P>
<P>
   If Turks are outraged by Greece's role in protecting Ocalan,
Greece also has a new focus for its anger. Turkish leaders have
begun asserting that there are political ``gray zones'' in the
Aegean Sea, suggesting that Turkey has designs on islands that have
long been considered Greek. Dozens of interviews in both countries
suggest that the animosity between these neighbors is fed by a
combination of prejudice and political competition. But they also
revealed hope that a more positive relationship might emerge out of
the current trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I am in Greece, what strikes me is how alike we
are,'' said Orhan Taylan, a Turkish painter who is a member of a
small Greek-Turkish friendship group. ``We have the same emotions,
we tell the same jokes, we eat the same food, we listen to the same
music, we look at the world the same way. That's what makes it so
awful that this conflict just keeps dragging on.''
</P>
<P>
   Studying the psychology of Greek-Turkish relations is a passion
for historian Hercules Millas, who was born to Greek parents in
Istanbul and considers himself at home in both countries. ``Neither
side has any empathy with the other or any doubt that it is 100
percent right,'' Millas said. ``The Turk you know personally may be
good, but the Turkish nation as a whole is a brutal and warlike
enemy. For Turks, Greeks are liars, full of intrigues and bad
intentions, definitely not to be trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has nearly six times the population of Greece, a much
more powerful army and a crucial location that makes it a highly
desirable ally. Greece is more developed and widely considered more
democratic, but Turkey has far greater strategic value.
</P>
<P>
   History plays a great role in creating the suspicions that
infect the Greek-Turkish relationship. These may be the only two
countries in the world that fought their definitive wars of
liberation against each other. After centuries of subjugation,
Greeks drove out the Ottoman Turks to emerge as an independent
state in the 1820s, and a century later, amid the wreckage of the
Ottoman Empire, Turks drove Greek forces from Anatolia to establish
the Turkish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the nations warmed during the 1930s, but then
cooled and reached a breaking point in 1974, when Turkish forces
landed on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus and occupied a
substantial part of it. Turkey said it was acting to prevent the
slaughter of ethnic Turks by the ethnic Greek majority. Greece
called the act an illegal invasion of a sovereign country that
proved Turkey's expansionist nature.
</P>
<P>
   A few isolated rays of light have fallen on the Greek-Turkish
relationship in the quarter-century since the Cyprus operation, but
they have not been enough to brighten the darkness that has come to
envelop it. The nations have come to the brink of war several
times, most recently over a barren Aegean islet in 1996. Their
naval units still conduct maneuvers in the Aegean at the same time,
and their pilots routinely engage in mock dogfights.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion that many ordinary Greeks and Turks harbor for
each other is fed by a remarkable lack of contact. There is little
trade between the two nations. Greeks and Turks rarely visit each
other's countries, and very few speak the other's language.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish leaders insist they can begin no dialogue with Greece
until the Greek government closes what they say are camps used to
train Kurdish guerrillas in Greece and declares the guerrilla
group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, a terrorist
organization. But Papandreou insisted in an interview that there
are no guerrilla camps in Greece, and that his government is not
prepared to label the PKK terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   The PKK is not a legal organization in Greece and is not allowed
to exist here,'' Papandreou said. ``We do not say that it is or is
not a terrorist group. I think it's putting a blindfold on the
problem to say that this is only a problem of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days following Ocalan's capture in Kenya last February,
Greece was shaken by a political earthquake. Three ministers and
the chief of the intelligence service were forced to resign. Their
successors, including Papandreou, are considered strong supporters
of the relatively moderate prime minister, Constantine Simitis, and
less likely to embark on provocative adventures like sheltering a
man who is the most wanted fugitive in a nearby country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to come out of the worst of it not only
unscathed, but with some very positive changes,'' said Theodore
Couloumbis, director of the Hellenic Foundation for European and
Foreign Policy. ``We're leaving behind this idea that the enemy of
our enemy is our friend, which got us into this huge mess in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkish anger over Greece's support for Ocalan has not faded,
however, and the victory of nationalist parties in Turkey's April
election may have made compromise more difficult. One of the elder
statesmen of Greek politics, Defense Minister Apostolos
Tsohatzopoulos, is among those who hope that the shock of the
Ocalan affair will lead to a new dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very heavy blow to Greece, and it created a
political and ethical crisis here,'' Tsohatzopoulos said. ``I see
it as a chance to change the bad perceptions that exist.''

 &HT;    DYING AS REFUGEES: Sadly, some will never return home to Kosovo

   KUKES, Albania _ Peace did not come soon enough for Halil Emini.
</P>
<P>
   He did not get killed by Yugoslav forces or NATO bombs. He just
drowned Friday while swimming with his children near their refugee
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of planning a return to his homeland, Emini lies
under a mound of dirt on a plateau with 140 other deceased ethnic
Albanians who fled Kosovo during the Serbs' ethnic cleansing
campaign. In a new section the local city cemetery, their graves
show the signs of a people dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden stakes mark the identities of the dead. Their names,
birth dates and home villages are marked with a ballpoint pen and
usually, to protect them from the elements, covered by half of an
old plastic soft-drink bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the hubbub of the crowded refugee camps, there is
cemetery silence here. The wind rustles through the trees, only
occasionally interrupted by crackling gunfire from a nearby Kosovo
Liberation Army training ground.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a few graves carry the wreaths and ribbons of slain
fighters in the rebel KLA. But most here died in mundane ways -- a
child hanged accidentally on a rope in a refugee camp, a
middle-aged man had a heart attack, many died of old age. A baby
died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials say mortality rates are normal among the refugees,
maybe even lower for people in camps than those traveling roads and
doing work. Figures were not available, but as many as 500 have
died among Albania's 440,000 Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees' long wait for NATO troops to move into Kosovo came
to an end Saturday, as the vanguard of British forces began
streaming into Pristina, determined to ensure peace in the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   The was no jubilation among the families of Emini and others for
whom the entry of NATO forces came too late, however.
</P>
<P>
   While death is a fact of life, for refugees it comes on a
foreign land, where they die in new-found poverty and far from
realizing their dreams of returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Just an hour after Emini's death, his widow huddled silently
with other women in one of the 200 tents at the seedy Bashkia
refugee camp. A bearded man, a relative, squatted on the hard red
dirt near the tent flaps and cried. A group of men stood nearby,
angry and sad and lamenting their plight.
</P>
<P>
   They described Emini as a 38-year-old dye supervisor in a
textile plant in the Kosovo provincial district of Opoja. He was
tall and thin.
</P>
<P>
   They said he was quieter and poorer than the other refugees. He
had traveled for about a week on a neighbor's tractor to flee
marauding Serb troops and paramilitary thugs and arrived here April
4.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, when word came of the peace agreement between the NATO
alliance and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovic, Emini did not
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said this is the moment to be very careful, that we cannot
trust anything until we touch the realities,'' said friend Nazim
Tahiri.
</P>
<P>
   There is little to do in the Bashkia camp, run by the Kukes
municipality. The tents lack the double-sheeting that can provide
insulation from the sweltering sun. So people leave for a half-hour
walk to the White Drin River, which flows from Kosovo. The
turquoise water is less peaceful than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a child found an old hand grenade in the river
and got his hand blown off. Friday, swimming with his 12-year-old
daughter, and eight- and six-year-old sons, Emini apparently
strayed past a steep drop off of the river bed. He called for help,
but no one could reach him in time.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, his brother-in-law was helping plan his pauper's
funeral, clearly frustrated as much as saddened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was thinking we should go back as soon as it is safe,''
Ramadan Jafir, 40, said. ``That is our place. That is our land.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday morning, about 200 men from the camp were trudging
away from the Muslim funeral for Emini in the Kukes cemetery. They
wrote his name on a stake and jammed it in a large mound of dirt
over Emini's plain wooden casket, then slipped a two-liter soda
bottle over it and poured water on the grave, as is customary here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their place is in Kosovo so it is better they should be buried
there than here,'' said Idriz Gjana(CQ), a Kukes Albanian who earns
about $60 a month digging graves. ``But, since they were pushed out
and died here, this land is theirs as much as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Gjana said many Kosovar Albanians say they will someday return
to take their family members' bodies back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But aid officials say that the destruction in Kosovo, a southern
province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, may require
half the refugees here to wait months before returning.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the camps, which are becoming more developed and
entrenched, the graveyard is taking on signs of permanence. Gjana
said they must always have a few empty graves ready. A few actual
headstones are appearing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one has an epitaph, those words used to sum up a
life.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two cloth flowers on the smooth white cement stone
of 70-year-old Abedin Liman Telaku, it names his village as Banje
and says simply, ``Forced out by Serbs.''

   MOSCOW _ Jolted by Russia's surprise decision to be the first to
send peacekeeping troops into Kosovo, American diplomats and
military representatives held talks with Russian counterparts
Saturday that were clouded by distrust and confusion over whether
President Boris Yeltsin himself had ordered the deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, held in Moscow and Macedonia, centered on how to make
the best of the de facto presence of some 200 Russian soldiers in
Kosovo. The suspicions of Russia's intentions were heightened by
the growing consensus in Moscow that the deployment was no mistake,
as Russia's top diplomats had originally suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you slice it, I don't think sending Russian
troops into Kosovo has been a particularly helpful step,'' said a
Clinton administration official in Moscow. ``Overall, this kind of
confusion in Russian government ranks, and Russian troops leaving
Bosnia without notification, doesn't help Russia's credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, ordered back to Moscow
late Friday after the Russian troop movements became known, met
through the night, and again Saturday, with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov. Talbott was scheduled to meet with Vladimir
Putin, chairman of Russia's security council, later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yeltsin has yet to make any public comment on the troop
deployment, some observers here suggested that the decision to put
Russians in the Kosovo capital, Pristina, well ahead of their NATO
counterparts was made inside the Kremlin itself.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the order came from the Russian Defense Ministry or
the Kremlin, it was obvious Saturday that the move had been planned
well in advance. As one source told the Interfax news agency, this
was ``not an amateur'' operation.
</P>
<P>
   There were other signs Saturday that at least part of the
Russian political establishment is trying to torpedo any future
Russian cooperation with NATO in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One official unnamed source, also quoted by Interfax, accused
the Americans of trying ``to usurp the right to its own exclusive
presence in the region, leaving a secondary role for Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Such statements ran counter to the more official comments on
Saturday's negotiations with Talbott, which suggested that some
headway had been made. More talks at the Foreign Ministry are
planned for either Saturday or Sunday, Talbott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is expected to talk by telephone with President Clinton
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The main issue in the talks is to match Russia's insistence on
its own command for its proposed 2,500 troops in Kosovo, with
NATO's stance that the international force be led by a ``unified
command'' structure, with NATO at its core.
</P>
<P>
   That issue _ left unresolved in the peace agreement accepted by
Belgrade last week _ has been the stumbling block for the smooth
introduction of an international force into Kosovo. NATO began
moving its own troops into the province Saturday afternoon, 12
hours after the small Russian contingent arrived in Pristina, to a
delirious welcome by local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Gen. George Casey, a one-star American general
attached to the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has accompanied Talbott
on Kosovo negotiations, left Moscow Saturday morning with two
Russian military commanders to join negotiations, now underway in
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kremlin Saturday, where Yeltsin was reported to have met
with top government officials, including Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev, official spokesmen cast little light on the question of
whether Yeltsin himself gave the orders for the Russian troops to
proceed into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But new pieces of evidence _ plus the Kremlin's failure to
disown the troop deployment _ suggest that the president made the
decision himself, apparently without notifying the Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other clues was the announcement Saturday that Yeltsin
had decorated Viktor Zavarvin, Russia's military representative to
NATO who accompanied the Russian troops to Pristina, and promoted
him from lieutenant general to colonel general.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation here and in the West had first focused on the
possibility of a breakaway decision by the Russian military to make
a unilateral move into Kosovo. That theory was supported by the
unusual statement by Ivanov, delivered to the CNN television
network midway through a marathon negotiating session with Talbott,
in which he said the troop deployment had been an unfortunate
mistake, and that an order to pull back had been issued.
</P>
<P>
   As the day progressed, no such withdrawal order was announced.
Instead, by late afternoon, Interfax quoted military and diplomatic
sources as saying that ``an additional contingent of several
hundred servicemen'' is being prepared to be airlifted to Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   According to Interfax, the additional troops would fly through
air space provided by Ukraine and Bulgaria, after Hungary _ one of
NATO's three new member states _ denied Russia air rights.
</P>
<P>
   The same sources, insisting that the order to deploy had come
from the ``highest levels,'' told Interfax that Russia had had to
deploy Friday night or else it would have ended up being squeezed
out of the international security force.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Interfax reports, again quoting unnamed
sources, Moscow had become increasingly convinced that negotiations
were a facade, behind which NATO would proceed with its own
deployment. ``Moscow was made to move ahead,'' the agency quoted
one official as saying, noting that the troop deployment had been
planned long in advance.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised interview, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special
Kosovo negotiator, said Yeltsin will clarify his position Sunday.
``You will learn from the president, he will say everything'' said
Chernomyrdin, who noted that he himself had not been informed of
the troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear when, how, or if Russia had coordinated the
troop deployment with Yugoslavia. Top Yugoslav military officers
traditionally have maintained strong ties with their counterparts
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's top foreign policy adviser, Sergei Prikhodko, also
dodged the issue in a statement issued late Saturday, in which he
said ``the deployment of the advance unit of a Russian peacekeeping
contingent is part of the first phase of the international security
presence in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Necessary presidential directives in regard to such presence
are available,'' said Prikhodko. ``Responsibility for their
scrupulous implementation rests with the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Kremlin official, who asked to be unnamed, said the main
issue now was to press ahead with a negotiated settlement on the
thorny issue of a mutually acceptable command structure. ``All the
problems that have developed in recent hours are technical
problems, minor problems,'' he said.``Now we are looking forward,
rather than backward.''
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that Yeltsin _ and not the Russian military _
played the role of hawk in the late stage of the Kosovo peace
negotiations runs counter to a view, held by some in Western
governments, that the Russian president has steered Russian policy
on Yugoslavia away from any confrontation with the NATO allies.

   Tradition says that when someone interested in converting to
Judaism knocks on a synagogue's door, the rabbi should turn him
away _ not once but three times, to test the seriousness of the
person's intent. Unlike Christianity, Judaism emphatically shuns
proselytizing.
</P>
<P>
   But even if many rabbis today are not so discouraging as that,
what would happen if they took a really different tack and
encouraged spiritual seekers to embrace Judaism?
</P>
<P>
   That idea is gaining attention _ and some hot criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Among its exponents is Gary Tobin, president of the Institute
for Jewish and Community Research in San Francisco, who advocates
``a positive, welcoming approach to non-Jews becoming Jews.''
Tobin, the author of ``Opening the Gates: How Proactive Conversion
Can Revitalize the Jewish Community'' (Jossey-Bass), is not alone
in the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Rabbi Alexander Schindler, then president of the
Union of American Hebrew Congregations, Reform Judaism's synagogue
organization, spoke publicly of the value of reaching out to the
unaffiliated. Abraham's tent, he said, ``was continually open on
all four sides for fear that he would miss a wandering nomad and
fail to bid him enter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, the organization has offered a free program,
advertised in secular newspapers and hosted by synagogues around
the country. ``A Taste of Judaism'' has sessions on Jewish
spirituality, ethics and community.
</P>
<P>
   This program has attracted 17,000 people, half of them Jews
interested in learning more about their faith, the other half
non-Jews, according to the union's director of outreach, Dru
Greenwood. A union survey found that one in seven among the
non-Jews went on to study for conversion.
</P>
<P>
   One ``Taste of Judaism'' class this spring at the South Street
Temple in Lincoln, Neb., drew about 80 people, including Jews,
Christians, agnostics and others. Afterward, 10 non-Jews expressed
interest in conversion; none of them was married to a Jewish
partner, said Cantor Michael Weisser, the synagogue's spiritual
leader. ``I think what attracts non-Jewish people to Judaism once
they get a tiny taste of it is the logic of it, the ability to
argue with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one, though, has suggested that Jews should be out ringing
doorbells or passing out magazines. Jewish outreach efforts, like
the union's program and similar efforts elsewhere, are restrained,
taking the form of invitations to study and directed primarily
toward people with family ties to Jews, or those already seriously
interested in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in a conference at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New
York City in May, Tobin said the Jewish community would help itself
by reaching out to non-Jewish partners in interfaith marriages,
their children, people with some Jewish ancestry and gentiles
spiritually searching. Converts bring an enthusiasm for their new
identity that inspires other Jews, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New converts, Tobin said in an interview, are not a magic bullet
to remedy Jews' concerns about cultural assimilation, a low birth
rate and the rise in marriages between Jews and non-Jews, which
many fear often produces families without a clear identity. Rather,
reaching out is an expression of American Jews' position in a
democratic, religiously pluralistic society. ``We're strong enough
and secure enough that we can think about growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Converts are already a presence in American Jewish life. Most
who convert are married or engaged to Jews. Of the nation's 6
million Jews, about 180,000, or 3 percent, identify themselves as
converts, or ``Jews by choice.''
</P>
<P>
   This discussion has taken place amid two larger trends.
Anti-Semitism has declined in America, removing a barrier against
assimilation but also making it socially easier for non-Jews to
consider conversion. A widespread search for spirituality is also
running at high tide.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant churches lost their dominance of the religious
culture years ago. Their influence was offset by what many perceive
as a free market of faiths more or less equally competing for the
attention of spiritual seekers, said Rabbi A. James Rudin,
interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Jewish groups should enter this free market is
another matter. Some reject efforts at major outreach as faddish, a
threat to provoke counter-efforts by some Christian groups or, at
worst, a waste of time, talent and money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a deep concern about this kind of approach among
people in all sectors of American Judaism,'' said Jack Wertheimer,
provost and professor of American Jewish history at the Jewish
Theological Seminary in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer said he was not against people converting to Judaism.
But he objected to major efforts because they amounted to ``an
expression of panic, a real lack of faith'' in ``traditional
methods of transmitting Jewish identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as critical is Rabbi Ephraim Buchwald, director of the
Jewish National Outreach Program, which runs short courses in basic
Judaism, essential Hebrew and a beginners' religious service, all
designed to bring Jews closer to their faith. Buchwald spoke at
Tobin's conference, declaring that the Jewish community needed to
invest far more time and money in educating Jewish children so they
would not lose their identity.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ``expend Jewish resources trying to convince a
gentile to put on a yarmulke,'' Buchwald said at the conference,
the future depended on exposing Jewish children to the ``joyous,
optimistic side of Judaism.''  &QL;

AID AGENCIES SHIFT FOCUS TO THE NEEDS INSIDE BORDER
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ The refugees stopped arriving only three days
ago, but now, like trying to turn around a battleship, the aid
agencies handling the 120,000 Kosovo Albanians in this border town
are having to reverse focus to the refugees' safe return _ plus
preparing to feed and help shelter an estimated 500,000 Albanians
still inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not been the biggest refugee movement, and it's not
been the worst emergency, but it's shaping up to be by far the most
complex,'' said Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Although aid organizations say there is no evidence so far of
starvation, refugees crossing the border in recent days say they
left family members behind who had run out of food.
</P>
<P>
   One refugee who had been imprisoned by the Serbs and then
released this week near the Albanian border, and who said he was
too frightened to give his name, said he was worried about his wife
and six children left behind in the village of Zhabar I Ulet in
northern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three days they didn't have anything to eat,'' he said.
``They didn't have enough flour to make bread.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies say they have heard reports of Kosovo Albanian
``displaced persons,'' as they call them, hiding in the mountains
but moving from hamlet to hamlet looking for something to eat.
``They've been scavenging in empty houses,'' said Anna DiLellio, a
spokeswoman for the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a U.N. mission in Kosovo determined that on top
of widespread destruction _ burned houses, destroyed roads and
bridges _ one third of the arable land in Kosovo had not been
cultivated this year. In addition, Serbian forces had taken over
the main World Food Program warehouse in Kosovo, where they were
said to be charging the equivalent of $2.50 for a pound of sugar _
an astronomical price in impoverished Kosovo. They also have
reportedly shot cows, goats and sheep. ``I think _ forget milk,''
Ms. DiLellio said.
</P>
<P>
   Although only a few relief workers are to go into Kosovo from
Albania on Sunday behind NATO troops, U.N. aid agencies are
preparing to establish offices in seven cities in Kosovo within the
next weeks. The World Food Program expects they will find that many
people in Kosovo have no electricity and water and are unable to
cook and so has readied 1.5 million ready-to-eat daily meals
intended to last three months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The ration comes in a yellow plastic bag, with ``Food Gift from
the People of the United States'' printed prominently on the front,
in three different varieties, or ``menus'' that contain a one-day
supply of food.
</P>
<P>
   Menu No. 3 contains a compressed rice loaf, shrink-wrapped in
thick plastic, that tastes like a dry, cinnamon-flavored rice
pudding. It also includes a shrink-wrapped rice with vegetables in
sauce, a fruit pastry bar, vegetable crackers, shortbread cookies,
blackberry jam, peanut butter and a book of matches (for smokers)
with an American flag and ``U.S.A.'' on the cover.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Saturday aid agencies continued to prepare returning refugees
about the danger of land mines, many of which are thought to have
been placed in the border area. Tehnaz J. Dastoor, Unicef's
specialist in land mines, and Eric M. Filippino, a demining expert
from Geneva, held a class Saturday afternoon at the Unicef office
here to educate a group of 16 Kosovo Albanian youths, elected
``representatives'' from five of the refugee camps here.
</P>
<P>
   They also showed the representatives posters warning about land
mines that are to go up in the refugee camps and asked for their
opinions about them _ in essence, test-marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the first thing you thought when you saw it?''
Filippino asked the group about a poster showing a land mine with a
large hand covering its spike that simultaneously prevents a small
child's foot from stepping on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be careful when you walk,'' said Sanije Seferaj, 23,
an economics student from Pristina, the Kosovo capital, who now
lives in the Kukes I refugee camp.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aid workers here are nervously hopeful that the refugees will
heed the lessons and return slowly but are worried about the
possibility of a chaotic rush to the border after NATO troops go
in. Although NATO will be clearing the main paved road toward
Pristina of mines, the troops will not get to the fields and
smaller roads for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the roads in Kosovo are dirt roads,'' said Ms.
Dastoor. ``It's going to be a huge process.''

GOVERNMENT REPORT SAYS 3 NATIONS HIDE STOCKS OF SMALLPOX
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
 (nk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD and JUDITH MILLER  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A secret federal intelligence assessment completed earlier this
year concludes that Iraq, North Korea and Russia are probably
concealing the deadly smallpox virus for military use, government
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment, the officials say, is based on evidence that
includes disclosures by a senior Soviet defector, blood samples
from North Korean soldiers that show recent smallpox vaccinations
and the fairly recent manufacture of smallpox vaccine by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say the warning was a deciding factor in President
Clinton's recent decision to reverse course and forgo destruction
of American stocks of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the United States, only Russia retains openly declared
stocks of the virus now, nearly 20 years after the disease was
declared to be eradicated. The intelligence assessment concludes
that Russia is most likely hiding additional stocks of the virus at
military sites.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has about 56,000 troops stationed
near Iraq and North Korea and is periodically bombing Iraq, the
officials say there appears to be no imminent military threat
involving the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The steps to turn a microbe into a biological weapon are many,
they say, and the government sees no signs of smallpox arms or
planned attacks by the suspect countries.
</P>
<P>
   The virus that causes smallpox is known as variola. For ages, it
ravaged the globe, killing millions and crippling many survivors.
Victims had high fever, nausea and a pronounced rash that left
survivors with permanently pocked skin. The disease was highly
contagious and quick to attack anyone without immunity, making it
one of history's great killers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States unilaterally renounced germ warfare in 1969
and lobbied for a 1972 international treaty banning such arms that
more than 100 nations signed.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and North Korea have repeatedly denied that they have
programs to develop germ weapons and both are signatories of the
1972 treaty. And Mikhail A. Shurgalin, a spokesman at the Russian
Embassy in Washington, denied that Russia maintains secret military
stocks of smallpox. ``We always observe our international
commitments,'' he said, ``including those relating to
bacteriological weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The warning was based on an analysis of years of accumulated
data, say the officials, and was prompted by a White House review
of whether American stocks of the smallpox virus should be
destroyed by the end of this month, as a panel of the World Health
Organization recommended in 1996. The United States had previously
sided with many other nations in urging that destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The new intelligence assessment, officials said, helped persuade
a team of presidential advisers to unanimously urge Clinton to
delay the virus' destruction, a reversal the White House announced
on April 22.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Defense Department official familiar with the
assessment said that destroying the virus at the two official
repositories, in Russia and the United States, and declaring it
abolished globally would be ``perpetrating a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor in Clinton's decision, officials said, was a
report by the National Academy of Sciences concluding that keeping
the virus would speed the development of new anti-viral drugs and
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, American experts have clashed bitterly over
whether the virus exists outside the two official repositories,
with intelligence experts tending to argue that it does. Covert
stocks would undermine the global plan to exterminate the microbe,
and the very existence of hidden stockpiles would be a signal that
the countries holding them are interested in the development of
germ weapons for war or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The American military stopped routinely vaccinating troops
against smallpox in the late 1980s and would be hard-pressed to
resume. The nation's civilian store of smallpox vaccine has
quality-control problems, experts say, and the process that was
used to manufacture it would not meet modern standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has a program under way to develop a new vaccine,
but its testing and development is usually projected to take until
2005 at the earliest. The Defense Department official said the new
intelligence assessment and the president's reversal could end up
accelerating the Pentagon's program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision has been seen as likely to give the declared
stocks of the virus a new lease on life. Officially, however,
possible destruction has simply been put off while world health
authorities debate the new arguments for keeping the stocks. They
have given themselves until June 2002 to do so. Russia has long
opposed the virus' destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the lab, variola survives only within the human body.
After world health authorities declared humans free of smallpox in
1980, plans were made to destroy laboratory stocks. The cause of
the ancient pestilence was to be the world's first species made
extinct by design rather than accident.
</P>
<P>
   Today, declared stocks exist only in guarded freezers at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the
Russian State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology (known
as Vector) near Novosibirsk, in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who discussed the new intelligence warning refused
to divulge it in its entirety. But in a series of interviews, they
disclosed some details and pointed out supporting evidence
scattered among declassified intelligence reports.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable weight, they said, was given to the disclosures of
a Soviet defector, Ken Alibek. Alibek came to the United States in
1992, after serving as a top official in the Soviet Union's illicit
germ warfare program, now known to have been the world's largest
and most advanced. Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered it to
end in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In secret debriefings, Alibek said that Russia had grown vast
quantities of the smallpox virus for war and that, as Russian
scientists sought new ways to support themselves when the Soviet
system collapsed, samples of the virus might have been sold or
hidden.
</P>
<P>
   A May 1994 report by the Defense Intelligence Agency, citing an
unnamed source, echoed Alibek's worry. It said that some of the
Russian smallpox had been sent to Iraq and North Korea, naming no
other nations. The transfers, it said, apparently occurred in the
late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern that the virus was transferred'' from Russia,
a top intelligence expert said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is well known to have worked hard at using germs in
unconventional arms _ the virus could most easily be spread by some
form of spraying. But the United Nations, which probed Iraq after
the 1991 Gulf War, never listed smallpox as a focus of Iraq's
biological weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An Iraqi soldier told allied authorities during the Gulf War
that he had been immunized against smallpox as a warfare safeguard
around 1985 or 1986 during the Iraq-Iran conflict, which ended in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier, a Defense Intelligence Agency report said, told of
having seen ``smallpox casualties'' and ``acne-type skin
inflammations, eating into body tissue.'' Just who suffered the
casualties was unclear, as was whether the soldier could diagnose
smallpox accurately.
</P>
<P>
   The officials who discussed the warning said that the soldier's
claims were supported by widespread evidence of immunizations in
blood taken from Iraqi prisoners during the gulf war, although some
analysts said that such immunity could come from routine
vaccinations years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence for the warning also came from the United Nations,
which shared its findings about Baghdad's weapons programs with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, U.N. arms inspectors said they discovered that
the Iraqis were making the smallpox vaccine as late as 1989, a
decade after the disease had been eradicated and long after the
United States had stopped doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Another discovery proved even stronger evidence of Iraq's work
on smallpox weapons, experts said. In the mid-1990s, inspectors
found an special apparatus, a freeze drier, labeled ``smallpox'' at
the maintenance shop of the State Establishment for Medical
Appliances Marketing, an arm of the Ministry of Health, which was
involved in germ warfare. A freeze drier, experts said, has
applications in both vaccine production and the preparation of
germs for dissemination in war.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, suspicions about Iraq were aroused when a senior Iraqi
virologist involved in making germ weapons, Hazem Ali, told arms
inspectors that Iraq was working on camel pox, which is similar to
smallpox, causing fever and skin rash in camels, but which rarely
infects humans. An inspector said Baghdad's germ scientists were
widely suspected of using the disease as a less deadly surrogate
for smallpox to perform research and refine production methods.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA report echoed that, saying in May 1996 that camel pox
``could possibly serve as a research model for smallpox.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Iraq, North Korea has long been publicly accused
of keeping secret stocks of smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   Russia made the charge forcibly in the early 1990s when its
Foreign Intelligence Service, the successor to the Soviet Union's
KGB, wrote a report on the spread of weapons of mass destruction.
Among other things, the report said that North Korea, a former
ally, was working on smallpox weapons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Senate Committee on Government Affairs, headed by John
Glenn, then a Republican senator from Ohio, quietly obtained a copy
of the Russian report, had it translated and made it public in
February 1993. At an open hearing, a CIA expert said he believed
the report was ``not a bad summary'' but declined to address
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Adding new clues about North Korea, federal officials said in
interviews that a defector had told of smallpox work. They also
said recent blood samples from North Korean soldiers show evidence
of immunizations, and that other information indicates some
vaccinations were fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vaccinations are as close to a smoking gun as you can
come,'' the senior Defense Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior intelligence analysts presented their warning to the
presidential advisory team early this year in oral and written
form, the Defense Department official said, helping persuade them,
in combination with the academy report, that it was prudent for the
United States to forgo smallpox destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But other officials said some members of the presidential
advisory team debating the virus destruction had doubts about some
of the data, especially blood evidence about vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest evidence described in the intelligence warning,
they said, concerned current secret work on smallpox by the Russian
military, but they would give no further details.
</P>
<P>
   That finding is politically sensitive because the Clinton
administration is helping former Russian germ warriors find
civilian work, despite Republican assertions that such aid can
foster secret military strides. Backers of the Clinton approach say
that it provides the best window into all Russian germ work, both
civilian and military.

their refugee camp. Now, instead of planning a return to his
homeland, Emini lies under a mound of dirt on a plateau with 140
other deceased ethnic Albanians who fled Kosovo. In a new section
of the local city cemetery, their graves show the signs of a people
dispossessed. Wooden stakes mark the identities of the dead. Their

shattered the backbone of a central European military force, all
without losing a single U.S. or allied pilot in combat. But the
campaign has raised questions and sparked debate whether air power
alone can win a war without the use of ground troops. (Deans, Cox

Bay, a posh area often referred to as Montserrat's own Beverly

the Kleebs, who say they have all their money tied up in their
retirement home, have refused to leave. They alone have stayed on

STARR MAY ISSUE REPORT CRITICAL OF THE CLINTONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Ill., Pa., Va.)  (Exclusive)

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, will not
seek indictments of President Clinton or Hillary Rodham Clinton but
has tentatively decided to issue a final report about their
behavior, several associates of Starr said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which could land in the middle of Mrs. Clinton's
Senate campaign, might be ``blistering'' in its descriptions of her
actions, one Starr associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, the associates said, decided that he would not seek
criminal indictments after discussions in his office about that
possibility. But as Starr winds down his operation, those
associates said, he was leaning toward issuing a report that would
discuss the Clintons' behavior in some detail.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision on whether to issue such a report could have
immense implications for Mrs. Clinton's likely run for a U.S.
Senate seat from New York in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, one adviser said, has been grappling with whether such a
report would be perceived simply as a politically motivated gesture
if it were released, as would be likely, in the middle of Mrs.
Clinton's campaign. For all intents and purposes, she has already
begun her campaign, although she has not made a formal
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the discussions that led to the tentative decision to
issue such a report occurred before it appeared that Mrs. Clinton
was serious about running for the Senate, the Starr associates
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, as now envisioned, would be a recitation of events
and unresolved issues without any explicitly stated judgments, one
Starr associate said. Nonetheless, Starr associates said, it would
inevitably convey a critical view because it would raise unanswered
questions about Mrs. Clinton's behavior in some land transactions
in Arkansas and her testimony under oath about her actions as a
lawyer in those deals.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what such a report would say about Mrs. Clinton is
unclear. But this spring in Little Rock, Ark., at the trial of
Susan McDougal, a former Whitewater partner of the Clintons, a
Starr deputy disclosed that the prosecutor's office had drafted an
indictment of Mrs. Clinton. The deputy, W. Hickman Ewing, did not
say exactly what was in the indictment, but he testified that he
drafted it after concluding that Mrs. Clinton was not truthful in
her answers to prosecutors about her role in Arkansas land deals.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue that has been discussed, a second Starr adviser
said, is whether it is fair to issue a report criticizing the
behavior of someone who has not been and will not be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question as it has been framed in the debate has been
whether you put up or shut up,'' that adviser said. ``If you can't
indict her, shouldn't you just shut up?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Starr and his associates are engaged in
intense discussions about when and how to close up the office of
the independent counsel, which was opened in 1994 to investigate
the Clintons' involvement in the failed Whitewater real-estate
venture in Arkansas before they moved into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr investigation gradually expanded to include other
areas, including accusations of political favoritism in the firing
of employees of the White House travel office and the Clinton White
House's improper acquisition of hundreds of confidential files,
including those of many Republicans, from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation of the president's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, led to Clinton's impeachment
last year in the House and his eventual acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizing the appointment of independent counsels to
investigate high-ranking administration officials expires on June
30, and despite a series of congressional hearings, there is no
move to renew it.
</P>
<P>
   While Starr is not obligated to close his operations with the
law's expiration, he has told Congress that he will consider using
the date of the law's demise to consider turning over unresolved
matters to the Justice Department as the law allows.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's associates say that while the possibility sounds
appealing, it is proving nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would like to leave tomorrow,'' one close associate said,
``but he doesn't think he can.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to issuing any report, Starr's office still has two
trials to prosecute, both involving Webster Hubbell, the former
associate attorney general and longtime friend of the Clintons. It
would be difficult to turn over the Hubbell trials to the Justice
Department for several reasons, said associates of Starr as well as
department officials.
</P>
<P>
   The principal problem is that it would present too great a
conflict of interest for the department to prosecute its former
third-ranking official. Eric H. Holder Jr., the deputy attorney
general, in an April letter to Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa.,
suggested that the department could appoint a special counsel to
handle cases like that of Hubbell if it had to inherit the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But another impediment to such a transfer is that Starr is said
to believe that the department has little appetite for the
prosecutions. In one case, in which Hubbell is charged with tax
evasion, department officials had argued that the case should not
have been brought.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The second trial itself could prove a problem for Mrs. Clinton.
Hubbell is charged with concealing information from the federal
authorities about the role he and Mrs. Clinton played as lawyers in
a complicated Arkansas land transaction that helped lead to the
collapse of a savings and loan institution.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Starr was suggesting that Mrs. Clinton,
who was not named in the indictment but was referred to frequently
as ``the billing partner'' in the Rose Law Firm, had done anything
improper or illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mrs. Clinton and her actions would inevitably be raised in
some fashion at the trial, which is scheduled to begin in August.
She could even be called as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of Mrs. Clinton have been counting on a kind of
``scandal fatigue'' to shield her from any more political damage
rooted in the previous five years. But a trial or a closing report
could freshen and revive questions about her behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Mrs. Clinton may be inoculated against damage
by the vigorous and somewhat successful White House campaign to
portray Starr as a politically motivated Republican whose actions
and conclusions should be discounted by the public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The law creating Starr's office allows him to file a report on
the Clintons to the three-judge panel that appointed him, but it is
unclear as to how detailed or thorough it need be.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr has contemplated how to complete his work and leave
office, the Justice Department has agreed to a request by
congressional Democrats to investigate whether prosecutors in
Starr's office improperly dealt with Ms. Lewinsky when they first
confronted her January 1998 in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in
Alexandria, Va., about her relationship with Clinton. Department
officials said they had not yet begun the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Rotunda, a professor at the University of Illinois Law
School who has been advising Starr, said in an interview that he
reviewed what the prosecutors did in the hotel and found that they
did not prevent Ms. Lewinsky from leaving or from calling her
lawyer, accusations that are at the heart of the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in The Washington Post suggested that the
department might drop the inquiry if Starr left office. His
associates said that he was offended by what appeared to be a
``plea bargain'' offer, and that it would only stiffen his resolve
to stay. A department official denied that there was any effort to
persuade Starr to leave in exchange for dropping the ethics
investigation.

IN AMERICA: HOUNDING THE INNOCENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Okla.)  (nk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An anti-loitering law that allowed the Chicago police to arrest
more than 42,000 people from 1992 to 1995 was declared
unconstitutional last week by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Antonin Scalia howled in dissent, which should tell you
something. The law was an abomination, just like the practice in
New York of stopping and frisking black and Hispanic people by the
tens of thousands for no good reason. And just like the practice of
pulling over and harassing perfectly innocent black and Hispanic
motorists on streets and highways in many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic profiling by law-enforcement authorities in the United
States comes in many forms, and all of them are disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer sadistic members of the state police in Oklahoma
spent more than two hours humiliating Rossano Gerald, a 37-year-old
Army sergeant, and his 12-year-old son, Greg.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald was pulled over and interrogated. He was ordered out of
his car and handcuffed. The troopers asked if he had any guns. They
asked permission to search the car and when he refused they
searched it anyway. They separated Greg from his father and locked
him in a police vehicle. They interrogated him. They brought
drug-sniffing dogs to the scene. They dismantled parts of the car.
When they finally tired of the madness, they told Gerald he was
free to go. No arrest was made. Greg, of course, was petrified.
When the ordeal ended he wept uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   Why did this happen? Greg and Gerald were guilty of America's
original sin. They were born black.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, profiling was not only perpetuated but elevated to
astonishing new heights during the regime of Rudolph Giuliani. Here
the targets are mostly pedestrians, not motorists. Young black and
Hispanic males (and in some cases females) are stopped, frisked and
harassed in breathtaking numbers.
</P>
<P>
   By the Police Department's own count, more than 45,000 people
were stopped and frisked by members of the Street Crimes Unit in
1997 and 1998. But the total number of arrests made by the unit
over those two years was less than 10,000. And it is widely
believed that the number of people stopped during that period was
far higher than the 45,000 reported by the cops. The true number
likely was in the hundreds of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union, noted last week that two things characterize the New York
City stops: ``Virtually everybody is innocent, and virtually
everybody is not white.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, like most public officials, will not acknowledge that
his police officers are targeting people by race. ``The stops are
driven by the descriptions of the person who committed the crime,''
Giuliani said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Spare me. The vast majority of these stops are in no way
connected to the commission of a specific crime, and the mayor
knows it. They are arbitrary and unconscionable intrusions on the
rights of New Yorkers who are supposed to be protected, not
humiliated, by the police.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans have no idea of the extent of the race-based
profiling that is carried out by law-enforcement officials, and the
demoralizing effect it has on its victims. The ACLU, in a report
called ``Driving While Black: Racial Profiling on Our Nation's
Highways,'' said: ``No person of color is safe from this treatment
anywhere, regardless of their obedience to the law, their age, the
type of car they drive, or their station in life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago law that resulted in more than 42,000 arrests over
three years was aimed at curbing gang activity. It was clearly
unconstitutional. It made it a crime for anyone in the presence of
suspected gang members to ``remain in any one place with no
apparent purpose'' after being told by the police to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Why should one's purpose for being in a public place have to be
apparent? As a reporter for The New York Times, I might be in the
presence of a suspected gang member. What business is that of the
police? And how could that possibly be a legitimate basis for an
arrest?
</P>
<P>
   The suit challenging the law was brought by the Chicago office
of the ACLU. A spokesman for the group noted that the ``vast
majority'' of the people arrested under the law were
African-American or Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   What a surprise.

COMMENTARY: LIGHTEN UP, BABY! 
</HEADLINE>
  (With STARR-CLINTONS) 
 (bl)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Hillary Rodham Clinton runs for the Senate, she
will be roughed up by a vengeful, two-fisted, single-minded
prosecutor, a guy who actually enjoys slapping manacles on people.
</P>
<P>
   And as though that weren't scary enough, she'll also have to
contend with Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Even a Yankees cap might not save her.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr and Hillary Clinton, it seems, have some
unfinished business. Of course, with Starr, business is always
unfinished.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the first lady is about to achieve lift-off as a Senate
candidate, and an independent woman, who should pop out to drag her
back down into the scandal swamp but the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, gentle readers, you won't believe this, but Javert is still
on the case, darkly scheming to destroy a Clinton on our dime. The
only thing that has changed is the Clinton _ now it's the Mrs.
</P>
<P>
   If he had any sense of shame, or any survival skills, the
prosecutor might have decided to stop investigating when the
Justice Department began investigating him. He might have decided
to shut down the Starr Chamber before the independent counsel law
expires at the end of June. He might have decided to give up once
he realized there was not enough evidence to indict the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   But he is still on revenge autopilot, carrying on the charade
that he is not partisan.
</P>
<P>
   Now he plots to release his final report on the Clintons at a
time when it could scald Hillary's nascent Senate campaign. A Starr
associate told Neil Lewis of The New York Times that the report's
descriptions of Mrs. Clinton's actions could be ``blistering.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely to stir up the Gatsbyesque flotsam and jetsam
floating in the wake of her Senate dream. He will want to dredge up
all the damaging Hillary garbage: the woeful Whitewater, the crass
Castle Grande trailer park, the disappearing and reappearing Rose
Law Firm billing records, and other White House scandals in which
her name figured prominently _ the firing of the travel-office
staffers and the violation of FBI confidential personnel files,
many on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The great struggle of the buttoned-down prosecutor and the
unbuttoned president seems risible in retrospect _ like some
Washington version of ``Austin Powers,'' with Starr cast as the
peevish, power-mad Dr. Evil scheming to destroy our puerile but
lovable hero, the shagadelic playboy with the pelt on his chest,
Bill Clinton.  &UR; Oh, behave, baby! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But Starr does not seem to realize he is a figure of ridicule.
Even one of his own advisers suggested to the Times that if Starr
can't bring charges, perhaps he should just ``shut up.'' Far from
shutting up or shutting down, he is trying to reclaim the limelight
by going on a Sunday show on conservative-friendly, Murdoch-owned
Fox TV. Even though television cameras blessedly no longer record
his morning coffee imbibing and trash disposing, he is still
insistent on sitting in moral judgment of the Clintons. He cannot
indict. He cannot impeach. But he can still impugn.
</P>
<P>
   He is also pursuing two trials prosecuting Webster Hubbell. In
one, which is scheduled to begin in August, Hubbell is charged with
hiding information about the role he and one of his Rose Law Firm
partners, Mrs. Clinton, played in an Arkansas land deal that
contributed to the fall of an S&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   In that indictment of Hubbell, Hillary is identified only as
``The Billing Partner.'' But Starr could call her as a witness in
the trial, and that would be embarrassing, coming right as she is
starting her new life as a carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a capital that has seen plenty of riveting feuds, this
one is remarkable. The liberal first lady and the conservative
prosecutor have always seemed destined _ or doomed _ to slug it
out, ever since she went on television after the Monica story broke
and branded Starr as part of what she called a conspiracy of hate
against the Clintons, ``a politically motivated prosecutor who is
allied with the right-wing opponents of my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   As Alessandra Stanley wrote in the Times in January 1998, the
two are opposite-sex doppelgangers. They are both accomplished,
brainy lawyers, devoted parents, religious, relentless and, when
they wish to be, charming.
</P>
<P>
   A Starr associate told the Times that while the special
prosecutor would like to leave, ``he doesn't think he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Think again, Mr. Starr.

   Moviegoers who were recently seduced by the lyricism of
``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' will see
a starkly different side of William Shakespeare in ``Titus'' (short
for ``Titus Andronicus''), starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica
Lange and directed by Julie Taymor. With more than a dozen murders,
assorted dismemberments and the emperor Saturninus sitting down to
a pie made from the bodies of his stepsons, ``Titus'' is
Shakespeare's goriest play and, many critics feel, his worst. T.S.
Eliot described it as ``one of the stupidest and most uninspired
plays ever written.'' A 1923 production of ``Titus'' at the Old Vic
was laughed off the stage. Observations on the play and
disputations on its authorship over the centuries follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   The Naysayers
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Down through the centuries, many members of the literati have
argued that Shakespeare could not have written something as awful
as ``Titus.'' One early disbeliever was Edward Ravenscroft, a
playwright whose comments appeared in the bowdlerized version of
the play that he published in 1687. (Shakespeare died in 1616.) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I think it a greater theft to Rob the dead of their Praise than
the Living of their Money. That I may not appear Guilty of such a
Crime, 'tis necessary I should acquaint you, that there is a Play
in Mr. Shakespears Volume under the name of Titus Andronicus, from
whence I drew part of this. I have been told by some anciently
conversant with the Stage, that it was not Originally his, but
brought by a private Authour to be Acted, and he only gave some
Master-touches to one or two of the Principal Parts of Characters;
this I am apt to believe, because 'tis the most incorrect and
indigested piece in all his Works; It seems rather a heap of
Rubbish than a Structure.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In ``Titus Andronicus'' for the ``Shakespeare in Performance''
series (Manchester University Press, 1989), Alan C. Dessen noted
some of Ravenscroft's major changes. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Most of these moments involve on-stage violence or images that
can elicit unwanted audience laughter. ... Rather than cutting off
his hand on-stage, this Titus exits with an executioner and
re-enters ``with his hand off'' ... The problematic exeunt in
III.i, in which Titus and Marcus each carries a head and Lavinia is
directed to carry the hand in her mouth, is avoided when the boy
Junius, asked to ``share in this Ceremony,'' is ordered to ``bring
thou that hand _ and help thy handless Aunt.'' The bloodiest moment
in Shakespeare's script, the on-stage murders of Chiron and
Demetrius with Lavinia holding a basin to catch their blood, is not
witnessed by the audience; rather, Titus appears afterward ``like
an Executioner'' with a bloody weapon in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Samuel Johnson, in his 1765 edition of Shakespeare's plays,
also argued against the playwright's being the author. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All the editors and criticks agree with Mr. ((Lewis)) Theobald
in supposing this play spurious. I see no reason for differing from
them; for the colour of the stile is wholly different from that of
the other plays, and there is an attempt at regular versification,
and artificial closes, not always inelegant, yet seldom pleasing.
The barbarity of the spectacles, and the general massacre which are
here exhibited, can scarcely be conceived tolerable to any
audience; yet we are told by ((Ben)) Jonson, that they were not
only borne but praised. That Shakespeare wrote any part, though
Theobald declares it ``incontestable,'' I see no reason for
believing.
</P>
<P>
   The Defenders
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In ``Shakspere as a Playwright'' (Scribner's, 1913), Brander
Matthews, a professor of dramatic literature at Columbia University
who deliberately shortened the playwright's name as part of his
advocacy of simplified spelling, says ``Titus'' was a smash by
Elizabethan standards. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Revolting as the several episodes may be to us, the play gave
the Elizabethans the kind of pleasure they expected in the theater.
It has a complicated plot, easy to follow in action and gathering
force as it moves onward. ... Seen on the stage, it could not fail
to arouse and to hold the interest of a contemporary audience. Its
action advances swiftly; its characters are boldly outlined; its
dialogue is stiff with top-lofty rhetoric. It may be only a medley
of invective and assassination, of bombast and brutality; but it is
adroitly devised to capture the favor of the groundlings. Even if
it does accumulate horror on horror's head, this did not displease
the full-blooded and coarse-grained playgoers for whom it had been
compounded.

and artificial closes, not always inelegant, yet seldom pleasing.
The barbarity of the spectacles, and the general massacre which are
here exhibited, can scarcely be conceived tolerable to any
audience; yet we are told by ((Ben)) Jonson, that they were not
only borne but praised. That Shakespeare wrote any part, though
Theobald declares it ``incontestable,'' I see no reason for
believing.

   The Defenders
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In ``Shakspere as a Playwright'' (Scribner's, 1913), Brander
Matthews, a professor of dramatic literature at Columbia University
who deliberately shortened the playwright's name as part of his
advocacy of simplified spelling, says ``Titus'' was a smash by
Elizabethan standards. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Revolting as the several episodes may be to us, the play gave
the Elizabethans the kind of pleasure they expected in the theater.
It has a complicated plot, easy to follow in action and gathering
force as it moves onward. ... Seen on the stage, it could not fail
to arouse and to hold the interest of a contemporary audience. Its
action advances swiftly; its characters are boldly outlined; its
dialogue is stiff with top-lofty rhetoric. It may be only a medley
of invective and assassination, of bombast and brutality; but it is
adroitly devised to capture the favor of the groundlings. Even if
it does accumulate horror on horror's head, this did not displease
the full-blooded and coarse-grained playgoers for whom it had been
compounded.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; After signing on for a 1978 production, the British actor Simon
Callow studied ``Titus,'' and his notes, published in his book
``Being an Actor'' (Methuen, 1984), reflect his attention to the
play's relevance to both the past and present. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ A ravaged Rome, the Goths at the gates, but Rome itself is
almost Barbarian. Social behavior has sunk to a basic, tribal
level. Death, rape. Unqualified self-interest rules. A punk
scenario, almost. ...

<P>
   _ During the play's run, the heads of 10 rebels were stuck on

   _ Revenge. No confidence in ability of law to settle righteous
grudges; revenge regarded as legitimate (cf. vigilantes).

<P>
   &UR; Writing about the play for the ``Arden Shakespeare'' series
(Routledge, 1995), Jonathan Bate, a professor at the University of
Liverpool, finds profundity in what may be the most anticlimactic
utterance in ``Titus'' _ and possibly all of Shakespeare. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What do you do when 21 of your sons have been killed in battle,
you've killed the 22nd in a fit of pique, your daughter has been
raped and had her hands cut off and her tongue cut out, two further
sons have been wrongly accused of murdering your son-in-law and the
remaining one sentenced to exile, you've been told that the two who
are condemned will be reprieved if you chop off your hand, and you
do so, only to have the hand and the heads of the two sons sent
back to you in scorn? Dramatic decorum dictates that you should
rant (``Now is a time to storm,'' says Marcus). But human nature
does not obey dramatic decorum. What Titus says is much more true:
``Ha, ha, ha!''
</P>
<P>
   A `Bardolator'
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The literary critic Harold Bloom argues in ``Shakespeare: The
Invention of the Human'' (Riverhead, 1998) that ``Titus'' is a
parody. He calls the work ``a blowup, an explosion of rancid
irony.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want bombast and gore, then they shall have it!''
seems the inner impulse that activates this bloodbath, the
Shakespearean equivalent of what we now respond to in Stephen King
and in much cinema. I would hesitate to assert that there is one
good line in the play that is straight; everything zestful and
memorable clearly is a send-up. ...
</P>
<P>
   As perhaps the last high Romantic Bardolator, I am rendered
incredulous, and still wish that Shakespeare had not perpetrated
this poetic atrocity, even as a catharsis. Except for the hilarious
Aaron the Moor, ``Titus Andronicus'' is ghastly bad if you take it
straight, but I will demonstrate that Shakespeare knew it was a
howler, and expected the more discerning to wallow in it
self-consciously. If sadomasochism is your mode, ``Titus
Andronicus'' is your meat ....
</P>
<P>
   I don't think I would see the play again unless Mel Brooks
directed it, with his company of zanies, or perhaps it could yet be
made into a musical.
</P>
<P>
   The Movie Director
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For her part, Julie Taymor has decided to emphasize the play's
``unbelievable black humor.'' In an interview she described the
emperor's wedding party. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It's an extremely elegant, decadent scene. It's in a giant,
semi-circular ballroom that has a huge mosaic swimming pool and
large columns. We have a giant wedding cake, made out of candy and
fruit, that is a half female face, half male _ empress and emperor.
It's floating by these partygoers who are lounging on the edge of
the pool, and this Medusa woman with a dress floating in the water
is pushing the cake. The guests have long forks that poke the
eyeballs and they eat the various parts of the face. It's
shockingly beautiful.

   Theaters Move to Enforce Ratings
</P>
<P>
   An organization representing the owners of most of the United
States' movie theaters announced that they would begin requiring
young people who are not accompanied by adults to show photo
identification cards proving they are at least 17 years old, when
they try to buy tickets to R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the National Association of Theater Owners, was
responding to public concern that violent movies lead teen-agers to
commit violence themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts were pessimistic, however. They said the move might
backfire by making the movies all the more alluring because of the
challenge of getting in.
</P>
<P>
   And many teen-agers expressed confidence they would find ways to
sneak into whatever movies they wanted.

   A Food Scare in Europe
</P>
<P>
   Belgian animal feed tainted with dioxin caused a food crisis
that scared governments around the world into banning many poultry,
meat and dairy products from all European countries because of
fears they contained the poison.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities first discovered high concentrations of the
poison, which accumulates in fatty tissues, in sick chickens last
March, but waited until two weeks ago to tell the Belgian and
European public and take poultry off the market. Later, beef, pork,
and butter were added to the list while officials ascertained which
products were safe.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Belgians satisfied European Union authorities
that they had done so, filling their supermarket shelves and
resuming exports. But the Europeans remained furious at the way
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's coalition government had handled
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian authorities say that they traced the problem to chicken
and animal feed from a single Belgian feed company, and that it is
now under control.

   Court Frees Woman Who Threatened Cosby

   A federal appeals court in New York overturned the conviction of
Autumn Jackson, who was sent to prison for threatening to tell a
supermarket tabloid that she was Bill Cosby's out-of-wedlock
daughter unless he paid her $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jackson, who had served about 14 months of her 26-month
prison term, was released on Thursday, one of her lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not yet said whether they will appeal the
decision of the three-judge panel, or retry Ms. Jackson and two
associates who were also convicted. Legal experts said the ruling
may have broader significance by helping to clarify what
constitutes an acceptable threat, as opposed to blackmail or
extortion.

   A New Plan for Drug Coverage Under Medicare
</P>

   President Clinton wants to expand Medicare to cover prescription
drugs, and White House officials disclosed some details of the
proposal. They also said, however, that they were still trying to
figure out how to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of elderly people say they cannot afford the drugs they
need, and many Democrats are hoping to retake control of the House
of Representatives in next year's elections by running on the
promise of Medicare drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said the proposed
drug benefit would be ``universal and affordable,'' would have ``a
modest premium'' and would be ``better than anything you could buy
today in the open market.''

   Supreme Court Strikes Down Loitering Law Aimed at Gangs
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's anti-loitering law, a model for cities seeking to
reclaim the streets from violent gangs, was declared
unconstitutional. By a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court said the law
gave the police too much discretion to sweep up innocent people in
their fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
   In his majority opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said the law
didn't give police officers enough guidance. Under the law, he
said, ``it matters not whether the reason that a gang member and
his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob
an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving
the ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   But the opinion suggested that Chicago could solve the problem
by rewriting the law to define prohibited behavior more precisely,
and Mayor Richard M. Daley vowed that the city would do so.
Municipal lawyers said they hoped to have a new version ready
within 30 days.
</P>

   A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, which
challenged the 1992 law, said it would be hard to write a broad
anti-loitering law that would be both constitutional and effective.

   African National Congress Seals an Election Victory
</P>
<P>
   Final election results showed that South Africa's ruling African
National Congress, the party of outgoing President Nelson Mandela
and President-elect Thabo Mbeki, was re-elected in a landslide on
June 2, gaining even more Parliament seats than it got in 1994
during the country's first post-apartheid elections.
</P>
<P>
   The party fell just one seat short of the two-thirds majority it
needed if it wanted to start making changes to the Constitution,
though it can no doubt put together such a majority by making
alliances with smaller parties.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely to face a boisterous opposition, however. The new
Parliament will include 12 opposition parties, up from six last
time; it also includes several new outspoken personalities and a
far larger Democratic Party, which captured 38 seats, up from
seven. That party has been a vocal and effective government critic
and seems determined to continue in that vein.

   Pope John Paul II was back in his native Poland again, this time
to focus attention on the 20th-century martyrdom of Christians and
underline the broad themes of his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   The visit took a bizarre turn when the chief rabbi of Poland,
Pinchas Monachem Joskowicz, introduced himself on a receiving line
and addressed the pope directly, saying: ``I have a favor to ask
Mr. Pope'' _ to seek to remove a cross at the walls of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal, broadcast live on Polish television, shocked many
Polish viewers and embarrassed leaders of Poland's Jewish
community, who said the setting was inappropriate and the form of
address scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   Their fear was that the incident would undermine their own more
diplomatic efforts to find a compromise over the visibility of the
cross at a site of great Jewish suffering. It was put up to
commemorate the pope's 1979 visit to Auschwitz, and as a memorial
to Christian victims of the Holocaust.

   Hillary Rodham Clinton took her most decisive step yet toward
running for the Senate from New York, declaring her lifelong
allegiance to the Bronx Bombers. At a White House ceremony honoring
the 1998 World Series champs, she got a Yankees cap that she tugged
over her forehead as she posed with the team.
</P>
<P>
   In this initial skirmishing over the Senate seat, Mrs. Clinton's
declaration amounted to a Bronx cheer to New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely rival and a diehard Yankees fan.
</P>
<P>
   The move raised questions about Mrs. Clinton's sense of loyalty,
since she was born and bred in Chicago and had worn her love for
the Cubs on her sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Mrs. Clinton said. Because the Cubs were in the
National League, she has needed an American League team to root for
too.

   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   EAST-WEST-VALUES-REVIEW (Moscow) _ Americans think their values
are the world's _ and in economics, that often is true. But to some
nations, the Kosovo atrocities were just the broken eggs of yet
another national omelet and the West is a self-righteous, ever-more
meddlesome cook. This anti-West club is not so much motivated by
love for Milosevic as a conviction that bloodlettings like Kosovo
are internal matters; that it's arrogant and foolish to thrust
yourself into someone else's war; that the safe and even humane
course usually is to let the two sides duke it out. By Michael
Wines. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   LOWERCLASS-PROSPERITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ The U.S. economic boom
is finally starting to trickle down to affect the poorest
Americans, challenging the conventional wisdom that government had
a crucial role in helping the poor. But now there's reason to
wonder if maybe prosperity can do the job alone. Or to put it
another way, how far down the economic ladder can prosperity be
expected to reach? Economists aren't sure, but job statistics give
some interesting clues. By Michael Weinstein. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-SWITCH-REVIEW (Washington) _ With more drugs available and
more prescriptions being written each year, the FDA is concerned
about deaths and injuries caused by medications. Much attention is
given to medication mix-ups and other pharmaceutical errors. But
many people don't realize that pharmacists, at the behest of
insurance companies and HMOs, intentionally switch medications all
the time, with potentially harmful consequences. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   FUNDRAISING-LOSERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Whether they are
well-known faces or ordinary people who run for Congress, losing
candidates find that just because the election is over doesn't mean
the fund-raising stops. But if it was tough raising money in the
heat of a campaign, try fund-raising after Election Day, as the
bills from pollsters, the telephone company and poster makers keep
rolling in. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   JUDAISM-PROSELYTIZE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Unlike Christianity,
Judaism emphatically shuns prosyletizing. But even if many
modern-day rabbis are not so discouraging as all that, what would
happen if they took a really different tack and encouraged
spiritual seekers to embrace Judaism? That idea is gaining
attention _ and some hot criticism. By Gustav Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE-APPOINT-REVIEW (Washington) _ President Clinton's recess
appointment of a homosexual as ambassador to Luxembourg has
provoked a clash between two of the most venerable _ and arguably
most anachronistic _ traditions of the federal government. At issue
is the right of the president to make appointments during
congressional recesses without Senate confirmation vs. the right of
individual senators to block any nomination that comes before them.
By Philip Shenon.
</P>
<P>
   SHAKESPEARE-TITUS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Movie audiences will
see a different side of Shakespeare in the upcoming film version of
`Titus Andronicus.' It is Shakespeare's bloodiest play and, many
critics feel, his worst. Some examples of critical reaction over
the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   WILDE-HUSBAND-REVIEW (Undated) _ A century after the debut of
Oscar Wilde's ``An Ideal Husband,'' the portrait of a successful
politician trying to slip out of humiliation retains a certain
currency, while the portrait of his wife seems like a classy
photograph that has faded from fashion. By Waklter Goodman.

<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-MONITORS-REVIEW (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ One of the
founders of the National Movement for Free Elections, or Namfrel,
Jose Concepcion helped end the 20-year rule of Fredinand Marcos and
pioneer a new weapon in the spread of democracy around the world:
independent, citizen-led election-watch groups. He was in Jakarta
last week with a Namfrel delegation keeping an eye on the world's
latest democratic experiment, Indonesia's first free election in 44
years. Also here were scores of men and women from other nations
who are in effect his students. By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-COMPUTERS-REVIEW (Washington) The U.S. has determined that
the new Sony Playstation II, available later this year, is powered
by a chip so powerful that Washington would have to be notified
before it could be shipped to China. But a Chinese military officer
determined to play out his fantasies on state-of-the-art Sony _
perhaps simulate an attack on Taiwan _ can simply send his kids to
any of the five Toys `R' Us stores in Hong Kong, which is still
considered a safe place to send advanced technology even though it
has reverted to Chinese rule. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   GREECE-TURKEY-REVIEW (Istanbul) _ The Kosovo crisis has
underlined how closely Greek and Turkish strategic interests
coincide. Both would benefit enormously from stability in the
Balkans and the eastern Mediterranean. Yet, in one of the most
persistent and puzzling anomalies of modern geopolitics, their
dispute remains seemingly intractable. Though joined by geography
and history, they are divided by one of the world's angriest and
longest-running blood feuds. By Stephen Kinzer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW _ With three stitches in his forehead after he slipped
and hit his head in the Vatican Embassy, Pope John Paul II
explained Saturday how Catholics should behave in newly democratic
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who according to his spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls,
suffered ``no neurological repercussions'' or other serious effects
on his health from the fall, omitted the harshest condemnations of
``free love'' and the ``culture of death,'' his term for abortion,
that were in his prepared homily and that are leitmotifs of his
homilies to American and European Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, wearing a small bandage and speaking in a strong voice,
the Roman Catholic leader urged Poles to resist secularism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not be afraid to live in a way contrary to fashionable
opinions and ways of life in conflict with God's law,'' he told
more than 400,000 followers who gathered for a Mass in Sandomeirz,
a small town in southeastern Poland.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 79-year-old pope's moral preachings have had a
gentler, more understanding tone than in 1991, when he scolded
Poles, perhaps prematurely, for allowing themselves to be seduced
by the worst excesses of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the softening is that since 1997 a center-right
government coalition has replaced one dominated by former
Communists, and it has passed laws, including restrictions on
abortion, that are closer to church teaching.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope, who told his bishops on Friday that this 13-day
trip to his native land is his ``crowning'' pilgrimage, does not
want the Polish church to retire from public life now that the
struggle against Communism is won. He wants to coax bishops,
priests and, most important, Catholic laymen to work harder to
inject Christian moral values into a democratic Poland before
Western-style secularism has a chance to seep in.
</P>
<P>
   The church has lost some of the power it held when it was seen
as the country's main bastion against the Communist authorities.
But by European standards, the Catholic Church in Poland remains
unusually influential. The pope is seeking to secure the church's
moral authority without inhibiting Poland's newly minted democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But to do so, he has to resolve conflicts wedged deep in the
Polish church, which since Communism collapsed has found itself
more subject to public scrutiny and criticism. Within the Polish
hierarchy, formed by World War II and the battle against Communism,
there are clashing ideological views and lingering prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   As the pope was reminded on Friday, when Poland's chief rabbi
implored him to remove a large cross at Auschwitz, a deeply
contested issue in Poland, his calls for interfaith understanding
are not always heeded in full.
</P>
<P>
   When John Paul held a Mass earlier this week in Torun, close
observers of church politics in Poland wondered how he would handle
Radio Marya, the powerful and virulenty right-wing Catholic station
based there. Radio Marya has five million listeners and is so
outspoken that the priest who founded it was chastised by the
conservative Catholic primate of Poland, Jozef Cardinal Glemp,
three years ago. The pope did not say anything about the station on
his last visit, in 1997, disappointing many liberal Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mass, Radio Marya had front-row seats under a large
yellow-and-white Radio Marya banner. The pope wished its listeners
and employees joy, and thanked them for ``the catechization
conducted through radio waves.'' Its founder, the Rev. Tadeusz
Rydzyk, however, was noticeably absent.
</P>
<P>
   In Torun, the pope hinted that the most gratingly partisan
voices of the church should simmer down, without relinquishing
their larger pastoral mission. But he sometimes has to overcome the
instincts of his own bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservative Catholic leaders were initially opposed to
their country seeking membership in the European Union, fearing
that the kind of anticlericism found in France and Germany could
infect Poland. The pope, however, wants Poland's deeply rooted
Catholicism to infect the rest of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe needs a Poland that believes deeply and is culturally
creative in a Christian way, conscious of the role that providence
has entrusted to it,'' he told the bishops on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   George Weigel, a papal biographer from the United States, said,
``In Poland's church, it is not really an issue of conservatives
vs. liberals, it's the Wojtyla church versus the national church.''
</P>
<P>
   The political pronouncements of Catholic clergymen have
noticeably declined even since the pope's 1997 visit, which was
seen by Catholics and non-Catholics as ushering a new mood of
reconciliation in Poland. Perhaps accordingly, the spiritual side
of the church is relatively healthy, but it is hard to measure its
real weight. Bishops complain that church attendance is down,
especially among the young. Yet priestly vocations are back up to
nearly 1,800 new seminarians, the same number as in 1987, when the
church was seen as a national defender of freedom and had immense
prestige. They had dropped to 1,350 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Poland's new Constitution does not refer to the Catholic Church
as the state religion, but in all but name it is. Ninety percent of
the population is Catholic, and while religious instruction in
schools is voluntary, few students have the nerve to decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be considered strange if I didn't go,'' said Bartosz
Rzepczynski, 19, of his high-school religion classes. ``But that
doesn't mean I listen. It's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, however, still fascinates the young. Rzepczynski had
traveled by train to Torun from his small town of Dzialdowa to
attend the pope's Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has held a number of ecumenical services in Poland,
including a service alongside bishops of the Polish Orthodox Church
in Drohiczyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope wants every Catholic to be ecumenical, to be open to
dialogue, especially with the Eastern Church,'' said the Rev.
Maciej Zieba, a Dominican priest in Warsaw who is an informal
adviser to the pope, ``That means better relations with Russia and
the Orthodox Church, and that can be difficult for the older
generation. There are deep wounds on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism remains a problem for the Catholic Church here,
where the pope's message of reconciliation is sometimes filtered by
Polish nationalism and the country's own tragic memories of the

   ``Jews are not part of the Polish martyrology,'' Zieba said.
``Every family has a father or uncle who died in the camps. They
are not as aware of the Jewish tragedy. Especially in the church we
should keep that memory alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most outspoken anti-Semites in the church have been
curbed, most notably Henryk Jankowski, who was once a spiritual
adviser to Lech Walesa, the founder of the Solidarity trade union
movement, and is now barred from preaching. But there are bishops
who are openly uninterested in interfaith dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Poles who follow internal church politics were heartened
by the recent promotion of Archbishop Henryk Muszynski, who is an
advocate of ecumenicism, to metropolitan of Gniezno, a prestigious
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, good relations with Jews won't hurt your career in
the church, and can help it,'' said Konstantin Gebert, a journalist
and Jewish activist. ``But even today, expressing mildly
anti-Semitic thoughts won't hurt your career, either.''

   DJENERAL JANKOVIC, Yugoslavia _ As NATO troops surged into
Kosovo from Macedonia Saturday morning, American Apache
helicopters, which President Clinton had dispatched to Albania two
months ago but then kept out of combat, coursed overhead, providing
air cover to the vanguard force.
</P>
<P>
   British paratroopers from the 5th Airborne Brigade, who seized
the mountains on either side of the valley that wends its way north
of this border town, led the way as NATO troops, mostly British and
French, moved into Kosovo from the south and east.
</P>
<P>
   The border crossing here had been abandoned by Serbian
authorities, although the Yugoslav flag still fluttered in the
breeze. In a valley down the hill from the border, there was a vast
field of cars that Kosovo Albanians had been forced to abandon when
they fled.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a hulking cement factory showed severe damage from NATO
bombs. Four donkeys stood in the shade outside. An ethnic Albanian
village near the border, Seciste, remained deserted, some of its
houses scarred by fire.
</P>
<P>
   NATO moved into Kosovo only after 78 days of intense bombing and
missile strikes, which succeeded in wearing down the Serbian
forces, but at the cost of destroying many of Kosovo's bridges,
roads and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   It will take at least eight more days before the last Serbian
forces withdraw and the NATO force, which will ultimately include
some 50,000 peacekeepers, takes control.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, NATO officials had reported few problems, although a
column of French troops, entering from the south, stalled only a
few miles inside Kosovo, when it encountered an unmarked minefield.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports that retreating units of Yugoslavia's
Serbian-dominated army and police had torched houses in Djakovica
and Janik, but by and large, the Serbs were said to be cooperating
with the occupation of the province. In the case of the French
troops, a Yugoslav officer helped identify the location of the
mines so they could be cleared.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Richard Dannert, commander of Britain's contingent
here, said that the first troops encountered a few groups of
Serbian civilians, as well as members of the separatist Kosovo
Liberation Army, but no resistance. ``In both cases, their attitude
was compliant,'' he said from his base in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander in Europe,
said Saturday afternoon that NATO troops had secured the road to
Pristina from Macedonia's capital, Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   On the Macedonia side of the border Saturday morning, thousands
of refugees spilled out of the sprawling, dusty camps that have
been their homes for weeks and cheered as tanks, armored vehicles,
troop carriers and other NATO vehicles rumbled toward the Kosovo
border.
</P>
<P>
   One refugee called it the liberation of Kosovo. A group then
began to sing a Kosovar anthem: ``I gave my word; I will give my
life for Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   At Stankovic 2 Camp, Alije Latifaj, who fled Kosovo with six
members of her family on May 27, was ecstatic. ``Yes! Yes!'' she
said when asked if she expected to return home soon. ``This is the
hope that keeps us alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the border crossing here, refugees were not rushing to
go home. Most said they would wait at least a few days before
trying to return to the villages they had to flee when Serbian
forces swept through.
</P>
<P>
   One man, however, did not wait. Shaban Bella, 65, crossed the
border back into Kosovo on foot, ignoring the entreaties of U.N.
refugee officials. ``I am going to see if my house is burned,'' he
said, vowing to walk to his village, Kacanik, a few miles up the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Blerta Mustafa, a Kosovo Albanian translator who accompanied a
reporter into Kosovo Saturday morning, used a cellular phone to
call her father in Macedonia to tell him that she had returned to
Kosovo, two months after fleeing her home in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's troops entered the province from two directions: British,
Italian, German and a platoon of Americans from the Army's 82nd
Airborne Division from the south, and the French along two mountain
roads to the east. A force led by German troops will enter from
Albania, crossing the border on the road between Kukes and Prizren,
an area of intense fighting between Serbian forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The operation faces many uncertainties, including the ultimate
role of the Russian troops within the Kosovo peacekeeping force.
There are also the rebels, land mines and the thousands of
displaced Albanians who never left the province.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Land mines hampered the progress of the French troops. A
contingent of 250 French marines in armored personnel carriers
towing mortars departed at dawn from the border as planned but
immediately found mines crisscrossing the dirt road inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For the next five hours a scouting party searched for
alternative routes while the soldiers in sunglasses joked, smoked
cigarettes and read magazines to pass the time.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-hour delay, the column moved down another road but
found mines there too and began the painstaking process of clearing
them.
</P>
<P>
   A second column of roughly 450 French soldiers tried to enter
Kosovo on a slightly better dirt road. But they too were thwarted
by land mines and had only made their way a few miles inside Kosovo
as of Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the American troops amassed in Macedonia, led by
troops from the 82nd Airborne and the 26th Marine Expeditionary
Unit, were expected to enter Kosovo over the next few days, when
they will take over one of five sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Second Lt. Toma Kim of the 82nd Airborne led the first American
ground troops into Kosovo. His squad, a convoy of 10 vehicles,
including armored Humvees mounted with 50-caliber machine guns ,
merged into the main column heading north.
</P>
<P>
   After spending two months in Albania with the Apache
helicopters, he said, the Americans were eager finally to go, but
anxious about what they would find.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go up there and see how bad it really is,'' he
said.

CRITICS SAY REPORT ON CHILD SEX ABUSE TRIVIALIZES ITS EFFECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERICA GOODE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few people took notice last July when Psychological Bulletin, an
academic psychology journal, carried a lengthy, jargon-heavy report
titled ``A Meta-Analytic Examination of Assumed Properties of Child
Sexual Abuse Using College Samples.''
</P>
<P>
   But nearly a year later, the study, its authors and the American
Psychological Association, which publishes the journal, are at the
center of a political storm.
</P>
<P>
   The study concludes that the effects of sexual abuse on children
are not always severe. Conservatives such as radio talk-show host
Laura Schlessinger and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay have declared
that the study trivializes the impact of such abuse and condones
pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Parshall, a spokeswoman for the Family Research Council, a
fund-raising organization for social conservative causes, said the
article ``gives pedophiles a green flag.'' Rep. Matt Salmon,
R-Ariz., introduced a resolution in Congress in May condemning the
article.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Leadership Council for Mental Health, Justice and
the Media, an organization of mental health researchers, also
criticized the study, saying it included ``numerous flaws and
weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the furor, the psychological association announced
last week that it was taking steps to insure that ``journal editors
will fully consider the social policy implications of articles on
controversial topics.''
</P>
<P>
   Such considerations will not influence the decision to publish
an article, said APA president Raymond Fowler, but will allow the
inclusion of other material to put controversial studies in
context. The APA also said it was seeking an independent evaluation
of the scientific quality of the study.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to DeLay, Fowler said that ``the association has
always condemned the sexual abuse of children'' and that the group
did not support ``the `normalization' or decriminalization of any
form of sexual relations between adults and children.''
</P>
<P>
   The journal article was written by Dr. Bruce Rind, an adjunct
faculty member in the psychology department at Temple University;
Dr. Robert Bauserman, an evaluation specialist working on AIDS
prevention at the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene;
and Philip Tromovitch, a graduate student at the University of
Pennsylvania. The article, a statistical reanalysis of 59 studies
of college students who said they were sexually abused in
childhood, concluded that the effects of such abuse ``were neither
pervasive nor typically intense, and that men reacted much less
negatively than women.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also questioned the practice, common in many
studies, of lumping all types of sexual abuse together. They argued
that treating all forms of sexual abuse equally presents problems
that, the researchers wrote, ``are perhaps most apparent when
contrasting cases such as the repeated rape of a 5-year-old girl by
her father and the willing sexual involvement of a mature
15-year-old adolescent boy with an unrelated adult.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, serious harm may result, Rind and his
colleagues maintained, but the second case ``may represent only a
violation of social norms with no implication for personal harm.''
The authors also suggested that the term ``adult-adolescent sex''
or ``adult-child sex'' be substituted, in some cases, for ``child
sexual abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rind could not be reached for comment. But in a statement
released by Temple University's Office of University Relations, he
said: ``Our article went through rigorous peer review in one of the
most difficult journals in psychology to publish in. Even though
our study has been criticized by certain persons in the media, many
psychologists at academic institutions have praised it as being
excellent work.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also released a statement saying that their
article ``does not condone'' child sexual abuse and that ``lack of
harmfulness does not imply lack of wrongfulness.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``adult-child sex,'' they said, is already used by many
researchers. ``Our paper suggests only that these terms be used
more selectively in psychological research _ not in media
discussions or in legislative discussions,'' they added.
</P>
<P>
   Bauserman said in a telephone interview that although he and his
colleagues expected that their research might evoke some discussion
in academic circles, the public outcry came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly did not expect a controversial public reaction
like this,'' he said. ``Our feeling simply was that it's going to
be read by researchers in the field, and that they're going to be
able to evaluate whether it makes useful points or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychological Bulletin has a circulation of fewer than 6,000
copies, most of which go to academic psychologists. And for many
months after the article was published, neither the authors nor the
APA received any feedback.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in March, when a Philadelphia radio talk show
picked up on the study. Schlessinger then discussed the article on
her show. The onslaught soon followed, and as evidence that the
study condoned pedophilia, the Family Research Council and other
critics said that the North American Man-Boy Love Association, a
group that promotes consensual sex between boys and men, mentioned
the study positively on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Spiegel, a psychiatrist at Stanford University and a
member of the leadership council, criticized the study, saying it
had serious methodological flaws and that the researchers ``use
meta-analysis the way a drunk uses a lamppost _ for support, rather
than illumination.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel, who with other researchers hopes to publish a critique
of the journal article, said many other studies indicated that
sexually abused children can suffer severe consequences. Studies
have linked sexual abuse to post-traumatic stress disorder, eating
disorders, increased risk of suicide, and gastrointestinal
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler said the major finding of the study had been overlooked
amid all the hubbub. ``Horrible as it is that some adults abuse
children,'' he said, ``it's good to know that there's a chance for
them'' to recover.

 &HT;    DYING AS REFUGEES: Sadly, some will never return home to Kosovo
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-TROOPS; KOSOVO-AID.

   KUKES, Albania _ Peace did not come soon enough for Halil Emini.
</P>
<P>
   He did not get killed by Yugoslav forces or NATO bombs. He just
drowned Friday while swimming with his children near their refugee
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of planning a return to his homeland, Emini lies
under a mound of dirt on a plateau with 140 other deceased ethnic
Albanians who fled Kosovo during the Serbs' ethnic cleansing
campaign. In a new section the local city cemetery, their graves
show the signs of a people dispossessed.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden stakes mark the identities of the dead. Their names,
birth dates and home villages are marked with a ballpoint pen and
usually, to protect them from the elements, covered by half of an
old plastic soft-drink bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the hubbub of the crowded refugee camps, there is
cemetery silence here. The wind rustles through the trees, only
occasionally interrupted by crackling gunfire from a nearby Kosovo
Liberation Army training ground.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a few graves carry the wreaths and ribbons of slain
fighters in the rebel KLA. But most here died in mundane ways -- a
child hanged accidentally on a rope in a refugee camp, a
middle-aged man had a heart attack, many died of old age. A baby
died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials say mortality rates are normal among the refugees,
maybe even lower for people in camps than those traveling roads and
doing work. Figures were not available, but as many as 500 have
died among Albania's 440,000 Kosovar refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees' long wait for NATO troops to move into Kosovo came
to an end Saturday, as the vanguard of British forces began
streaming into Pristina, determined to ensure peace in the
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   The was no jubilation among the families of Emini and others for
whom the entry of NATO forces came too late, however.
</P>
<P>
   While death is a fact of life, for refugees it comes on a
foreign land, where they die in new-found poverty and far from
realizing their dreams of returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Just an hour after Emini's death, his widow huddled silently
with other women in one of the 200 tents at the seedy Bashkia
refugee camp. A bearded man, a relative, squatted on the hard red
dirt near the tent flaps and cried. A group of men stood nearby,
angry and sad and lamenting their plight.
</P>
<P>
   They described Emini as a 42-year-old dye supervisor in a
textile plant in the Kosovo provincial district of Opoja. He was
tall and thin.
</P>
<P>
   They said he was quieter and poorer than the other refugees. He
had traveled for about a week on a neighbor's tractor to flee
marauding Serb troops and paramilitary thugs and arrived here April
4.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, when word came of the peace agreement between the NATO
alliance and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosovic, Emini did not
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said this is the moment to be very careful, that we cannot
trust anything until we touch the realities,'' said friend Nazim
Tahiri.
</P>
<P>
   There is little to do in the Bashkia camp, run by the Kukes
municipality. The tents lack the double-sheeting that can provide
insulation from the sweltering sun. So people leave for a half-hour
walk to the White Drin River, which flows from Kosovo. The
turquoise water is less peaceful than it looks.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a child found an old hand grenade in the river
and got his hand blown off. Friday, swimming with his 12-year-old
daughter, and eight- and six-year-old sons, Emini apparently
strayed past a steep drop off of the river bed. He called for help,
but no one could reach him in time.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, his brother-in-law was helping plan his pauper's
funeral, clearly frustrated as much as saddened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was thinking we should go back as soon as it is safe,''
Ramadan Jafir, 40, said. ``That is our place. That is our land.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday morning, about 200 men from the camp were trudging
away from the Muslim funeral for Emini in the Kukes cemetery. They
wrote his name on a stake and jammed it in a large mound of dirt
over Emini's plain wooden casket, then slipped a two-liter soda
bottle over it and poured water on the grave, as is customary here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their place is in Kosovo so it is better they should be buried
there than here,'' said Taf Gjana(CQ), a Kukes Albanian who earns
about $60 a month digging graves. ``But, since they were pushed out
and died here, this land is theirs as much as ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Gjana said many Kosovar Albanians say they will someday return
to take their family members' bodies back to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But aid officials say that the destruction in Kosovo, a southern
province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic, may require
half the refugees here to wait months before returning.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the camps, which are becoming more developed and
entrenched, the graveyard is taking on signs of permanence. Gjana
said they must always have a few empty graves ready. A few actual
headstones are appearing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one has an epitaph, those words used to sum up a
life.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two cloth flowers on the smooth white cement stone
of 70-year-old Abedin Liman Telaku, it names his village as Banje
and says simply, ``Forced out by Serbs.''

 &HT;    A day in the life of Waffle House -- TAKE 1
 &HT;    (Package includes WAFFLEHOUSE, WAFFLEHOUSE-SUITS,
WAFFLEHOUSE-TRIVIA and photos.)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While it is true that the Waffle House never closes,
it is not true, as some insist, that the keys to the front door are
buried in wet cement each time a new unit opens. They might as well
be. Waffle House doors stay unlocked 24 hours a day, seven days a
week, 52 weeks a year. Somewhere, night and day, the hash browns
are hissing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas is rough,'' says waitress Shirley Lowe, as she
stands behind a Waffle House counter in East Point, Ga., blinking
through circles of blue eye shadow that make her face look as sad
as a panda's. ``I've got three small kids, and I want to be home
watching them open gifts so bad. But that's our busiest day. We've
got customers lined up waiting to get in, and they expect to see me
here. They're family, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes Mr. Tibbs,'' another waitress announces. Dan Tibbs,
the neighborhood laundryman, qualifies as kin because he has been
visiting the restaurant as often as three times a day since 1978.
His coffee is waiting by the time he walks in and hears the voices
chiming, ``Good morning!''
</P>
<P>
   For 44 years, Waffle House has been almost as reliable as
sunrise. Those yellow-and-black Scrabble-board signs have become
such a familiar feature of the Southern landscape that they almost
blend in, like pine trees or double-wides. There are 1,200 Waffle
Houses across a Sun Belt crescent that begins in Maryland and ends
in Arizona. Atlanta, the company's hometown, has more than 200
alone, making Waffle House and McDonald's the metro area's most
franchised restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their assembly-line sameness, the two chains differ
considerably. Something about Waffle House invites an intimacy that
would seem out of character beneath the Golden Arches. Maybe it's
the shoe-box smallness of the buildings. Or the fact that so many
customers are regulars who know their waitresses by name. Or the
retro way orders are filled, not by computer screen, but by
shouting, the food then cooked before your eyes. Maybe it's the
diner lingo or the all-night ambience or the jukeboxes that stock
corny songs about eating at the Waffle House.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, the chain has inspired a cult following that
runs from cops and truck drivers to barflies and overcaffeinated
college students. The latter are mostly responsible for the dozens
of Waffle House Web sites, full of witty repartee such as this
recent exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``I (bleepin') love the Waffle House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wawful on, dude!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You idiots are sick, get a life!''
</P>
<P>
   Waffle House Inc. has no official Web site of its own. The
privately held company has never really courted publicity _ until
now. Late last year, for the first time, Waffle House hired an
outside public relations firm. ``We were seeing a lot of stories
about Chick-fil-A,'' explains marketing executive Chris Jacobsen,
mentioning the other great Atlanta-based fast-food success, ``and
we thought we had a good a story to tell, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Chick-fil-A's talkative S. Truett Cathy, Waffle
House's chief executive won't be telling it. Joe Rogers Jr. doesn't
do interviews. The last time he talked to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution at any length, Richard Nixon was president.
His Waffleness prefers that any media attention focus on the
restaurants and their employees and customers.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude inhabits Waffle House headquarters. The new
two-story complex in suburban Norcross has no private offices, only
cubicles. Nor are there kitchen facilities; employees are
encouraged to get out from behind their desks and eat at a Waffle
House. On holidays, they're urged to show their solidarity with the
front-line troops by volunteering to do anything from running the
grill to washing dishes. When the suits return to HQ, they can't
miss the sign over the elevators that demands to know, in the words
of one of the company's founders, ``Who's looking out for the poor
old cash customer?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. This story is about them _ those poor old cash
customers and the poor old cooks and waitresses who feed them and
humor them in a thousand little boxes thick with smoke and grease
and the clatter of people being people.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast side of the street
</P>
<P>
   It's 7 o'clock on a Friday morning, and the usual crowd is
streaming in: the painter, the preacher, the contractor whose lady
won't let him smoke at home, the guy whose hair looks suspiciously
dark and shiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne, did you dye your hair?'' waitress Amanda Jacobs asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' Wayne says, settling into a booth. ``It's Just for
Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Waffle House is assigned a number according to when it
opened. Unit 7, on West Washington Road in East Point, is one of
the oldest. It's an authentic classic, from the fake-brick floor to
the faux-wooden booths to the brown laminate countertop _ a
symphony of earth tones that was last fashionable when Barry White
was popular the first time around. The open kitchen _ all stainless
steel and sizzle _ has two griddles, two burners and six round
waffle irons that gleam like chrome hubcaps.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, there's a historic personage at the door. ``Miss
Lucy'' Shelton has been waiting tables in Atlanta for so long that
she remembers pouring coffee for Margaret Mitchell. She's been
working for Waffle House since 1957 and still comes in regularly to
greet customers like a Wal-Mart hostess. Most of them know her; one
of them says she looks like Lena Horne.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast being the busiest time of day, the company tries to
situate its stores on the right side of the road to the heaviest
morning traffic. Customers at that hour witness a short-order
fandango that's rare in restaurants these days. Waffle House cooks
do not consult written orders or video monitors. Instead,
waitresses line up at the ``wait-and-watch'' mark, a colored tile
on the floor, and take turns calling out orders in a
stream-o'-slang that can sound like a tobacco auction. (Hash browns
all the way comes out
scattered-smothered-covered-chunked-topped-diced-peppered.) Then
the servers watch as the cook acknowledges the order and records it
symbolically with condiments on plates. A jelly package denotes
eggs, a butter cup a waffle, an upside-down butter cup a pecan
waffle.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most fluent grill operators can be left speechless on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Harper, the first-shift cook at Unit 7, can flip omelets
and juggle eggs like some Cirque du Soleil acrobat. But he's taken
aback when a waitress shouts an order for ``scrambled with sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   He puts down his frying pan and looks at her as if she's trying
to be funny. Who you callin' sugar, sugar?
</P>
<P>
   She rolls her eyes. ``She wants a little sugar in her scrambled
eggs, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl puts a package of sugar on a plate and turns back to the
grill. Learn something every day.
</P>
<P>
   Planting `yellow seeds'
</P>
<P>
   The first song on every Waffle House jukebox is ``Waffle House
Family, Part 1,'' a lively ditty performed by Mary Welch Rogers,
the CEO's wife. Not every employee appreciates it.
</P>
<P>
   When someone selects the title during the lunch rush at Unit
1000 in Avondale Estates, waitress Jackie Almond glares at the
infernal music machine and snarls, ``Death to the person who put on
the Waffle House song!''
</P>
<P>
   Some customers think it's cute to play one Waffle House song
after another. Sometimes they'll punch up $10 worth of them and
skedaddle. The help gets sick of it. One regular liked to play the
songs so much that Jackie called him Aggravatin' Richard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waffle House Family'' has a verse that seems appropriate for
this particular franchise:
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, Tom and Joe
</P>
<P>
   Planted little yellow seeds
</P>
<P>
   And watched 'em grow.
</P>
<P>
   Unit 1000 is what became of the first seed. On Labor Day 1955,
the uber-wafflehaus opened down the street from here on College
Avenue. Joe Rogers Sr., a manager for the Toddle House chain of
diners, was unhappy that the company didn't allow employees to
invest in its stock. So he decided to start his own company with a
neighbor in Avondale, real estate man Tom Forkner. A few years
later, an Atlanta equipment salesman who had been supplying them
borrowed the concept again and launched the Huddle House chain. If
you're keeping score, that's Toddle to Waffle to Huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Unit 1 was mothballed a few years ago _ it became a Chinese
restaurant _ and was replaced by the much larger Unit 1000. But the
same old faces still come around for lunch. Roosevelt Murray, a
welder, sits at the counter with Lloyd X. Creecy, a retired school
administrator, and they talk about Kosovo over eggs and raisin
toast. Connie Bailey, a hardware clerk, walks in the door, and her
friend Jackie orders up her usual cheeseburger by instructing the
cook to ``Feed Connie!'' (Later, when Connie doesn't finish her
chocolate cream pie, Jackie snitches a bite and Connie cries,
``Feed Jackie!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``See, this place is like our club,'' says Jack Haralson, a
leather-skinned auto mechanic, who sits at the back booth sucking
cigarettes and sipping coffee. ``I'll bet I come in here three
times a day. Been doing it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been doing it, in fact, since the beginning. He was there
on Labor Day '55. The man across the table from him, Doug Jordan,
was there even earlier: He laid the restroom tile for Unit 1.
</P>
<P>
   They both remember stopping by that day for free Cokes and
hearing Joe Sr. tell anyone who would listen that someday Waffle
Houses would cover Dixie like the dew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone laughed at him,'' Jack recalls, with a deep chuckle.
He takes another sip of coffee. Looks at the cup. ``You know, these
used to be bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   A waitress interrupts him. ``Jack! Telephone!''
</P>
<P>
   The garage knows exactly where to find him. A funeral home is
bringing over its hearses for servicing. Jack stubs out his
Marlboro and heads for the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back,'' he says, and no one doubts him.

<P>
   A day in the life of Waffle House -- TAKE 2
</P>
<P>
   (Package includes WAFFLEHOUSE, WAFFLEHOUSE-SUITS,
WAFFLEHOUSE-TRIVIA and photos.)
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ... doubts him.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of Flavor Fry
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you looking for a job full of excitement? Great pay? Great
benefits? Come join the fun today: The Waffle House Way!''
</P>
<P>
   The orange recruitment poster practically grabs customers by the
lapels as they enter Unit 1215 on Peachtree Industrial Boulevard in
Suwanee. Like other fast-food outfits, Waffle House is constantly
looking for help _ even the back of the bill invites job
applicants. But the fun and excitement apparently eluded some of
the workers at this location.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, in the middle of second shift, a couple of them
walked off the job and didn't return. Which is why the woman with
two names is working the counter today.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed help. This isn't my regular unit.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the tags on her brown-and-white striped blouse says
Melanie Ford; the other says Penelope the Salesperson. Some
customers started calling her Penelope for some reason, and she
liked the idea of a stage name so much that she kept it. Maybe it
made her feel like Cher. It isn't too busy yet this evening _ the
Little League families and high school kids have yet to come _ so
Melanie pushes back her brown hair and talks about what it's like
being a Waffle House ``salesperson,'' as the company calls servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty good,'' she says. Subminimum wage, but you can net
$30 to $50 a day in tips, and you don't have to split it with the
others. Bonuses. Decent benefits. Employee stock plan. One waitress
in South Carolina is said to own more than $500,000 worth of
company stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Waffle House job to avoid, she says, is unit manager. ``I'd
take a pay cut not to be a manager. Those people work too hard. My
manager at 761, she'd work two or three days in a row and sleep in
the back on a couple of chairs pulled together. I brought her a
little mattress.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there's one other benefit. Working at the Waffle House is
the cheapest all-you-can-eat deal in town. The company deducts
$2.25 a day from each full-time paycheck on the assumption that
employees will be too busy not to dine in. They typically eat
kitchen mistakes. Sometimes Melanie sneaks a little takeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took some hash browns home the other day,'' she says, ``but
they didn't taste the same. Know why? I didn't use Flavor Fry.''
</P>
<P>
   Flavor Fry is the butter substitute the grill operator ladles
over hash browns like gravy over mashed potatoes. Melanie fetches
an industrial-size can of the miracle grease. The label lists
coconut oil, cottonseed oil, partially hydrogenated soybean oil _ a
90-proof cholesterol cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got all that in it?'' she says, scrunching up her face.
The dinner trade is starting to trickle in. Before she heads back
to the grill, she hides the can under the counter. ``Maybe I
shouldn't have shown you that.''
</P>
<P>
   They only come out at night
</P>
<P>
   One of the oddest things about Waffle House is how places that
look so identical can be so distinct. Take Unit 1058, at Pharr and
Piedmont roads in the wealthy Buckhead section of Atlanta. Other
Waffle Houses attract delivery vans or police cruisers. This one
gets stretch limousines.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the limo drivers hang out here,'' says Audran Johnson, a
bulky young man parked in the front booth while his long white
dream machine sits outside glowing fabulously under the street
lights. ``I just wish they had cappuccino.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 2 a.m., and the bar crowd is starting to show its glassy
eyes. The foursome in the back corner are celebrating a birthday
and have already hit four watering holes. The student at the
counter is blotting up alcohol with a ham steak and hash browns.
The chiquita in the sequined cocktail dress is drawing stares from
a roomful of men too tipsy to disguise their wandering eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this the Comedy Club,'' says waitress Angel Payne, who
wears Mardi Gras beads in her hair, an impromptu gift from one of
her customers. ``Everyone who comes in here after the bars close
thinks he's a comedian.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everyone. She says former Atlanta Mayor Maynard
Jackson came in for a bacon-egg-and-cheese sandwich the night
before. ``He autographed my ticket book.''
</P>
<P>
   And the classy-looking trio in the last window booth certainly
don't look looped. The three tastefully dressed Golden Girls are
chanteuses who have been performing at a nearby restaurant. When
they're finished singing, wherever the job, they cap the evening
with eggs and grits at the closest Waffle House. They know to bring
their evening wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep the air so cold in these places,'' Theresa Breuer
says. ``Chamblee-Tucker Road is the worst; you have to wear your
fur in that Waffle House.''
</P>
<P>
   The overnight shift is the diciest time for employees.
Robberies, altercations, customers passing out or tossing their
grits _ all the annoying stuff happens in the middle of the night.
One evening this spring, a bomb threat cleared out Unit 1058 at 1
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight, the house is merely busy and rowdy in a
good-natured way. Although there is one guy you wonder about. A
young man waiting in line for a table is talking loudly and drawing
uncomfortable glances.
</P>
<P>
   The menu, he says, stroking his goatee ... that jumbled menu
with the big-headed caricatures and the ``big deal'' dinners ...
it's written in secret code. And the heart of the code, he
continues, whipping out a sketchbook to make his point by drawing a
diagram, is that box in the middle where they reveal the seven
guises of hash browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hash browns, man,'' he says, as earnestly as a ``Star
Wars'' cultist expounding on the Force. ``It's all about the hash
browns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wee small hours at the Waffle House, who can argue?

 &HT;    Waffle House: Customers dish out bias suits across 3 states
 &HT;    (Package includes WAFFLEHOUSE, WAFFLEHOUSE-SUITS,
WAFFLEHOUSE-TRIVIA and photos.)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They call themselves the vampires, the overnight
workers who unload trucks and restock shelves at the Wal-Mart
Supercenter in Hiram. It was Dec. 11, the Christmas rush, and with
four trailers to empty before dawn, they were looking forward to
their meal break. At 2 a.m., nine of them piled into their cars and
drove down U.S. 278 to one of the few restaurants open at that hour
in Paulding County, a Waffle House.
</P>
<P>
   They sat at several uncleaned tables and waited. Half an hour
later, still waiting, they confronted a waitress about why they
weren't being served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all can go eat somewhere else,'' they say she told them.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers Rachel couldn't understand it. The restaurant wasn't
busy. His friends weren't acting rowdy. They'd eaten at the place
once before without problems. The waitresses were serving other
people, including two white women. Rachel's party was mixed: six
black, three white.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only reason I could figure,'' he says. ``That was
the hurtin' thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, all nine of the night-shift workers filed a
federal lawsuit charging Waffle House with racial discrimination.
It's one of five pending civil rights suits brought by customers
against the company or its franchisees in Georgia, Alabama and
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have the makings of a Denny's situation here,'' says
Daniel Huff, the Atlanta lawyer who is representing the Wal-Mart
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Denny's _ the word can send shivers up the corporate spine. In
1994, the Spartanburg, S.C.-based chain of coffee shops showed how
costly civil rights controversies can get when it paid $46 million
to settle two class-action suits involving thousands of black
customers. The case began with six Secret Service agents who said
they had been denied service at a Denny's in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Waffle House and its franchisees have contested the allegations
in each of the suits. Some 30,000 people work in 1,200 Waffle
Houses across the Sun Belt, half of them company-owned. All
staffers are governed by a thick employee handbook, ``The Waffle
House Way,'' which forbids discriminatory behavior and directs
anyone who sees it to ``stop it, fix it and report it'' by calling
a toll-free line at corporate headquarters in Norcross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is zero tolerance,'' says Chris Jacobsen, vice
president for communications. He would not comment on specific
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the most troublesome area for Waffle House has been
gender relations. In 1997, a federal judge in Texas stung the
company with an $8.1 million verdict in a sexual harassment
complaint brought by a personnel recruiter who had worked with
Waffle House for 3 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Therese Scribner claimed that her immediate
bosses had made fun of her large bust and had once placed a camera
between her legs and snapped a picture. In an unusually angry
opinion, Judge Jerry Buchmeyer called her superiors ``liars'' and
concluded that Waffle House CEO Joe Rogers Jr. knew of the
harassment but did nothing to stop it, fix it or investigate it.
The two supervisors accused of the worst harassment still work for
the company, one of them at headquarters. Waffle House is appealing
the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least six other sexual harassment suits pending
against Waffle House and its franchisees.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only two racial discrimination cases have cost the
restaurant chain. Last year, two black couples who said they had
been refused service in a Clinton, Ala., Waffle House settled out
of court with the company that ran the unit, Treetop Enterprises
(now SouthEast Waffles) of Nashville. And in January, a federal
jury awarded eight Atlanta teenagers $440,000 for emotional
distress in an incident at a Waffle House in Commerce, Ga. The
teens, part of the North Atlanta High School band, said a cook
called them racist names when they stopped by after performing at a
football game in 1996. Although the jury sided with the eight, it
did not find evidence of discrimination. Hillcrest Foods of
Suwanee, which runs the unit, is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The other discrimination cases are so similar they could have
been poured from the same pot of coffee. All happened late at night
and all involved white waitresses and black customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Alabama, six customers say a waitress refused to serve them
at a unit in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover. They sued in March.
(The franchisee, SouthEast Waffles, investigated and fired the
waitress within 24 hours, says Hugh C. Howser Jr., an attorney
representing the company.)
</P>
<P>
   _ In South Carolina, nine family members took a break from
visiting a sick relative and went to the Waffle House in Santee.
They say a waitress accused them of stealing silverware and loudly
berated them with racial slurs. They sued her, the manager and
Waffle House.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Georgia, an emergency room clerk and his wife say they were
denied service when they tried to eat at a Waffle House in Forsyth.
When they grew upset, a white Forsyth police officer who was there
off-duty advised them not to make a scene but to contact a lawyer
if they wanted to press their case. The officer, Alvin Bearden,
later gave a deposition supporting their complaint. ``None of the
Caucasian patrons had any problems getting service that I
noticed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The night-shift workers in Hiram say they were not eager to join
the roster of Waffle House litigants. After they left Wal-Mart
around 7 that morning, still hungry from having missed their meal,
they went back to the restaurant as a group and asked the manager
in charge why the waitress had treated them so rudely.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he'd just apologized and offered us a free breakfast or
something, it probably would have stopped right there,'' Rachel
says. ``But he folded his arms and said he hadn't been there, so he
hadn't seen anything. There was nothing he could do.''
</P>
<P>
   The group talked it over and then contacted a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   For Shari Chase, a 37-year-old white co-worker, it was a matter
of accountability. ``If I treated a customer like that at
Wal-Mart,'' she says, ``I'd be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel's motivation in suing was more personal. The 60-year-old
Paulding County native was a grown man before segregation was
outlawed in 1964. He drove a rig back then and remembers what it
was like to be turned away from a truck stop because of the color
of his skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought all that was over,'' he says. ``I've got a
10-year-old daughter now, and I don't want her to see anything like
this again, ever.''

 &HT;    Waffle House: Weird and wonderful trivia
 &HT;    (Package includes WAFFLEHOUSE, WAFFLEHOUSE-SUITS,
WAFFLEHOUSE-TRIVIA and photos.)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAFFLEPRAISE: Waffle House joined the likes of Spago and Chez
Panisse on Saveur magazine's ``Saveur 100,'' the gourmet
publication's list of things it loves. How did a chain of
greasy-spoon diners rate such recognition from such a
discriminating magazine? One of the editors, Ann McCarthy, grew up
with WH in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLEBELLS: People have been known to marry at WH. In
Lawrenceville, Ga., a cook and a waitress said their vows in front
of the jukebox. In Attalla, Ala., witnesses tossed uncooked grits
and hash browns at the happy couple.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLEGRUB: The most popular menu item isn't waffles; it's
coffee, followed by hash browns, then waffles. And, no, don't ask
for pancakes _ unless you know the cook real well.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLESONGS: ``Waffle Doo Wop,'' ``Good Food Fast,'' ``There Are
Raisins in My Toast'' _ the kitschy house music you find in every
WH jukebox is available on CD. For information, call 1-877-923-3532
or go to www.wafflehousesongs.com.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLEMATH: WH claims it has found 844,739 ways to prepare a
hamburger. In a song about it, a customer describes what happened
when he asked a waitress to name them: ``She said, `You can have it
rare, medium or well inside; single, double or triple fried; mayo,
mustard, lettuce, onions and ketchup, too; pickles, cheese, chili,
bacon ...' and suddenly her voice started shakin', she was runnin'
out of air and turning blue.'' The 844,739 figure, incidentally,
was calculated by a mathematics class at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLEFIGHT: Four co-workers at the Grand Bay, Ala., WH sued a
waitress to force her to share winnings from a lottery ticket that
had been given to them by a customer. A jury told her to split the
$10 million.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLEPOLS: During the last presidential campaign, Bob Dole
joked that Bill Clinton had turned the White House into the Waffle
House.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLEBOSS: Joe Rogers Jr., WH's CEO and majority owner, is a
mover and shaker in Republican politics who has signed on with
George W. Bush's finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLEWOOD: In the movie ``Tin Cup,'' the golf pro played by
Kevin Costner celebrates his unlikely victory at WH.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLEJOCKS: Athletes eat up WH. Among its frequent customers
are Deion Sanders, Evander Holyfield and Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   WAFFLEWEAR: Musicians like WH, too. Customers at the WH near
Nashville's Opryland swear that Marty Stuart once stopped by for
coffee _ in his pajamas.

 &HT;    Southern Baptists focus on issues at convention
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Baptists from around the country will gather
in the Georgia Dome this week for what promises to be a meeting
full of praising, preaching and politicking over issues ranging
from TV violence to human embryo research.
</P>
<P>
   About 14,000 ``messengers'' are expected to register, with
thousands of family members and employees of Baptist agencies and
institutions also attending.
</P>
<P>
   Early risers will convene at 8 a.m. Tuesday for music led by the
Revival Choir and Sunday Celebration Orchestra of First Baptist
Church in Snellville. The faithful will leave after 9:10 p.m.
Wednesday and the benediction by Alabama evangelist Junior Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there will be a welcome by Chick-Fil-A founder
Truett Cathey, testimony by football player Reggie White and a
prayer by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, best known as founder of Liberty
University and the now-defunct Moral Majority.
</P>
<P>
   This year's annual presidential election is expected to be
uncontested, with the Rev. Paige Patterson, president of
Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake Forest, N.C.,
sliding into a second term.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, an architect of the conservative resurgence in the
denomination over the last quarter century, said he plans to focus
on the need to reach the nation's major urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   His push comes when the Southern Baptist Convention has recorded
its first loss in membership since 1926.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said in a recent telephone interview that he is
especially concerned about ``getting out of our traditional South
area.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to move the image of the denomination beyond Dixie,
two messengers to last year's convention proposed changing the name
to something less regional. But the denomination's executive
committee found in February that there is ``no compelling
rationale'' for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The geographical designation in my estimation is not the most
helpful,'' Patterson said. ``The problem is there really isn't a
good name out there that anybody's come up with that is any better.
And although Southern Baptist is no longer a geographical
designation, it is the truth that 'Southern Baptist' says something
theologically. If somebody says I'm Southern Baptist, everybody
knows to either pucker or duck.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's meeting of Southern Baptists may be asked to take
stands on several issues in the news, according to Richard Land,
president of the SBC's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission.
Land says his agency, which address social issues on behalf of
Southern Baptists, wants the commission to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Come out against research on human embryos. Last month, a
panel appointed by President Clinton recommended that the federal
government begin funding some research on human embryos, citing
evidene that some embryo cells can potentially grow into
replacement tissues to treat a variety of diseases. ``When you
start arguing that it's all right to kill human embryos in order to
do treatments and research that benefit other people, you're
lowering yourselves to biotechnical cannibalism in which you're
eating your own young in order to sustain your health or extend
your life,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Condemn ethnic cleansing, wherever it occurs. ``If the 20th
century has taught us anything, it has taught us where that
leads,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Urge a reduction of violence in entertainment. ``These people
who are pimping this kind of behavior to our children need to be
called to account, and we need to be called to account for not
having stopped this kind of emotional abuse of our children,'' Land
said.

 &HT;    Faulder victim remembered as 'kind, gentle and loving'
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jerry Graham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ The murder of Inez Phillips was a defining
moment for a generation of Gladewater, Texas, residents, just as
the assassination of President Kennedy was burned into the memories
of Americans a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And residents are ready for her killer's execution to be carried
out Thursday, regardless of the international implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can remember where they were when they heard the
news of her death. It was one of those events,'' said Joyce Hugman
of Gladewater. ``It really shook up the whole town, because she was
so beloved and so innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stanley Faulder, 61, a Canadian whose pending execution
has become an international issue, is scheduled to die after 6 p.m.
CDT Thursday for the July 8, 1975, slaying of Mrs. Phillips, 75. He
would be the first Canadian executed in the United States since
1952.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time she was murdered, she was putting up preserves.
That is what she was doing when they banged on her door,'' Hugman
said, referring to Faulder's accomplice, who persuaded Mrs.
Phillips to open her door, after which Faulder rushed in and robbed
and killed her.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian media have portrayed Faulder as an unfortunate soul
whose personality changed when he fell from a moving car as a
child, and have portrayed Mrs. Phillips as the matriarch of a
wealthy Gladewater family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me so annoyed when the press refers to her as an oil
heiress. She didn't inherit anything. She worked for what she
got,'' Hugman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Phillips was a schoolteacher before she married. Her
husband, Loyce, was a bank clerk until the oil boom came. Then he
started investing in oil wells. He discovered oil fields around
here, along with his son Jack,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is referred to as a socialite. Well, her social life was
the First Baptist Church and the Garden Club. Her activities
revolved around the church,'' Hugman said.
</P>
<P>
   Gladewater residents would like to see the execution carried out
because they think Faulder is despicable, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Faulder's wife described him as no good and mean in a
letter she wrote to Mrs. Phillips' son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faulder never worked when he was married to her, and she had
to support the family. He walked off and left her with three
children to support, and she never heard from him again,'' Hugman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Sandra Babcock has tried to challenge Faulder's
conviction on the grounds that law enforcement officials did not
notify the Canadian consulate that Faulder had been arrested in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A treaty ratified by the United States requires the Canadian
consulate to be notified when a Canadian is arrested. Officers said
they were unaware of the treaty and unaware Faulder was a Canadian
because he had a Texas driver's license when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has asked state officials
to grant clemency to Faulder. Failure to do so could affect the
rights of U.S. citizens who are arrested in a foreign country, she
contends. Hugman thinks Albright should stay out of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like if Madeleine Albright will take care of what is
going on in the Balkans and Yugoslavia, Texans will take care of
Texas justice,'' she said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me he should have exhausted his appeals. I don't
see where another appeal could be heard. This needs to get over
with,'' she said.

 &HT;    Fallout continues as IOC convenes
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The seismic upheaval that shook the foundation of the
Olympic movement is just over six months old. The aftershocks could
be felt for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, International Olympic Committee members will feel the
tremors on the streets, where cost-cutting organizers threaten to
transport the highnesses in buses rather than Mercedes-Benzes
during the 2000 Summer Games. They also might have to tone down
playing facilities and athlete housing.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, where a bribery scandal involving 2002 Winter
Games officials and IOC members erupted last November, organizing
committee president Mitt Romney just cut $98 million out of his
budget. The shaking will be felt under the skis and skates of U.S.
athletes, who face limited training access to venues before the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Congress is considering legislation that could
drive sponsors away from the Games and deter cities from seeking
the Olympics. And there's no telling what shock waves would emanate
from Atlanta when congressional investigators, looking for evidence
of fraud and bribery in Olympic records at the Atlanta History
Center, go public with any findings.
</P>
<P>
   In Lausanne, Switzerland, home of the IOC, 10 members have been
booted, and reforms are being considered on how the committee does
its business.
</P>
<P>
   How far will those reforms go? Will the aftershocks cease and
normalcy return? Or will the Olympic landscape someday be reshaped
and unrecognizable? Some clues will emerge this week when the IOC
begins to put the darkest days of its 105-year-history behind it as
the general assembly meets in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the IOC's private club still claim that the Salt Lake
scandal and its spread to other bid cities was a creation of
overzealous media and ambitious U.S. politicians. They cannot
comprehend how $1 million worth of vacation trips, cash,
scholarships, skis and semi-automatic shotguns provided by
ambitious hosts of the 2002 Games could have wrought all this
global handwringing.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in an effort to silence the critics and reassure its
corporate sponsors, the IOC has promised to change its ways. In
addition to running off its worst offenders, the committee
appointed an ethics panel to forge a code of conduct and created an
80-member reform panel that includes such luminaries as former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Peter Ueberroth, who
operated the successful Los Angeles Games of 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The reform group gathered two weeks ago to consider ways to
restructure the IOC and revamp the Olympic bidding and selection
system. While they came up with little consensus on the specfics,
Kissinger, one of 36 outside members on the panel, said he thinks
that the IOC is moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a legitimate forum, and I think serious efforts
have been made,'' Kissinger said, giving some credibility to the
IOC's commitment to change.
</P>
<P>
   The reform panel will present preliminary findings at this
week's meetings. It says the IOC should include athletes who are
elected by active Olympic competitors. And it proposes a new
bidding system for the 2008 Summer Games, for which 10 cities are
lining up to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has a poor history of enacting reforms, especially in
efficiency and frugality. Next year's Summer Games will offer 300
medal events, 29 more than in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger is not better,'' Ueberroth told the reform group. ``If
the Games get any bigger, no city or country will be able to do it
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also shows little inclination to curb its mushrooming
membership, which generally amounts to a lifetime privilege.
Corruption attrition hasn't done the trick. Even after six IOC
members were expelled in March and four resigned after being
accused of receiving cash and lavish gifts from Salt Lake City's
bid team, the body still has 105 members. Elections for newcomers
are expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   One more member might get the ax. Phil Coles of Australia
already has been censured for his Salt Lake City escapades and now
is under fire from colleagues for the personal dossiers he compiled
on their tastes and habits and allegedly turned over to bid groups.
</P>
<P>
   A former Olympic rower, Coles barely has been hanging on since
the Atlanta organizers reported to the U.S. House Commerce
Committee that he brought two companions _ one over the limit _ on
an expenses-paid trip here in July 1989. The tab cost $13,053.21,
which the Atlantans said they were happy to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   One member who appears to have weathered the storm is the man at
the top, Juan Antonio Samaranch. The IOC president says he is not
going anywhere, despite pressure from worldwide media and small
segments of his fractured IOC club.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Un-yong, a close ally of Samaranch, said the general
assembly will solidify the president's position this week. ``Mr.
Samaranch has absolute support,'' Kim said. ``In his opening
remarks in Seoul, he will make clear that he will stay on until
2001 and finish his mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim himself has survived an investigation of his own
gift-gobbling, which included a $616 Tiffany jewelry box from
Atlanta bidders.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dick Pound, an IOC vice president, recently echoed out
loud the whispers within the Olympic family _ that Samaranch might
leave after ushering in reforms at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   (Long optional trim begins here)
</P>
<P>
   Kim shares the sentiment of many IOC members, who maintain that
the Salt Lake scandal is being kept alive as a campaign platform
for ambitious U.S. politicians.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), a presidential contender and a
harsh IOC critic, conducted Senate hearings in which the committee
was accused of fostering a ``culture of corruption'' and not acting
swiftly enough to enact reforms. As chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, he has threatened to take away tax deductions given
companies for sponsoring the Olympics, which would hit the IOC
where it really hurts _ in the pocketbook. A proposed bill also
would give the U.S. Olympic Committee control over this country's
television-rights fees for the Games, the IOC's single biggest
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the House Commerce Committee is investigating
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games, while pressuring the White House
to place the IOC under international anti-bribery laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do what they desire,'' Samaranch said. ``But I
repeat: The IOC is run by the IOC members. . . . We highly respect
the Senate of the United States, but I am sure they also will
respect the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   Uprooting corruption entirely from the IOC won't be easy, if
only because the roots go deep. Samaranch has been accused of
ignoring accusations for years that some members have had their
hands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salt Lake City is, in my opinion, probably one of the most
innocent bid cities in recent times,'' Ueberroth told the panel.
``You know that, and I know that. The culture that caused the
problems started in 1956 and can be easily disposed of by this body
and current leadership of the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   But Samaranch says he thinks that the scandal has been disposed
of and that reform is on the way. ``This meeting is only the
beginning,'' he said. ``Our aim is to have final decisions by the
end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is soon enough _ and whether the reforms go far
enough _ is an issue for Sydney and Salt Lake City organizers, who
are facing $400 million shortfalls in their combined budgets. Some
potential sponsors are taking a wait-and-see attitude before
paying. Just last week, the most vocal critic from the corporate
ranks cautioned any sponsors about signing on now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way for corporations to keep the IOC's feet to the
fire on reform is to withhold any new IOC sponsorships until we see
what the reforms are,'' the president of John Hancock Financial
Services, David D'Alessandro, wrote in a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers, who remain about $100 million short of
sponsorship goals, this month trimmed $48 million from their $1.6
billion budget. They blame the IOC's greasy palms for hurting
sponsorship and consumer confidence in the Games and consequently
have cut $3.7 million from their spending on the IOC, sports
federations and National Olympic committees. The Olympic VIPs will
share cars, enjoy reduced catering and get fewer free tickets than
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly keen to get the IOC to behave as much as
possible like ordinary citizens of Sydney,'' said Sydney Organizing
Committee president Michael Knight. There's also a freeze on
hiring, and organizers reportedly foresee less paid staff and more
volunteers during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates said any
cutbacks could mean changes in the athletes' Olympic Village and in
the stadiums and arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in Salt Lake's $1.45 billion budget tentatively
includes $5 million lost for the operation of ski jumps, the
bobsled and luge track and the speedskating oval. The venues would
remain closed until just before the Games. U.S. athletes had hoped
to begin training free at the venues beginning next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Romney needs to find money somewhere. Some $300 million short in
sponsor fees, he has asked the IOC to pick up some of its members'
costs in Salt Lake, including hotel charges.
</P>
<P>
   And he is expected to ask the IOC this week to renegotiate its
contract to cut Salt Lake's costs in the same way Sydney's costs
for 2000 are being trimmed _ by deferring royalty payments on
merchandise, sponsorships and tickets.
</P>
<P>
   An IOC spokesman said Salt Lake should not expect much relief.
``We're not the sugar daddy who has all this money hidden under a
tree in Lausanne,'' Franklin Servan-Schreiber said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC marketing staff isn't helping Salt Lake's cause, either.
It recently announced an increase in worldwide sponsorship fees,
from $40 million to $55 million, for the 2001-2004 quadrennium.
Nine of the 11 current international sponsors are based in the
United States, where the heat from the scandal is hottest.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers in the next two host cities vow that any cutbacks
will have no impact on the spectators or the athletes once the
Games begin.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, says viewers will forget
the scandal when the flame is lit in Sydney. ``The Olympics, in
terms of viewers and advertisers, are the athletes and competition.
At no reasonable level does anyone think that has been impacted.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The other order of business this week is the selection of a host
city for the 2006 Winter Games. As the IOC copes with the excessive
trips, lavish entertaining and expensive gifts received by its
members, most of the candidates are complaining about an emergency
ban that prevented the members from touring their cities. Under a
trial format this week, a 16-member panel of members and outsiders
will vote to eliminate four hopefuls virtually sight unseen. Then
the entire IOC will pick the winner.
</P>
<P>
   If no loser threatens litigation, the temporary fix might be
made permanent. It would generate yet another after-shock to the
scandal that has shaken the Olympic movement.

 &HT;    Mel Torme: The crooner loved his craft
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a songwriter, arranger, actor, drummer and author. What
jazz listeners worldwide will miss most about Mel Torme, however,
is that voice.
</P>
<P>
   It was soothing, silky and fluid. It was the audio equivalent of
warm butterscotch inching lazily down scoops of ice cream in a
parfait glass. And whether it was coming from a phone, echoing from
a stage or seated across from you, it was the first thing that
rattled and awakened your senses in the singer's presence.
Incredibly, its strength and range actually improved as Torme aged.
``I've never smoked or drank or messed with any kind of drugs
ever,'' he explained in 1989. ``I guess that's why everything still
works.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, at age 73, the complications from a 1996 stroke
finally silenced ``the Velvet Fog.'' But Mel Torme leaves behind a
singing legacy matched, arguably, only by Frank Sinatra, Ella
Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday.
</P>
<P>
   If not for the love of his craft, the jazz and pop vocalist
could have been but a tiny footnote in a guide to American
songwriters. At age 21, in 40 minutes on a sweltering day in
California's San Fernando Valley, Torme and lyricist Bob Wells
banged out ``The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open
Fire).'' The result was a lifelong pile of money for both. There
are close to 3,000 recorded versions of the seasonal standard
written in the July heat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever thought I would be sitting here discussing the
50th anniversary of that tune,'' Torme said in 1995. ``Everyone
thought it was a one-night song. We just hoped that the Nat Cole
version would do OK. Every time I get a royalty check, I'm stunned.
Sure, I could have retired, there's no question about that. I just
enjoy performing too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Torme enjoyed more was his role as an
international jazz ambassador. Even during interviews, he spoke
using a jazz musician's vocabulary. Conversations were sprinkled
liberally with ``babes'' and ``cats.'' Concerts were ``gigs'' or
``dates.'' Musical mistakes were ``clams.'' His arrangements were
his ``charts.'' Torme's reputation as a scat singer, matched only
by his idol Fitzgerald and Jon Hendricks, was a source of great
pride.
</P>
<P>
   The crooner enjoyed blurring racial divides. The first sentence
of his 1988 memoir, ``It Wasn't All Velvet,'' reads: ``Ethel Waters
was once widely quoted as having said, `Mel Torme is the only white
man who sings with the soul of a black man.'''
</P>
<P>
   The accomplished artist was equally savvy at business. He
actively marketed himself to the children and grandchildren of the
bobby-soxers who first swooned to the crooner in the 1940s. He did
13 guest shots on the NBC sitcom ``Night Court'' and popped up on
an episode of ``Seinfeld.'' He recorded with new wave rock combo
Was (Not Was). In 1995 he faked a sky-diving jump while singing ``I
Get a Kick Out of You'' in a Mountain Dew commercial. ``I actually
jumped just 30 feet,'' quipped Torme. ``At my age, it felt like
200!''
</P>
<P>
   In between concerts and acting, Torme turned to writing. In
addition to an autobiography, he penned ``Wynner,'' a novel; ``The
Other Side of the Rainbow,'' a 1970 memoir of his time spent as the
musical arranger on Judy Garland's ill-fated television show;
1991's ``Traps,'' a biography of pal and jazz drummer Buddy Rich;
and 1994's ``My Singing Teachers: Reflections on Singing Popular
Music.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a stroke stripped him of his greatest instrument, Torme
reflected on his place in the music world. ``People are always
asking me, `Who's going to take your place?''' he said. ```Who's
coming up who can sing scat and sing jazz with your approach?'
Sadly, I've looked and I can't point a finger at anyone in the
business right now.'' As far as male performers go, only Harry
Connick Jr. comes to mind as a figure currently on the jazz scene
who shares Torme's ability to write, arrange, play a variety of
instruments and act and who has Torme's respect for jazz
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   On his final live recording, ``A&AMP;E Presents an Evening With Mel
Torme,'' released in 1996, Torme paused midway through his set to
pay tribute to a recently departed singing idol. ``Ella
Fitzgerald,'' he said. ``There was only one of those. We've lost a
heavyweight.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could well be said of ``the Velvet Fog.''

system. While they came up with little consensus on the specfics,
Kissinger, one of 36 outside members on the panel, said he thinks
that the IOC is moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a legitimate forum, and I think serious efforts
have been made,'' Kissinger said, giving some credibility to the
IOC's commitment to change.
</P>
<P>
   The reform panel will present preliminary findings at this
week's meetings. It says the IOC should include athletes who are
elected by active Olympic competitors. And it proposes a new
bidding system for the 2008 Summer Games, for which 10 cities are
lining up to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has a poor history of enacting reforms, especially in
efficiency and frugality. Next year's Summer Games will offer 300
medal events, 29 more than in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger is not better,'' Ueberroth told the reform group. ``If
the Games get any bigger, no city or country will be able to do it
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also shows little inclination to curb its mushrooming
membership, which generally amounts to a lifetime privilege.
Corruption attrition hasn't done the trick. Even after six IOC
members were expelled in March and four resigned after being
accused of receiving cash and lavish gifts from Salt Lake City's
bid team, the body still has 105 members. Elections for newcomers
are expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   One more member might get the ax. Phil Coles of Australia
already has been censured for his Salt Lake City escapades and now
is under fire from colleagues for the personal dossiers he compiled
on their tastes and habits and allegedly turned over to bid groups.
</P>
<P>
   A former Olympic rower, Coles barely has been hanging on since
the Atlanta organizers reported to the U.S. House Commerce
Committee that he brought two companions _ one over the limit _ on
an expenses-paid trip here in July 1989. The tab cost $13,053.21,
which the Atlantans said they were happy to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   One member who appears to have weathered the storm is the man at
the top, Juan Antonio Samaranch. The IOC president says he is not
going anywhere, despite pressure from worldwide media and small
segments of his fractured IOC club.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Un-yong, a close ally of Samaranch, said the general
assembly will solidify the president's position this week. ``Mr.
Samaranch has absolute support,'' Kim said. ``In his opening
remarks in Seoul, he will make clear that he will stay on until
2001 and finish his mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim himself has survived an investigation of his own
gift-gobbling, which included a $616 Tiffany jewelry box from
Atlanta bidders.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dick Pound, an IOC vice president, recently echoed out
loud the whispers within the Olympic family _ that Samaranch might
leave after ushering in reforms at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   (Long optional trim begins here)
</P>
<P>
   Kim shares the sentiment of many IOC members, who maintain that
the Salt Lake scandal is being kept alive as a campaign platform
for ambitious U.S. politicians.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), a presidential contender and a
harsh IOC critic, conducted Senate hearings in which the committee
was accused of fostering a ``culture of corruption'' and not acting
swiftly enough to enact reforms. As chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, he has threatened to take away tax deductions given
companies for sponsoring the Olympics, which would hit the IOC
where it really hurts _ in the pocketbook. A proposed bill also
would give the U.S. Olympic Committee control over this country's
television-rights fees for the Games, the IOC's single biggest
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the House Commerce Committee is investigating
Atlanta's bid for the 1996 Games, while pressuring the White House
to place the IOC under international anti-bribery laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do what they desire,'' Samaranch said. ``But I
repeat: The IOC is run by the IOC members. . . . We highly respect
the Senate of the United States, but I am sure they also will
respect the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   Uprooting corruption entirely from the IOC won't be easy, if
only because the roots go deep. Samaranch has been accused of
ignoring accusations for years that some members have had their
hands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salt Lake City is, in my opinion, probably one of the most
innocent bid cities in recent times,'' Ueberroth told the panel.
``You know that, and I know that. The culture that caused the
problems started in 1956 and can be easily disposed of by this body
and current leadership of the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   But Samaranch says he thinks that the scandal has been disposed
of and that reform is on the way. ``This meeting is only the
beginning,'' he said. ``Our aim is to have final decisions by the
end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is soon enough _ and whether the reforms go far
enough _ is an issue for Sydney and Salt Lake City organizers, who
are facing $400 million shortfalls in their combined budgets. Some
potential sponsors are taking a wait-and-see attitude before
paying. Just last week, the most vocal critic from the corporate
ranks cautioned any sponsors about signing on now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way for corporations to keep the IOC's feet to the
fire on reform is to withhold any new IOC sponsorships until we see
what the reforms are,'' the president of John Hancock Financial
Services, David D'Alessandro, wrote in a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney organizers, who remain about $100 million short of
sponsorship goals, this month trimmed $48 million from their $1.6
billion budget. They blame the IOC's greasy palms for hurting
sponsorship and consumer confidence in the Games and consequently
have cut $3.7 million from their spending on the IOC, sports
federations and National Olympic committees. The Olympic VIPs will
share cars, enjoy reduced catering and get fewer free tickets than
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly keen to get the IOC to behave as much as
possible like ordinary citizens of Sydney,'' said Sydney Organizing
Committee president Michael Knight. There's also a freeze on
hiring, and organizers reportedly foresee less paid staff and more
volunteers during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates said any
cutbacks could mean changes in the athletes' Olympic Village and in
the stadiums and arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in Salt Lake's $1.45 billion budget tentatively
includes $5 million lost for the operation of ski jumps, the
bobsled and luge track and the speedskating oval. The venues would
remain closed until just before the Games. U.S. athletes had hoped
to begin training free at the venues beginning next winter.
</P>
<P>
   Romney needs to find money somewhere. Some $300 million short in
sponsor fees, he has asked the IOC to pick up some of its members'
costs in Salt Lake, including hotel charges.
</P>
<P>
   And he is expected to ask the IOC this week to renegotiate its
contract to cut Salt Lake's costs in the same way Sydney's costs
for 2000 are being trimmed _ by deferring royalty payments on
merchandise, sponsorships and tickets.
</P>
<P>
   An IOC spokesman said Salt Lake should not expect much relief.
``We're not the sugar daddy who has all this money hidden under a
tree in Lausanne,'' Franklin Servan-Schreiber said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC marketing staff isn't helping Salt Lake's cause, either.
It recently announced an increase in worldwide sponsorship fees,
from $40 million to $55 million, for the 2001-2004 quadrennium.
Nine of the 11 current international sponsors are based in the
United States, where the heat from the scandal is hottest.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers in the next two host cities vow that any cutbacks
will have no impact on the spectators or the athletes once the
Games begin.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Sports, says viewers will forget
the scandal when the flame is lit in Sydney. ``The Olympics, in
terms of viewers and advertisers, are the athletes and competition.
At no reasonable level does anyone think that has been impacted.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The other order of business this week is the selection of a host
city for the 2006 Winter Games. As the IOC copes with the excessive

RON LINK, 58, DIRECTOR KNOWN FOR HIS THEATRICAL EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ohio)  (kd) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Link, a director known for his work off Off Broadway in the
1970s and 80s and later in experimental theater in Los Angeles,
died on Monday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 58 and lived in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac failure after abdominal surgery, said Dan
Gerrity, his companion.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Columbus, Ohio, Link began his theater career in his
early 20s as a stage manager in New York, working on the original
productions of ``The Fantasticks'' and ``Little Mary Sunshine''
before becoming a director.
</P>
<P>
   He became one of the first innovators of experimental Off
Broadway theater, creating some 22 productions at Caffe Cino and La
Mama ETC.
</P>
<P>
   He was also noted for his ability to discover new talent,
including a young Robert De Niro, who played 10 roles in Link's
production of ``Glamour, Glory and Gold,'' and Sylvester Stallone,
who performed in a revival of Somerset Maugham's ``Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Link's better-known productions was the prison spoof
``Women Behind Bars'' (1974), which he produced with its author,
Tom Eyen. The play ran for more than a year at the Astor Place
Theater and was later revived with the actor Divine before touring
the United States, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Link moved to Los Angeles in 1983, when the play moved to the
Roxy Theater there.
</P>
<P>
   His West Coast productions included Eyen's ``Why Hanna's Skirt
Won't Stay Down,'' with Susan Tyrrell, and ``Bouncers,'' with
Gerrity and Andrew Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Link also directed works by more conventional playwrights,
including Neil Simon, Herb Gardner and C.P. Taylor at theaters like
the Hartford Stage, the Globe Theater in San Diego and the Coconut
Grove Playhouse in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Gerrity, he is survived by his mother, Rita, and
a sister, Elizabeth, both of Columbus, and a brother, Carson, of
New York.

 &HT;    Fallout continues as IOC convenes
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The seismic upheaval that shook the foundation of the
Olympic movement is just over six months old. The aftershocks could
be felt for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, International Olympic Committee members will feel the
tremors on the streets, where cost-cutting organizers threaten to
transport the highnesses in buses rather than Mercedes-Benzes
during the 2000 Summer Games. They also might have to tone down
playing facilities and athlete housing.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City, where a bribery scandal involving 2002 Winter
Games officials and IOC members erupted last November, organizing
committee president Mitt Romney just cut $98 million out of his
budget. The shaking will be felt under the skis and skates of U.S.
athletes, who face limited training access to venues before the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Congress is considering legislation that could
drive sponsors away from the Games and deter cities from seeking
the Olympics. And there's no telling what shock waves would emanate
from Atlanta when congressional investigators, looking for evidence
of fraud and bribery in Olympic records at the Atlanta History
Center, go public with any findings.
</P>
<P>
   In Lausanne, Switzerland, home of the IOC, 10 members have been
booted, and reforms are being considered on how the committee does
its business.
</P>
<P>
   How far will those reforms go? Will the aftershocks cease and
normalcy return? Or will the Olympic landscape someday be reshaped
and unrecognizable? Some clues will emerge this week when the IOC
begins to put the darkest days of its 105-year-history behind it as
the general assembly meets in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the IOC's private club still claim that the Salt Lake
scandal and its spread to other bid cities was a creation of
overzealous media and ambitious U.S. politicians. They cannot
comprehend how $1 million worth of vacation trips, cash,
scholarships, skis and semi-automatic shotguns provided by
ambitious hosts of the 2002 Games could have wrought all this
global handwringing.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in an effort to silence the critics and reassure its
corporate sponsors, the IOC has promised to change its ways. In
addition to running off its worst offenders, the committee
appointed an ethics panel to forge a code of conduct and created an
80-member reform panel that includes such luminaries as former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Peter Ueberroth, who
operated the successful Los Angeles Games of 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The reform group gathered two weeks ago to consider ways to
restructure the IOC and revamp the Olympic bidding and selection
system. While they came up with little consensus on the specfics,
Kissinger, one of 36 outside members on the panel, said he thinks
that the IOC is moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a legitimate forum, and I think serious efforts
have been made,'' Kissinger said, giving some credibility to the
IOC's commitment to change.
</P>
<P>
   The reform panel will present preliminary findings at this
week's meetings. It says the IOC should include athletes who are
elected by active Olympic competitors. And it proposes a new
bidding system for the 2008 Summer Games, for which 10 cities are
lining up to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has a poor history of enacting reforms, especially in
efficiency and frugality. Next year's Summer Games will offer 300
medal events, 29 more than in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bigger is not better,'' Ueberroth told the reform group. ``If
the Games get any bigger, no city or country will be able to do it
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also shows little inclination to curb its mushrooming
membership, which generally amounts to a lifetime privilege.
Corruption attrition hasn't done the trick. Even after six IOC
members were expelled in March and four resigned after being
accused of receiving cash and lavish gifts from Salt Lake City's
bid team, the body still has 105 members. Elections for newcomers
are expected this week.
</P>
<P>
   One more member might get the ax. Phil Coles of Australia
already has been censured for his Salt Lake City escapades and now
is under fire from colleagues for the personal dossiers he compiled
on their tastes and habits and allegedly turned over to bid groups.
</P>
<P>
   A former Olympic rower, Coles barely has been hanging on since
the Atlanta organizers reported to the U.S. House Commerce
Committee that he brought two companions _ one over the limit _ on
an expenses-paid trip here in July 1989. The tab cost $13,053.21,
which the Atlantans said they were happy to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   One member who appears to have weathered the storm is the man at
the top, Juan Antonio Samaranch. The IOC president says he is not
going anywhere, despite pressure from worldwide media and small
segments of his fractured IOC club.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Un-yong, a close ally of Samaranch, said the general
assembly will solidify the president's position this week. ``Mr.
Samaranch has absolute support,'' Kim said. ``In his opening
remarks in Seoul, he will make clear that he will stay on until
2001 and finish his mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim himself has survived an investigation of his own
gift-gobbling, which included a $616 Tiffany jewelry box from
Atlanta bidders.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dick Pound, an IOC vice president, recently echoed out
loud the whispers within the Olympic family _ that Samaranch might
leave after ushering in reforms at the end of this year.

 &HT;    Baptists go door-to-door before convention
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Close encounters of the Baptist kind occurred all over
metro Atlanta on Saturday as the Southern Baptist Convention hosted
a giant family festival in Centennial Olympic Park and block
parties in some 20 neighborhoods. Meanwhile, hundreds of Baptists
canvassed door-to-door in about 40 communities from the city to the
farthest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, known as Crossover Atlanta _ for the sweep across
Atlanta and for Jesus's cross over the city _ will continue on a
smaller scale through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Carter, a homeless tap-dancer sat on a bench in
Centennial Olympic Park surrounded by four teen-age girls from
Peachtree Corners Baptist Church in Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me to marry him,'' said Laura Hayes, 15. ``He was
real nice, though.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls had already spent four hours talking to people in the
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just ask if they're Christian, and stuff,'' said Sarah
Shaw, 13, also of Peachtree Corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been awesome,'' said Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, teams had reported more than 1,000 religious
conversions with many more groups yet to call in, according to Jack
Smith of the Alpharetta-based North American Mission Board, the
agency responsible for evangelism in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not every team made a convert, but most had memorable
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of one group's activities as they canvassed
Candler Park, an urban, gentrified neighborhood, on behalf of three
small Baptist churches in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Archie, 40, is watching her recording of last night's
basketball game when she hears a knock at the door. She opens it to
two young women and a middle-aged man going door-to-door on behalf
of the Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't attend church because they say I'm going to hell
because I'm homosexual,'' says Archie, 40, a graphic artist who
lives with her partner.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations goes on, moving through a discussion of heaven
and a solicitation of prayer requests. Then it comes back to
Baptists and gays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bible-believing, practicing Baptists love you,'' says Ken
Taylor, who teaches urban missions at New Orleans Baptist
Theological Seminary. ``There are things about your likestyle we
don't like, but if we follow the Bible, we know God loves you just
as much as anybody else. That means we love you, too.. . ``
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is fellowship,'' says Agnes Karivki, a masters
degree student at the University of Utah who is originally from
Kenya. ``It's Jesus Christ that binds us together.''
</P>
<P>
   Archie: ``I don't need a church to connect with Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Kariviki: ``Do you pray?''
</P>
<P>
   Archie: ``I talk to God all the time. . . .To me church is
politics. It's power. We don't need to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor: ``Can I leave this? `` He sticks out a blue photocopied
paper with information about the churches.
</P>
<P>

will make you feel better, I'll take it.''

   Taylor: ``It will make me feel better if you take this.''

<P>
   Down the street Kerry Clemmons, 33, has been working on the
computer while her 15-month-old son naps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi. I'm Melanie Lawler,'' says the third member of the team, a
graduate student in Christian Education at New Orleans seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmons, standing on the porch of her two-story gray house,
tells them she was not raised in a church and does not go now. If
she did, she would want a church ``that did a lot of things that
mattered to us as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you believe people can know for certain that they will
go to heaven?'' asks Lawler, working from a prepared questionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily have a good answer for that,'' says
Clemmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I tell you what the Bible says?'' asks Lawler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' Clemmons replies.
</P>
<P>
   Clemmons listens intently as Lawler reads about the ``stops'' on
the ``road to hope'' whose destination is eternal life. ``Would you
like to accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior?'' asks Lawler
when she is through.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Clemmons. ``I'm not ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   At a smaller house with brown siding, Joel Kidd, 26, a
Nationsbank manager is asleep. He comes to the door barefooted in
shorts and a t-shirt. He is a regular churchgoer, he tells them, an
Episcopalian by birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really nice,'' he said when they had gone. ``I've
got to respect them for their faith. I'm not looking to change, but
I think they're doing a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talks, a tatooed man walks his dog down the street
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, but who are those people?'' the dog-walker asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're from out of town. They're Southern Baptists,'' said
Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Baptists,'' the man replied, shaking his head, as he
walked on down the street.

 &HT;    Georgia congressmen wrestle with upcoming gun vote
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the weeks since the Senate passed new gun
legislation, Rep. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.) has heard an earful from
his conservative constituents in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Isakson has personally answered more than 500 letters. After a
metro television report misrepresented his position on new gun
measures, saying he favored blanket gun control, Isakson sat at his
desk to field scores of irate calls.
</P>
<P>
   In each letter and call, Isakson said he has patiently explained
that he favors legislation requiring safety locks to be sold with
guns and requiring that all gun purchasers submit to criminal
background checks at gun shows, where 20 percent to 40 percent of
such sales are now exempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have yet to have anyone tell me that these positions are
inconsistent with a common-sense approach to guns,'' said Isakson.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Isakson and Georgia's 10 other House members will
cast important votes on new gun control. For Isakson and a majority
of the Georgia delegation, some of whom campaigned against
Congress' adoption of the assault weapons ban in 1994, the votes
will be their first on the controversial topic since joining
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by the deadly shooting in Littleton, Colo. and the near
catastrophe at Heritage High School in Rockdale County, Ga., the
House on Wednesday will take up a massive juvenile crime bill that
now includes new restrictions on the sale of guns to juveniles,
mandatory trigger locks on gun sales and background checks at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   An ABC News/Washington Post poll recently found that 89 percent
of Americans favor criminal background checks at gun shows and 75
percent support mandatory trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals have sharply divided Republicans in Congress, and
Georgia's Republican members are among the most vocal critics of
the new legislation. Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), the state's senior
Democrat, strongly favors the new proposals, while Rep. Sanford
Bishop (D-Ga.), a member of the National Rifle Association whose
rural southwestern district includes thousands of gun owners,
remains uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from an area where people hunt ... and enjoy
shooting,'' Bishop said. ``Guns are a part of the lay of the land.
... My constituents don't want to be punished for the misdeeds of a
few juveniles.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's other Democrat, Rep. Cynthia McKinney, declined to
discuss her views.
</P>
<P>
   Most Georgia Republicans don't think that gun control, however
modest, works, and many are angry that Congress is being forced to
consider the new measures at all.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) derisively refers to the legislation,
dubbed the Child Safety Act, as the ``political protection act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What outrages me as a father of four kids, including two
teenagers, is that it's being done on the blood of innocent
children in Colorado and it will do nothing to prevent another
Colorado from happening,'' said Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Norwood (R-Ga.), who shot and killed a childhood
friend in an accident when he was 16, said he had yet to see any
gun control legislation reduce crime or prevent accidents. Norwood
said trigger locks might even cause more accidents, even though
several studies have shown that they can reduce accidental firings
if properly used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people tell me that a lot of these locks are
dangerous,'' Norwood said. Norwood spokesman John Stone later said
the House member does support trigger locks on new guns, but he is
concerned that they could make the guns less useful in
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nathan Deal (R-Ga.), who voted against the assault weapons
ban in 1994 when he was a Democrat, said he is opposed to mandatory
trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Most Georgia lawmakers said they favor closing the gun show
loophole. While licensed gun dealers are required to give criminal
background checks, whether at a gun shop or a gun show, unlicensed
dealers are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't know why we allowed that exception at gun
shows,'' said Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.), whose district includes
Conyers. ``That's just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Linder and other Georgia Republicans, including Isakson,
said they favor only ``instant'' checks at gun shows. Under both
the House and Senate legislation, law enforcement officers would be
allowed up to three days to complete background checks if the
instant check turned up a question. The extra time would give law
enforcement the opportunity to check court records that might not
be immediately available over weekends, when most gun shows take
place.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents, such as Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), say the time
frame amounts to a waiting period. Most GOP House members are also
suspicious of some of the special record-keeping requirements
imposed on sellers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has claimed to its members that the requirements amount
to a national gun registry. Supporters of the measure say it is
essential for law enforcement officers to solve crimes and track
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the need for a national registry,'' said Rep. Mac
Collins (R-Ga.). ``I'm going to have to take a real close look at
all these gun control provisions because I just don't believe in
taking away people's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) said he supports criminal
background checks for all purchases at gun shows and will support
an amendment to be offered by Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.) to raise the legal age of handgun purchase to 21, which is
currently the limit in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue in my mind is not gun control,'' Chambliss said.
``These are gun safety measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, meanwhile, said he will oppose all the gun restrictions
and, if the House floor rule allows for it, offer amendments to
remove the gun control provisions from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to bear arms is an express right people are
guaranteed in the Constitution,'' said Barr, an NRA board member.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats for the most part are solidly behind the new
measures, House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) is giving
members such as Bishop the freedom to vote they way they choose.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), who personally supports
most of the provisions, says he will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their points of view on this and I think they
will be able to work their will in the House,'' Hastert said.
``Even within our conference there are two or three different
points of view, and legitimately so.''

 &HT;    Some anti-violence programs show promise
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eddie and Travis Feltman, father and son, huddled
together to read the well wishes scrawled on a card from a group of
counselors, parents and children gathered in the student center of
the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Haltingly, they repeated the words out loud; messages of hope
and encouragement for the 12-year-old freckled kid already in
trouble with the law for aggravated assault. Moments later, Feltman
gently patted his son on the shoulder; a small touch of pride
marking their completion of a 10-week program called Family
Solutions, designed to change the troubled paths of young,
first-time lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   No one has a higher stake in this program's success than the
mothers, fathers and sons who sat at tables last week in a blue
reception room, munching on chicken wings, pizza and pecan pie.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the hugs: anxiety. Along with hope: worry.
</P>
<P>
   Will this program stick? Will these boys _ some in low-slung
pants, others in baseball caps _ remember that their fate is tied
in part to how well they learned their lessons here?
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the questions remain the same. As communities _ from
Littleton, Colo., to Conyers, Ga. _ reel from violence among
children, a host of anti-violence programs like Family Solutions
are flooding the schools, churches and counseling centers.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers are hesitant to declare victory. Too many
programs are well-intentioned, but don't have either the data or
the history to show they can live up to their promises, scientists
say. The conclusion: Hundreds of programs, working with shoestring
budgets and unclear missions, probably don't work.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves researchers with a critical goal: learn what works,
and learn it fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that America will not give up its guns _ not in my
lifetime, not in your lifetime,'' said Dr. Stephen Thomas, director
of the Institute for Minority Health Research at Emory University.
``So we must find, and find quickly, effective solutions to save
our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not envy the violent, and do not choose any of their ways _
Proverbs 3:31
</P>
<P>
   Children killing children has become one of the most disturbing
trends of the century. In the past 20 years, homicides has become
the second leading cause of death for young Americans between the
ages of 15 and 24. And for children 10 to 14, homicide is now the
third leading cause of death, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Black teenage males are seven times more likely to be murdered
than white teenage males, and are eight times more likely to commit
murder, according to mortality statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had kids killing each other for years,'' Thomas said.
``But since urban black kids don't shoot each other in school,
apparently no one noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   And although there's been a slight decrease in national youth
homicide rates since 1993, the number of teens who die violently
``remains unacceptably high,'' according to the CDC. Between 1992
and 1994, more than 8,000 children were homicide victims, agency
figures show.
</P>
<P>
   In response, hundreds of programs have been launched nationwide
to help kids stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Girl Scouts offers an anti-violence program. So does the
YMCA and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Cities have
experimented with school programs, theater groups, boot camps,
mentoring and Internet police sites that allow children to send
tips to law enforcement about violent activity.
</P>
<P>
   Congress set aside $300 million in April for federal grants to
fund youth violence prevention programs in 50 communities.
President Clinton is getting into the act as well. This month, he
ordered a review of whether the entertainment industry markets
aggression to children. He also plans to create an
anti-youth-violence program modeled after the federal government's
anti-smoking campaign.
</P>
<P>
   I
</P>
<P>
   Nothing enduring can be built on violence _ Mohandas K. Gandhi
</P>
<P>
   I
</P>
<P>
   But which of these programs actually work?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been studying that question since the early
1990s. The CDC selected a dozen projects to fund and study in 1993.
Of those, five ``showed promise'' and are continuing to receive CDC
funding, according to Alex Crosby of the CDC's Division of Violence
Prevention at the National Center for Injury Prevention and
Control.
</P>
<P>
   Those programs _ in Arizona, Michigan, Virginia, South Carolina
and Oregon _ targeted at-risk and very young children.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the results are in, but preliminary findings suggest
successful programs have some common traits.
</P>
<P>
   Programs that had multiple goals appear to do better than ones
focused on one area. It's not enough to merely teach kids how to
avoid a fight. Instead, a program should teach a variety of life
skills.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Self Enhancement Inc., of Portland, Ore., not only
provided middle school students counseling sessions on conflict
resolution, but also mentoring, peer counseling, recreational
opportunities and academic tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   And Second Step, a Seattle program now in 10,000 schools,
teaches younger children not only how to avoid conflict, but to
feel empathy for others and control impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Second Step successfully reduced aggressive behavior and
increased ``pro-social'' behavior in second- and third-graders who
had gone through the program, according to a 1997 study published
in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got teachers telling me that we've got kids on the
playground helping other kids to calm down,'' said Joan Immerman,
school counselor at Midway Elementary School in Forsyth County,
Ga., one of two local schools using the program. ``We're already
starting to see the fruits of our labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Programs that showed collaboration between multiple agencies and
community leaders also seemed to be effective. For example, input
from public health departments, social workers, and churches
improved a program's chance of working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence is not limited to one arena; it spills into every
aspect of life,'' Crosby said. ``It goes back to the idea of taking
a village to raise a child _ in this case, it takes a village to
interact with kids and stop the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Center of the Study and Prevention of
Violence in Bolder, Colo., developed four nuts-and-bolts criteria
for a successful violence prevention program:
</P>
<P>
   _ It must be theoretically sound.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must be able to prove it has a deterrent effect _ in other
words, it keeps kids out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must show that it is able to sustain that effect for at
least a year.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must have worked some place other than where it was
created.
</P>
<P>
   I
</P>
<P>
   Violence is an admission that one's ideas and goals cannot
prevail on their own merits _ Sen. Edward Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   I
</P>
<P>
   Family Solutions is an example of a program that meets those
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, administrators from the Office of Juvenile Justice
and Delinquency Prevention in Washington traveled to Athens, Ga.,
to listen to parents discuss Family Solutions. The agency, part of
the U.S. Justice Department, is interested in duplicating the
program elsewhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an opportunity for a second chance,'' said Brenda Bush,
whose 17-year-old son, Tony Johnson, has been part of Family
Solutions since April. ``This let them know what they had done
wrong, but it lets them get back up and go forward with their
lives. It puts them back on the right path.''
</P>
<P>
   Family Solutions is designed for first-time offenders who have
committed what's considered low-level crime, such as assault,
criminal trespassing or delinquency. Killers and rapists are not
eligible. It requires that parents and children attend support
groups for three months. The groups, one for the teens and one for
the adults, are designed to give participants a chance to vent. But
they also seek to help parents and children to role-play,
strengthen communications, and learn social and conflict-resolution
skills.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Violence is as American as the Fourth of July and cherry pie _
H. Rap Brown
</P>
<P>
   I
</P>
<P>
   But nationally, the vast majority of programs are probably not
meeting standards _ or simply don't have the data or a clear enough
mission to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we saw was a fairly glaring need to evaluate
these violence prevention programs,'' said Crosby of the CDC. ``We
see a lot of activity (to stem youth violence), but we don't see
much scientific data that shows whether any of it works or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that most violence prevention programs
are run on a shoestring. ``And it costs far more to evaluate them
than to run them,'' said Pete Colbenson of Georgia's Children and
Youth Coordinating Council, which has given Family Solutions a
$20,000 juvenile justice grant to start the program in Macon. ``So
if you've got to pick, what are you going to do?''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the organizers often don't know how to
evaluate their progress. ``Family Solutions is special, in part
because it had the resources of UGA behind it,'' Colbenson said.
``Most of these are grass-roots projects that simply don't have the
academic sophistication to prove what they're doing works.''
</P>
<P>
   Many programs sprang up in the wake of recent school shootings
and are simply too new to gauge. Others are too vague in their
mission to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is complicated; there is no quick-and-easy fix,'' said
Jeffrey Fagan, director of the Center for Violence Research and
Prevention at Columbia University. ``A prevention program is not
like a Viagra pill.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason: There are many types of violence. Violence against
strangers. Domestic violence. Violence against girlfriends. School
violence. Urban street violence.
</P>
<P>
   An outreach program has to know what it's trying to address.
</P>
<P>
   Kids Alive and Loved targets urban youths dealing with
unresolved grief and post-traumatic stress caused by witnessing
violence. The program was started by Cobb County, Ga., resident
Bernadette Leite, whose son, Khalil, a 17-year-old high school
graduate, was shot in the back and killed in 1993. The program
provides intensive counseling, but maintains a kind of street
savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had young men lose six friends in a year,'' said
Emory's Thomas. ``And yet they had not talked about that. Can you
imagine?''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of pent-up emotion, paired with an unsafe,
crime-ridden neighborhood, leads to a ``tough man mentality,'' and
a rage that can result in instant violence, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in a neighborhood where one person just got out of
prison and the other one's just finished his school-based conflict
resolution class,'' Thomas said. ``Now, you tell me _ really _ who
do you think is going to win?''

</P>
<P>
   Frans DeWaal of Emory's Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center
stood before a friendly, erudite crowd filled with tweed jackets,
bow ties and custom-made crosses. His topic: How monkeys control
violence.
</P>
<P>
   DeWaal, author of ``Peacemaking Among Primates,'' ($16.95,
Harvard University Press) was the third speaker at a recent
international conference entitled ``Violence Reduction in Theory
and Practice,'' a gathering of theologians, linguists and
scientists at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   With slides of monkeys behind him, he explained how some
primates were very good at teaching their young to be, well, kind
to one another. If there was a fight, family groups often worked
hard _ through grooming, kissing and sex _ to patch things up.
</P>
<P>
   A question was politely raised: So what?
</P>
<P>
   DeWaal pondered for a while, then reminded the audience that
humans, big brain aside, are still animals. And what might work for
monkeys could work for us. Maybe we too could learn how to stop
violence before it destroys our communities.
</P>
<P>
   His message wasn't much different that those of the boys in
Family Solutions, who talked slowly of new hope and second chances.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that newfound enthusiasm will help find the
theories and programs that work _ and bring our children out of the
killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt bad about what I did,'' said Tasha Lynn Fielder
of Winder, a 13-year-old who hit her mother. She graduated in April
from Family Solutions in Barrow County.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, things are so much better,'' Tasha said. ``I've
learned I don't have to fight every time I get mad. I can control
my temper better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of myself. It feels great.''

REAL ESTATE: WHEN BOARD MEMBERS ARE LIABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On May 27, a state appeals court issued a decision
that put co-op and condominium board members on notice that they
can be held personally liable for their actions as corporate
directors. The court ruled that when board members are sued as
individuals for actions they perform as directors, they cannot be
reimbursed by their co-op or condominium if they are found liable
for damages that are punitive in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate lawyers say that the decision also calls into
question the ability of co-ops and condominiums to reimburse board
members for penalties imposed under various local, state and
federal laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say, the decision raises the issue of whether, to
protect themselves against claims not covered by insurance, board
members facing punitive damage claims should consider hiring their
own lawyers to look over the shoulders of counsel provided by
insurance carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant case by an important court,'' said
Richard Siegler, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, explaining that the
decision, issued by the Appellate Division, First Department, is
binding on lower courts in Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester
County. ``It is a clear warning that willful misconduct by a board
member that leads to punitive damages can end up being very costly
for the board member personally.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision arose out of a 1996 federal lawsuit in which
Gregory and Shannon Broome sued Beekman Hill House Apartment Corp.
and its board for denying the couple's application to sublet an
apartment in the building at 425 East 51st St. According to court
papers, the Broomes filed the case under the federal Fair Housing
Act and other anti-discrimination laws, charging that the denial
was based on Broome's race (he is black).
</P>
<P>
   After a jury trial, the Broomes were awarded a total of $640,000
in damages. Of that amount, Nicholas Biondi, the president of the
board, was ordered to pay $230,000 in compensatory damages and
$125,000 in punitive damages. The balance was to come from the
co-op corporation and four other directors.
</P>
<P>
   After settlement conferences with Biondi, the compensatory
damages for which he had been liable ended up being paid by the
co-op corporation, and Biondi remained personally liable for the
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi then filed a lawsuit against Beekman Hill House in state
Supreme Court seeking indemnification _ a form of reimbursement _
for the punitive damages he was required to pay.
</P>
<P>
   And while the trial court rejected the co-op's motion to dismiss
Biondi's complaint, the Appellate Division overturned that decision
and ruled that under the state's Business Corporation Law,
indemnification cannot be made to a director ``if a judgment
adverse to the director establishes that his acts were committed in
bad faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The court concluded that the acts for which Biondi was found
liable in the federal case _ violating the Broomes' civil rights _
``could only have been committed in bad faith'' and dismissed his
claim for indemnification.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the court is saying is that if you decide to serve on a
board, you better stop and take a deep breath before making any
important decisions, because you're taking on a serious
obligation,'' said Errol Brett, a Manhattan co-op lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Brett explained that the bylaws of many co-ops and condominiums
contain provisions indemnifying board members for liabilities,
judgments and even fines they incur in the good-faith execution of
their duties. Such provisions, he said, are a practical necessity
if co-ops and condominiums are to be able to encourage shareholders
and unit owners to serve on their boards.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brett said, indemnification has become increasingly
important because of the personal exposure board members face under
regulations like the Window Guard Law, the Elevator Inspection Law,
city, state and federal human rights laws, sexual harassment laws,
and federal lead-paint disclosure regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these laws contain provisions for punitive damages,''
Brett said. ``And all of them expose the directors to fines and
penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, directors who are required to pay fines for
actions they take _ or fail to take _ as directors may have to pay
out of their own pockets even if their co-op or condominium wants
to indemnify them. Brett explained that since fines are punitive in
nature, the Appellate Division's decision prohibiting
indemnification for punitive damages could easily be extended to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Schiff, one of Biondi's lawyers in his case against
Beekman Hill House, said that the decision also puts directors on
notice that when faced with punitive damage claims, the lawyer
provided by the insurance carrier may not be working entirely in
their best interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any director who finds himself a defendant in a lawsuit that
contains a claim for punitive damages should hire his own lawyer to
ensure that his individual interests are protected,'' Schiff said.
He added that a decision had not yet been made on whether to appeal
the ruling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He explained that a lawyer hired by an insurance carrier to
defend a claim against a co-op or condominium is working primarily
for the co-op or condominium. And since the carrier can be held
responsible only for compensatory damages _ coverage for punitive
damages, he said, is prohibited by law _ it is possible that a
claim for punitive damages would receive less of the lawyer's time
and attention than the claim for compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Livingston, another Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that
while board members should take steps to protect themselves when
faced with punitive damage claims, it is unlikely that such claims
will result in liability unless the board member is found to have
engaged in willful misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a potential for exposure to punitive damages, you
might very well want your own lawyer looking over the shoulder of
the lawyer hired by the insurance company,'' he said. ``But the
number of instances where board members are actually hit with
punitive damage awards is relatively small. And I certainly
wouldn't want this decision to keep competent candidates from
serving on boards.''

BUSH IOWA TRIP SIGNALS REAL START OF 2000 RACE FOR THE PRESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Tenn.) (Eds: Added starter NYT Page 1, replacing Starr-Clintons) 
 (rk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMANA, Iowa, _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ended his shadow
presidential campaign Saturday and flew to this state to directly
declare his interest in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement effectively inaugurated what is shaping up to
be the earliest and quickest presidential nominating processes in
recent history.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dropped any pretense of ambivalence about his ambitions as
he left Austin for his first explicitly political trip _ nearly
four days that have brought him first to Iowa, which will hold
party caucuses next February, and then will take him to New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming here today to tell you this, I'm running for
president of the United States,'' Bush said, stating what has, for
most Republicans, become the obvious, standing on a stage piled
with bales of hay, a shiny red tractor behind him. ``There is no
turning back. And I intend to be the next president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting the theme for his campaign, Bush said that he would be
at once an activist and a conservative president _ a
``compassionate'' Republican who would advocate using the nation's
prosperity to help its downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is compassion beneath us?'' Bush said, speaking in this town
of cornfields outside of Cedar Rapids. ``Is mercy below us? Should
our party be led by someone who boasts of a hard heart?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to be a compassionate conservative,'' the son of a
former president declared, invoking what his aides said would be
the rhetorical core of his race for the White House. ``I welcome
the label. And on this ground, I'll take my stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Three other Republicans who are also seeking their party's
nomination for 2000 _ Lamar Alexander, the former governor of
Tennessee, Elizabeth Dole, former Red Cross president, and Rep.
John R. Kasich of Ohio _ were campaigning in Iowa as well, speaking
at the World Pork Expo at the Iowa State Fairgrounds in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   Their days were largely lost to the tumult of Bush's visit. His
utter dominance of the political stage, notwithstanding the fact
that he is one of a half-dozen Republicans who would like to be the
next president, was testimony to the success with which Bush has
managed to use early political endorsements and fund-raising to
present himself as the prohibitive favorite for his party's
nomination _ even though no Republican will vote on this field for
nearly seven months.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Saturday's visit appeared to mark the real start of
the 2000 presidential nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   While it is hardly unprecedented for candidates to begin running
17 months before an election, the race this year is unusual for the
early strength _ in endorsements, in fund-raising, and in the sheer
size of their political apparatus _ that is brought to the fight by
the two presumptive front-runners among the Republicans and the
Democrats, Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore flies next week to Carthage, Tenn., his family home, to
announce _ just in case anyone had any doubts _ that he, too, is
running to succeed President Clinton in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Even though both are opposed and there is plenty of time for the
tide to suddenly turn against either of them, both are eager to
portray themselves as assured of victory.
</P>
<P>
   With his broadly thematic speech appearance Saturday in the
state where the first presidential caucus will be held next
February, the two-term governor dropped any pretense about the
nature of his presidential ambitions. ``I believe you can expect
someone named George W. to win this nomination!'' he declared to a
clutch of noisy supporters who greeted him at an airport hanger
rally in Cedar Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance in Iowa Saturday was the first of nearly four
days of explicitly political appearances, and it had all the
trappings of a full-scale political invasion.
</P>
<P>
   He was accompanied by a planeload of staff, security and press
(including one reporter on hand to write a story about the
reporters) and appeared at events that were planned to the last
footstep and camera angle, producing the kind of frenzied campaign
day that Iowans customarily do not have an opportunity to witness
until the final days before the February caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was upbeat and jaunty throughout what clearly was among the
more challenging days of his political career, starting from the
moment he boarded his campaign plane at 7:28 a.m., picked up the
intercom and made light of the precipice he now stood on after
weeks in which his staff had invited interest in this inaugural
political trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please stow your expectations securely in your overhead bins
as they may shift during the trip and can fall and hurt someone _
especially me,'' said Bush, who was wearing cowboy boots and a
shiny brass ``Governor George W. Bush'' belt buckle.
</P>
<P>
   As chuckles rolled through the cabin, Bush added: ``Thanks for
coming. We know you have a choice of candidates when you fly, we
appreciate you choosing Great Expectations'' _ a reference to the
name that Bush's staff had attached to both the campaign and the
tour in its effort to defuse the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Iowa, Bush gave what his aides described as the keynote
speech of his day, setting out the themes of his campaign while
drawing some unstated, if sharp contrasts, with the Democratic
leadership of the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels to me like an old era of American politics is ending
_ like Americans are waiting for new hopes, new energy, new
idealism,'' he said. ``We will prove that someone who is
conservative and compassionate can win without sacrificing
principle. We will show that politics, after a time of tarnished
ideals, can be higher and better. We will give our country a fresh
start after a season of cynicism.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke in the kind of rural setting that was, down to the
country music and Pledge of Allegiance, reminiscent of the
backdrops that his father used. But his rhetoric was clearly
different in tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am running because our country must be prosperous, but
prosperity must have a purpose,'' he said. ``The purpose of
prosperity is to make sure that the American dreams touches every
heart. The purpose of prosperity is to make sure no one is left out
and no one is left behind. I'm running because I want our party to
match a conservative mind with a compassionate heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that as president, he would advocate for what he
described as ``the responsibility era,'' again drawing an unstated
if clear contrast with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first goal is to usher in the responsibility era _ an era
that stands in stark contrast to the last few decades, what our
culture has said: If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a
problem, blame someone else. Each American must understand that we
are responsible for the decision each of us makes in life.''
</P>
<P>
   His second goal, he said, was ``to rally the armies of
compassion that exist in every community,'' _ a reference to
churches and charities to help the poor. He said he would lift
regulations that hamper involvement of such organizations in such
programs as after-school programs. ``Supporting these men and women
_ the soldiers in the army of compassion _ is the next, bold step
of welfare reform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His third goal, he said, is that ``every child should be
educated, and no child should be left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's first trip was arguably as intriguing for what he had to
say, as for how he actually took to campaigning. The governor, in
contrast to the campaign style of his father, lingered at every
crowd, shaking hands and taking advantage of a schedule that
specifically gave him time to ``mingle'' with supporters at each
stop.
</P>
<P>
   At the tarmac, two students from the University of Northern
Iowa, Dan Strenchuk and Mike Russell, told Bush that they were
running for student government and imposed on him for a picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will sink your campaign,'' he said as he slung a hand
over their shoulders and gazed into a camera. Then, as he was
leaving, he turned to the two youths, and said: ``Thank you all for
coming. You make sure to show up for the caucuses _ no matter how
cold it is.''

REAL ESTATE: OLD NAVY BASE WITH NEW CONTROVERSIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LYN RIDDLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Sprawling on a spit of land beside the
Cooper River, the 1,600 acres of the now-closed Charleston Navy
Base have come to represent both an enormously valuable development
opportunity and a continuing focus of charges, countercharges and
commercial and political maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   With three miles of riverfront, the former base represents
hundreds of millions of dollars of real estate. It includes 21
first-rate piers and some 600 buildings, from large warehouses to a
handsome colonial-style house that once housed admirals.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 68 companies with a total of 4,200 workers have moved
into two-thirds of the buildings. But very public controversies
have surrounded the competing plans of a handful of companies and
agencies for some of the prime facilities within the base.
</P>
<P>
   Even selecting who would oversee the redevelopment of the former
base was not easy. In most communities where a base is closed, the
redevelopment agency is run by a city or county. But here the
Charleston Naval Complex Redevelopment Authority, which oversees
the site, is run by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The base is in this city, but just a few miles upriver from
Charleston, which by size and tradition has been the most
influential in the region. Three counties are close to the base,
and all entities wanted a say in what would become of the land. So
the counties, cities and state all have representatives on the
redevelopment board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is uniquely Charleston,'' said Jack Sprott, the director of
the redevelopment agency. ``There's a lot of jealousy between
Charleston and North Charleston and the political folks said this
was the best way to handle it, and it's worked pretty well. The
only drawback is the city has zoning powers. We've had our lumps
and bumps, but we're in lock step now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sharpest controversy involved how the north end of
the base would be used. The city of North Charleston wanted
residential development. But the Charleston Naval Complex
Redevelopment Authority wanted a cargo operation. The city
eventually won. According to James Bryan, chairman of the
authority, his agency expects to begin work on a waterfront park,
commercial buildings and residences for North Charleston within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement in 1993 that the base would close was met with
instant panic. ``It was gloom and doom all over Charleston,'' said
Sprott. But in the six years since, Sprott said, community leaders
have managed to regain the 25,000 jobs lost when the base closed
with the arrival of new businesses throughout the region, while the
redevelopment agency continues to foster commercial operations at
the former naval complex.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent visit to the site, William Cassidy, deputy assistant
secretary of the Navy, called the redevelopment authority ``a model
for the country'' in base reuse, according to Sprott.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that set up shop at the former base perform a wide
range of services, from repairing ships to preparing small boats
for overseas shipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy shipyard here was established in 1902. During World War
II it grew to become the Navy's third-largest home port, behind
Norfolk, Va., and San Diego. When closing was announced in 1993, 80
ships and submarines were based at North Charleston. The Navy
turned the base over to the redevelopment agency in April 1996, but
the final land conveyance has not yet taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Sprott said his agency put off those negotiations, preferring to
find tenants first. The first was Charleston Marine Manufacturing,
a consortium of area businesses that leased the largest dry dock to
repair ships.
</P>
<P>
   Ten government operations occupy space at the base as well,
including the Border Patrol, the Postal Service and the state's
National Guard. Soon the South Carolina State Ports Authority plans
to operate a cargo facility here, a plan that has resulted in a
fair share of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the state's Ports Authority, which operates four
terminals in the Charleston area, wanted to set up a break-bulk
facility on the northern tip of the base.
</P>
<P>
   But the city of North Charleston had other plans for the site.
Mayor Keith Summey said he wanted the area for residences,
businesses and a waterfront park. The base includes the only
waterfront in the city. Plus, he said, the site abuts a residential
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been a break-bulk facility for 100 years'' said Sprott,
``and we thought that was the best use. But the last thing we
wanted was a controversy with the city.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked out a deal to lease land at the center of the base to
the Ports Authority, leaving the north end for North Charleston.
The north end is now the subject of a lawsuit by Braswell Shipyard,
which contends that the redevelopment authority did not execute an
agreed-upon sublease there. Sprott declined to comment on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   In still another dispute, Carolina Marine Handling, one of the
base's current tenants, has charged that the agency had improperly
signed leases and has not been diligent in protecting assets left
behind by the Navy. When the military closes a facility, more than
just buildings are left behind. Pencils are even left in holders,
said James Kenney, a former chief of staff at the base.
</P>
<P>
   H.R. Stender, president of Carolina Marine Handling, said he had
applied to lease the north end of the base with virtually the same
plan that was originally espoused by the Ports Authority, but this
was turned down. Now, he said, the authority will soon move onto
the pier in the central part of the base that he had been using for
his break-bulk operation, whose lease was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``One billion dollars is being chipped and diced and given out
to friends of the former governor, David Beasley,'' said Stender,
whose family has operated stevedoring companies in the Charleston
area for three generations.
</P>
<P>
   He also maintains that the redevelopment agency and the Ports
Authority have conspired to drive him out of business, using his
own business plan, which he sent to the agency when he applied for
the land at the north end of the base.
</P>
<P>
   The regional state legislative delegation has looked into his
claims but found them groundless. But four of its 20 members have
asked for a review by the state's Legislative Audit Council, which
is scheduled to begin its study later this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The state Law Enforcement Division has turned over its report on
Stender's allegations to the state attorney general but the results
have not been released.
</P>
<P>
   Sprott calls Stender's claims ``garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done more for him than anybody,'' Sprott said. ``We had
a fair competition and we did not pick him. Now he's irate.''
</P>
<P>
   Stender operated a break-bulk facility, loading frozen chicken
on ships destined for Russia, until a few months ago on one of the
base's prime piers, called Zulu.
</P>
<P>
   But his operation dwindled as word spread that the company he
leased from _ Charleston Shipbuilders _ was out of business and
that this company's lease would be canceled. Charleston
Shipbuilders intended to overhaul Navy ships to supply electricity
to rural areas in South America, but the one ship it completed was
not able to supply power adequately.
</P>
<P>
   Sprott said the Zulu Pier would be used by the Ports Authority,
but Stender was offered the use of another pier.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Miller, a spokesman for the Ports Authority, said that its
terminals were public ``and anybody and everybody can come and
operate there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his agency had been interested in operating another
break-bulk terminal for years. He also rejected Stender's charges
of political favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Sprott said the next step in redevelopment would be to negotiate
the cleanup of the property and get the land deeded to his agency.
The agency wants not just to occupy existing buildings but to build
new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Now considering leasing space on the base is a company that
wants to convert the former Navy hospital and a number of smaller
buildings into a film studio, at a cost of $30 million. The company
would rent out space for the production of commercials, television
shows and feature films.
</P>
<P>
   The company, called Carolopolis, is making ``a serious effort to
develop a motion picture studio in the state,'' said Isabel Hill,
director of the South Carolina Film Office.

Coleman, 73-year-old Luther Williams Field begins to buzz with
anticipation every time Rafael Furcal reaches first base.
``Everyone knows he's going to try to steal,'' longtime Macon fan
Joe Jones, 75, said of Furcal. ``I really think he's even faster
than Coleman was back then.'' Coleman stole 145 bases for Macon in
1983, setting a record for Organized Baseball. Furcal, the Atlanta
Braves' leadoff man and shortstop of the future, isn't likely to
match that. But the 18-year-old Dominican is on pace to become the
first minor or major-league player this decade to steal 100 bases
in a season. (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25. WITH

   OLY-IOC-PREVIEW _ Olympic organizers in Salt Lake and Sydney
have told IOC members not to expect to be treated royally at their
Games, as the members are accustomed to. Several candidates to host
the 2006 Winter Games fear that they haven't had a chance to
``sell'' their cities because of a travel restriction for members.
In many small ways, the Salt Lake City scandal has changed the way
the Olympics does business. Advancing big IOC meetings in Seoul.

AMERICANS TURN LOSS INTO A SUCCESS STORY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one ever wants to lose, especially the U.S. women's soccer
team, but some defeats can be instructive and revelatory. A 1-0
defeat to Norway in the semifinals of the 1995 Women's World Cup
was a short-term calamity but a long-term benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had won that World Cup, I believe we wouldn't have won
the Olympics,'' forward Tiffeny Milbrett said. ``A lot of things
were not right about that team. You have to be ready to give it the
best you have. In '95, we weren't ready. Sometimes it takes crisis
to initiate change.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that defeat, much has changed for the American women, from
their defensive formation to their style of attack to their
dedication to reclaim the title as the world's best soccer team.
The United States won the gold medal at the 1996 Olympic Games _
defeating Norway, 2-1, in overtime of the semifinals _ and it is
favored to regain the world championship the team secured at the
initial Women's World Cup in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   There is much pressure on the American team: to win, to sell
tickets, to lay the framework for a women's professional league
that could start in 2001, to expand the game as a pioneer to a
wider audience. And there is no assurance that the United States
will prevail in the 16-team field. Twice this year, China has
defeated the Americans, snapping their 50-game unbeaten streak at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's pressure, but what's the alternative?'' coach Tony
DiCicco said. ``The alternative is that we stress over it, or that
we aren't good enough to do well. It's not going to be easy, but we
obviously know we're capable of doing well. We've just got to make
sure we've done things as well as we've ever done them.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving as an assistant coach to Anson Dorrance during the
1991 Women's World Cup, DiCicco took over as head coach in 1994.
Reluctant to fix something that did not appear to be broken, he did
not make many changes for the 1995 World Cup. But, after the United
States lost to Norway and went home disappointedly with a bronze
medal, he re-created the team.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of continuing with three defenders, and being vulnerable
to counterattacks, he employed four. Instead of attacking the way a
hockey team would, knocking the puck into the corners and digging
it out, he employed a more sophisticated possession game. The
attack is purposeful and attractive.
</P>
<P>
   With 109 international goals, Mia Hamm has scored more than any
other woman or man to play the game. Cindy Parlow, at 5 feet 11
inches, is a lighthouse of a target. And Milbrett, with a squat
build and explosive acceleration, appears ready to become a
breakout star. She and Hamm have combined for 100 goals and 83
assists in their last 84 games.
</P>
<P>
   In the midfield, Kristine Lilly, often overlooked and
underappreciated, has played in 180 international matches, more
than any other player in the game. Julie Foudy is an offensive
threat and a vocal leader.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Akers, after scoring 10 goals in the inaugural World
Cup, has moved to defensive midfield, where she can still control a
game with her tackling, heading and passing skills, although she
struggles daily with the effects of chronic fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the best woman that's ever played the game, period,''
DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Carla Overbeck is captain of the American team for
a third World Cup. Joy Fawcett is often considered one of the
world's best defenders and is also a frequent threat in attacking
from the back.
</P>
<P>
   Brandi Chastain, formerly a striker, is perhaps the team's
savviest player. Kate Sobrero brings toughness and reliability.
Always a capable shot-blocker, goalkeeper Briana Scurry has matured
into a traffic cop who excels at organizing the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are fast, athletic and experienced _ six are
competing in their third World Cup _ but they succeed in large part
because they have bought into the simple but vital concept that
they are a team, not a collection of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   It shows in the way they play, the way they joke with each
other, even in the way they make commercials. In the television
spots, when one goes on a date, they all go on the date. When one
gets dental work, they all get dental work.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm gets far more attention than anyone else, but she
constantly defers to her teammates _ a point guard dishing off
verbal assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has the luxury of finding and developing a group of
young women who have many of the same values,'' DiCicco said. ``A
lot of that has to do with being fit and having self-discipline. If
you don't buy into the culture, you're left by the wayside.'' &QL;

IN BUFFALO, DISILLUSION BREEDS CAUTION AMONG SPORTS FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JEFF Z. KLEIN and KARL-ERIC REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week The Dallas Morning News sent a reporter to Buffalo,
N.Y., as part of its effort to introduce its sunbaked readers to
the mysteries of that strange foreign phenomenon, the Stanley Cup
finals. What the reporter found, in contrast to the habitual
cockiness of Dallas fans, was Buffalonian after Buffalonian picking
the Stars to win the series, muttering muted thanks that the Sabres
had at least got this far, and expressing the cautious hope that
maybe, just maybe, if all the planets queue up properly in the
firmament, the locals will scratch out victory and finally bring
some positive national attention to their small corner of the
Niagara Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter concluded that Buffalo sports fans are
unenthusiastic about the cup finals. But that's not the case at
all. Fans in western New York aren't unenthusiastic, they're just
guarded; they've been burned too often to yet again embrace false
hope quite so readily.
</P>
<P>
   Can you blame us? Leave aside a civic history that has produced
one economic or esthetic disaster after another for at least the
last 40 years; Buffalo's sports heritage is replete with stumbles
on the threshold of glory. Oh, sure, we've won championships, but
only when no one else was watching, like when the baseball and
hockey Bisons won minor league titles or the Bandits dominated box
lacrosse.
</P>
<P>
   And don't even get us started on how the National Football
League snubbed Buffalo when it absorbed teams from the All-America
Football Conference in 1949, or how in 1969 a lone vote from that
carpetbagger Walter O'Malley denied Buffalo a National League
baseball franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills won American Football League championships in 1964 and
'65 with Jack Kemp leading a dynamic offense and a defense that
old-timers insist would have stopped anything the NFL could have
thrown at it. But they were the AFL, a Mickey Mouse league in NFL
eyes; a year later, with a berth in the first Super Bowl on the
line, the Bills lost to Kansas City, 31-7, even though everybody
knows we would've beat the stuffing out of Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   After that there was a long drought, but at least the Bills had
a spectacular superstar in the 1970s; unfortunately, it was O.J.
Simpson. It took the boys 25 years to climb back close to the top,
but of course they came a cropper in four straight Super Bowls,
leaving us memories of Scotty Norwood's wide right (typical Buffalo
reaction: a huge rally the following day to let Norwood know we
still loved him), Thurman Thomas' losing his helmet, Jim Kelly's
utter lack of peripheral vision, and, our best memory, Don Beebe's
racing 90 yards to knock the ball out of Leon Lett's hands and
prevent a touchdown that would've made it 59-17, Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Sabres. The National Hockey League
admitted the Sabres in 1970, but their glory era was essentially
the team's first five years of existence, the days of the French
Connection, Horton and Schoeny, Roger the Dodger, Luuuuce, the
Rammer and Gare. That collective's high-water mark was a trip to
the Stanley Cup finals in 1975, when they fell to the despised
Broad Street Bullies, the Philadelphia Flyers. It was a great
playoff run and a great final, but all anyone outside Buffalo seems
to remember was the fog at Memorial Auditorium and the bat that Jim
Lorentz killed with his stick in the neutral zone.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was an endless string of playoff debacles through
the '70s and the complete destruction of the team through the '80s
at the hands of the general manager and sometime coach Scotty
Bowman _ his only sustained failure in 32 years in the NHL,
wouldn't you know it? The club again flowered briefly this decade
as Pat Lafontaine and Alex Mogilny staged skating and scoring
exhibitions and coach Ted Nolan breathed life into ``the hardest
working team in hockey,'' the perfect personality for this
determinedly blue-collar town. But even that soon collapsed in a
bitter muddle: general manager John Muckler, the politicking
curmudgeon who basically assembled the Sabres' current roster, was
fired; Nolan was shown the door; the sainted Lafontaine had his
contract terminated in a PR disaster; the front office was sacked;
the marvelous, cozy old Aud was boarded up as the team moved into
the vast and soulless Marine Midland Arena, and the team was sold,
transferring from the local control of the revered Knox family to
the Pennsylvania-based cable television baron John Rigas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite it all, in Buffalo we love our teams with a wholehearted
fervor, in the way that small towns with little else in the way of
international recognition love their teams. We seek affirmation in
them; we seek identity in them.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo, neither East Coast nor Midwest, the one city in America
overshadowed by the size, fame and prosperity of its Canadian
neighbor _ Toronto _ harbors a sensibility in almost every way
Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo is a place where you can listen to sports-talk radio
dominated by arguments over the Sabres and Leafs, lacrosse and
curling, and where basketball doesn't really hold anyone's interest
because, well, it's just too darned easy to score.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as in Canada, boastfulness and grandstanding are sourly
frowned upon. It's a reaction crucially different from that of
Dallas fans, who, as we learned from their appalling behavior in
our two Super Bowl losses to the Cowboys, revel less in their
teams' success than they exult in their opponents' defeat.
</P>
<P>
   So, given our Northern reserve and the gun-shyness born of our
perennial sports disappointments, how would we react if we ever did
win it all? Say we were lucky? Apologize to the other team's fans?
What would it be like if we came from a city like Dallas or New
York, where frequent championships breed confidence, optimism and
expectation of victory? Would Buffalonians be wealthier, more
successful, happier people? Or would we continue to be our old
selves, like our local tennis phenom Jimmy Arias, who, after he got
into the U.S. Open semifinals in 1983, bashfully told a television
interviewer, ``I really don't expect to win this.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. One thing we know, though, is hockey. How, Buffalo
wonders, can the Stanley Cup go to a city where 36 hours before the
first puck was dropped for the finals' opening game, hundreds of
tickets remained unsold _ while back in Buffalo, the 6,000 total
seats available for the Sabres' three potential home games sold out
in less than eight minutes?
</P>
<P>
   Sabre banners wave all along Main Street, while street crews
stencil the Sabres' demonic goat's-head logo on the pavement all
along Delaware Avenue, Buffalo's dilapidated answer to Park Avenue.
The fans are talking hockey, even if the tone is often one of
disbelief that the Sabres have got this far, even if they're half
bracing themselves for another huge disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   But if hope hasn't translated into the kind of confidence we had
in the Bills, if we're not quite wearing our hearts on our sleeves
this time, who can blame us? Just don't think the hope and the
heart aren't there.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: KRISTINE LILLY IS A PLAYER WITH CAPS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ill., N.C.)  (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   She has played more international soccer games, 180, than
anybody else in history, male or female. But Kristine Lilly is
hardly alone.
</P>
<P>
   Seven teammates have also reached the 100-game level, helping to
form the most cohesive national team ever to represent the United
States, any gender, any sport. And it is important to all of them
that they be something more than a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a second family,'' Lilly said the other day.
``Female sports are different. You do a lot better when you care
about each other. We are nurturing people, caring people. I'm glad
to have my friends out there. It goes a little bit deeper than just
sports. We all want to see each other happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Their next international game _ known as a cap in soccer _ will
be Saturday in Giants Stadium against Denmark in the 1999 Women's
World Cup. Many of the players were also together in the two
previous cups, in 1991 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   `You mean, the old bags?'' Julie Foudy asked.
</P>
<P>
   They are not that old, so their record needs explaining. The men
play in leagues, accumulating their caps with national teams in
occasional World Cups and other tournaments. The men's world record
for caps is 147, held by Majed Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The American women, without a league, play an extensive
international schedule. In 1996, Lilly, 27, a left-footed,
left-side midfielder with an aggressive penchant for moving
forward, passed the women's record of 152, set by Heidi Stoere of
Norway, and she has kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some NBA teams are together a long time, but this is unique,''
Lilly said, talking about players who know where each other will
be, just as the old Boston Celtics and Montreal Canadiens always
knew.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is something else. The women also need to feel a
togetherness they say is uniquely female. A communications graduate
from the University of North Carolina, Lilly recently spoke with
great animation and respect about her seven 100-cap teammates:
</P>
<P>
   _ Michelle Akers, age 33, 141 caps, who has missed games to
injuries and chronic fatigue syndrome: ``It's unbelievable to see
what she's gone through. She's one of the smartest players I've
ever known. Her shooting is like clockwork, the way she can get out
of pressure. Now you don't expect her to take on the world anymore,
but when the game is on the line, I wouldn't mind the ball at her
feet. I just think, `Get the ball to Michelle.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Joy Fawcett, age 31, 142 caps: ``She's got such a great right
foot. She's the quiet one in the background, who deserves more
attention. Sometimes reporters are talking to everybody but Joy,
and I just look at her and say, `You are awesome!'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Julie Foudy, age 28, 155 caps: ``Jules is one of my roommates
and usually I play against her in practice. I think I'm getting the
ball from her, and she just toe-pokes it away. One time she kicked
the ball at me, and I kicked it out of bounds. Same thing all over
again. I said, `Jules, we can do this all day.' Afterward we
laughed. She is so competitive, but she knows it's just soccer, not
life and death.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mia Hamm, age 27, 173 caps: ``She's always been an incredible
player. She's the one you want with the ball on the final third of
the field. I'd love to have her mentality. There are great scorers,
and there are finishers. Finishers can do it different ways, like
Pele and Ronaldo. Like Michael Jordan. Like Mia. It's like she's
skating on ice with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tiffeny Milbrett, age 26, 118 caps: ``Millie, she's a little
fireball. I've gotten to know her better; she'll give you a little
hug after a goal. She's so genuine. On the field, Millie and Mia
are so different. Millie wants the ball on the 18-yard line. She's
got a great volley.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Carla Overbeck, age 31, 144 caps: ``Another of my roommates.
She's the vocal leader. You can play your worst game and she'll
say, `Come on, Lil, forget about it.' She's so positive, so
competitive. She'll fire you up, saying, `Come on, guys.' It's why
she's the captain.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tisha Venturini, age 26, 122 caps: ``Tish has the most
incredible headers I've ever seen. She can just get up there and
time it, the most amazing grace. Once in a great while I head one,
and I just look at her and say, `Tish, see?' She just starts
laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Brandi Chastain, who left the team for a few years,
has 95 caps, and Briana Scurry, the goalkeeper who sometimes sits
out lesser games, has 90 caps. Carin Gabarra finished with 117 caps
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly said she was stunned at the fuss when she broke Stoere's
record in Kobe, Japan, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, I realize what it means,'' Lilly said. ``It's
hard to believe, eight of us at 100. I have gone to work and given
all I had. I've missed games because of weddings and personal
things, but not because of injuries. I was hurt at the '91 World
Cup, but I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York, Lilly began playing at 6 _ ``my incentive was
the oranges at halftime'' _ after her family settled in Wilton,
Conn. She followed her older brother, Scott, and five of her
cousins, all boys, into soccer. She made her debut with the
national team in China at 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the running around outdoors,'' she said. ``Maybe
it's the team aspect. Maybe it's because I was good at it. I love
the mental part of soccer. There are a lot of losses in soccer, and
you have to have the mentality to put it together, and you have to
be fit to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Since graduating from North Carolina, Lilly has become a typical
soccer nomad, training in California and Florida, and seeing her
boyfriend in Chicago whenever possible. Wilton is still home _ as
proven by the road sign there: Home of Kristine Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly said she would keep playing until the Summer Games in
Sydney, Australia, in 2000, ``and then see how my body feels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The travel is the hardest part,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She would not mind seeing the huge international schedule be
limited by a national women's league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to compete against Jules,'' Lilly said. ``If she were
my opponent, there'd be a fire between us.''
</P>
<P>
   But they would remain friends. Women's soccer is different.

NORWAY'S RIVALRY WITH UNITED STATES IS INTENSE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS, Mass. _ When Norway won the 1995 Women's World Cup, one
of every four Norwegians watched the championship match on
television, team officials said.
</P>
<P>
   When the players returned from the tournament in Sweden, their
plane was escorted into Oslo by two F-16 fighter jets. The 1999
world soccer championship begins next weekend, and Norway is taking
no chances that it will be caught off guard in defending its title
by either the heat or the time difference in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At home, temperatures have been in the low 60s, which is great,
except when preparing for the oven of an American summer. So,
Norwegian players have been drinking up to one and a half gallons
of water a day to practice hydration. Some have approximated the
sweaty, saunalike conditions ahead by training in waterproof rain
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Before arriving at their training base on Cape Cod on Wednesday,
the Norwegian players had grown accustomed to the six-hour time
difference by staying up until 3 or 4 in the morning at home and
sleeping until noon. ``My mother was calling me at 1 in the
morning, my coach was calling me at 1 in the morning,'' said Linda
Medalen, the Norwegian captain. ``Time was upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Having overcome a rash of injuries, Norway is among the four
favorites in the 16-team tournament, along with the United States,
China and Germany. The Americans open play next Saturday against
Denmark at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Norway plays its first match next Sunday against Russia in
Foxboro, Mass. All of its matches will be broadcast live in Norway,
and large audiences are expected to watch again, even in the middle
of the night. In case anyone falls asleep, the matches will be
replayed in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Women's World Cup is the largest sporting event ever
held for women. Organizers expect to sell half a million tickets.
All 32 matches will be televised by ABC, ESPN and ESPN2. More than
65,000 tickets have been sold for the American opener. And if the
United States, as expected, faces Norway or China in the final on
July 10, organizers hope to fill the 92,542 seats at the Rose Bowl
in Pasadena, Calif.

   The U.S.-Norway rivalry in women's soccer is what the
Yankees-Red Sox are to baseball, the Packers-Bears are to football
and Ali-Frazier was to boxing. There is an edgy respect between the
teams, which have met in epic matches at every important moment in
the emergence of the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   At the inaugural Women's World Cup, in 1991, the United States
defeated Norway, 2-1, in the championship match. They met again in
the semifinals of the 1995 World Cup, and Norway won, 1-0. A year
later the Americans prevailed, 2-1, in overtime, in the semifinals
of the 1996 Summer Olympics. Last year, in a tournament in
Portugal, Norway handed the American women their worst defeat ever,
4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archenemies'' is how Tiffeny Milbrett, the American forward,
describes the rivalry. That loss in the 1995 World Cup was a bitter
defeat for the Americans, some of whom felt affronted by the
Norwegians' post-game celebration. Joined hand to ankle, the
Norwegians crawled around on the field in a maneuver known as ``the
train'' after derailing the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very shocking,'' Milbrett said of seeing her teammates
inconsolable in defeat. ``I don't think I had ever seen anyone on
the team cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to beat the Americans because they get so upset, make
so much noise, when they lose,'' said Medalen, who will be 34 on
Thursday. ``This is a problem. Never be weak.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Once one of the game's top forwards, Medalen has moved to
central defense, anchoring with speed and experience a back line
that has been plagued by injury and retirement since the 1995 world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of her teammates, who receive a $10,000 yearly stipend
from the Norwegian soccer federation, she plays in an amateur
women's league and works a second job. A former sergeant in the
Norwegian army and officer in the Oslo police department, Medalen
now is a part-time private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has the necessary skills for listening and quickly
analyzing what to do,'' said Harald Olsen, one of her investigative
partners. ``It's very similar to football. You get a clue and you
have to make quick decisions. There is a very short response
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a man disappeared on a ferry boat ride from Norway
to Denmark. While the police suspected the man might have jumped
overboard, or pulled a scam and walked away from his previous life,
Medalen established that he had quarreled with others on the ferry
and might have been pushed or thrown over the side of the boat,
Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, a father who kidnapped his daughter and took
her to Italy was traced by placing an eavesdropping device into a
videocassette of ``The Lion King,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the police went in, they were gone,'' Olsen said. ``We
are still looking. We are going to find them. Again.''
</P>
<P>
   On the soccer field, Medalen and her teammates use a much more
direct approach, excelling at a physical, grinding style of long
ball. Norway has recently preferred a possession-type game, but the
Norwegians do not defer in the slightest to the Americans, as some
teams do, and this assertiveness can put the United States in the
unusual position of backpedaling on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norway was the first team to play aggressive against the
U.S.,'' said Leonardo Cuellar, the coach of the Mexican team.
``They play very directly. Very few teams can make the American
players run back to get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gro Espereth, Norway's sturdiest defender, will miss the World
Cup with a knee injury. Otherwise, the team is relatively healthy
for the first time in a year. Goalkeeper Bente Nordby has mended
her balky knee. Hege Riise remains an impeccably reliable
midfielder. And Ann Kristin Aarones, the tall striker who is one of
the world's top headers, has recovered from a viral infection. It
was Aarones who redirected a corner kick for the lone goal against
the Americans in the 1995 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Norway is a squeaky machine right now, coach Per-Mathias Hogmo
said, but it should become well oiled in first-round matches
against Russia, Canada and Japan. The farther into the tournament
Norway goes, the more threatening it should become.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the World Cup, so anything can happen,'' Hogmo said.
``We are good enough to beat anyone.''

A REDEEMED CHILDS SALUTES FALLEN STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ So many thoughts were running through Chris Childs'
head, so many emotions running through his body that he must have
felt like he was going to burst.
</P>
<P>
   The team's leader, Patrick Ewing, being knocked from his arduous
and seemingly endless championship bid by a torn Achilles' tendon
four games ago. Larry Johnson writhing on the floor midway through
Friday's second quarter after spraining ligaments in his right
knee. The good work of the deposed Ernie Grunfeld, who was fired as
the Knicks' general manager with eight games left in this
then-forlorn season. Even Stephon Marbury, the brash Nets point
guard who said that Childs and Charlie Ward would never get the
Knicks near a championship.
</P>
<P>
   All of that was on Childs' mind while the Knicks were en route
to shocking everyone but themselves by defeating the Indiana
Pacers, 90-82, Friday night to win the Eastern Conference title by
four games to two. So when the mission was accomplished and Childs
exhaled, he released all the energy and passion that had been
swirling around inside of him by bounding around the court and
hurling the game ball into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to throw it to the top of the rafters,'' Childs said
after the Knicks advanced to the National Basketball Association
finals for the first time since 1994. ``I tried to throw it as far
as I could but I was exhausted. I was real emotional. This is what
you play all your life for. I was thinking of the guys on this team
that went down, Patrick and Larry. Larry and I came here at the
same time, so I saw all the work that he put in to get us to this
point. And to see Patrick play the years that he did and not really
be a part of this, you get choked up behind it. So I went out there
and played with all of those guys in my heart to let them know that
what they put forth on this team I appreciate and I'm going to go
out there and do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because Childs put forth such a splendid effort in Game
6 and throughout the entire series, the Knicks will meet the San
Antonio Spurs in the finals that begin Wednesday night at the
Alamodome. Childs, who has been viewed as something of a bust since
the Knicks signed him as a free agent three years ago, was a
lifesaver in this series since Ward, the starting point guard,
struggled mightily against the Pacers' bigger, stronger Mark
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Childs' significance was never more evident than Friday night.
The box score read that Childs contributed 9 points, 4 assists, 4
rebounds and 2 steals to the Knicks' victory, but close observation
of the game revealed that Childs had done much more. In the 37
minutes that Childs was on the floor, the Knicks outscored Indiana
by 86-60. In the 11 minutes that he wasn't, the Pacers drilled the
Knicks by 22-4.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, after Indiana sprinted to an 11-4 lead,
Van Gundy subbed Childs into the game and all became well for the
Knicks. The offense began running smoothly, Jackson was kept under
control, and the Knicks scored 20 of the next 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the start of the second half, with the Knicks reeling
because of the injury to Johnson, the Pacers ran off 11 unanswered
points in &QC; 1 minute 55 seconds to turn a 6-point deficit into a
5-point advantage. Again, Van Gundy turned to Childs, and again the
backup point guard delivered. Less than five minutes later, the
score was tied. Two minutes after that, the Knicks regained the
lead when Childs buried a 15-foot jumper and honored Johnson by
making the ``L'' signal with his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just emotion,'' said Childs, who went on to score 7
points in the fourth quarter and hold Reggie Miller to three field
goal attempts and no points. ``A lot of people didn't like it when
Larry started doing that. I think he just carries a lot in his
heart and I just wanted to let him know that he was still a part of
this team and that the things that he's accomplished, the things
that he's given us as a player, the unselfishness that he possesses
each and every night, was with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Childs, still emotional, reminisced about the Knicks'
wild and improbable journey to the conference title. Asked what he
would have said two months ago if a friend had told him the Knicks
would be playing for the league championship, he responded: ``You
need to gointo rehab. You're definitely on some kind of drug.''
</P>
<P>
   That the newest Knicks, Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, have
keyed the Knicks' run is not lost on Childs. Neither is the now
seemingly foolish and premature release of the man responsible for
bringing them to New York, Grunfeld. ``I wish he was here,'' Childs
said, referring to Grunfeld. ``I wish he was in the building to
feel what was going on because what he's done has given us the
opportunity to play for the championship. Maybe I should put E.G.
on my ankle tape to let him know that he's a part of this team
also.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, this Knicks point guard who was so excited that he
was admittedly rambling in answering questions, addressed Marbury.
Back in April, when the Knicks were floundering, Marbury criticized
Childs and Ward after they outplayed him in a Knicks' victory,
saying the Knicks would never win a title with them quarterbacking
the team. At the time, Childs said the comment did not bother him,
but when he was asked how satisfying it was to get the Knicks to
the finals, he replied with a smile, ``Ask Marbury.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``People have opinions. But I've been around Charlie
for three years and two heads are better than one any time and we
believe in each other, the team believes in us and that's all that
matters. People don't have to believe in us because we're strong
enough in our character that we're going to go out there and play,
not to prove anybody else wrong but to just prove to ourselves that
we are worthy.'' &QL;

OUTDOORS: THE SALMON OBSESSION THAT WENT UNSATISFIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAGALLOWAY PLANTATION, Maine _ A recent trip to Maine's remote
and tumultuous Rapid River reminded me that I can become
inordinately obsessive about catching fish, in this instance,
landlocked salmon.
</P>
<P>
   When my companion Ruth Kirchmeier and I launched our canoe,
laden with gear and grub for a week, at the public ramp on the
Androscoggin River in Errol, N.H., I was already planning how I
would cook the salmon I was going to catch that evening. We were
heading for the upper end of the pool, just below the rapids, where
the Rapid River tumbles into the western side of Lake Umbagog, a
long, essentially shallow body of water that straddles the
Maine-New Hampshire border and is now within a national wildlife
refuge. Much of the refuge is unspoiled wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   It is five miles from the ramp to the cabin at the mouth of the
Rapid River, a little more than half of the distance involving
running up the Androscoggin to where it leaves the lake. From
there, we cross to the Maine shore. Ruth, I knew, was thinking less
of salmon than of the trip across Umbagog. In the decade we have
been visiting the area, there have been some wet and challenging
crossings. Often, the wind suddenly pours out of the mountains,
making the lake a churning welter of whitecaps in a quarter of an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   This time there was nothing more than a gentle breeze. The
camp's owner, Dick Celli of Lenox, Mass., greeted us and an hour
later I was assembling my fly rods _ one with a sink tip line, the
other with a floating line.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth and I were at the Rapid River's outlet pool for two hours
that evening and I caught nothing. The water temperature was 61
degrees, a bit warm for salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The following evening Celli ran his pontoon boat up to the pool
and caught two salmon, one 13{ inches long, the other just over the
minimum legal length limit of 14 inches. (The daily limit for
salmon on the Rapid River is one. It's fly fishing only and all
trout must be released. The river has good numbers of wild brook
trout, and two-pounders _ particularly a few miles upstream at Pond
in the River _ are not uncommon.) That same evening Ruth and I
remained at the pool until 8 p.m. and I caught three 12-inch salmon
and several large white suckers.
</P>
<P>
   Celli was up at dawn the next day and took a nice male salmon
nearly 20 inches long on his sixth cast. I slept late that day, my
last such indulgence. Celli left for home, planning to return in a
couple of days with his wife, Liz. He has two camps he owns on the
peninsula which juts out into the lake on the south side of the
junction of the river and Umbagog.
</P>
<P>
   I soon began to fret that we might not have even one evening
meal of salmon. An unusually warm spell _ it was in the mid-80's by
noon most days _ had begun on the weekend and showed no signs of
departing, and the river became a degree warmer each day. In
addition, upstream dam releases had raised its level about 10
inches, making it impossible _ the current was too strong and the
water too rough _ for us to anchor our canoe as far upstream in the
rapids as I would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   The hot weather stayed with us save for one afternoon when a
short-lived cold front came in from the northwest just before
sundown, and for a few hours Umbagog looked familiar, waves
crashing against the point and the gale stripping leaves from the
poplars, maples and birches that are between the camp and the
water. When the wind died, several loons began wailing and it was a
good night for sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Another day had gone by with no salmon when Fred Andrews of
Florida Mountain, Mass., arrived and offered us a 12-inch brook
trout that he had caught trolling 17 feet down in the lake. We
accepted it with unseemly alacrity. We later visited Fred's camp at
nearby Sunday Cove, and he gave me some gasoline for my
2-horsepower outboard so that I could step up the frequency of my
unrelenting visits to the outlet pool. Fred later caught nothing
there. As far as I know, Celli's salmon were the only ones taken
the week I was there.
</P>
<P>
   My quest possessed me. Day after day, we motored to the pool,
anchored the canoe in the thrashing, foaming water while I cast
hundreds of times with various fly patterns and Ruth sketched the
same scene over and over, alternately concentrating on waves and
towering conifers. By the end of each such session, I began to be
slightly giddy from all the jouncing.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth never complained although she once commented mildly that it
seemed as if I was going to work rather than having fun. In other
years we took hikes upriver, but the heat, the general lack of wind
and the plethora of black flies and mosquitoes made walking in the
woods unappealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to catch a salmon,'' I said as we sat in our
lurching canoe. ``When you are 76, you lose agility, but gain in
sagacity and persistence.''
</P>
<P>
   One evening after all of the various streamer, wet fly and nymph
patterns had produced nothing, I _ even though no salmon were
rising _ put a dry fly, a No. 12 White Wulff, on my floating line,
made a long cast to a smooth glide in the dark, sliding water to my
left and was rewarded with a savage strike. The fish vaulted into
the air in the near darkness and I jubilantly proclaimed that I had
finally ended the jinx.
</P>
<P>
   The fish jumped again, and this time I noted that it was
unusually dark and chunky for a salmon. It jumped again and I began
to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smallmouth bass,'' I announced to Ruth, and relaxed,
all salmon madness shed away. The bass was so large, about five
pounds and 20 inches long, that it barely fit into my trout net. I
baked it for supper that night, garnished with onions and sun-dried
tomatoes from last year's garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it better than salmon,'' said Ruth, and she wasn't
kidding. I liked it well enough to devote the next day, our last,
to a hike upriver to Smooth Ledge.

INTERLEAGUE THRILLS COMING FROM UNEXPECTED SOURCES THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A primary attraction of interleague baseball games is supposed
to be the opportunity it affords fans to see stars from the other
league they normally wouldn't see: Ken Griffey Jr. in Denver, Larry
Walker in Arlington, Texas, Barry Bonds in Seattle, Greg Maddux in
Boston, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, unheralded players provide an unexpected
bonus, either for their teams' fans or someone else's: Guillermo
Mota and Dan Smith of Montreal, Nelson Cruz of Detroit, David
Newhan of San Diego, for example. Players have mixed feelings about
interleague play, but these rookies just love the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome, especially since we were playing Oakland,'' said
Newhan, who began his career in the Athletics' organization. ``I
know about half their lineup. It was real fun to get to play
against those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhan, a 25-year-old second baseman, was promoted June 4 from
Las Vegas of the Pacific Coast League, where he was hitting .307
with 10 home runs and 9 stolen bases, when shortstop Chris Gomez
was placed on the disabled list with a strained knee.
</P>
<P>
   In the Padres' first interleague game, against Seattle, he went
in as a pinch-runner in the eighth inning, stole second and scored
the winning run. In his first start, against Oakland last Tuesday,
he stroked three hits in a 5-3 victory. When he rapped a double in
the second inning for his first hit, he said, ``They gave me a
standing O; it was neat.''
</P>
<P>
   On that same night, Smith and Cruz discovered that, like Newhan,
they liked interleague play. Smith, a 23-year-old right-hander,
made his major league debut for the Expos and gave up three hits to
the first four Boston batters, then retired the next 20 he faced
before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the seventh en route to a 5-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who pitched in relief 19 times for the Chicago White Sox
in 1997, made his first major league start and was the winning
pitcher in the Tigers' 11-4 victory over Pittsburgh. The
26-year-old right-hander allowed one run and two hits in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mota, Smith's teammate, discovered a different reason for liking
interleague play. The 25-year-old Dominican, once an infielder in
the Mets' minor league system, pitched the final one and two-thirds
innings against the Red Sox on Wednesday night and retired all five
batters he faced. But that wasn't the most memorable experience he
took from his first interleague game. Making his 12th major league
relief appearance but batting for the first time, Mota socked a
three-run home run. As a minor league infielder, Mota hit 16 home
runs in five seasons. He became a pitcher in 1997 after the Expos
drafted him from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   With Mota, Smith and their teammates beating up on Boston, then
the American League East leader, it did not enjoy the first two
series of interleague play. Five losses in six games with the
Atlanta Braves and the Expos wiped out Boston's game-and-a-half
lead and dropped it half a game behind the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In sweeping the Red Sox, the Expos did the unthinkable. They
beat Pedro Martinez, something only one American League team, the
Chicago White Sox 10 starts earlier, had done this season. In the
first game of the series, the Red Sox lost to Carl Pavano, whom
they traded to Montreal for Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   F.P. Santangelo, who spent the previous 10 years in the Montreal
organization, the last four with the Expos, is another player who
likes interleague play. Now playing for the San Francisco Giants,
Santangelo had not hit a home run all season. Then he hit one
against Oakland and the next day his second one against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox closer Bob Howry likes interleague play. He had eight
saves in the team's first 28 games, then went without one for the
next 24. However, in the space of three interleague games, he
earned his 9th and 10th saves, one against Pittsburgh, one against
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Erickson of Baltimore likes interleague games. Erickson,
who is the only major league pitcher to start a game in Cuba in the
last 40 years, had gained one victory in his first 12 starts but
then beat the Florida Marlins, who themselves think interleague
play is the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens in their weekend series with the Yankees,
the Marlins have had another successful segment of interleague
games. Even with the decimated team they had last year, the Marlins
had an 8-8 interleague record (compared with 46-100 intraleague)
and came into this season's games with a two-year 20-11 record,
best in either league. Then they won their first five games this
season, sweeping three from Tampa Bay and beating Baltimore twice
before Erickson beat them. Not everybody loves inter-league play.
Think Wil Cordero does? The Cleveland player broke a wrist making a
sliding catch of a Jeromy Burnitz fly ball. Chan Ho Park? He was
suspended for seven games for attacking Tim Belcher of Anaheim with
a move right out of a kung fu movie.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two Sets of Rules
</P>
<P>
   Interleague play continues to generate debate among its
supporters and its critics, but one element gets no argument from
most people, that is, most people who don't make the rules. It
makes no sense to play by two sets of rules _ designated hitter in
American League parks, no designated hitter in National League
parks.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees went to Philadelphia last week and might as well
have left Chili Davis at home. They used him as a pinch-hitter in
two losing efforts. The Orioles left Harold Baines on the bench in
Florida, calling on him to pinch-hit once. Edgar Martinez missed
three of six Seattle road games last week, played first base twice
and pinch-hit once. Tampa Bay sent Jose Canseco to left field twice
and to the plate as a pinch-hitter once.
</P>
<P>
   Two other teams used the games as an excuse to return their
designated hitters to their rightful positions. Mo Vaughn, who
missed 17 games with an ankle injury, had been serving as the DH
since his return from the disabled list, but the Anaheim Angels put
him back at first base for six games in Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro, recovering from knee surgery, had been the
Texas Rangers' DH all season. He sat out the first interleague game
in Arizona because Randy Johnson was pitching and the left-handed
Palmeiro thinks the best position to be in to face him is on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next five games in Arizona and Los Angeles, Palmeiro
was at first base. His hitting did not suffer. He batted .391 and
drove in nine runs. Nevertheless, when the Rangers returned home
Friday night, Palmeiro was the DH. once again.
</P>
<P>
   When National League teams play in American League parks, they
generally use the DH spot to give some of their regular players
half a day off. Playing in Cleveland last Thursday night, the
Milwaukee Brewers used Jeromy Burnitz as their DH after he had
started in right field in every one of their first 58 games.

   Raging in the Dugout
</P>
<P>
   In a dugout scene in Florida last Wednesday night, Albert Belle
played the part of Reggie Jackson, Ray Miller played Billy Martin
and Jeff Reboulet took the supporting role of Elston Howard. It
was, 22 years later, a re-enactment of the dugout confrontation at
Fenway Park between Jackson and Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In that encounter, Jackson raged at Martin after the Yankees'
manager (Chapter I of V) yanked him out of right field after,
Martin believed, he had loafed going after a hit. Howard, a coach,
stepped between the men as they screamed at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Reboulet was the man who stepped into the middle in the
Baltimore dugout as Belle stormed at Miller. Belle, for at least
the third time this season, had not run out a grounder in the
Orioles' ninth. Although Miller said he had planned to replace
Belle in right field with Rich Amaral before the play, Belle went
out to right and had to run back in. When he reached the dugout, he
confronted the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had made a similar move eight previous times this season,
six times in one-sided games, twice with the Orioles ahead by one
or two runs. This time they led by two. But if the manager wasn't
punishing Belle by removing him from that game, he was certainly
acting punitively Friday night when he left Belle out of the lineup
for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Belle has been a shell of his former self. When he was omitted
from the lineup, he was hitting .244, had driven in 35 runs and had
hit 10 home runs, one in 21 games since May 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Winner, and Still Unbeaten
</P>
<P>
   Eight pitchers, five relievers and three starters, have run
their records this season to 5-0. Only one, however, has gone
beyond. He is Jeff Zimmerman, an unheralded reliever for the
Rangers, who only two years ago was pitching in the independent
Northern League.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman gained victory No. 6 at Los Angeles last Tuesday
night, pitching the 11th and 12th innings of a 13-inning 7-6
decision, then picked up No. 7 Friday night with a one-inning
appearance against Colorado. Those decisions gave him four of the
Rangers' last eight victories. John Wasdin of Boston has a chance
to join Zimmerman beyond 5-0. He went from a 3-0 record to 5-0 with
victories in consecutive games against Detroit May 31 and June 1.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens of the Yankees, John Smoltz of Atlanta and Brian
Bohanon of Colorado each reached 5-0, but each starter also lost
his next decision. Suffering the same fate were relievers Jason
Grimsley of the Yankees, Dennis Cook of the Mets and T.J. Mathews
of Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Part Marlins, Part Yankees
</P>
<P>
   John Henry, the commodities trader who rescued the Florida
Marlins from H.Wayne Huizenga earlier this year, still holds a 1
percent piece of the Yankees. The 60-to-90-day period he was given
to sell that tiny share has passed, but officials are not concerned
about his dual ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave us a representation that he would not participate in
any Yankees activities and not vote on any Yankees matter,'' said
Robert Dupuy, Major League Baseball's executive vice president for
administration.
</P>
<P>
   As if any limited partner of the Yankees has ever had a say in
club decisions. John McMullen said it best 20 years ago: ``There's
nothing more limited than a limited partner in the Yankees.'' &QL;

 &HT;    A decorative arts dynasty

   ``Art &AMP; Enterprise: The Virginia Carroll Crawford Collection of
American Decorative Art, 1825-1917''

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The High Museum of Art is not often on the receiving
end of museum envy. It can, however, boast two exceptions in patron
Virginia Carroll Crawford and the 19th-century decorative arts
collection her largesse and enthusiasm have built.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the great collections of 19th-century material,''
says Kevin Stayton, decorative arts curator at the Brooklyn Museum
of Art. ``That collection couldn't be put together now at any
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has a serious exhibition on the subject has to
borrow from the High,'' says Atlanta dealer Deanne Levison.
</P>
<P>
   But not right now.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred seventy-five of the 230 objects amassed over 20
years are staying put through Sept. 26 in ``Art &AMP; Enterprise: The
Virginia Carroll Crawford Collection of American Decorative Art,
1825-1917,'' an exhibition that opened Saturday at the High.
</P>
<P>
   Diversity is the hallmark of the era, which tapped historical
styles as relentlessly as postmodern architecture. The collection
follows rapidly changing fashions. You can find Gothic Revival
andirons and classically styled silver tea sets, Egyptian-themed
mantel decorations and Arts and Crafts furniture. Pieces are as
subtle as Japanese-inspired pottery and as over the top as the wild
west chair and ottoman with backs and legs made out of steer horns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collection is about social history as well as art
history,'' says High curator Donald Peirce, who has devoted at
least half his time to the collection since arriving in 1981. He
organized this exhibition and wrote its catalog entries.
</P>
<P>
   From the shimmering elegance of a Louis Comfort Tiffany vessel
to the stately geometry of Louis Sullivan's elevator grille, the
Virginia Carroll Crawford Collection is a window on American taste
_ affluent taste, that is. During the 19th and early 20th
centuries, the United States grew in wealth and power and, like a
three-dimensional set of Architectural Digest magazines, this show
lets us peek into a world where money was frequently no object.
Five pieces, including a delicate side chair and luxurious ottoman
by the famed Herter Brothers, came from the palatial Fifth Avenue
home of William Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, perhaps, the exhibition is a celebration of a great
patron, and what such a person can mean to a museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia Carroll Crawford is a unique donor,'' Peirce says,
voicing an accolade seconded by curators around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``More often, collectors collect what they are interested in,''
says David Hanks, an independent curator who has been the
collection's New York consultant since its inception. ``She was
willing to collect what the museum wanted. I don't know another
parallel to that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Crawford, 72, decided in the late 1970s that she wanted to
focus her giving, she agreed to the proposal, made by curator
Katherine Farnham, to build a collection of 19th-century American
decorative arts, an area not in vogue at the time. One big reason?
Since pre-1825 American decorative arts were the rage, later
19th-century objects would be more available and less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though it was not her interest, Mrs. Crawford showed an
openness and willingness to learn,'' Peirce says. ``Along the way,
she developed an appreciation and an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The High made a bold move, and it was extraordinarily
successful,'' says Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen, curator in American
decorative arts at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. ``To have
a supporter who had the confidence in the institution, and the
curatorial staff to form something new, and the means to make a
difference, is a museum's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Hanks served as bird dog, watching auctions and
dealers, and informing Peirce about possible purchases. If an
important piece surfaced and passed muster with Peirce, he would
present it to Crawford. These objects needed only Crawford's OK.
Thus, a purchase could be made in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we could act quickly, we were offered the best
pieces,'' Hanks says. ``Otherwise we would have missed half the
collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Building the collection became a great adventure for Crawford.
``Once I started, I wanted it to be the best of its kind,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   For the first several years, due to lack of space at the old
High building, objects were stored in a New York warehouse, which
Crawford would occasionally visit. The collection debuted in
Atlanta along with the new museum building in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thrill was seeing the trucks carrying the
collection arrive at the new museum, and the special display
(architect) Richard Meier had created for them,'' Crawford recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The collection stimulated interest at other museums.
Subsequently, prices escalated. But the High had a head start and a
persevering patron: Peirce recalls no talk of a budget during his
18 years of working with Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have maintained our desire to have the finest,''
Crawford says. ``There are still things we want to add.''

 &HT;    What co-workers have to say about David E. Kelley
 &HT;    (With DAVIDKELLEY-Q&AMP;A.)
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer and Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What his colleagues have said told the news media about David E.
Kelley:
</P>
<P>
   Camryn Manheim (Ellenor on ``The Practice''): ``We know that
he's there with his yellow pad and churns stuff out from 9 to 5 and
goes home every night to be with Michelle Pfeiffer. I think he's an
idiot-savant. And I mean that in a really good way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Nicole Carson (Renee on ``Ally''): ``He's warped.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Krakowski (Elaine on ``Ally''): ``I think it's really cool
that David knows that women don't completely like each other at all
times. They like each other, but certain elements are not
attractive to the other person. Nobody is a clean package. He sort
of explores that concept with all the women.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter MacNicol (John Cage on ``Ally''): ``I don't know when I've
ever experienced this kind of symbiosis with a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Hamlin (``L.A. Law''): ``I left `L.A. Law' for one reason,
and that was because David Kelley was leaving. I said, `If you find
someone as good as Kelley, I'll stay.' They couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Elodie Keene (director who's worked on Kelley shows from ``L.A.
Law'' to ``Ally''): ``I've been on shows when David left, and what
happens to the writing and the characters is a sad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bochco (Kelley's mentor, who hired him for ``L.A. Law''):
``I am in awe of David Kelley, simply in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Williams (Lindsay on ``The Practice''): ``He's like a rock
star who doesn't sing.''

 &HT;    Changes afoot for `Ally,' writer Kelley says
 &HT;    (With DAVIDKELLEY-COLLEAGUES.)
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the universe according to David E. Kelley,
attorneys quickly get over the shock of finding a severed head in a
bowling ball bag and start plotting legal strategy. A brilliant
surgeon on the edge of a nervous breakdown warbles ``And the Band
Played On'' in a desperate vibrato. People gather in a unisex
bathroom and break into shuffle-step choreography to a Barry White
oldie.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the real universe is expanding, so is Kelley's
uniquely skewed fantasy universe. This fall, the creator of Fox's
``Ally McBeal,'' ABC's ``The Practice'' and CBS' ``Chicago Hope''
will be on three networks with five series (including a new ABC
series ``Snoops'') _ or four-and-a-half, depending on how you count
the strange idea of repackaging ``Ally'' as a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley leaves most people in the TV industry shaking their heads
in wonder. This past season, he wrote all 22 episodes of ``Ally''
and most episodes of ``The Practice,'' virtually unheard of in an
industry that uses entire teams to write one half-hour of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, 42, was a Boston lawyer when he started writing scripts
for ``L.A. Law'' in the late '80s. He moved to Los Angeles and
started honing his vision, which frequently involves serious social
issues being discussed in a bizarre context.
</P>
<P>
   In New York recently to accept two Peabody Awards for ``Ally''
and ``The Practice'' _ added to Golden Globes for both shows and a
best drama Emmy for ``Practice'' _ the soft-spoken Kelley answered
questions about his shows and, a little more reluctantly, himself.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The new half-hour ``Ally'' is puzzling a lot of people. How
much is going to be recycled and how much will be new stuff we
haven't seen?
</P>
<P>
   A:It'll play more fresh than people think. The majority will be
material people have seen, with one, maybe two new scenes in any
given episode. They'll have new music and be recut. These are
funnier and a little more quickly paced.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Who came up with this idea and why?
</P>
<P>
   A:I'm sort of embarrassed to say. I'm always accused of being a
horrible businessman, but my business nose led with this one. The
syndication market for one-hours is not as strong as for
half-hours, and there was this feeling this show might not be as
timeless as other shows. I thought I could crunch this show to a
half-hour. Once I started to do it as an experiment, I was
surprised to find some of these half-hours played better than the
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You're also going back to ``Chicago Hope'' in the fall. What
is the deal?
</P>
<P>
   A:The deal is just trying to have it survive. It was on life
support in terms of being renewed. I just felt there was some
potential in it that was untapped. I won't be writing the episodes,
but I will play more of an active role, which I really haven't been
doing. I expect I'll be polishing up the (Dr. Jeffrey) Geiger
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Q:How are you going to get all this done?
</P>
<P>
   A:I'm building more of a (writing) staff on ``The Practice,''
and maybe next year will be a little easier. By and large I'll
still be hands-on with ``Ally'' and ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:And (the new ABC detective drama) ``Snoops''?
</P>
<P>
   A:``Snoops'' I'm launching, and I'll be a consultant. That show
has writers who are better suited to that genre than I am anyway.
I'm probably doing them a favor by getting out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The shows other than ``Ally'' are probably easier for other
writers to take over. Is it hard for other writers to get into that
(Ally) voice?
</P>
<P>
   A:Yeah. I haven't found 'em yet. But I'm not actively looking.
The prospect of continuing to write all the episodes for three,
four, five more years isn't that daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The whimsy of ``Ally'' _ if that's a word that doesn't give
offense _ may be hard to sustain over a long period. Maybe the show
starts to taper off, or the audience says we've been though this
before. Is that a concern?
</P>
<P>
   A:I think that will always be something we have to be conscious
of. Ally always has to grow and change to refresh itself. Sometimes
it's by adding new characters, sometimes by taking existing
characters down new paths. There's not a pressure to come back next
year and do it like we did last year. That's what's fun for me as a
writer. Lord knows on most television shows, if it ain't broke,
don't fix it. That doesn't apply here. It's not a question of being
broke, it's a matter of growing to stay viable.
</P>
<P>
   Q:On ``Ally,'' is there a fine line between establishing
something unusual, be it dancing babies, frogs, Barry White and
making sure you get out before you overdo it?
</P>
<P>
   A:Absolutely. And you never know where that line is. There was
one case where I felt I couldn't be objective and that's where the
jury started singing ``Trouble'' with (John) Cage. And I always
loved ``The Music Man,'' but I was seriously wondering, ``Am I the
only one that thinks this is funny?'' I took it home and put the
cassette in for my wife (actress Michelle Pfeiffer) because she'll
tell me. And I said, ``Did we cross the line this time?'' And she
said, ``No, it's funny.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't want to play it too safe. And you don't want to fall
over and go splat. There have been some cases where we have.
</P>
<P>
   Q:In the (unisex) bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   A:The bathroom never bothers me. People have told me that you've
gone too far in the bathroom, but I continue to be amused by it.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Sexual harassment and gender war issues play a huge role in
``Ally,'' and somewhat of a role in ``The Practice.'' Why are you
so interested in these issues?
</P>
<P>
   A:I'm interested in themes of women in the workplace and men in
the workplace contending with women. That workplace is evolving,
and so is the law _ the law has just been all over the place. It's
great fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Do you ever get sick of everyone in the industry telling you
how wonderful you are and kowtowing to you?
</P>
<P>
   A:Especially with ``Ally,'' there's a lot of people who don't
like the show, who find it annoying. If you want to accept the
accolades, then you have to accept the criticism. It feels over
here like the company is in the middle of its 15 minutes (of fame),
and we're just trying to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The notion of Ally as a post-feminist icon and lightning rod
seems to have died down some. What was that scrutiny like?
</P>
<P>
   A:It was very surprising to see the show being taken so
seriously. We were ill-equipped to respond to it. When we started
out, we got a lot of criticism aimed at our ``intent'' to depict
Ally as the personification of womankind. That was never our
intent.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Of all the characters on your shows, whom do you feel
personally closest to?
</P>
<P>
   A:I don't know. The two characters would probably be Cage and
Ally. There's more of me in them than in the others. But I don't
liken myself to either Ally or Cage.
</P>
<P>
   Q:What parts of you are like them?
</P>
<P>
   A:I suppose the inner worlds that both of them retreat to is
something I identify with, as a writer who spends most of my day in
an imaginary world.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Do you have a theme song?
</P>
<P>
   A:I don't. I think I have a lot of theme songs. The effect that
a theme song can have on Ally, or Barry White on Cage, I've
experienced that.

REAL ESTATE: INSURANCE FOR REDEVELOPERS OF POLLUTED SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHELLE GARBARINE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year the state of New Jersey enacted the Brownfields and
Contaminated Site Redemption Act, which would reimburse developers
for up to 75 percent of the cost of the completed cleanup if, among
other things, the redevelopment project would generate new tax
revenue exceeding the cleanup cost.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also provides purchasers with protection from
private lawsuits related to past contamination problems and carries
an assurance that the state will not sue once the site is cleaned
according to the the state's now more flexible standards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry professionals and developers said, redeveloping
polluted sites could be like opening Pandora's box since the
state's changes address neither the actual cost of doing the
required cleanup nor protection from lawsuits if unknown
contaminants are found.
</P>
<P>
   One answer to both of these problems, say brokers and
developers, is the use of private environmental insurance. The
developers of two projects, one in Linden, the other in Edison,
have taken out environmental insurance policies as they prepare to
transform contaminated sites into mixed-used centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance allows all parties to distill what is a large
unknown to a fixed cost and eliminate the potential of a huge loss
due to liability,'' said Richard Greenberg. He is the president of
Environmental Waste Management Associates, an environmental cleanup
firm in Parsippany, who is involved in the cleanups of the Linden
and Edison sites.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance covering unexpected costs is based on an initial
estimate of what it will cost to remediate known contaminants on
the site. Any costs incurred over that estimate, minus a deductible
of 10 percent to 20 percent, depending on the insurer, are covered
by the policy, which runs for the length of the cleanup. The policy
can be tailored to protect buyers and sellers as well as lenders
and tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The policy can also be extended, or a separate policy can be
written, to cover third-party liability issues, including property
damage and the discovery of unknown pollutants. This coverage
usually runs from one to five years, but can be extended to up to
10 or 15 years and can be put in place before during or after the
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Most insurers will issue policies only after the state approves
a cleanup plan. But some will do so even without state approval if
the consultant who did the estimate has a proven track record and
will do the cleanup in accordance with state standards.
</P>
<P>
   While insurers began offering such policies three years ago,
they only started to be actively used in the last 18 months. Among
the reasons, analysts say, is the scarcity of developable land. The
state's efforts to return contaminated sites to productive use has
increased developers' interest in such sites.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say, technological advances in assessing the cost
of cleanups have made insurance companies more willing to
underwrite such policies. As more policies are written, increasing
competition among insurers has resulted in lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Major insurers offering the coverage include American
International Group, or AIG, of New York, Kemper Environmental of
Princeton, N.J., a division of Kemper Insurance Cos., and Reliance
National Insurance Co. of Exton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental insurance is not inexpensive. Premiums for
policies covering cost overruns generally range from 4 percent to
10 percent of the estimated cost of the cleanup, said Robin
Kelliher, a vice president at the Morris Plains office of Willis
Corron Corp., an international insurance brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors influencing the premium amount are the amount
of contamination and whether there is off-site migration of the
contaminants through soil or groundwater. The minimum premium is
$15,000, Ms. Kelliher said.
</P>
<P>
   What buyers are hoping, said Joseph Boren, president of AIG
Environmental, an affiliate of the giant insurer, is that the
insurance ``can help control the cleanup cost'' and enable them to
decide whether moving forward makes economic sense. Otherwise, he
added, ``if something is missed they could be left with tapioca.''
</P>
<P>
   No one sees insurance as a panacea and even supporters say
policies must be carefully read by buyers to make sure they are
getting the coverage they need. Insurance also cannot be obtained
for every deal, nor is it always necessary, Ms. Kelliher said,
adding that for small cleanups of $25,000 or less insurance doesn't
make sense.
</P>
<P>
   State environmental officials consider the use of insurance
complementary to their efforts to facilitate the reuse of the
10,000 contaminated sites in the state, down from about 20,000 in
1985. Of the remaining sites, 1,130 are brownfields, which the
state defines as tainted, underutilized industrial or commercial
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden there's a ton of insurance products to deal
with cost overruns,'' said Richard Gimello, assistant commissioner
at the Site Remediation Program, part of the state's Department of
Environmental Protection. ``For projects with $1 million cleanups
it sounds like a good idea because it gives developers a level of
comfort that there is finality to their costs.''

   Such insurance played a role in the purchase earlier this month
by Starwood Ceruzzi LLC of 62 acres of the 188-acre city-owned
Linden Airport along Route 1-9 in Linden. Part of the airport is
used for small cargo and private planes.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Ceruzzi _ a joint venture of Ceruzzi Holdings of
Fairfield, Conn. and Starwood Opportunity Fund V, an affiliate of
Starwood Capital Group of Greenwich, Conn. _ intends to turn the 62
acres into a 650,000-square-foot mixed-use center, comprising a
hotel, movie theater and shops. Financing for the $60-million
project, the latest in a three-decade effort to redevelop the
airport, is coming from banks and investors.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Ceruzzi had 60 days to decide to redevelop the site and
take on the cleanup associated with it. Greenberg of Environmental
Waste Management Associates estimated the cost of cleaning the
contaminants on the site and in the groundwater, which included
chlorinated solvents left behind from the airport operation, at
$1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the partners' time frame the cleanup plan was designed
without state approval, which saved time and will allow them to
``hit the ground running,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Ceruzzi, president of Starwood Ceruzzi, added: ``Whenever
there is a significant cleanup we wring the risk out of it and
protect our investors by buying insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The partners paid a $100,000 premium for an insurance policy
from Reliance that covers $1 million in unexpected costs. ``The
price of the policy was worthwhile when weighed against our ability
to move ahead today with a $60 million project,'' Ceruzzi said. And
since Greenberg told the developers that the cleanup would meet
state standards, he said, ``we will be able to avail ourselves of
the state's reimbursement program and its assurance not to sue once
the cleanup is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   The cleanup will be tied to the construction of the project,
which is to start in 30 days. Completion is expected in 18 months,
said Ceruzzi.
</P>
<P>
   In Edison, Starwood Heller LLC purchased environmental insurance
to redevelop a 63-acre former Revlon complex, including the
cosmetic giant's worldwide research and development center, near
the intersection of Route 27 and Interstate 287.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for demolishing most of the vacant
750,000-square-foot former manufacturing plant and replacing it
with 390,000 square feet of new and renovated industrial space, as
well as building 150,000 square feet of retail space on 18
undeveloped acres.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Heller _ a joint venture between G. Heller Enterprises
of Edgewater and Starwood Capital Group _ also agreed to lease back
to Revlon the 100,000-square-foot research component, as well as
75,000 square feet in an existing 250,000-square-foot office
building. That four-story building will be renovated.
</P>
<P>
   But for the $49 million purchase and redevelopment plan to
proceed Revlon wanted to limit its exposure to cost overruns and
legal liability involved in the $1 million cleanup of the site,
said Scott Heller, executive vice president at G. Heller
Enterprises. So, he said, the partners agreed to pay a premium of
$100,000 to $200,000 to buy an $8 million insurance policy from
AIG. The cleanup involves treating contaminants in the groundwater,
including a variety of chemical solvents, Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance made cautious people more comfortable,'' Heller
said, noting that without the policy Revlon would not have sold the
property.

2 CLAIMS COMPLICATE TUSSLE OVER NEW AGE GURU'S ESTATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ Accounts of fraud, bogus spirituality and
sexual exploitation had given the battle over the estate of
Frederick P. Lenz III, a popular author and New Age guru who killed
himself on Long Island in 1998, all the melodrama a television
producer could want.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Two women claiming to be Lenz's widows have turned up to contest
his will, causing a scramble by the lawyers involved in the case in
Surrogate's Court here.
</P>
<P>
   Two sides, the National Audubon Society and the executor of the
estate, had been arguing over who should get Lenz's estate of $18
million, which he amassed chiefly through his lectures on
meditation and computers. His will had said he intended to leave
everything to the Audubon Society or to a foundation promoting his
quasi-Buddhist ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Then a Texas woman, Diana Jean Reynolds, filed papers May 12
saying that she was Lenz's widow and was entitled to a third of his
fortune, as New York State law provides.
</P>
<P>
   As the lawyers moved to investigate Ms. Reynolds' claim that she
met and married Lenz in 1980 when she was a flight attendant, a
second woman told the Surrogate's Court on May 27 that she was the
true widow.
</P>
<P>
   That woman, Deborah Lenz, who describes herself as a cult
deprogrammer who is writing a book about her stormy relationship
with the tall, blond Lenz, claimed no documented marriage with him
but said in court papers that they had lived as husband and wife
from 1988 until his suicide and claimed a common law marriage under
Colorado law. She is seeking to have his will thrown out entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The will is no help in the dispute between the women: Lenz said
in the first paragraph that he was not married and wanted to
disinherit his family.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the four parties who now want a piece of Lenz's
holdings _ which include several mansions, a couple of Lear jets
and some luxury cars _ are to meet in court here on Wednesday to
begin sorting through the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Diana Reynolds as being a wonderful person,'' said
Mark E. Laxer, an early follower of Lenz who is listed as a witness
on the marriage certificate that Ms. Reynolds submitted. ``I don't
think she's making any of this up, but she may have been duped,
like the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Laxer, 38, a computer programmer for the United States Customs
Service, wrote a book, ``Take Me for a Ride: Coming of Age in a
Destructive Cult'' (Outer Rim Press, 1993), about his experience as
a follower of Lenz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't remember any major wedding, where everybody
gets dressed up and has cake or anything,'' Laxer said. ``Maybe one
day they said, `Hey, we're getting married,' as I was on my way out
to school or something and then they counted me as a witness, but I
don't remember it.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage certificate is from San Diego County, but a clerk
in the San Diego County Clerk's Office, Angie Zaragoza, said the
office had no record of the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Ms. Reynolds, Rita Gilbert, said Ms. Reynolds never
divorced Lenz but that their relationship ended in the mid-1980s
after he forced her to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Lenz, who filed her claim May 27, the deadline for
challenges to the will, said she had not planned to enter the
dispute over the will until she heard about Ms. Reynolds. ``I had
to come forward,'' Ms. Lenz, 48, said in a brief telephone
interview. ``I cannot allow someone else to claim t be married to
my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   To support her legal claim, Ms. Lenz submitted a letter from a
friend, Leta Jo Sparkman, who wrote that she had met Ms. Lenz at a
psychic fair and had had dinner with the couple several times
between 1988 and 1997. ``Their marriage had matured and the bond of
love and devotion was very obvious to any viewer's eye,'' Ms.
Sparkman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview with The Aspen Daily News in 1989, Ms. Lenz,
who then used the name Deborah Haines, spoke about how dangerous
Lenz was. ``He has an insane obsession with me,'' she said, adding,
``He'll do anything he can to stop me and shut me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenz amassed his fortune in part by charging followers monthly
tuition to attend his spiritual lectures and to meditate with him.
He encouraged his followers to study computer programming and then
to give him a share of the proceeds from software they designed. He
also wrote two novels, ``Surfing the Himalayas'' and ``Snowboarding
to Nirvana'' (St. Martin's Press, 1995 and 1997). He committed
suicide at the age of 48 in April 1998, taking 150 Valium tablets
and walking off a dock into the bay behind his mansion in Old Field
on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   His will, which was prepared four years before his death and
filed in Surrogate's Court in Westchester County, where he owned
property, said that all his money should go to a foundation to
promote his ideas if he took ``significant steps'' to establish one
during his life. Otherwise, the will said, all his money should go
to the National Audubon Society.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Marcus, specified as the executor in the will, formed a
foundation shortly after Lenz's death and made himself the
president, saying he was following the will's intent. In December,
the Audubon Society sued, saying it was entitled to the entire
estate because Lenz had never taken ``significant steps'' to form
the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society's lawyers, intending to weaken any competing
claims, characterized him as a charlatan and a fraud. The society's
legal filings included a thick binder of negative news articles
about Lenz, including those accusing him of coercing many women
into having sex with him by promising to hasten their spiritual
enlightenment. ``There was a lot of heavy spirituality going on,''
Laxer said of Lenz's relations with women. ``Some New Age love.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Audubon Society and Marcus were engaged in
settlement talks when the women's claims were filed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eugene Kalbacher, the publisher and editor of Hot
House, a small monthly magazine covering the jazz world, died on
May 25 at his home in Rockaway Township, N.J. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his wife, Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   Kalbacher was a young jazz journalist who saw great potential in
jazz developments of the early 1980s, and when the New York-area
radio station WRVR changed its format from all-jazz to all-country
at the beginning of the decade, it was a signal to him to start a
replacement all-jazz media outlet. In 1981 he and another jazz
journalist, Jeff Levenson, founded Hot House, a free monthly
publication that ran feature stories on musicians playing in New
York and carried complete listings of jazz in clubs and concert
halls in the metropolitan area. The magazine, available at jazz
clubs and record stores, has been published regularly ever since;
now it will be run by Mrs. Kalbacher. While running the magazine,
Kalbacher also wrote for the magazines Downbeat, Pulse and College
Music Journal and wrote liner notes for the record labels Enja and
Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by his mother, Gladys
Kalbacher, and two brothers, Bruce and Paul, both of Ghent, N.Y.

KARL MORGAN, 91, A FOUNDER OF HEALTH PHYSICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Karl Z. Morgan, a founder of the field of health physics,
the science of human health and radiation exposure, died June 8 in
Oak Ridge, Tenn., after years as a top official at the national
laboratory there. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was a member of the metallurgical laboratory staff at the
University of Chicago in 1943 when Enrico Fermi and other
physicists in the Manhattan Project were developing the world's
first atomic bomb there. After joining the project, Morgan was sent
to a then-secret location in Tennessee where uranium was processed
for the bombs that were dropped two years later on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, Japan, in the closing days of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he remained for 29 years at the plant, which
became the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and was director of
health physics at the plant until his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan founded the Health Physics Society and was its first
president, from 1955 to 1957. He also founded the Journal of the
Health Physics Society and was its first editor, serving from 1958
to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the June issue of the journal, Morgan was
described as ``one of a group of six persons who developed and
established the new science known as health physics, which today
employs thousands of persons in countries throughout the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At midcentury, Morgan was a proponent of the near-Messianic view
of nuclear science that then prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the nuclear age is here to stay and that its
future rests in large measure on the successful control of
radiation exposure,'' he wrote in an editorial in the first issue
of Health Physics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must understand the full and ultimate consequences of this
exposure and limit it at a level where we, and those that come
after us, can reap the maximum benefits of this new age,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But after decades as a pillar of the nuclear establishment, Dr.
Morgan offered court testimony friendly to people who said they had
been harmed by nuclear weapons and the nuclear power industry,
sometimes to the dismay of others in nuclear science.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1982, he testified in a lawsuit brought by nearly
1,200 people who accused the federal government of negligence in
atomic weapons testing in Nevada in the 1950s, which they said had
caused leukemia and other cancers. Morgan, then 75, testified that
radiation protection measures in the tests were substandard and
``not in the spirit'' of what was known at the time about the
health hazards of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Atomic Energy Commission, the forerunner of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, had set radiation safeguards and
other standards by selectively using information that would support
conclusions that had already been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan also testified in behalf of Navajo uranium miners and
their survivors, saying federal officials had known about mine
radiation dangers but had failed to protect the miners. And he
testified in the case of Karen Silkwood against Kerr-McGee. Ms.
Silkwood was a laboratory technician who reported health and safety
violations before being killed in a car crash as she was on the way
to meet with a reporter from The New York Times about her
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was also influential in the campaign for a 1968 federal
law that regulated medical X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   His autobiography, ``The Angry Genie: One Man's Walk Through the
Nuclear Age,'' written with Ken M. Peterson, a trial lawyer, was
published earlier this year by the University of Oklahoma Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went through a progression,'' Peterson said in a telephone
interview. ``In the '70s, he had a change of heart'' about nuclear
weapons production and nuclear power, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Peterson said, Morgan ``became quite unpopular with
certain elements in the health physics profession, and certainly
within the nuclear power industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is survived by his wife, Helen Lee McCoy Morgan, also of
Oak Ridge, two sons Karl Jr., a retired mechanical engineer from
the Oak Ridge plant, and Dr. Eric Lee Morgan of Cookeville, Tenn.;
two daughters, Joan Elen Morgan of Indian Rocks Beach, Fla., and
Diana Morgan Matthews of Cookeville; a sister, Lois Morgan Johnson
of West End, N.C.; four grandsons, and a great-grandson. &QL;

EDITORIAL: LATIN AMERICA'S BIRTH SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, June 13:
</P>
<P>
   Four months from now, the world's population is expected to hit
6 billion. Although it will continue to soar for decades to come,
the population would be far higher if the last 30 years had not
brought a significant drop in fertility in many regions.
</P>
<P>
   The drop is not surprising in rich countries and newly wealthy
East Asian nations such as Taiwan and Singapore. More remarkable is
the fertility drop in Latin America. A New York Times article last
week detailed the change in Mexico, and similar gains have been
made throughout the region. In the mid-1960s, Latin American women
averaged more than 6 children. Today the average is 2.9. The
benefits of smaller families are seen not only in a better life for
children and their parents, but also in an increased savings rate
and less cost to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America today is not markedly wealthier than in 1965. But
its women have much higher levels of education, access to health
care and employment. Latin American nations must do more to reduce
their birth rates, but they are ahead of South Asia and especially
Africa. Even as those regions struggle to get richer, they could
reap the benefits of smaller families by making contraception
available and emphasizing women's basic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's family-planning campaign is the major one initiated by
a government. In 1974, Mexico established a network of clinics, and
government-sponsored billboards touting the benefits of small
families are ubiquitous. In the rest of Latin America, governments
reluctant to defy the Catholic Church have mainly left family
planning to private groups, most of which got their start with
financing from the U.S. Agency for International Development and
the International Planned Parenthood Federation. Today, those
groups are trying to become self-sufficient, as donors switch their
focus to South Asia and Africa. They have also been hurt by
hundreds of millions of dollars in cuts for overseas family
planning engineered by Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The acknowledged leader is Colombia's Profamilia, founded in
1965. Profamilia has been a pioneer in many now-common techniques _
the use of radio to promote family planning, a network of trained
volunteers offering contraceptives and information door to door,
mobile sterilization vans and now special clinics for men. The most
remote Colombian village has a bodega stocking Profamilia's pills
and condoms. Now Profamilia, with grants from the Dutch government
and the United Nations, is training others.
</P>
<P>
   Contraceptives became available because Latin American women
demanded them as they began to get more education. Today, unlike
any other region in the developing world, Latin American girls are
just as likely as boys to be in school, except in the most rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Growing urbanization, which turns children from economic asset
to burden, and increasing job opportunities for women have helped
reduce the birth rate. In many nations, there has also been an
expansion of social security, which lessens the need for children
as old-age insurance. In addition, millions have had their first
exposure to doctors and modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Even television may have played a role. The evidence is
strongest in Brazil, which, surprisingly, has a lower birth rate
than its richer and better-educated neighbors. Vilmar Faria, a
Brazilian sociologist, and Joseph Potter, a University of Texas
sociologist, argue that the drop in fertility tracks the spread of
television _ dominated by the universally popular nightly soap
operas known as telenovelas. For many poor, the telenovelas
provided their first glimpse of small, less authoritarian families
and of consumer culture. Women realized they could choose fewer
children, and that children had a cost.
</P>
<P>
   For all the machismo in Latin America, women there have gained
substantially more rights and better treatment than women in the
rest of the developing world. The region's experience shows that
this is the most important key to limiting the population
explosion. &QL;

WITH RUN AGAINST THE ODDS, KNICKS TURN FANS INTO BELIEVERS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hardest word on 7-year-old Drew Beck's spelling
test on Friday was ``believe.''
</P>
<P>
   As in, I  &UR; believe &LR;  the Knicks can go all the way. Or, I
 &UR; believe &LR;  in Coach Jeff Van Gundy even when management seems not
to. And, as it says on the orange-and-blue handout towels, on the
Jumbotron at Madison Square Garden and in the minds of fans, I
still believe, even with Patrick Ewing's Achilles' tendon and Larry
Johnson's sprained knee, I believe, I believe, I  &UR; believe. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Drew's dad did not tell him until after school Friday that they
would be going to the Garden that night. He wanted the second
grader to concentrate on spelling. And young Drew, beaming before
the game in his No. 2 L.J. jersey and baggy Knicks shorts, got it
right: B-e-l-i-e-v-e.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, ``a few times he shut off the TV and
went to bed,'' said Tom Beck, a landscaper from Lewisboro, N.Y.,
who got the last-minute seats through a client. But, the boy
pointed out, he turned the television off only because it was a
school night. ``Drew,'' Beck said, ``never gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, in a word, unbelievable. What are we doing here?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really knows. And nobody really cares.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they miss Charles Oakley and John Starks, but try to find
someone who will say out loud now that trading them was a bad idea.
Had they really been anti-Sprewell? Now it's all about second
chances.
</P>
<P>
   And Jeff Van Gundy? It sounded as if every person in New York
was chanting his name, making a singsong of each syllable as the
seconds ticked down yesterday after midnight on the basketball game
deciding the Eastern Conference winner. The T-shirts emblazoned
``Champions'' began to appear, and they went to the Knicks, not the
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a season of destiny,'' said Mickey Rosenzweig of Old
Westbury, on Long Island, a season ticketholder who was sitting
with his wife, their daughter and her boyfriend, who is from
Detroit but all of a sudden loves the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Knicks this season are the epitome of New York City,''
Rosenzweig said. ``New York is a place of people who are always
fighting to survive and excel. This team did the greatest American
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no joy as sweet as the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Presents at Christmastime pale next to a surprise gift in
February. Flowers on Mother's Day cannot compare to a bouquet given
just because. And the excitement of following a predicted champion
from preseason practice to playoff lacks the wild wonderment of
watching an underdog beat the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Reiner, a 29-year-old lawyer in his first year as a season
ticketholder (right behind the basket, but hoping to move),
explained it to his sports buddies in one of dozens of
Knicks-related e-mail exchanges in recent weeks.

beat the Miami Heat and Larry Johnson's four-point play to beat
Indiana earlier in their series, Reiner wrote, ``When things
somehow go right, my reaction is not elation (and certainly not any
I-told-you-so satisfaction) but that I'm stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday morning, as he headed home to the Upper West Side
on the No. 1 subway crowded with his crowing comrades, the smile
seemed as much from shock as success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I laughed so hard when they billed me for three
rounds of playoff tickets,'' Reiner said. ``I can't be happy,'' he
added. ``I'm so stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   At the legendary hoops playground on West 4th Street in
Greenwich Village, players and coaches were wearing their hair in
cornrows the way Latrell Sprewell has since long before he came
East in the John Starks trade. Marcus Camby is like all those kids
from somewhere else who try to make it on Broadway, only in
sneakers. The nebbishy Van Gundy, who toiled so long as an
assistant coach behind the flamboyant Pat Riley and is now looking
for the National Basketball Association championship his boss never
got with the Knicks, is the basketball version of the computer
geeks-turned-millionaires sprouting on every corner of Silicon
Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Butter, a Knicks fan ``since the crib'' who does not
want the other players at West 4th to know his real name. Butter
loads trucks for Federal Express on the overnight shift and spends
days bouncing ball on pavement. His arm has a blue-and-orange
basketball tattoo, his Bulova watch a Knicks logo. Butter's pet
Akita is named Starks. His first-born, he vows, will be Knick, with
K's on both ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always a fan, but I expected to be rooting for someone
else in the playoffs,'' admitted Butter, who turned 29 in May as he
stood on the court with a black Knicks cap turned backward. ``For
my birthday, I just wished they'd win the championship. That would
be the best present. So I can walk down Broadway in the ticker-tape
parade.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been only five years since the Knicks last made the
finals, but fans are saying this feels different, somehow even
better than the championships in '70 and '74. The lockout, the
death of Red Holzman, the shortened season, the management
scuffles, the 21-21 record in March, the injuries, the bottom
ranking heading into the playoffs. (The second-hardest word on Drew
Beck's spelling test, he said, was ``except,'' as in: no eighth
seed has ever made the NBA finals,  &UR; except &LR;  the 1999 New York
Knicks.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They found a new way to win, and that's the New York story,''
explained Mitchell Moss, who directs the Taub Urban Research Center
at New York University. ``They couldn't win with their starters, so
they win with their bench. It's the New York resiliency.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Parker, 55, and the other lawyers at her firm were having
a tough time giving their season tickets away early this spring.
They joked that if people went to the game, the firm would buy them
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   So when her 11-year-old cousin, Dylan Watson, asked in April
whether she would take him to a playoff game, Ms. Parker felt she
had no choice but to let him down easy. ``I said, honey, I would
take you, but the Knicks aren't going to get into the playoffs,''
Ms. Parker, who lives on the Upper East Side, recalled telling the
boy. ``He said, `Yes they are, of course they are.' And now they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have faith,'' Dylan said with a shrug. ``I just kinda
knew.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in New York, now lives in Louisiana, and flew up for
Friday night's game in time to watch warmups. Now he can tell the
boys back in Baton Rouge all about how Latrell Sprewell touched him
on the way down to the court.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan was wearing Ewing's No. 33 tank top over a playoff T-shirt
as he spoke, his eyes sparkling between three orange and blue NYK
face decals.
</P>
<P>
   And he was carrying one of those orange towels everyone was
waving around, the ones that say, ``I believe.''

EDITORIAL: WHERE'S YOUR ID, KID? 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Sunday, June 13:
</P>
<P>
   So, it's Saturday night at the movies. The ticket seller is
taking forever, especially when the buyer has acne or green hair.
Somebody starts to mutter, and a few customers threaten to boycott
the theater's profitable golden popcorn. How long, then, will
theater managers maintain their pledge made to President Clinton
that they will demand photo ID's for young people trying to go to
R-rated movies? The answer is probably until the public starts
worrying about something other than violent entertainment and
Congress stops threatening to curb media violence with unworkable
and unconstitutional laws.
</P>
<P>
   Over three decades ago, the movie industry launched the rating
system it still uses, shoving sex, violence and rough language
under an all-purpose R label. Anyone under the age of 17 is barred
from an R-rated movie unless accompanied by an adult. Enforcement,
however, has always been uneven. In most rural areas, theater
owners tend their doors like surrogate parents. In urban areas,
theaters too often focus not on the buyer's years, but on the
number of dollars thrust through the ticket window.
</P>
<P>
   Despite photo ID's and parental admonitions, determined teens
will find a way to see ``The Matrix.'' The most persistent can
enlist a willing adult to chaperone. The most patient can wait for
the video. The wiliest might go to the nearest multi-theater
complex, buy a ticket to see ``Aladdin'' and then try to slip
next-door for Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, trying to enforce the code is a helpful step toward
sparing youngsters the blood-and-guts cinema that is often made for
global markets where explosions and gun battles need little
translation. Another important step came last weekend when Jack
Valenti, the Washington lobbyist for the major Hollywood studios,
advised film makers to cut ``gratuitous'' violence from their
pictures and to ask themselves, ``Is this the best I can do?'' That
is a very good question, not only for those who make movies, but
also for producers of video games, television and music.

 &HT;    Sickle-cell patient appears to be clear of disease
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An experimental procedure to cure sickle cell anemia
appears to have eliminated all traces of the disease from a
suburban Atlanta boy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the doctor who performed the procedure is not yet
claiming a cure, his experiment is being closely watched because it
could dramatically increase the number of potential blood donors
for the 70,000 victims of the blood disease. Sickle cell is an
inherited disease which strikes mostly black people and can be
fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Yeager, director of hematology, oncology and bone
marrow transplantation at Emory University School of Medicine,
performed the procedure on Keone Penn last December.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment, done at Atlanta's Egleston Children's Hospital,
was groundbreaking on three fronts: It marked the first time that a
sickle cell patient was treated with stem cell blood; the donor was
not related to the patient; and the donor blood was not a complete
match with Keone's _ only five of six key blood properties matched.
</P>
<P>
   But it has worked _ so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have hope for my kid, college and getting married, and
all the things people hope for for their kids,'' said Keone's
mother, Leslie Penn.
</P>
<P>
   Keone celebrated his new-found health _ and his 13 birthday _
Saturday at his home in Gwinnett County's Centerville community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it,'' Keone said, grinning under a new head of hair
grown out since chemotherapy. ``I'm talking, my heart's beating and
my brain is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, the only successful bone marrow transplants for
sickle cell sufferers have involved the patients' siblings or an
extremely rare marrow match found through a national registry.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager performed what was believed to be the world's first stem
cell transplant for a sickle cell patient, using a newborn's
umbilical cord blood, which is rich in the substance that grows new
bone marrow. It's a dangerous procedure that posed the potentially
fatal risk of an overwhelming infection attacking Keone's
suppressed immune system.
</P>
<P>
   But it looks like the risk paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks great, and spiritwise he's really up there,'' Yeager
said. ``And his cord blood (transplant) remains stable and fully
functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Yeager said he can't use the c-word _ cure _ quite yet.
``I want to, but medically I can't say it. We need a longer
observation time, six more months....There's always that slight
chance he may reject his new blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Sickle cell disease causes great pain as odd-shaped blood cells
get stuck in veins. It often triggers strokes, infections and
premature death.
</P>
<P>
   The disease was considered incurable until recently, when
doctors began experimenting with bone marrow transplants similar to
those given to cancer patients. Yeager performed the most risky
bone marrow procedure _ a stem cell transplant. The cells were
collected from the placenta and umbilical cord of an anonymous
woman and found through the New York Blood Center. Keone had been
unable to find a close enough bone marrow match from his
half-sister or from the national donor registry.
</P>
<P>
   The disease was devastating for Keone. He suffered a stroke at
age 5, excruciating pain, numerous infections and needed monthly
blood transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   Keone received the stem cell blood Dec. 11 after undergoing 10
days of chemotherapy to kill his own bone marrow that contained the
sickled cells. The cord blood gave him a whole new system of red
cells, white cells and platelets.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering for his birthday, friends and family rejoiced in the
news that his body now shows no sign of the blood disorder. ``This
is a wonderful celebration,'' his mother said. ``We have so many
things to be thankful for. We're so blessed.''

 &HT;    Kosovo's future? Bosnia-Herzegovina enters fifth year of
enforced peace
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Four years after the end of a
brutal war, Bosnia-Herzegovina and its capital city of Sarajevo
have come far toward healing the wounds.
</P>
<P>
   But as the international community begins looking at problems
elsewhere in the region and the world, much of the Dayton Peace
Accord that ended the war in Bosnia remains a work in progress,
with all sides from the war still objecting to some of the
provisions in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a peace agreement, but at the same time it was a
declaration of separation,'' Sarajevo Mayor Rasin Gacanovic told a
goodwill delegation from Dayton, Ohio, last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sarajevo is still dealing with emotional and physical scars that
printed words on the Dayton Peace Accord are having difficulty
healing.
</P>
<P>
   A flood of international aid has come to Bosnia since the war's
end, and armed United Nations peacekeepers move about the cities
and countrysides, creating odd juxtapositions for Bosnians in daily
life.
</P>
<P>
   As well-dressed Sarajevans bustle through their downtown
commercial district, they must make room for a dizzying array of
international aid organizations and regular appearances by the
peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   The international workers are immediately obvious, driving in
the largest, newest cars or rugged sport utility vehicles. Local
residents' tend toward small, European cars that can more easily
dart through the city's narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the only weapons visible in Sarajevo are the
automatic rifles of camouflage-wearing peacekeepers. Their constant
presence has begun to aggravate some city residents.
</P>
<P>
   For people who lived through three years of war, just the sight
of camouflage and guns brings on a momentary panic.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Graconivic spoke of no aggravation, just disappointment
Bosnia-Herzegovina needed to turn to outside help at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately our country did not have the necessary forces
and it was necessary for a third-party to take part in the peace
plan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarajevans know when their three-person presidency is meeting at
its offices in town. It's when Italian troops drive jeeps, mounted
with machine guns, onto the streets in front of the federal
government building.
</P>
<P>
   One Muslim, one Croat and one Serb sit in each seat of the
presidency, and continued tension and ill will from the war between
the ethnic groups brings in the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Haris Silajdzic, one of two prime ministers, said the situation
has become almost unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just impossible to live this way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the war are still heavily on the minds of
Sarajevans.
</P>
<P>
   Gacanovic used the visit by the Dayton delegation to repeat his
call for people who committed atrocities to be brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no unification without having all the war criminals
charged and tried,'' Gacanovic said. ``We know that justice will be
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a pleasant evening on a hillside patio last week,
beneath the spreading branches of rose bushes and grape vines, a
retired Sarajevan couple talked matter-of-factly about the war.
Many Sarajevans do. The war was such a consuming part of their
lives, there is no way not to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The father could not gesture and talk about his beautifully kept
vegetable garden without recounting the number of mortar shells
that landed in it. Scars are showed. Some residents carry pieces of
shrapnel still in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The hills of the city make the region beautiful, but it is from
there that shells and bullets rained down for three years.
Residents said the beautiful hills that help give Sarajevo its
identity had suddenly become the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Residents recall vividly the fluttering sound incoming shells
made when they were likely to pass overhead. The ones coming
straight in near you made a piercing, high-pitched whine.
</P>
<P>
   Several U.S. officials said the Bosnians are being urged to
implement the major elements of the Dayton Peace Accord because the
commitment international forces have made to the country is
unlikely to last forever.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military officials claim the ethnic Serb part of the
country, the Republika Srpska, is in political and military
disarray. But it still maintains its own armed forces and has a
huge superiority in artillery over the rest of the country. The
Yugoslavian army and Bosnian Serbs used that artillery to earn what
military success they achieved during the war.
</P>
<P>
   There are millions of mines still scattered along what was the
final border between the armed forces when the war ended in 1995,
but eliminating them is going so slowly as to be of little use.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 3,500 years this sector will be clear of mines,'' U.S. Army
Col. Mike Milano said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's old downtown section is once again brimming with
cafes and fashion boutiques crammed into storefronts that still
have bullet holes and evidence of shelling. Couples stroll through
the area, young couples holding hands and young adults wheeling
baby carriages.
</P>
<P>
   But the city would be having a difficult time of things even if
the first mortar shell had never fallen. The country is still
trying to shake off communism, which was in place for 45 years
before petering out a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism has already created some of the conditions that are
reported to be out of control in the former Soviet Union. There are
signs of great wealth and even a middle class, but children beg on
the streets, asking for a Deutschmark for wiping a car's windshield
or ``standing guard'' over a car in the airport parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   For all the new wealth has refurbished and built anew, the
majority of the buildings in the city still are pock-marked with
huge scars left by mortar blasts.
</P>
<P>
   The economy is down, and there is little sign of direct
investment by U.S. companies. One senior state department official
said companies like McDonald's have tried to come in but pulled out
after being blocked by bureaucracy and cronyism in the Sarajevan
government.
</P>
<P>
   Officially the unemployment rate stands at 70 percent, and
locals say joblessness is a problem, but that many people work for
cash and never report their wages to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Residents repeatedly apologize for their rutted, rumble-strip
roads.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs of work. Buildings throughout the region
have been rebuilt, out to the smallest distant village. In
Sarajevo, scaffolding and cranes dot the skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the war's message _ and a sign that underlying tension
still exists _ hits Bosnians every day as they pass through their
damaged city.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall of the National Library, which Serb shelling burned
and destroyed early in the war, is posted a sign meant to remind
what ``Serb criminals'' did to the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not forget,'' the sign reads. ``Remember and warn.''

NEW YORKERS ARE HAVING A FEEDING FRENZY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ky.)  (lb) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The astonishing explosion of New York City's
specialty food markets began as a gustatory version of Genesis: In
the beginning there was Balducci's, Dean &AMP; DeLuca and Zabar's. And
they were good. And culinary darkness no longer blighted the face
of Manhattan. And the merchants said: Let there be more.
</P>
<P>
   And so there was Vinegar Factory and Gourmet Garage and Eli's
Manhattan and Healthy Pleasures and Grace's Marketplace and Agata &AMP;
Valentina and Garden of Eden Farmers Markets and Amish Manhattan
Farmers Markets and a grand mitosis of Greenmarkets.
</P>
<P>
   And they were good. But how much of a good thing can you have
before it becomes, well, bad? Is the city now the world's capital
of gourmet glut?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just so much stuff for sale, it can be really
confusing,'' said Chris Sadoff, a violinist who has lived on West
73rd Street for two decades and has watched her neighborhood become
a microcosm of the city's galloping gastronomy. ``Who are these
people living on caviar all the time? I'm not sure why all these
stores are opening.''
</P>
<P>
   She was peering into the new addition at Fairway on Broadway and
74th Street, now the epicenter of a fiercely competitive
seven-block food fight on the West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks the market, which has expanded three times since
1975, will complete its incursion into the two-story space that was
once the no man's land between no-frills Fairway and its primordial
rival, Citarella, where fish, meats, poultry and produce are
arrayed like jewelry on two floors at the corner of West 75th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Only 60 paces to the south of Fairway, Food Emporium _ perhaps
aspiring to capitalize on the hungry hordes from Donald Trump's
Riverside South development _ established its 22nd upscale
beachhead in December. The store even has a
green-and-white-uniformed doorman with a gold-braided cap who calls
cabs for customers. He directs shoppers to the sleek escalator that
takes them down to the anti-Fairway: a cheerful 21,000-square-foot
basement space.
</P>
<P>
   And to the north, plugging the Broadway gap between Citarella
and the legendary Zabar's on West 80th Street, the unlegendary
Westside Supermarket gives customers yet another shopping option at
the corner of West 77th Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the bull-market, fin-de-siecle rush to excess, the city's
gourmet generals have been seizing strategic territory.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the perpetually expanding Fairway leapfrogged north
to establish a bastion at 132nd Street and 12th Avenue, Citarella
opened a satellite across town from its main store, at 75th Street
and Third Avenue; Citarella has leased another space in Grand
Central Station.
</P>
<P>
   And Gourmet Garage _ the warehouse-style purveyor that provides
specialty foods to 180 restaurants, including Le Cirque 2000 and
the Four Seasons _ has cloned itself in four Manhattan locations
since 1992. ``We are expanding aggressively, and our plan is to do
two or three new stores a year,'' said John Gottfried, a partner,
who said he has made offers on two new properties.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Zabar's Vinegar Factory on East 91st Street, which was
originally opened by Gourmet Garage and taken over by its landlord,
Zabar, has siblings at Eli's Manhattan on Third Avenue at 80th
Street, and E.A.T. on Madison Avenue at 80th.
</P>
<P>
   Balducci's has planned to establish suburban satellites.
Balducci family feuds led to a diaspora and the establishment of
the high-end Agata &AMP; Valentina at 79th Street and First Avenue
(which recently doubled its space) as well as the upscale Grace's
Marketplace at 71st Street and Third Avenue, which also has
expanded and added a butcher.
</P>
<P>
   Whole Foods Market has leased 40,000 square feet of space on
Seventh Avenue and 24th Street for a blockbuster organic food
market. Healthy Pleasures on University Place in the Village, which
claims to be the city's largest natural-foods store, has opened a
satellite in SoHo on Broome Street.
</P>
<P>
   Amish Manhattan Farmers Market in Hell's Kitchen opened a
sibling on East 45th Street near Third Avenue, and just this month
unveiled another at Cedar Street. And the two Garden of Eden
Farmers Markets, in Gramercy Park and Chelsea, are planning an
outpost on West 14th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The food retailing frenzy leaves some shoppers all epicured out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have five places now where I can buy cheese instead of
two,'' said Nora Ephron, the director and writer, who lives in the
Zabar's orbit and who shot scenes there for her most recent film,
``You've Got Mail.'' ``At first I thought, well, someone will go
out of business, but apparently there is no telling how much food
you can sell.''
</P>
<P>
   While many consumers are benefiting from runaway variety, new
challenges are being posed by the New York's superabundance of
brie. ``It is very easy to go into one of these places and walk out
with a small bag that costs you $100,'' said Tim Zagat, whose
latest New York City Marketplace Survey, an overview of 1,360 food
purveyors, has just been published.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hardy specialty-food shoppers have refined their coping
strategies. Especially scorned by the store owners are the
bargain-hunting cherry pickers, who ``go for sale items,'' said one
store manager. ``We don't make any money on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the uptown strategy. David Brody, an entomologist
at the American Museum of Natural History, walks north along ``the
strip,'' as he calls it, heading from the Food Emporium to Zabar's.
``I check the price, I see what's fresh, what looks good. It's
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrarily, Mildred Grant favors the downtown search, starting
at 75th Street. ``I just start at Citarella and work my way
south,'' she said, winding up at Food Emporium, which is owned by
Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co., ``for sales and staples.'' She
smiled. ``I was born to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   There are even those so victimized by gourmet glut that they
totally opt out of high-end shopping. ``It's too crazy here,'' said
Nina Rhodes, a West Side resident for 20 years, as she glanced past
the sidewalk flower stand to the frenzy within Fairway. ``I just go
to the A&AMP;P on West End Avenue and 70th, where it's not so hectic.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, shoppers are not only sought after but studied.
``You need a population of about 14,000 upper-income people to
support one of these stores,'' said Gottfried of Gourmet Garage.
With their high-margin offerings and prepared foods, specialty
markets can soar: Their competitors estimate that Zabar's and
Fairway, only six blocks apart, each take in $50 million in revenue
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the current market proliferation is surprising, given the
hard realities of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Yearly retail rents of $100 to $150 a square foot in Manhattan
make opening new stores prohibitively expensive in the fickle,
labor-intensive grocery business. Worse, experts say that for every
10 feet of selling space, a store needs about 3 feet of
nonproductive storage and preparation space.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, merchants cannot throw in a few tubs of Kumomoto
oysters just anywhere and reap a windfall. Gottfried estimated that
the market for Manhattan specialty food stores is ``about 80
percent saturated, but there are still neighborhoods that haven't
been penetrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, the city's retail specialty-food economy, which
analysts estimate at close to $300 million, ``is incredibly
competitive,'' said Saul Zabar, president of Zabar's, the
gastronomic landmark that has been around since 1936. ``We are
always running scared here, and we have to be on our toes more than
ever. That said, all I know is that we are selling substantially
more fish and prepared foods than we did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the turf battles can get sort of ugly (Fairway and
Citarella actually engaged in an awning war this year), even fierce
competitors see an advantage in proximity. ``We overlap with
Fairway's customers,'' said Mindy Birnbaum, a spokeswoman for
Citarella, when asked about the Fairway expansion. ``So if more
people come to the block, then we're bound to benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Citarella's archrival was no less optimistic. ``I think there is
an infinite market for the good operators,'' said Howard Glickberg,
an owner of Fairway. ``The Red Apples, the Sloan's, they draw 90
percent of their customers from a four-block area. But we draw from
all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the specialty merchants are such a draw that bus
companies are mounting day trips for food worshippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first stop is Zabar's,'' said Greg Abbott, a spokesman for
Dattco in New Britain, Conn., which conducts a ``Noshing Tour'' of
Manhattan 20 times a year. After about 50 foodies per busload have
descended on Zabar's, they head back into their red-and-white MCI
tour bus and proceed to Balducci's. That is followed by a visit to
Guss' Lower East Side Pickles, a tour of Chinatown markets and
finally a stroll through Little Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But academics are traveling even greater distances. ``My
students ooh and aah in these markets,'' said Nancy Graham, an
assistant professor in the hospitality department of Morehead State
University in Morehead, Ky. She and her daughter stood near the
$2.99-a-pound New Zealand pears at Fairway and explained that they
had brought 13 of their hotel students to New York to research the
exotic markets of the natives, starting at Balducci's and working
their way up to Zabar's.
</P>
<P>
   Given such interest, some insist that New York markets are
poised to conquer the nation. ``Whatever food you may want in Sioux
City, Iowa, you can have it delivered in less than 24 hours,
through mail order and the Internet,'' Zagat said. ``Soon every
major store in New York will be online and available to the entire
country.''

CHECKETTS MIGHT BE ROOTING FOR VAN GUNDY AS A GENERAL MANAGER,
TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy has dedicated his professional life to coaching,
preferring to remain on the sideline and away from the corporate
offices of the team. But as his stature grows in New York, one
wonders if the Knicks would dangle the dual role of general manager
and coach in front of him after the team's stunning post-season
run.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ernie Grunfeld was reassigned by Madison Square Garden
president Dave Checketts in April, Checketts has taken over
day-to-day duties of the team. After Friday night's clinching Game
6 victory over Indiana, Checketts admitted to being caught up in
the emotion of the moment enough to join in the post-game chanting.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Checketts insisted he would wait until the season to
deal with Van Gundy's job status, as both parties agreed to do
earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the image of the Garden president mouthing the words, ``Jeff
Van Gun-Dee!'' along with nearly 20,000 others, cannot help but
speak volumes.
</P>
<P>
   As the Knicks head for San Antonio for the league championship
series this week, perhaps the ill will between the two is
subsiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tonight, you know, if you want me to make a definitive
statement, it's not about that,'' Checketts said after the Knicks'
90-82 victory. ``It is about the fact that we're working very well
together, we're communicating. We both agree: we're going to sit
down after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts entrusted Ed Tapscott, the assistant general manager,
to take care of scouting for the draft and other personnel details.
Tapscott should be in the running for the general manager's job _
especially if Van Gundy, whom he has worked with for most of the
last decade, is retained as coach.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of Checketts remaining in that role should not
be ruled out, either.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Van Gundy can take the team to its first championship in
26 years, he may be in line for not only a long-term extension but
also more say and power in organizational matters.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it may be the only way he would want to be retained by
the Knicks. Negotiating the maze of politics in the Garden was
something he detested this past season, his feud with Grunfeld over
personnel the obvious indicator.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, in lieu of all the underhanded behavior at the
Garden this season _ some of which Van Gundy has privately admitted
taking part in _ would the Knicks be willing to give Van Gundy that
kind of authority?
</P>
<P>
   Would Checketts' superiors at Cablevision, some of whom have
openly questioned in staff meetings how the coach runs his team,
give Van Gundy a long-term deal worth in the neighborhood of $20
million?
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the coach who figured to be out of a job less than
a month ago is now sitting pretty on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   A berth in the finals guaranteed the final year of Van Gundy's
contract, and thus insured him of collecting $6 million over the
next two seasons regardless of whether the club plans to relieve
him of his duties.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the $2 million he will receive as coach, the club is
forced to pick up an option year worth $3.5 million based on a
contract clause that stipulated the money must be paid if Van Gundy
guided the Knicks to the championship round.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy can also earn another $300,000 guaranteed if the
Knicks win the title.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the emotional satisfaction transcended the financial
reward on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt like he just had won the lottery, Van Gundy
said: ``No. I won't even dignify that.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorce in Orlando
</P>
<P>
   When Doc Rivers was interviewing for the Orlando Magic head
coach's job before accepting it last Monday, he made one point
clear to management: Before the team moved Anfernee Hardaway, the
disgruntled point guard, he wanted to sit down with him and gauge
his feelings about remaining in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   If Hardaway felt his relationship with the franchise could be
mended, Rivers would back the former All-Star's return. But
Hardaway beat him to the punch on Friday, exercising an escape
clause in his contract to become a free agent July 1.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Magic must perform a sign-and-trade deal with
another team to obtain any compensation for Hardaway. If he does
not cooperate and decides to sign with Toronto, the Clippers or
Chicago _ the teams with the kind of salary-cap room to pay him
handsomely _ the Magic will have lost their second franchise player
in four years for nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   Losing Shaquille O'Neal was a crime. Losing Hardaway may be the
best thing. Regardless of whether the Magic gets anything in
return, it would rid itself not only of his burdensome salary but
also the petulance and inconsistency of his past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   According to one Eastern Conference team official, Rivers
informally surveyed former teammates and coaches of Hardaway and
found a consensus: Hardaway was difficult to coach and play with,
and coddling wouldn't change that.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a possible sign-and-trade-deal for Boston's Ron Mercer
and Kenny Anderson, the Magic is thinking about trying to coax Gary
Payton away from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disrespect to Penny, but it would take more than him to pry
Gary from Seattle,'' one Western Conference team official said.
``They're going to have to come back with much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton is watching what the Sonics do in the off season to
improve the team before demanding a trade. Hersey Hawkins may be
one of several players, along with draft picks, that Seattle
packages in an attempt to lure a legitimate big man. The Lakers,
Minnesota and Houston are all interested in Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's situation is he's sitting back and seeing what the
Sonics do,'' Aaron Goodwin, Payton's agent, said. ``He wants to
retire in Seattle, but only time will tell if that's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker's stock has fallen after a miserable, injury-riddled
season with the Sonics. As one of the few prized free agents this
summer, he may be on his way out as well.
</P>
<P>
   Around the League  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the Don't Worry About Paying Your Dues file: Doc Rivers,
37, was recently asked why he became such a hot commodity the last
few months. ``They hear me on TV, that's why,'' he said of his
Turner Sports analyst's job. ``That was Chuck Daly's advice. When I
retired and was thinking about taking an assistant job, Chuck said:
`Well, if you want to be a head coach, I think more people will
hear you on TV than they'll see you sitting next to the head coach.
He was right.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: ALBANY FORGETS HOW TO PRETEND TO LEGISLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York state Legislature has always posed a challenge to
people who believe in the inevitable progression of human history.
But critics who have called it impervious to change are wrong.
Lately the system has gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   The state has long led the nation in overdue budgets while
bringing up the rear in ethics regulation. But now, the legislative
paralysis is accompanied by a veritable frenzy of campaign
fund-raising. If a committee holds a meeting in which a bill is
actually discussed, it is a day to remember. But if the chairman
takes a break from legislative business to walk across the street
and host a fund-raising party for the lobbyists who work his
committee, it is par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   These parties have grown so pervasive that it scares people.
``When I came here in 1984, there were occasional fund-raisers, but
now some nights you have 18,'' says Blair Horner of the New York
Public Interest Research Group. In the past, lobbyists at least
honored the fiction that there was no direct connection between
their willingness to pay hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars to
eat cocktail weenies with lawmakers and the legislative process
itself. But now, members report that they are being pressed for
favors right over the hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   ``The niceties are falling apart,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Martin Connor. ``I don't think anybody's selling their vote, but
you also aren't supposed to give the appearance of selling your
vote.'' There is a growing fear that somebody  &UR; will &LR;  eventually get
caught up in an influence-peddling scandal, particularly since
legislators have gone for months without being paid, under a new
law that stops their salaries once the budget is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   Albany has always been a highly partisan culture in which
individual lawmakers are expected to follow the party leader. That
works fine if voters can identify the party that is making the
decisions and throw it out when things go badly. But over the last
few decades, the legislative leaders, armed with the latest
computers, have perfected a gerrymandering that makes most seats
safe for whoever happens to be occupying them. That gave the
Republicans a death grip on the state Senate and the Democrats a
death grip on the Assembly, throwing the place into perpetual
stalemate. Figuring out who was really responsible for anything
became a puzzle even for Capitol regulars. The leaders became
stronger in their ability to control the party troops and to raise
money from lobbyists, even as they lost power to actually pass
serious legislation. Now, the Legislature revolves around raising
money to win elections in which the outcome is already assured. The
public has long since lost interest in a process it cannot
comprehend, and the lawmakers are performing for an audience of a
few thousand people _ themselves, the lobbyists, the staff and a
handful of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The rituals of a real, functioning democracy are slowly falling
away. Lobbyists and special-interest groups still occasionally drag
their constituents up to the Capitol to buttonhole legislators,
because they have always done it. But more and more of them simply
stick to working the fund-raisers. ``They don't even bother to have
people write letters,'' says one committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Some legislators still slave away on major initiatives, like
Assemblyman Alexander Grannis of Manhattan, who points with pride
to bills he has worked on this year, including auto-insurance
reform and an ``integrity in government act'' that would ban
political fund-raisers in Albany while the Legislature is in
session. But he admits that the state Senate has no interest in the
insurance bill, and that his own leaders will never allow lobbying
reform to make it to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Grannis, a 25-year veteran, came to Albany with the
post-Watergate generation, which was actually interested in
politics. The newer members, even the most dedicated, know that the
way to rise in the system is to raise more money than your
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, although himself a former legislator, has no
respect for the legislative culture. He ignored a deal between the
Assembly and Senate on last year's budget, vetoing a raft of items,
most of which were Democratic priorities. He refuses to rule out
doing the same thing this year, and the Democrats have no real
comeback except delay. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver can hardly
appeal to the public, which has long since tuned out on the whole
incomprehensible mess.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are a few state laws governing health care
that expire soon, which the governor wants to see renewed.
Eventually, when time has run out, Silver may be able to use that
leverage to get a deal, and the Legislature will be able to go
officially out of session with the traditional flurry of
special-interest bills that always get passed under the cover of
the rush to adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   Albany is like a foundering boat, held together only by the
barnacles. There are probably enough barnacles in place to get the
state through another year, but what is really needed is a new
hull.

ONE KILLED AND EIGHT INJURED ON AMUSEMENT-PARK RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 17-year-old girl was killed and eight other people
were injured late Friday night when an amusement park ride in Coney
Island malfunctioned, hurling the girl from her seat and pinning
her between one of the ride's cars and the tracks below, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl who was killed, Nadine Caban, had been on a fast-moving
circular ride called the Himalaya about 11:20 p.m. when a coupling
between cars broke, causing violent gyrations that threw her from
the ride, said Jerry Varson, a Police Department spokesman. She
died an hour later at Lutheran Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caban, who had a 10-month-old son, was planning to attend
hairdressing school this summer, her sister Elsie said. She added
that Ms. Caban loved Coney Island and the rides, and had chosen the
Himalaya on Friday specifically because she thought it was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Eight other passengers, many of them part of a group attending a
birthday party at the amusement park, suffered minor injuries in
the accident and were treated at Coney Island Hospital before being
released, Varson said.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, which is owned by Norman Kaufman, had passed a city
inspection on March 27 and was given a certificate to operate
through the end of the summer, according to Paul Wein, a spokesman
for the Buildings Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ride was closed briefly when inspectors found
electrical violations in 1984, Wein said that Friday's accident was
the first malfunction ever reported on the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still investigating but we do know that the car did
come loose from the track,'' he said. ``We have inspectors out
there now and that part of the park is closed to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   The Himalaya, tucked between slow-moving children's rides and
more ominous-sounding rides such as the Cyclone and the Jumbo Jet,
takes riders on a fast circular route, undulating and sometimes
reversing along a track banked by snowy mountain backdrops, as
speakers blare rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   It is a popular and exciting ride, according to those who had
been on the Himalaya at the time of the accident, some of whom had
already taken the trip once or twice on Friday night. But it was
also known as a safe ride, less scary than some others. No one ever
expected to be hurt, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just this fun ride that keeps going around and around,
pulling you one way and that way, to the beat of the music,''
explained Ismerelda Cruz, who had been in the car immediately in
front of Ms. Caban's. ``Something just happened.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Cruz, 19, said she and eight others had gone to the
amusement park to celebrate the birthday of a friend, and part of
the fun had been riding the Himalaya. Shortly before 11:30 p.m.,
they decided to ride it again.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Ms. Cruz said, she and her friend Josephine Garcia
stepped into the car that later hurled Ms. Caban to her death. But
they moved to the one directly in front because they saw a Puerto
Rican flag tucked into the side of the car.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caban took their place. She had gone to the park with her
two sisters and the fiance of one of the sisters. She was alone in
the car. Her sisters, Elsie, 19, and Magalie, 23, got in about two
cars back. The ride's announcer was playing loud salsa music and
yelling for Puerto Rican riders to let themselves be heard. The
ride whirled faster and faster, and then started to reverse course,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly it looked like the ceiling caved in and I ran onto
the platform and yelled, `Stop the ride, stop the ride,''' said
Elsie Caban's fiance, Edwin Oyola, 21, who was standing with others
waiting to get on the Himalaya. ``But it took too long and the ride
just kept going. When they finally stopped it, everyone jumped off,
but we noticed that Nadine was missing. Then we saw her hanging
from the ride about 8 feet from the ground. Everyone was
panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and paramedics were able to dislodge Ms. Caban, who
was trapped between the track and one of the cars, witnesses said.
They said she was conscious, but covered with blood. ``She kept
saying, `What's happened to me, what's happened to me?''' said her
sister Elsie. ``They got her and were taking her to the hospital
and she didn't want me to leave her side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night Nadine told me she didn't feel well and didn't want
to go on any dangerous rides,'' Elsie Caban said Saturday. ``She
said: `Let's just go the Himalaya. Its a safe ride.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been on it so many times before,'' Elsie Caban said
before trailing off in tears outside the family's home in Brooklyn.
``She was so kind-hearted and outgoing; nothing stopped her from
doing what she wanted to do. She lived to have fun and that's what
we had gone to do.''

CONFERENCE CENTERS ARE CONSIDERED FOR GOVERNORS ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city is exploring more than a dozen development
proposals for Governors Island, the defunct Coast Guard Base in New
York Harbor that President Clinton promised to sell for a dollar if
New York came up with a publicly beneficial use.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the proposals involve hotels and conference centers, and
both New York University and Columbia University are interested in
establishing conference centers there, Deputy Mayor Randy Levine
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Modern Art have
expressed preliminary interest in setting up satellites, he said,
and Tivoli Gardens, the Copenhagen amusement park, has submitted
plans for an old-fashioned amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serious proposals that could produce revenue are starting to
come in,'' said Levine, who presided over a meeting of a task force
of government officials on Friday to consider some of the
proposals. The city wants private business to pay the estimated $30
million annual cost of maintaining the 173-acre island.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, city officials insisted that only a casino could
generate enough revenue to accomplish this goal, but it dropped the
idea after concluding that the state was unlikely to revise its
laws to permit casino gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said that one proposal the city was examining closely
came from a Boston developer, Corcoran Gennison. It proposes
turning a large rectangular building in the middle of the island
into a conference center and a family hotel. Its plan would include
housing and classrooms for NYU and Columbia and an outdoor
sculpture garden for the Guggenheim. The Guggenheim would also
build a series of self-contained indoor exhibits, each with a
single piece of monumental sculpture by such artists as Richard
Serra.
</P>
<P>
   Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, who is lobbying for the
Boston company, said the plan would cover the cost of maintaining
the island. In addition, he said, the company would pay an
unspecified rent and $17 million a year in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Tivoli Gardens spokesman Howard Rubenstein said the Danish
amusement company _ which has discussed a possible joint venture
with the Boston company _ wants to build low-key amusement rides,
including an old-fashioned wooden roller coaster. The plan calls
for the use of cobblestones rather than concrete, incandescent
lights instead of neon, and live music. ``They're going to try to
provide a respite from city life in a garden setting,'' Rubenstein
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are fears, however, that the federal government may sell
the island before before the city comes up with a plan. Six weeks
ago Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., proposed selling the island to
finance crop insurance programs. The government has placed a $500
million value on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless something smart is done in the near future, it could
flounder, and there will be an attempt in Congress to sell it,''
said Michael Waterman, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, however, discounts the risk that Congress will sell the
island. But he acknowledged that he feels ``a high sense of
urgency'' because the federal government may retain control if
something is not done.
</P>
<P>
   But the city is not alone in plotting the island's future. The
Battery Park City Authority has its own task force of state
officials, and it has hired consultants to do a financial analysis
as a first step toward exploring whether the authority or another
newly created state authority should operate the island, said
Authority Chairman James Gill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right there,'' he said, in arguing that the island
should be given to Battery Park City. ``It's just a stone's
throw.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the advantage to this plan is that the state could
subsidize the island's early development, and then run it in the
same manner as Battery Park City. As in lower Manhattan, the state
would give the city whatever rent was left after expenses, he said.
He suggested that the historic northern part of the island could be
made into a tourist attraction modeled after Colonial Williamsburg
in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Gill's idea may not be the key to quickly solving the island's
troubled fate. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has adamantly opposed
expansion of state authority in the past. Levine said he would
prefer a more equal and informal arrangement, like the one
governing the new Hudson River Park. The park is run by a trust in
which the city and the state have equal voting power.

 FOR DUVAL, PRACTICE IS A No. 1 PRIORITY  
 (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Duval, the world's No. 1 ranked golfer, spends far more
time practicing his chipping and putting than practicing his
driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``My short game saved me my first year,'' Duval said. ``I left
the West Coast my rookie year third on the money list. I learned
then what it could do, how much it could help you, how much it
would pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Duval's favorite putting drills is to place four balls
around the hole, anywhere from 3 to 5 feet from the cup. Then he
will force himself to make anywhere from 12 to 20 in succession. If
he misses a putt, he starts over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell yourself, `I've got to go around this hole four
times,' and if you miss, you've got to start over,'' Duval said.
``You hate missing that fourth one on the fourth leg because you
don't want to stand out there all day. But it teaches you to keep
concentrating.''
</P>
<P>
   For lag putts of 40 feet or more, Duval practices by standing on
the green and putting toward the fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get the ball to stop on the fringe of the green
without rolling off,'' Duval said. ``If you can do that, you've got
the right speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has enjoyed some hot streaks with his putter, Duval
thinks the key to making putts is getting himself in birdie
position with his approach shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think getting on a roll with your putter is more accurately
described as getting on a roll with your iron play,'' Duval said.
``Nobody is going to make seven 30-footers in a row. But you can
make a 4-footer, then a 15-footer, then an 8-footer, then a
6-footer. If you keep getting it that close, you can get on a
roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval grew up playing a lot of golf with his father, Bob Duval,
who is on the Senior PGA Tour. Playing with older players, Duval
learned early that there was a difference between playing for fun
and playing with something at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not encouraging kids to gamble, but if you play golf, it's
good to play for a Coke, a dime or whatever,'' he said. ``Just play
for something. Believe me, it makes a difference. You don't want to
lose, and it adds a little pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players use the lettering on the golf ball to help align
their putts, but Duval does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see white when I look down,'' Duval said. ``For one
thing, if you try to line up the lettering, it takes longer and
makes you a slower putter. Second, I don't think you can line it up
exactly right all the time. If you line it up wrong, do you start
over? Do you keep doing it until you get it right? Or do you just
finally hit it?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get ready to putt, first I read it, the break and the
speed. Then I make sure I get the putter flat, what I call flush,
make sure it's square to the ground. I don't want the toe up or the
heel up. Once I get my line picked out, I try to pick it out quick.
I think about the speed and try to putt it on that line.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens when Duval goes into a putting slump?
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I get the ball too far forward in my stance,'' Duval
said. ``It just works its way in there. You've got to move the ball
back, be uncomfortable for a couple of days until it's comfortable
again.''
</P>
<P>
   When Duval was a child, he used to stand on the green and putt,
imagining that he was standing over a putt to win the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I missed, I'd give myself a do-over,'' Duval said,
laughing. ``They don't do that out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Duval believes in positive thinking, which showed when
he was asked to recall the most important putt he had ever missed.
Duval paused for a long time before answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember,'' he said. ``By no means am I saying I've
made every big putt. But I try to forget the bad stuff. That's
important.'' &QL;

(ATTN: N.C.)  
 BIG ON SHORT GAME: PUTTING AT PINEHURST COULD BE DECISIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The speaker was David Duval. The subject was putting.
</P>
<P>
   As Duval held his trusted putter in his hand during a recent
conversation, he was asked about this week's U.S. Open, which is
being played for the first time at Pinehurst's revered No. 2 course
beginning Thursday. Duval has never played a tournament at
Pinehurst, a course characterized by unusual greens that drop off
on all sides, like bowls turned upside down. But when it comes to
making putts, Duval believes that some basics never change, that it
is important to take the same attitude to Pinehurst in North
Carolina, to Augusta National in Georgia or to anywhere else in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this level, I'd say confidence would be 96 to 97 percent of
putting,'' said Duval, who is the world's No. 1-ranked player but
will be trying to play in the Open less than a week after burning
his right thumb and forefinger in a home accident.
</P>
<P>
   Duval said confidence is born of practice. ``It comes from hard
work,'' he said. ``It comes from facing different situations and
making putts. It comes from knowing you've worked on the right
things, so when you get under the gun, you can execute what you've
practiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be a good putter and make a lot of putts, but can you
do it when you need to do it on Sunday to win a tournament? There's
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipping and putting will be the keys to winning at Pinehurst.
Approach shots that are not accurately placed will roll off the
green into minivalleys. Everyone will be required to chip and putt
a lot. And there are so many hidden breaks in Pinehurst's greens,
reading some putts will be like reading a book written with
invisible ink.
</P>
<P>
   This U.S. Open will be different from most, because instead of
hacking out of deep rough around the greens, players will have a
chance to be creative with their short games. You will see putts
over mounds from off the green. You will see a variety of chip
shots. And because so many pins will be in difficult locations, you
will see many nerve-racking putts, both short and long. Some will
be for birdies, many to save par, others simply to avoid
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's putting stroke will be under pressure, but that has
become a way of life. Any golfer would love to crush the ball the
way Tiger Woods does, or hit irons with the precision of Jose Maria
Olazabal. But ask players what they have to do to win, and they
usually answer, ``I hope I'll make a few putts.'' With talent so
deep among the world's top players, putting often makes the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many players are so equal,'' said Davis Love III, one of
the favorites this week. ``Over the course of a year, lowering your
putting one-hundredth of a stroke makes a huge difference. If you
say, `I'm going to improve one putt a week over the course of a
week,' you're talking about a huge difference. And one putt a round
can take you from 150th on the money list into the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting one more green a round helps, but you've still got to
make the putt. That's where you have the biggest room for
improvement, and that's also where you see guys disappear quickly,
when their putting stroke goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Go to any tournament, and you will see players gathered at the
practice green, hitting putt after putt. Some will be doing drills,
like hitting putts between two tees. Others will try different
styles, such as the conventional style used by Duval, or the
left-hand-low, or cross-handed, style favored by Vijay Singh, Fred
Couples and Jim Furyk. And on some occasions, you will see someone
using a long putter, as Rocco Mediate does. Mediate dismisses the
notion that using a long putter is easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was easier, everybody would use it,'' Mediate said. ``It
takes the strain off my back and allows me to practice more. But
the truth is, it's just me. I feel the most comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But gaining a comfort level on Pinehurst's greens will be
difficult for everyone. The last professional event played there
was the 1992 Tour Championship, and many players have never been
there.
</P>
<P>
   One of those looking forward to this tournament is Dave Pelz,
author of the recently released ``Dave Pelz's Short Game Bible''
(Broadway Books), who has worked with more than 40 players at his
short game school, including U.S. Open defending champion Lee
Janzen and other major winners like Paul Azinger, Mark Brooks,
Steve Elkington, Tom Kite, Payne Stewart, Ian Woosnam and Singh.
Pelz knows how critical the short game and putting will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a short game paradise,'' Pelz said of Pinehurst. ``The
good putters will still make putts, because the greens are in great
shape. However, local knowledge is key. I'm encouraging every
player I've spoken with to get there early, because you just won't
believe what the ball will do on some of these greens until you see
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I like Colin Montgomerie's game, I'm a little
worried that coming over from Europe, he won't have enough time to
adapt to these greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name his favorite putters in the game today, Pelz gave
a short list of Duval, Janzen, Stewart, Brad Faxon and Loren
Roberts. And Pelz believes there is an excellent chance that either
Janzen or Duval will be holding the U.S. Open trophy next Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duval is putting about as well as anybody at any time,'' said
Pelz, who has done numerous studies on the short game. ``And while
everyone knows that Janzen is an assassin when he has a chance to
win, people overlook the fact that he's a pretty good putter all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever putts best this week could hold the key to winning a
major championship. And Duval, looking for his first major
championship, knows exactly the kind of putt he wants. ``A
one-footer, uphill, to win any tournament,'' he said, smiling.
``That's my favorite putt.'' &QL;

 &HT;    APACHE PILOTS GET FIRST LOOK INSIDE KOSOVO AND SEE BURNING,
HIDING KOSOVARS
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-DEATHS-0613-1STLD; KOSOVO-AID-0613.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ABLE SENTRY, Macedonia _ It was just after daybreak
Saturday, and from the cockpit of his Apache helicopter, U.S. Army
Capt. Vincent Torza could see what looked like ``shantytowns''
hidden deep in the wooded mountains of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On another pass through these craggy crests near the border,
Torza could see the still-smoldering ruins of a Kosovar village.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like the inside of the houses had been gone through
and wrecked,'' said Torza, 29, of Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   It was the very first glimpse by a member of the soon-to-be
50,000 international peacekeepers of the carnage wrought by
Yugoslav forces and Serb police and paramilitary gangs in Kosovo
province over the past 11 weeks as NATO warplanes bombed
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Torza, and his wingman Chief Warrant Officer James Risler, 32,
of River Falls, Wisc., are expected to be followed into Kosovo
Sunday by the first of the American troops. The 26th Marine
Expeditionary Unit and members of the 82nd Airborne -- the guard
troops for the Apache helicopters -- spent most of Saturday
awaiting those orders.
</P>
<P>
   A good many could be seen standing in line for their laundry. Or
polishing their rifles. Or enjoying long lunches in the chow hall
inside this NATO support base near the Skopje airport. Or sitting
under trees, trying to escape the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Torza's day was a little different.
</P>
<P>
   As he skimmed along above the main highway toward Pristina, he
found first-hand evidence that Serb forces are indeed withdrawing
as British and French troops pushed north along the main highway to
the provincial capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't smiling and waving at us, but they were
definitely complying,'' said Torza, who flew one of the six Apaches
sent in by NATO to fly shotgun for British infantry units that had
been assigned by NATO to make the first push into Kosovo. The other
six Apaches accompanied the French troops.
</P>
<P>
   Torza didn't fully realize it at the time. But his sighting of
``shantytowns'' in the mountains may help resolve a nagging
question of the Kosovo crisis: Whatever happened to hundreds of
thousands of allegedly ``missing'' Kosovar refugees still inside
the province?
</P>
<P>
   At least some of them inhabit the mountaintop ``shantytowns'' in
the woods that Torza described after seeing clustered ``shanties''
made of plastic and corrugated metal
</P>
<P>
   ``Later in the day, we saw numerous small children and families
coming out of the woods and waving to us as we were flying over
them,'' Torza said.
</P>
<P>
   He was also witness to some of the havoc Serb forces are
wreaking as they pull out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after dawn, Torza noticed a plume of black smoke rising
from a settlement in the mountains about 10 miles southwest of the
Kosovo town of Urosevac. The town was so small it had no name on
Torza's maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially we heard a report on the radio of a fire in that
village,'' said Torza. ``Then we heard a report of possible mortar
or artillery fire being launched.''
</P>
<P>
   As the helicopter first skimmed over the village, Torza and
Risler didn't see anything. ``We continued up the high ground, and
we saw smoke,'' he said. ``We had been given a report that one
house was on fire. When we got up there, there were five.''
</P>
<P>
   Risler said they at least saw 30 troops and a couple of armored
personnel carriers inside the village, not far from the growing
flames of houses set fire not more than a half-hour before their
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Said Risler: ``We were kind of shocked to see that.''

 &HT;    Serb refugees in Bosnia-Herzegovina have lessons for newcomers
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ In a small house on the
northern edge of this capital city of the ethnic-Serb portion of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, a family worked last week building an addition
onto a home they do not like and would leave tomorrow if they
could.
</P>
<P>
   Bogoljub Popovic, 61, two friends and some workers piled rough
bricks and homemade mortar up onto the walls of a tumble-down
one-room building at the rear of their rural home.
</P>
<P>
   Popovic, his wife, two sons and other members of his family have
been in Banja Luka for almost four years. But even though the war
that pushed them from their home in the Croatian village of Sibenik
ended in 1995, they still feel aggrieved over the loss of their old
home and say they want to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will feel like a refugee until I go to my own house,'' the
grey-haired Popovic said. ``I feel like a refugee until I can go
onto my own property.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia-Herzegovina, war-torn for much of the early 1990s, has
now become a home to refugees such as the Popovics. Besides the
estimated 105,000 Muslims who have recently come there from the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, the country houses an estimated 1.7
million people who have not returned to their pre-war homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a problem that has perplexed U.S. officials who are part
of a United Nations effort to retain peace in Bosnia and get the
residents to return home, or truly settle into their new homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long will it take before they lose the will to go home,''
said U.S. Army Gen. Kevin P. Byrnes at a military base in Tuzla.
``There is a certain point that that (desire) will fall off.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the Republika Srpska, the northern and eastern part of
Bosnia-Herzegovina where ethnic-Serbs have fled, that desire
remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Popovics live in a small home at the end of a dirt lane.
Popovic said they got the home by swapping for it with its former
Croatian owners. The Croats took the Popovics' apartment building
in Croatia, and the Popovics went to Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
   The transition was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cared,'' said Zoran Popovic, Bogolub's son and a news
editor for the Bosnian television network.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb refugees still do not feel welcome in Bosnia, but
neither do they feel it is safe to go back to the villages of their
grandparents along the Adriatic coast.
</P>
<P>
   Banja Luka has become the refuge for Serbs kicked out or
escaping other countries in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   License plates of many newer cars showed their drivers live in
Belgrade, Novi Sad or other cities that were bombed by NATO forces.
Local residents say the city has seen an influx of temporary
residents, Serbs who fled the bombing in Yugoslavia to wait out the
war.
</P>
<P>
   But in front of them are veteran Serb refugees _ ethnic Serbs
like the Popovics, forced out of Croatia four, five and six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bosnia you have the international community and political
pressure (for resettling refugees),'' Zoran said. ``In Croatia, you
don't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoran said he, at least, would not return to Croatia even if it
were safe. He has married in Banja Luka and has a good job.
</P>
<P>
   But his parents feel less settled, and their views are shared by
many others.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military officials here claim all three sides _ Serbs,
Croats and Muslims _ are using the sympathetic plight of refugees
to continue the land grabs that they conducted during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategic war continues through the operational
resettlement of women and children,'' U.S. Army Col. Mike Milano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Banja Lukans have backed Yugoslavia throughout the NATO
campaign, but some residents last week said they were angry at the
United States not so much for bombing Serbia as for leaving
Slobodan Milosevic in office.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Americans are told to expect a cool reception, at
best, in Serbian areas of Bosnia, and U.S. employees were told to
stay out of the region during the NATO offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of cool stares, the Popovics greeted an American
reporter warmly and spoke passionately about the injustice they
feel at not being able to return to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   The war has created what a military official described as a
``daisy chain.'' Croats, Serbs and Muslims who were in the minority
of their regions fled to where their groups were more populous.
Many took residences in the homes that other refugees had just
left.
</P>
<P>
   Now, few people are willing to take the first step to go back
home, and so no vacant housing is available for people to move
into.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stalemate with no signs of ending soon.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the hopes of some in the international community
that the refugees will get on with their lives, some feel they can
never do that until they go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be stupid to say anything other than that I want to
go back to where my grandfather and great grandfather were born,''
Bogoljub Popovic said.

   COXNET FOCUS 0612 KOSOVO AIR _ There has never been an air
campaign quite like it. Over 78 days, NATO warplanes flew 35,000
sorties, dropped 23,000 bombs, destroyed 1,500 targets and
shattered the backbone of a central European military force, all
without losing a single U.S. or allied pilot in combat. But the
campaign has raised questions and sparked debate whether air power
alone can win a war without the use of ground troops. (Deans, Cox
Washington Bureau). Art includes 3-column color photo of a jet
fighter leaving the flight deck of a carrier; a 2-column photo of

   BUSH _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush makes his first out-of-state
trip as a presidential explorer. Iowa and New Hampshire are eager
to meet him in person. We pose the questions of how much his
delayed campaigning has hurt him and whether there's any backlash
for Bush not announcing he's a candidate. After all, he's raised
more money and is higher in the polls than any other GOP candidate.
How much more exploring does Bush need to do? When does he simply
appear indecisive? (Greenberger, Austin American-Statesman). 25-30.

   SICKLECELL-SUCCESS _ ATLANTA _ An experimental procedure to cure
sickle cell anemia appears to have eliminated all traces of the
disease from a suburban Atlanta boy. Although the doctor who
performed the procedure is not yet claiming a cure, his experiment
is being closely watched because it could dramatically increase the
number of potential blood donors for the 70,000 victims of the

Miccosukee Indians enter a new era with the official June 14

   MONTSERRAT-VOLCANO _ MONTSERRAT _ This small island made

maintained that the northern third of the island was safe,
Montserrat's tourism industry was decimated. Still, 3,000 residents
-- of the original 10,000 -- refused to leave their homeland in the
hopes that their volcano would quiet down. The volcano continues to
steam, but scientists say it has entered a period of repose. So how
do you rebuild an island when so many roads, houses and schools
have been completely wiped out? (Emling, Cox News Service). 30.

Bay, a posh area often referred to as Montserrat's own Beverly
Hills. A year later, the island's long-dormant volcano erupted. But
the Kleebs, who say they have all their money tied up in their
retirement home, have refused to leave. They alone have stayed on
in the shadow of the volcano in open defiance of a government order
to leave the so-called danger zone. ``I'm 70 years old and I've
done everything I've wanted to do in this world,'' said Beverly
Kleeb, a retired psychiatrist from Michigan. ``If I have to be
french-fried, then that's OK with me.'' (Emling, Cox News Service).

   NEW YORK _ Pressing his home-court advantage, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said Saturday that he assumed Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
likely future adversary for the U.S. Senate, was a Chicago Bulls
fan.
</P>
<P>
   With the New York Knicks poised to play the San Antonio Spurs in
the National Basketball Association finals Wednesday, it was the
mayor's turn for a spin move outside St. Sylvester's Roman Catholic
Church on Staten Island, where he went to celebrate the Feast of
St. Anthony and march in a parade for the 12th-century Portuguese
saint.
</P>
<P>
   And fittingly, he held a basket _ this one of white wicker, full
of bread that had been blessed and that is customarily shared on
the saint's feast day.
</P>
<P>
   As he distributed the bread to a cluster of skeptical reporters,
he was asked, ``Is Hillary Clinton a Knicks fan?''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a lane open, Giuliani drove to the basket. ``Everything
is now changing,'' he said. ``Soon we'll find out that she played
for the Brooklyn Dodgers.''

<P>
   MARYKNOLL, N.Y. _ Joseph M. Everson III was sitting on a very
hard rock inside a crumbling hut in the mountains of Peru, slicked
with mud after an exhausting climb to give Catholic communion to a
peasant family, when his mind stumbled into a thicket of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `What am I doing here?''' he said Friday.
``I used to be an attorney. I was at Skadden, Arps,'' as in
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, the Manhattan law firm where
Everson, 37, had negotiated financial contracts with banks and
brokerage houses. ``Here I am, sitting on a rock, covered with mud,
sitting in an adobe house. What am I  &UR; doing &LR;  here?''
</P>
<P>
   That was January 1997. Saturday, there was no such disquiet in
Everson as he lay, as ritual dictates, face down on the floor of
the Maryknoll Seminary's church, swathed in a white robe, before
Cardinal John O'Connor, the archbishop of New York. Saturday, Joe
Everson _ once a richly compensated corporate lawyer who rode a
gondola from Roosevelt Island into lower Manhattan each morning _
became Father Joseph Everson, a Catholic priest bound for the
forests of the Peruvian Andes with a salary of $300 a month.
</P>
<P>
   For him, the drastic change from corporate lawyer to missionary
priest could not have felt more natural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my closer friends said this seems to fit me much
better than when I was an attorney,'' he said Friday over the
twitter of birds in the grassy courtyard of the Maryknoll Seminary,
near Ossining in Westchester County. ``I feel a deeper meaning, and
I feel closer to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into a Catholic family that raised 10 children in the heart
of San Francisco, Everson said he had always felt drawn toward the
priesthood. It started in Catholic grammar school, reading
missionaries' accounts in Maryknoll magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He put off a decision until after college at Berkeley, where he
studied history. Then he went to law school in Texas, clerked for a
federal judge in Florida and, in October 1989, joined Skadden, Arps
as a lawyer specializing in asset-backed finance, drawing up
documents and negotiating contracts with investment bankers'
lawyers. He lived in a 12th floor apartment on Roosevelt Island,
waking up to a view of Manhattan's skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Everson, a short, stout man fond of khaki pants and simple
polo-style shirts, resigned in 1992 to begin training as a
Maryknoll seminarian, leaving many of his corporate colleagues
baffled. Why give up the money, the expense account, the morning
gondola rides to trudge up mountainsides in the rain to give
communion to a family of peasants?
</P>
<P>
   ``As an attorney at Skadden, I'd achieved success as society had
defined it,'' said Everson. ``But then I turned around and did the
opposite.'' Intent on helping the poor , he signed for two years of
academic and divinity training at the Maryknoll Seminary here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just about the most wonderful thing that could happen,''
said Everson's mother, Virginia Everson, 77, who flew in from San
Francisco to witness the ordination along with her nine other
children. ``I have six sons, and he was the last one, and hope was
getting thin there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryknoll, a society of the Roman Catholic Church, was founded
in 1911 by two priests dedicated to ministering to the destitute in
many of the world's poorest countries. Today, more than 1,400
Maryknoll missionaries work in dozens of foreign countries in South
America, Africa and Asia. The hilltop seminary here, completed in
1954, was built of stone and mortar in the winged tile roof style
of a Chinese pagoda and is part of a sprawling bucolic compound
that has its own postal code.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his training for the priesthood, Everson spent three
years in Yunguyo, Peru, a farming village square in the shadow of a
dormant volcano 12,500 feet above sea level in the Andes and 20
minutes from the border with Bolivia. There, under the supervision
of another Maryknoll missionary, he learned the craft of priests,
helping poor farmers from 42 neighboring villages build homes,
administering communion and aiding in baptisms.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, as the sun rose up through the chilled mountain
clouds, he would wake at 6 a.m. and spend an hour in prayer. For
exercise, Everson would hike to the border of Bolivia and back
again.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the most difficult part of being a priest is, Everson
bowed his head for a moment and thought. The loneliness, he said,
can be intense. Being away from the one's own language and culture.
Foregoing marriage. ``It's important to think why you made
decisions,'' he said. He made his decision, consummated today, he
said, ``because I felt my life could have deeper meaning for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Everson was the sole seminarian to be ordained a
Maryknoll priest. During the two-hour ordination ceremony, O'Connor
spoke of how priests do not choose God but are chosen by Him, a
lesson seemingly apt enough for Everson and his experiences abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Father Everson will return to Peruvian Andes in August to begin
a term as a priest to many of the same peasant farmers he left in
1995 to finish his spiritual education. As before, his life will be
an ascetic one. But in this age, when even priests routinely carry
pagers and cellular phones, Everson will adorn his life in the
Andes with one modern convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bring a laptop with me,'' he said, cracking a smile.
``For my ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   And for one other reason, too. ``e-mail.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ So many thoughts were running through Chris Childs'
head, so many emotions running through his body that he must have
felt like he was going to burst.
</P>
<P>
   The team's leader, Patrick Ewing, being knocked from his arduous
and seemingly endless championship bid by a torn Achilles' tendon
four games ago. Larry Johnson writhing on the floor midway through
Friday's second quarter after spraining ligaments in his right
knee. The good work of the deposed Ernie Grunfeld, who was fired as
the Knicks' general manager with eight games left in this
then-forlorn season. Even Stephon Marbury, the brash Nets point
guard who said that Childs and Charlie Ward would never get the
Knicks near a championship.
</P>
<P>
   All of that was on Childs' mind while the Knicks were en route
to shocking everyone but themselves by defeating the Indiana
Pacers, 90-82, Friday night to win the Eastern Conference title by
four games to two. So when the mission was accomplished and Childs
exhaled, he released all the energy and passion that had been
swirling around inside of him by bounding around the court and
hurling the game ball into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to throw it to the top of the rafters,'' Childs said
after the Knicks advanced to the National Basketball Association
finals for the first time since 1994. ``I tried to throw it as far
as I could but I was exhausted. I was real emotional. This is what
you play all your life for. I was thinking of the guys on this team
that went down, Patrick and Larry. Larry and I came here at the
same time, so I saw all the work that he put in to get us to this
point. And to see Patrick play the years that he did and not really
be a part of this, you get choked up behind it. So I went out there
and played with all of those guys in my heart to let them know that
what they put forth on this team I appreciate and I'm going to go
out there and do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because Childs put forth such a splendid effort in Game
6 and throughout the entire series, the Knicks will meet the San
Antonio Spurs in the finals that begin Wednesday night at the
Alamodome. Childs, who has been viewed as something of a bust since
the Knicks signed him as a free agent three years ago, was a
lifesaver in this series since Ward, the starting point guard,
struggled mightily against the Pacers' bigger, stronger Mark
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Childs' significance was never more evident than Friday night.
The box score read that Childs contributed 9 points, 4 assists, 4
rebounds and 2 steals to the Knicks' victory, but close observation
of the game revealed that Childs had done much more. In the 37
minutes that Childs was on the floor, the Knicks outscored Indiana
by 86-60. In the 11 minutes that he wasn't, the Pacers drilled the
Knicks by 22-4.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, after Indiana sprinted to an 11-4 lead,
Van Gundy subbed Childs into the game and all became well for the
Knicks. The offense began running smoothly, Jackson was kept under
control, and the Knicks scored 20 of the next 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the start of the second half, with the Knicks reeling
because of the injury to Johnson, the Pacers ran off 11 unanswered
points in &QC; 1 minute 55 seconds to turn a 6-point deficit into a
5-point advantage. Again, Van Gundy turned to Childs, and again the
backup point guard delivered. Less than five minutes later, the
score was tied. Two minutes after that, the Knicks regained the
lead when Childs buried a 15-foot jumper and honored Johnson by
making the ``L'' signal with his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just emotion,'' said Childs, who went on to score 7
points in the fourth quarter and hold Reggie Miller to three field
goal attempts and no points. ``A lot of people didn't like it when
Larry started doing that. I think he just carries a lot in his
heart and I just wanted to let him know that he was still a part of
this team and that the things that he's accomplished, the things
that he's given us as a player, the unselfishness that he possesses
each and every night, was with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Childs, still emotional, reminisced about the Knicks'
wild and improbable journey to the conference title. Asked what he
would have said two months ago if a friend had told him the Knicks
would be playing for the league championship, he responded: ``You
need to gointo rehab. You're definitely on some kind of drug.''
</P>
<P>
   That the newest Knicks, Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, have
keyed the Knicks' run is not lost on Childs. Neither is the now
seemingly foolish and premature release of the man responsible for
bringing them to New York, Grunfeld. ``I wish he was here,'' Childs
said, referring to Grunfeld. ``I wish he was in the building to
feel what was going on because what he's done has given us the
opportunity to play for the championship. Maybe I should put E.G.
on my ankle tape to let him know that he's a part of this team
also.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, this Knicks point guard who was so excited that he
was admittedly rambling in answering questions, addressed Marbury.
Back in April, when the Knicks were floundering, Marbury criticized
Childs and Ward after they outplayed him in a Knicks' victory,
saying the Knicks would never win a title with them quarterbacking
the team. At the time, Childs said the comment did not bother him,
but when he was asked how satisfying it was to get the Knicks to
the finals, he replied with a smile, ``Ask Marbury.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``People have opinions. But I've been around Charlie
for three years and two heads are better than one any time and we
believe in each other, the team believes in us and that's all that
matters. People don't have to believe in us because we're strong
enough in our character that we're going to go out there and play,
not to prove anybody else wrong but to just prove to ourselves that
we are worthy.'' &QL;

NO TROUBLE FOR LEITER AGAINST THE A.L. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Leiter turned in his second consecutive strong
outing _ in his second consecutive start against an American League
team _ to lead the New York Mets to a 4-2 victory over the Boston
Red Sox on Saturday at Shea Stadium. The victory was the Mets'
fifth in six games since they dropped a season-high eight in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter had helped reverse the Mets' sinking fortunes last
Sunday, when he allowed one run in seven innings at Yankee Stadium,
in his strongest performance of the season. Saturday, before 43,519
fans at Shea on a beach towel giveaway day, Leiter nearly topped
himself.
</P>
<P>
   He tossed six shutout innings, then pitched his way out of a
major jam in the seventh to leave with a 3-2 lead. Leiter allowed
two runs on six hits in seven innings, with one walk and four
strikeouts. In the last week, Leiter has lowered his earned run
average from 6.39 to 5.57.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks to solo home runs from Benny Agbayani, Robin Ventura
and John Olerud, Leiter was able to improve to 4-5. That isn't
quite the record befitting a $32 million pitcher, but there has
definitely been improvement since Leiter has had his left knee
taped differently to help protect an injury. Through six innings,
Leiter allowed only three base runners, all on singles, two of
which never left the infield.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, the 33-year-old left-hander fanned Damon Buford
for the 1,000th strikeout of his career. And in the sixth _ with
the Mets clinging to the 2-0 lead they had taken in the third on
Agbayani's ninth home run and a run-scoring Edgardo Alfonzo double
_ Leiter survived his own throwing error to keep the shutout
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who had left five runners stranded in extra innings
Friday night, gave the Mets a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the sixth
with his 10th home run. And that was fortunate for Leiter, too,
because after he quickly recorded the first two outs of the
seventh, the Red Sox rallied for a pair of runs.
</P>
<P>
   Buford began the rally with a two-out single to center and then
stole second. Troy O'Leary followed with a bloop double down the
left-field line on a 3-1 pitch to end Leiter's shutout bid. And,
after Creighton Gubanich delivered a full-count single through
short for another run, it was a 3-2 game.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis was the next batter and he fouled off four
consecutive full-count pitches before drawing a walk on Leiter's
100th pitch of the game. And, with the tying run was in scoring
position at second base, the right-handed hitting Jason Varitek
stepped to the plate to pinch-hit for Pat Rapp. Bobby Valentine
stayed with Leiter, however, something the manager has done often
this season; something that has often hurt the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Leiter rewarded Valentine's faith. He threw
two quick strikes past Varitek, then induced the catcher to meekly
pop out to first.
</P>
<P>
   And when Olerud homered in the bottom of the eighth _ after
Armando Benitez had tossed a scoreless inning in relief of Leiter _
the Mets were up by 4-2. A scoreless ninth gave Leiter his second
consecutive victory for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   _ With his second-inning single, MIKE PIAZZA extended his
hitting streak to 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ BOBBY BONILLA nodded when asked if his meeting on Friday, with
BOBBY VALENTINE and STEVE PHILLIPS had been productive, but the
outfielder was otherwise mum. The Mets expect to resolve Bonilla's
situation by Tuesday or Wednesday, one member of the organization
said Saturday. Presumably, Bonilla will be traded or released.
Scratch the Royals from the list of prospective suitors, however.
``We wouldn't have any interest in going in that direction,''
Kansas City general manager HERK ROBINSON said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Red Sox closer TOM GORDON traveled back to Boston on
Saturday for a magnetic resonance imaging test on his right elbow.
Gordon surrendered a game-tying two-run home run to Piazza in the
bottom of the ninth inning Friday night before the Red Sox rallied
to win, 3-2, in 12 innings. It was the first time in Gordon's
career he had blown two consecutive save opportunities, both coming
after he had set a major-league record by recording 54 saves in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   _ Before Saturday's game, the Red Sox announced that they had
placed BRET SABERHAGEN on the 15-day disabled list. The former Mets
pitcher cut his left foot stepping on a piece of glass during a
team party at his Long Island residence Thursday night. Mark
Portugal will start in Saberhagen's place Sunday.

ON BASEBALL: VALENTINE HAS TURNED INTO A LEGEND IN HIS OWN MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There he goes again.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine and the Mets haven't been immersed in enough
turmoil the past week, so the manager had to go and create yet
another issue Saturday. Practicing revisionist history at his best,
Valentine sat in his Shea Stadium office before the game against
the Boston Red Sox and talked about the great job he has done
considering what he found when he became the manager in August
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for two and a half years here we had as placid and as
peaceful a situation as there was in baseball,'' Valentine said.
``I took a terrible, disruptive situation and contained it,
straightened it and made it whole.''
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked him later if by the disruptive situation
he was referring to the past week, Valentine said, ``I was
referring to the abyss that was here two and a half years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps so much has happened the past week that the ceaseless
succession of events has clouded Valentine's 49-year-old mind, but
his recollection of an abyss isn't the way others who were there
remember that time.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Green was brought in to clean up the mess that was the
fallout from a disastrous, disappointing 1992 season, and he did
sweep out the refuse. Green's only failure was that the team didn't
win under him, and he was excused after three and a half years.
Valentine replaced him, and he has won. But there was no mess for
him to clean up.
</P>
<P>
   As for the placid existence the Mets have supposedly lived the
past couple of seasons, Pete Harnisch didn't find peace and
serenity in their clubhouse. Valentine saw to that. Todd Hundley
didn't live a life of serenity either. Valentine saw to that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes into a whole new situation and goes right after I
guess the most popular guy,'' Hundley, now with the Los Angeles
Dodgers, said of Valentine in spring training. And: ``You see him
coming from a mile away. He thinks he's working in the shadows, but
he's not. You can see right through him.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for placid and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The past week certainly wasn't. The Mets' effort to shed Bobby
Bonilla and Brian McRae via irrevocable waivers to clear up their
overcrowded outfield became known and roiled the clubhouse. Their
contemplation of the dismissal of pitching coach Bob Apodaca became
known June 5, and before the day was over, the Mets fired Apodaca
and two other members of Valentine's six-man coaching staff, over
his strenuous objections, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to the Yankees that day was the team's eighth in a row.
Life with the Mets was rapidly spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   It would get better and worse. Worse when Bonilla refused to
pinch-hit in a game last Tuesday because Valentine had benched him
and disclosed the news to a reporter. Better when the Mets beat the
Yankees in the third game of their interleague series and went on a
four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   But near the end of the fourth game of that winning streak,
Valentine created the most bizarre episode of the week and turned
what could have become a smooth sea into a choppy one. Ejected from
the game, he reappeared at the dugout entrance disguised in a fake
mustache and sunglasses. National League president Leonard Coleman
saw through the disguise and suspended him for two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incident that occurred that I can't take back,''
Valentine said Saturday, managing because he has appealed the
suspension. ``It's one of those things that happened. If I had
known what the responses would be and how seriously the outside
world would take it, I never would have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that what he did was stupid, he said: ``Let's not
kid anyone. I knew where the camera was. If I thought this was
punishable by death, the camera never would have seen me. I didn't
think it was that big a deal. But again I was incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said Coleman had offered to hear his appeal at 8:30
a.m. Saturday, but he said it would not be feasible because the
Mets had a 1:15 p.m. game. After his team's 4-2 victory behind Al
Leiter's strong pitching, Valentine said he was glad he had
managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of tough decisions made in that game,'' he
said, noting his use of John Franco, his closer, who had thrown 32
pitches the night before, and his leaving Leiter in to get the last
out in the seventh inning with the bases loaded. ``I'm glad the
guys whose job isn't to make those tough decisions didn't have to
make them. I'd rather have them do those &QC; 8-0 games we have planned
later.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Valentine said the conflagrations had abated. He said
he wasn't aware that before the game Rickey Henderson expressed his
displeasure at not playing regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, Valentine said, were not in a fragile state. ``I think
the foundation is laid here, and it's a strong foundation,'' he
said. ``It's built around the players in the clubhouse. There might
have been a couple windows broken, but the structure is still
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He just better watch out for those leaks in the basement. &QL;

GUN PROPOSAL TAKES A TURN AS DEMOCRATS SHOW DIVISIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A proposal for mandatory background checks of
buyers at gun shows that has the blessing of House Republican
leaders and reflects the preferences of the National Rifle
Association is being sponsored by a group of Democrats, including
the most senior Democrat in the House.
</P>
<P>
   That twist underscores a sharp division on gun control among
House Democrats and could provide valuable political cover for
House Republicans, many of whom would like to vote for softer
gun-control measures than the Senate has approved without having
their party tarred as indifferent to gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be clear until the middle of this week precisely what
rival gun-control measures the House Rules Committee allows to go
to the floor as amendments to a juvenile crime bill that is
scheduled for debate beginning on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republican and Democratic aides said Saturday that
the most lenient of several gun-show options that House members
ultimately vote on could be one put forward by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., a four-decade veteran of the House, and several Democrats
generally opposed to significant new restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   That is the scenario that Republican leaders, who hold sway over
the Rules Committee, are encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it to be very clear that both parties are divided on
this issue,'' said Michelle Davis, a spokeswoman for House Majority
Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise to House Democrats that Dingell, a former NRA
board member, opposes the Senate bill, or that some House Democrats
share his position. Nor does it change the fact that Democrats are
generally fiercer advocates of gun control than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, some Democrats pleaded with Dingell and his
Democratic allies last week not to do anything to potentially
dilute the party's claim to a popular issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blunts it a little bit,'' said one senior Democratic aide.
``But I think the media and the public will still know where our
party stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., who strongly favors new restrictions on
firearms, said that the decision of Dingell and a few other
Democrats probably reflected their lingering convictions about the
extent to which advocacy of gun control factored into the party's
loss of its majority in Congress five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their interpretation of 1994 is that this issue had an
important effect,'' Ms. Lowey said.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls late Saturday afternoon to Dingell's offices in
Washington and in Michigan were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Democratic and Republican aides said Saturday that they
were not sure which Democrats in addition to Dingell had their
names on his amendment.
</P>
<P>
   After a fight that split Republicans and Democrats, the Senate
narrowly approved a gun-show measure that defined the events
broadly and gave vendors up to three business days to complete
background checks. Most Democrats are promoting a similar measure
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who heads the House
Judiciary Committee, unveiled a less strict alternative. His
proposal shortened the maximum time allowed for background checks
to three calendar days and provided a much narrower definition for
what sorts of gatherings qualified as gun shows and subjected
vendors to the obligation of conducting background checks.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans found Hyde's measure too strict, and the
NRA continued to lobby for an alternative that limited to 24 hours
the time that gun-show vendors had to conduct background checks.
Senior Republican and Democratic aides said today that Dingell's
proposal contained that limit.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are now one of the great teams of the Garden,
one of the epic teams of New York. The Eastern Conference banner
will hang from the beams, but what really matters is the sound, the
emotion of that Friday night in June, forever trapped under the
rafters.
</P>
<P>
   Forget, for the moment, what may transpire against San Antonio
if Larry Johnson cannot play. That may be pure epilogue, sheer
aftermath, like Blutarsky growing up to be senator, downhill all
the way, baby, from the raging intensity of that Animal House night
against the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   On that Friday night in June, when their last remaining big
fella went down, the Knicks defended their property with a savage
sense of entitlement, the kind of energy that allows mothers to
lift automobiles off their children. They would not let anything
bad happen, not that night.
</P>
<P>
   These words were written, by the way, in the calm daylight of
Saturday morning, not in the first crazed minutes after the Knicks'
90-82 victory that put them in the finals of the National
Basketball Association playoffs. They play in San Antonio on
Wednesday, much too far away to think about at this moment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, consider what this eighth-seeded Knicks team
accomplished Friday night, and why the crowd chanted ``Jeff Van
Gun-Dee!'' in a chilling acknowledgment of the little terrier of a
coach, and why Latrell Sprewell bounced up and down on a victory
lap of the court, the pride and the relief momentarily wiping away
his glowering game face. Oh, what a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me ask you something,'' Spike Lee said before the game.
``When did the term the `Monster of the Garden' begin?''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think of it as the Beast of the Garden, but
whichever, it goes back a decade or two, to when people began to
perceive the collective roar of ancient crowds (maybe even the
ghost of classic Penn Station, destroyed to build this impractical
Garden), the will of millions of New Yorkers fused into one ghastly
sound, like Scottish war bagpipes or steel subway wheels grating
against steel rails. The Monster or the Beast, it was loose on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Spike danced at the edge of the court, letting out the joy of
his inner child. Donald Trump even watched a few random bounces of
the ball rather than his normal sporting routine of scoping out the
crowd for potential condo buyers. And, one can be sure, Hillary
Clinton will be wearing an orange-and-blue Knicks cap as soon as
somebody whispers the words ``downstate vote.''
</P>
<P>
   It is irrelevant how many of these guys, aside from the wounded
Patrick Ewing, will ever get their numbers hung from the beams,
along with the No. 24 of Bill Bradley, who was there, in the crowd.
What is relevant is what they accomplished from the moment Larry
Johnson went down near the end of the first half, his right knee
sprained by an inadvertent football clip.
</P>
<P>
   If they had won with Johnson firing 4-pointers, as he does
whenever they need one, that would have been sheer basketball
momentum. Rather, they won without Johnson, and that is a tribute
to them, and also a tribute to the man who wasn't there, Ernie
Grunfeld, the general manager who was sacked when the team was
mired at 21-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Ernie was in the building,'' said Chris Childs, who ran
the team when Van Gundy had finally seen enough of Charlie Ward.
``I wish he could see what he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld was not in the building, unless he was using Bobby
Valentine's ludicrous disguise kit. But his players were, Sprewell
and Marcus Camby, their pogo-stick space walks turning a respected
Indiana franchise into an instant dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Childs, the backup point guard who has emerged to
play the quality minutes. He conceded later that if anybody, two
months ago, had proposed to him that the Knicks would be in the
championship round, ``I'd have said, `Go into rehab,''' quipped the
man who is an openly recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   Childs has bonded with the ferocious, often surly, Johnson. They
sometimes counsel the mild-mannered Allan Houston to shoot his
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Allan's mother and father,'' Childs recalled
later. ``I asked, `Why doesn't he shoot more?' I told Allan,
`You've got to be more aggressive.'''
</P>
<P>
   They all tell him that. Brendan Malone, the assistant coach,
told Houston before the game, ``This is the kind of game you dream
about,'' and Houston shot with selective aggression, making 12 of
17, and 8 of 10 fouls, for 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of his game was coldly going after the Pacers who
were in foul trouble, like in the third period when Mark Jackson
picked up his fourth personal. Before the clock stopped to allow a
sub for Jackson, Houston drove right at Jackson for an essentially
undefended layup that tied the game at 53-53. The Knicks were never
behind again.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the fourth period, Childs hit a 3-pointer to put
the Knicks ahead, 62-59. As he ran down the court, Childs stuck his
left hand in the crook of his right elbow, demonstrating the Big L,
as in Larry.
</P>
<P>
   In Bensonhurst and Little Italy (and Naples and Genoa and other
tough places), this gesture can cause your elbow to be wrenched in
the opposite direction, but in the Garden it becomes Johnson's
narcissistic tribute to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now Childs gave the Big L as a salute to his fallen comrade. It
was Animal House in the Garden, another tableau, along with Willis'
walk and Messier's glare, a few more frightful noises to live
forever with the Monster, with the Beast, up there in the rafters. &QL;

 &HT;    Macon Braves' Furcal aiming for 100 steals
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACON, Ga. _ Just as it once did for Vince Coleman, 73-year-old
Luther Williams Field begins to buzz with anticipation every time
Rafael Furcal reaches first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows he's going to try to steal,'' longtime Macon
fan Joe Jones, 75, said. ``I really think he's even faster than
Coleman was back then. Of course, your mind can play tricks on you
when you're my age. It's hard to imagine anyone stealing 145
bases.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's what Coleman did for Macon in 1983, setting an
organized baseball record that might never be challenged. Not even
by the fleet Furcal, who could be the Atlanta Braves' leadoff man
and shortstop of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oooooh!'' Furcal said when told what Coleman accomplished on
the same red-clay basepaths he now uses as his personal dragstrip.
``I knew about Vince Coleman. But I didn't know he played here or
stole all those bases. I don't think I can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the powerfully built 18-year-old Dominican thinks he can
become the first player this decade to steal 100 bases in a minor-
or major-league season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my goal,'' said Furcal, who had 52 steals in 60 games
and the Class A South Atlantic League season of 142 games not half
over. Caught 12 times this season, he stole 31 bases in May _
including a record-tying five in one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us will be shocked if Raffy doesn't steal
100,'' Macon teammate Junior Brignac said.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal stole an Appalachian League record 60 bases in 66 games
last season _ a pace for 147 steals over a 162-game major-league
season. He also batted .328 and was voted the best prospect in the
rookie league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raffy is special,'' Macon manager Jeff Treadway said. ``If
there is a better prospect in this league, I haven't seen him.''
</P>
<P>
   Furcal, who signed with Atlanta at 16, has been clocked as fast
as 6.2 seconds for the 60-yard dash. That makes him even a little
faster than prized Braves prospect George Lombard.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Furcal's explosive first step and ability to read
pitchers _ not just speed _ that sets him apart from most young
base stealers. Given the green light to run on his own, Furcal
takes a lead with one foot past the first-base cutout, but he is
almost impossible to pick off because of his quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some teams have almost given up trying to stop him,''
Macon coach Tommy Gregg said. ``He usually picks the right pitch to
run on, but he even steals on pitchouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Stolen bases, however, are just part of Furcal's game. Converted
to a switch-hitter after signing, Furcal also impresses scouts with
his bat control at the plate, and with his range and strong arm in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal is hitting a team-high .321 and leads Macon in
walk-strikeout ratio. Playing shortstop for the first time after
moving from second base, Furcal also leads the M-Braves with 25
errors. But Treadway, a former infielder with the Braves and four
other major-league teams, downplays the miscues.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few years, people aren't going to remember the errors he
made here,'' said Treadway, who took a leave of absense from the
team Saturday. ``He's going to be a good major league shortstop.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was 21 _ three years older than Furcal _ when he played
at Macon in 1983, and reached the majors with a splash after just
one more minor league season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raffy won't get there that fast, but he's certainly the kind
of player who has the talent to skip a level and move up quickly,''
Treadway said. ``He has good baseball instincts and puts in the
work to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman was the National League Rookie of the Year with St.
Louis in 1985 and stole more than 100 bases in each of his first
three big-league seasons. He led the NL in steals a record three
more seasons, then went into decline because of injuries and
off-the-field problems. He finished his major league career ranked
No. 6 in stolen bases with 752.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman calls his 145-steal season at Macon a
``once-in-a-lifetime thing.'' He batted a league-best .350 and set
the record despite missing 32 games with a broken hand. Playing at
Lodi of the California League, Donnell Nixon _ Otis Nixon's younger
brother _ led the minors most of the season. But Coleman stole
eight bases in the last three games, including three the last day,
to edge Nixon 145-144.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee Thomas was the farm director at St. Louis at the time, and
he wanted to see me do it,'' Coleman said of the record. ``That's
probably the only reason he kept me at Macon for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it does seem like it might be a record that's never
broken. At the time, though, I believed it was something I could do
again, even in the major leagues. I guess I was pretty ambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Furcal. ``I don't know what year, but I know I'll get to
the big leagues,'' he said. ``In the Dominican, baseball was always
my dream. I want to get there as fast as I can.''

   Honor thy uniform
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay left-hander Wilson Alvarez still is hearing about it
after flinging his hat and glove into the stands at Turner Field on
Tuesday night and ripping off his jersey. Now 8-19 with a 4.82 ERA,
Alvarez offered apologies to the team, manager Larry Rothschild and
owner Vince Naimoli after seeing a replay of his act on TV, but it
rang hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild said that Alvarez, in the middle of a five-year, $35
million contract, is out of shape and will have his weight
monitored. Alvarez flipped after the Braves nicked him for nine
hits and seven runs in 2 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never, as long as I'm managing here, let a player throw
this uniform on the ground,'' Rothschild said. ...
</P>
<P>
   Like father like son: Yankees pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre
took off just one night after being struck in the forehead by a
Tino Martinez line drive during batting practice. The hit opened an
11-stitch gash. Earlier in the week in Arizona, son Todd
Stottlemyre vowed, ``Nothing will stop me from returning before the
year's out.'' He continues rehab exercises to help a partially torn
right rotator cuff.

   Tigers `one year behind'
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers are through fooling themselves. The additions
of catcher Brad Ausmus, third baseman Dean Palmer, DH Gregg
Jefferies, right-hander Dave Mlicki and right-hander Willie Blair _
plus a $10.8 million increase in payroll _ created false hope. The
Tigers haven't been better than .500 all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're one year behind where we thought we were,''
manager Larry Parrish said. ``Everyone thought we were ready to put
it together this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly owner Mike Ilitch, who has reiterated his desire
for the club to be improved by next spring, when it moves into new
Comerica Park. The Tigers have taken series from New York, Boston
and Cleveland, but have won just two of their other 16 series.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys either have to find a way within themselves to
learn how to win,'' general manager Randy Smith said, ``or we have
to go out and get somebody to show us how to win.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Will pitching ever be the same after Kansas City's I-70 Series
with St. Louis? The two staffs gave up 63 runs in three games and
needed 24 relief appearances. ... AL player of the week Frank
Thomas, who hit .555 with four doubles, just recorded his 1,000th
career RBI but hears nothing in Chicago about his home-run
production. He entered the weekend with just five home runs. ``I've
always prided myself on consistency,'' Thomas said. ``Lately, it's
just been fun to hit the ball hard.''
</P>
<P>
   AL WEST
</P>
<P>
   Keep on knucklin'
</P>
<P>
   Old knuckleballers never die. They just get released. Tom
Candiotti said goodbye to his fifth organization when Oakland axed
him, a painful decision for the A's. Candiotti was 3-5 with a 6.35
ERA when manager Art Howe called him in. ``It was real emotional on
my part,'' Howe said. ``I know how Tom must feel. I went through
it. It's not an easy thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Life immediately resumed. Rookie Tim Hudson took Candiotti's
spot in the rotation and struck out 11 in his debut Tuesday. And
Candiotti's name immediately was linked with Cleveland, where he
once led the Tribe in victories in 1987 _ with seven wins. ...
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Ken Griffey and left-hander Jeff Fassero are running
neck and neck _ Griffey with 23 home runs hit and Fassero with 23
homers allowed. The Mariners discussed with San Diego the
availability of relievers Donne Wall and Dan Micelli. ... Texas'
bullpen was 17-1 entering the weekend and on a 14-game winning
streak. Rangers starters were 19-22.

 &HT;    Braves slumps contagious
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Slumps have been passing through the Braves clubhouse
like the flu. Next case: Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox started Keith Lockhart at second base
Saturday, he said, to ``get Keith some at-bats.'' Another factor
may have been to give Boone time to collect himself. He goes into
tonight's series finale on a 0-for-13 skid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go through it every year at some point. It happens,'' said
Boone, who had started 57 of the first 60 games. ``It's just in the
last four or five games, my swing's just got long on me for some
reason. I've got to shorten it up and get back.It's going to end.
It's going to end soon. It's just not any fun going through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone hit .302 in May, third highest on the club, but is
5-for-36 in June with nine strikeouts. He has lost 33 points off
his season average to .266 in the last 16 games. His last
extra-base hit came May 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the ball fall,'' he said. ``I'm getting my pitch to
hit and fouling it off. I'm not swinging and missing and flailing
around.''
</P>
<P>
   KC calling
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager reserved comment on a Kansas City report
that Royals GM Herk Robinson had inquired about the availability of
Atlanta first basemen. Robinson, who has been in touch with ``six
or seven'' teams, was said to be particularly interested in Randall
Simon, though the Braves are not interested in dealing,
particularly now the rookie has just begun platooning on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some oars in the water,'' Robinson said. ``We've got
to have somebody who is going to catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals have been playing converted catcher Mike Sweeney and
converted outfielder Jeremy Giambi at first, with regular Larry
Sutton on the DL. The club earlier dealt away Jeff Conine and Jeff
King retired, leaving the organization stripped at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let Herk talk about his search for a first baseman,''
John Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Cure 59
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz is no longer wearing the energy band he wore around
his wrist for while.
</P>
<P>
   ``Threw it away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the body magnets he tried in spring camp and the
other treatments, workouts and gimmicks Smoltz has experimented
with to find a comfort zone for his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if encouraged is the right word,'' said Smoltz,
who tonight will make his third start since coming off the disabled
list. ``I'm more positive. I'm not going to be consumed with
whether it feels good or whether it doesn't. I'm more concerned
with how to win that particular game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jethroe meets Jones
</P>
<P>
   Sam Jethroe, the first African-American to play for the Braves
when he was the 1950 NL rookie of the year, made his first visit to
Turner Field Saturday. Jethroe came from Erie, Pa., for the
dedication of a baseball field in his name at Welcome All Park in
the Ben Hill section of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jethroe was interested in meeting Andruw Jones, who last season
tied the record of 413 putouts by a Braves outfielder that Jethroe
set in 1952.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's the most important putt you ever made? Some prominent PGA
Tour players give their answers.
</P>
<P>
   DAVIS LOVE III: ``At the '93 Ryder Cup, I made a putt at No. 18
to beat Costantino Rocca to help win the cup. It was only a
6-footer, but it gets longer every time I tell the story. I was
scared to death. The whole team was looking at me. The Ryder Cup
was riding on it. I got so nervous, I had to back off. I went
through my whole routine again and made it. After that, I figured
if I could make that putt, I could make any.''
</P>
<P>
   TOM LEHMAN: ``An 8-footer I made for par on No. 15 at Royal
Lytham in '96 on the way to winning the British Open. Another big
one was at the '95 Ryder Cup, a 5-footer when it was raining
sideways, to clinch the victory for me and Corey Pavin against
Colin Montgomerie and Nick Faldo. But at the 1990 qualifying
school, I made a 3-footer for birdie on the 72d hole to make the
Hogan Tour. That putt, at that time of my career, gave me the
confidence to go on. In many ways, that was the turning point of my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT SIMPSON: ``When I won the U.S. Open in 1987, I one-putted
Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 at the Olympic Club to beat Tom Watson by
one stroke. You can probably pick any of those putts. But the one
at No. 15 was the best. I made a 20-footer.''
</P>
<P>
   BILLY MAYFAIR: ``I still say the biggest putt of my life, I
missed. It was at the World Series in '95. Had an 8-footer, not
only to win the tournament but to get a 10-year exemption on tour.
It lipped out. Then I lost to Greg Norman in a playoff. There's no
way that ball could've come out, but it did.''
</P>
<P>
   FRED COUPLES: ``The most fun putt was a 40-footer to beat Vijay
Singh to win the 1996 Presidents Cup. But the biggest was probably
a 4-footer at No. 17 at Augusta in 1992 when I won the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   DAVID DUVAL: ``My first victory, a 12-footer at Kingsmill during
a playoff in 1997. That wasn't the hardest I've ever made, but it
was the most important for my confidence. The hardest putt was the
6-footer at the Bob Hope this year when I shot a 59.''
</P>
<P>
   PAYNE STEWART: ``When I won the U.S. Open in 1991 at Hazeltine,
I made a 20-footer for birdie at No. 16 that was the turning point,
because without that, I don't get into a playoff with Scott
Simpson.''
</P>
<P>
   LEN MATTIACE: ``In 1996, I made a 5-foot putt to win the Compaq
world putting championship. I won $250,000. Second place was worth
$50,000 That's a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   TIGER WOODS: ``I've got to give you two. When I was 12, I made a
15-footer to win the 11- and 12-year-old junior worlds. I wanted to
win the junior worlds in every age group, and I had already lost
when I was 11, so that was my last chance to win the 11 and 12. I
eventually won the junior worlds at every level. The other biggest
putt was on the 17th hole at Sawgrass in 1994, to win my first U.S.
Amateur championship, over Trip Kuehne. Without that one, maybe I
don't win three straight amateur championships.''
</P>
<P>
   GREG NORMAN: ``This decade, it would be a 10-footer for par on
the 15th hole at Royal St. George's, when I won my second British
Open.''
</P>
<P>
   JUSTIN LEONARD: ``The 17th hole at the British Open when I was
tied for the lead. I made a 30-footer. That was the key to winning
it.''
</P>
<P>
   JACK NICKLAUS: ``I'm not sure I can answer that. OK, on the 36th
hole of the 1959 U.S. Amateur championship against Charlie Coe, I
knocked in an 8-footer for birdie to win it. That was my first
major championship. From that point on, that one putt gave me the
confidence to say: `I can do it. I can do it.''' &QL;

 &HT;    Orioles again befuddle Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the second day in a row, the Braves found
themselves dominated by one of the weakest pitching staffs in
baseball and subjugated at home by the game's losingest road club.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by four runs after 13 pitches, the Braves lost 5-0 to
Baltimore on Saturday afternoon, on a six-hitter by Juan Guzman
(3-4), who had been doing his best to flunk out of the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   That makes two losses in a row to the 24-36 Orioles, who
received back-to-back complete games for the first time since the
last week of the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interleague has nothing to do with it,'' left fielder Ryan
Klesko said. ``You don't play well, you don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz will face Mike Mussina tonight, trying to avert just
the third three-game sweep of the Braves since Turner Field opened
in 1997. The O's that season were the first visitor to take three
in a row here, but that club was a division champion. These Orioles
are 12 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   They have made the Braves look pathetic. The Braves are 0-for-6
with runners in scoring position this series, and their Nos. 3-6
hitters are 4-for-28 (.143). Guzman, who had given up 68 hits and
36 runs in his previous 62 innings, allowed no extra-base hits and
walked two while allowing only two men to get past first base.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko and Andruw Jones both committed base-running sins
Saturday. Klesko was thrown out in the second trying to make a
single into a double, and Jones was doubled off second base on a
fly ball in the eighth. Jones would have been safe if he hadn't
jogged back.
</P>
<P>
   But this one was lost in the first inning, when Kevin Millwood
gave up three home runs to the first five batters. Brady Anderson,
Mike Bordick and Will Clark opened a 4-0 lead that was not
challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been living on the outer-third (of the plate) and on the
inner third,'' said Millwood, who recovered to hold the Orioles to
one more run through the sixth. ``That first inning, I was right
down the middle.''

   Counsell, Marlins break up
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find playing time in Florida, someone is sending a
message, which second baseman Craig Counsell has received loud and
clear. After being lifted Tuesday for defensive substitute Luis
Castillo, Counsell, a hero of the 1997 world champion Marlins,
requested a meeting with manager John Boles and asked to be traded.
Friday, he was designated for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can handle being a utility player, and I can handle losing
my job in spring training,'' said Counsell, who lost the starting
job to Castillo during camp. ``But now they're telling me I can't
play defense?'' Dave Dombrowski . . .

 &HT;    Dissension threatening Mets' season
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Mets worried about contending in a division
dominated for a decade by Atlanta. They worried about maintaining
steady gains at the turnstile. They worried about roster
continuity, with seven new players this year and 17 added since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   And with the sun blotted out by the cross-town New York Yankees,
the Mets worried so much about losing their personality in a city
where identity is everything. Turns out, the Mets' personality is
entirely functional. It's just that it formerly belonged to Cosmo
Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   In a year that began with the general manager being sued in a
sexual harassment case after he acknowledged an affair with a
front-office secretary, the Mets are seriously out of control,
their hopes for contention slipping away by the week.
</P>
<P>
   As the weekend began, manager Bobby Valentine was hit with a
$5,000 fine and two-game suspension by the National League for
failing to leave the Mets bench after being ejected in Wednesday's
extra-inning victory against Toronto. Well, he left, but he
returned with some eye black under his lip, wearing some geek
glasses and hoping no one would notice. He said later he was trying
to ``lighten the mood.'' Now he's appealing the fine and
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lightening Bobby Bonilla's case. The Mets are
expected to release the recalcitrant outfielder and eat what
remains of his $10 million contract. Forget a trade. The Mets ran
both Bonilla and center fielder Brian McRae through waivers last
week, and no one claimed either.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, after Valentine informed Bonilla that he was out of the
outfield rotation, Bonilla responded during the game by refusing to
pinch-hit. The two had to be separated Wednesday in a dugout
screaming match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have one of my coaches play the outfield,''
Valentine said later, and Mookie Wilson still could do it better
than Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Steve Phillips, whose job security is apparently
Kevlar-treated, as he retained his post after disclosure of his
affair with a Florida-based Mets secretary, just fired pitching
coach Bob Apodaca and hitting coach Tom Robson without consulting
Valentine. At the time, the Mets were second in NL batting and
their bullpen was ranked third.
</P>
<P>
   The clubhouse has broken into random piques of temper. Shortstop
Rey Ordonez tossed some batting helmets when he was out of the
lineup one day against Cincinnati. McRae has lobbied hard against
Valentine's policy of withholding his lineups until the day of the
game, although it is universal practice.
</P>
<P>
   And at center stage sits Valentine, as self-centered as any
manager in recent years. Within the space of a few hours Wednesday,
he went on WFAN to dispute how he has been portrayed in the press,
got into a shouting match with a Newsday reporter who disputed
those remarks and then took on Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Through the fog, the Mets trudged into the weekend with a
four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the team rule is the first rule,'' Valentine said, ``if
what people are thinking about first is the team, then everything
else falls into place. And I think at times, there's some confusion
about that.''

 &HT;    An issue of scar tissue
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants were three games over .500 the day
Barry Bonds underwent elbow surgery and were seven games over .500
when he returned Wednesday. The club did surrender first place to
Arizona, but it did not suffer as deeply as Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Faced in mid-May with the possibility of season-ending surgery
to remove scar tissue, Bonds went to the training room with
physical therapist Steve Conte, who manipulated Bonds' left elbow
so severely that the three-time MVP was crying in pain. But Conte
cracked the scar tissue, and Bonds was able to return 20 days ahead
of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something one human being should do to another human
being,'' Conte said. ``I pushed it to where he couldn't take it any
longer, and then I pushed it some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had plateaued with his range of motion,'' Conte said. ``If
we didn't get more range, (doctors) would have put him back in the
operating room, given him an anesthesia and then bent and broken
the scar tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Dusty Baker already thinks Bonds is throwing harder than
before, coming straight over the top more than from the side.
</P>
<P>
   TRIBE ON A RAMPAGE
</P>
<P>
   The numbers coming out of Cleveland continue to boggle the mind.
The Indians are not just leading the majors in offensive
production. They lead the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   After completing one-third of the schedule, the Tribe was on
pace to score 1,092 runs, 25 more than the record-setting 1931 New
York Yankees. The club was hitting a major-league high .300,
leading the AL in stolen bases and ranking second in homers, a
vicious pairing of speed and power. Roberto Alomar, Travis Fryman
and Manny Ramirez are heading for 100-RBI/100-run seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And Ramirez has been simply frightening. He is hitting .424 with
runners in scoring position, hitting an absurd .727 (8-for-11) with
the bases loaded and is on pace to drive in 196 runs, six more than
Hack Wilson's record 190, which has stood since 1930.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he has 100 or more at the All-Star break, he can definitely
make a run at it,'' hitting coach Charlie Manuel said. ``The key
will be our first three hitters (Kenny Lofton, Omar Vizquel and
Alomar). If they keep hitting and getting on base like they are
now, Manny has a very good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Those first three have a combined .426 on-base percentage.

 &HT;    Anderson extension unlikely before Falcons' camp
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons begin ``passing camp'' Monday, and
although attendance is not mandatory, coach Dan Reeves has made it
clear he regards it as important. For running back Jamal Anderson,
it could mean more than that.
</P>
<P>
   As contract extension talks continue with AndersonJim Sims, team
officials are looking for a sign that he regards the Falcons'
efforts as earnest. It wouldn't hurt if the 26-year-old All-Pro
would take a flight from his offseason home in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Jim Sims said the goal is for Anderson to be one of the
three highest-paid backs in the NFL. The best offer the Falcons
have made averaged $5.2 million a year, which would place him in
the top five, depending on whose contrace interpretation is used.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation Anderson is waiting on a signing
bonus of $10 million, which would far surpass the franchise-record
$6 million bonus quarterback Chris Chandler got with his four-year
extension last fall, with $2 million deferred until this spring.
Sims isn't confirming the $10 million figure.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led the NFC and was second in the NFL last season with
a franchise-record 1,846 rushing yards on a league-record 410
carries. But Reeves points out that Anderson's breakout season was
just that. He had 1,002 yards in 1997, with a 3.5-yard average, and
1,055 yards in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Emmitt Smith, Denver's Terrell Davis and Detroit's Barry
Sanders have nine rushing titles, five Super Bowl titles and three
league MVP awards among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a player who has had one outstanding
season,'' Reeves said. ``We don't have to be doing anything. We're
talking about a player who has a contract this year. Still, we want
to extend Jamal. At the same time, we've got to do what's best for
our team (financially).''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sims offered a counterproposal Wednesday, and said,
``We're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims would not say whether Anderson will be here Monday, and
Anderson could not be reached last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sims hasn't forgotten that the Falcons called the Patriots on
draft day to see if New England was interested in acquiring
Anderson in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know (Anderson) is going to be a Falcon,'' Sims
said. ``We don't want him to be used as trade bait again next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   Passing camp will barely resemble training camp, but there is
on-field skill work as players work in shorts, shirts, cleats and
helmets. Players will focus on basic offensive and defensive sets
for 30-45 minutes a day _ Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday _
for four of the next five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, but no thanks
</P>
<P>
   The agent for recently released Rams strong safety Toby Wright
called his former head coach, Atlanta defensive coordinator Rich
Brooks, to see if the Falcons might be interested. Atlanta already
has seven safeties, though, and probably will keep five, perhaps
four. ... Atlanta will not pursue recently waived Dallas wide
receiver Billy Davis, and probably will not pursue recently waived
Patriots cornerback Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   Working hard
</P>
<P>
   Strength and conditioning coach Al Miller said free safety
Eugene Robinson and defensive end Chuck Smith are in great shape.
``I don't think there's any comparative analysis that would show
how much further along they are,'' Miller said. ``Chuck's in the
best shape in my three years, and Eugene is light years ahead of
last summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Among rookies, first-round draft choice Patrick Kerney, a
defensive end, has been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Moving parts
</P>
<P>
   Reserve linebacker Craig Sauer, who moved from the weak side to
the strong side last season, probably will move back to the weak
side, where Keith Brooking is expected to start. ... The plan is
for Ronnie Bradford to get some work at free safety, but Bradford
will begin training camp as the starter at right cornerback, ahead
of '97 first-rounder Michael Booker.

 &HT;    Falcons' rise brings training site crunch
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Falcons moved their headquarters from
downtown to suburban Suwanee more than two decades ago, but senior
equipment manager Horace Daniel has not forgotten the joy of
moving.
</P>
<P>
   The team went from cramped offices in Atlanta-Fulton County
Stadium into a a new 28,000-square-foot building off 1-85 in
Gwinnett County. The Falcons facility was the ``kingpin of all
kingpins,'' said Daniel, who has been with the team since 1967.
``It was big, and ... we could do everything right here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were about the only team that had our own place. When other
teams were ready to build, they'd look at our place for ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Falcons are gathering ideas for another new home. The
team has signed a nonbinding letter of intent to move next summer
into a two-story, 70,000-square-foot structure at Stone Mountain
Park.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal goes through, the Falcons will be kingpins once
again. It can't happen too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the media relations and marketing departments moved
into trailers 300 yards from the main building. Team and group
meetings are held in other trailers, some workout equipment is in
another trailer, and news conferences are held in still another
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons didn't have such problems two decades ago, before
NFL rosters grew from 45 players to the current 53, plus five
players on the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   The league's increased public presence has required additional
personnel, as well. The number of nonplaying personnel has doubled,
from 31 in 1978 to 63 last season. The Falcons have added a
four-person marketing staff and two community-relations employees,
and the public-relations department has grown from one to four. The
team has gone from seven assistant coaches to 14 and from four
scouts to 11. Strength and conditioning coach Al Miller and his
assistant, Rocky Colburn, are good examples how times have changed.
Teams were starting to hire strength coaches in the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   The current weight room, about 2,000 square feet and undersized
by NFL standards, has dozens of bench, squat and clean racks and
hundreds of weight plates.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed facility at Stone Mountain will have a weight room
more than twice that size. It will also have an auditorium that
will seat 150 to 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, vice president of Partners &AMP; Associates, the
Knoxville-based developer in charge of the project, said the
facility will offter many other improvements, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be multiple whirlpools (in contrast to one now), a
more spacious locker room,'' Russell said. ``There will be 200
spaces in a gated parking facility for the team and about 800
spaces for the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be reasonable to say it will cost about $15 million
to $20 million, although that number could be revised,'' he said.
``The Falcons' intent is to take care of everybody involved and
have them all under one roof. ''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Falcons will have three outdoor practice fields
and an indoor practice field under a roof 225 foot by 395 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Partners and Associates was hired by Silver Dollar City, the
Branson, Mo., theme-park management company that runs Stone
Mountain Park.
</P>
<P>
   The developers have checked out several other NFL facilities,
including the one under construction in Nashville, but most of
their input is coming from the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment manager Brian Boigner, who stores quite a bit of gear
in an adjacent health club that was closed years ago, has put in
several requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know in New Orleans their (storage) cabinets are like track
lighting,'' he said. ``They can be suspended or on tracks in the
floor, and they can roll them when they're not using them.
Jacksonville, Cleveland and the Saints have it. It's a great
space-saver.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the locker room, where we now have (three) aisles, the
big thing is to get the perimeter lockers so the middle of the room
is open (like the Braves' clubhouse). And we want to have a loading
dock right off the back of the equipment room, which we don't have
now. A laundry facility that is its own separate entity would be
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also has been consulted. When he was coach of the Rams in
1995-96, St. Louis was building a new headquarters in Earth City,
Mo. He liked much of what he saw and has offered Partners some
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need separate rooms for offensive and defensive staff
meetings,'' he said. ``Right now, my office doubles as the
defensive meeting room, and staff meetings typically are in the
draft room, which is where the scouting staff does much of its
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was one of several coaches to say that each of their
offices needs a video setup. ``Sometimes, it's hard for coaches to
break down film without interrupting someone else,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   The annual lease for such a facility would approach $2 million,
but the Falcons want to reduce the payment to $200,000-$300,000 a
year, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   That will take a lot of corporate sponsorship; the balance
likely would have to be paid for by the issuance of construction
bonds which would increase the team's lease payments.
</P>
<P>
   Partners has about eight weeks to prove it can gather enough
corporate sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, talks are starting on the exterior appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will probably be a fair amount of brick,'' Russell said.
``We don't anticipate a modern, high-tech building with a lot of
glass; that wouldn't be in keeping with the park. But right now,
we're still focusing mostly on the floor plan, the way traffic will
flow through the building.''

 &HT;    Packers gear for rebound
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pundits in Las Vegas currently rate Green Bay as no better
than the No. 3 favorite, behind Minnesota and Atlanta, in the NFC
for 1999. Quarterback Brett Favre, however, thinks the Packers can
return to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened last year stung us,'' Favre said about the
team's second-place finish in the NFC Central and last-minute loss
to San Francisco in the wild-card round. ``Maybe we'll have the
luxury of sneaking up on folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Under first-year coach Ray Rhodes, the practices are longer and
more physical than the no-pads workouts of Mike Holmgren. But even
without Reggie White, general manager Ron Wolf has worked hard to
improve the depth. Look for the team to pursue tailback Lawrence
Phillips as a backup to Dorsey Levens and to sign a veteran
linebacker. There is optimism that fourth-year wideout Derrick
Mayes finally is ready to make an impact. And though the offensive
line is the deepest it has been in years, offensive coordinator
Sherm Lewis has Favre working from the shotgun for the first time
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Pack used its first three draft choices on defensive backs _
Antuan Edwards of Clemson (No. 1), Vanderbilt's Fred Vinson (No. 2)
and Mike McKenzie of Memphis (No. 3) _ in an attempt to get bigger
and quicker in the secondary. But it is the return to health of
corner Craig Newsome and additional experience of free safety
Darren Sharper that defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas will count
on for improvement. Lionel WashingtonJoe Vitt

 &HT;    U.S. Opeourse's splendor in its grass
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So how did Pinehurst No. 2, the elegant Donald Ross masterpiece
in the Sandhills, get the 1999 U.S. Open?
</P>
<P>
   A better question: Why did it take this long?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, folks, there's no great controversy here. There were no
Salt Lake City-type payments to the United States Golf Association.
There's nothing that would get Mike Wallace on a flight to
Raleigh-Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, we're just talking grass.
</P>
<P>
   Pinehurst No. 2 being one of the great tracks on the planet, it
had all but one ingredient to have secured a U.S. Open decades ago.
The USGA likes firm, fast greens in summer heat, and until a few
years ago it wasn't possible at No. 2 or many other courses in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   But a strain of bentgrass known as Penn G-2, installed in 1996
on the Donald Ross greens during a refurbishment headed by Rees
Jones, changed everything. They had proved successful at the newest
Pinehurst course, No. 8. Resistant to heat and humidity and able to
hold its smoothness and firmness, the putting surfaces, in the
opinion of the Pinehurst director of golf course maintenance Brad
Kocher, can be kept as firm and fast as any greens anywhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main concern,'' No. 2 superintendent Paul Jett said, ``is
the greens could potentially become too fast. We may have to raise
the mowing height for the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This grass is so good,'' said Tim Moraghan, the USGA's
championship agronomist, ``if you don't play a shot correctly, that
shot will get away from you real fast. Players will have to be
extremely accurate with their approach shots and very careful about
the spin they use.... (For putting) this stuff has virtually no
grain. It rolls really true.''
</P>
<P>
   With perfect grass, Pinehurst emerges as a perfect U.S. Open
venue for the first such championship in the South since the
Atlanta Athletic Club hosted in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's obvious that the fairways and approaches in the
South are as good as anywhere, but the putting surfaces are
normally the best during the early spring and late fall,'' said Don
Padgett, Pinehurst's director of golf. ``We had to convince them
that we could get firm and fast greens in June before they ever
thought about coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears to have worked. Players on spy missions in advance of
the tournament report shaved areas around the crowned greens that
will make par a very good score. Instead of brute strength often
being the tiebreaker in a U.S. Open, finesse will be foremost this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the area itself being able to withstand U.S. Open masses,
the USGA felt it adequate after the often congested Long Island,
N.Y., area so capably handled the 1996 U.S. Open at Shinnecock
Hills. Pinehurst is a village of only 8,000 residents, and to house
U.S. Open masses every hotel and rentable house within a 50-mile
area was needed. But it is a place that just exudes golf in every
aspect. Although Pinehurst will be too crowded this week to
appreciate in its usually charming state, the setting nonetheless
will be superb.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, who does not readily praise course architecture
that does not bear his own handiwork, calls Pinehurst No. 2 ``my
favorite course in the country, from a design standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the course will escape any periods of heavy rain this
week. If No. 2 plays firm and fast, playing for the flagstick will
be about as common as Tiger Woods in plaid pants. With balls likely
to scoot off the bowl-shaped greens and down tricky slopes,
creativity will be tested. If No. 2 softens, too many birdies
definitely could ruin a good thing.

 &HT;    Tiger Woods' next hurdle
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1995 at Shinnecock Hills, when Tiger Woods started
flailing in U.S. Opens, we have seen too many:
</P>
<P>
   _ Replays that required an ``R'' rating for anger, some
occasionally for language.
</P>
<P>
   _ Drives that found the thick, unyielding rough and too many
attempted recovery shots that discovered even more of it.
</P>
<P>
   _ First rounds, averaging 74.5, that separated the game's most
dynamic player from serious contention.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, all of 23 years old entering this week's 1999 U.S. Open
at Pinehurst No. 2, freely admits as much. ``I understand the U.S.
Open is a difficult tournament and I'm not always going to play
well,'' he said, eager for his fifth installment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though people think you have all the talent in the world
and all the mental skills, you still have to have some good
breaks,'' Woods said. ``You still have to have some balls end up in
the rough with good lies, knock them on the green and have
no-brainers. ... Unfortunately, I haven't played as (well) as I've
liked in a U.S. Open, but you could also say the same for a lot of
other people, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has shot in the 60s only two of 13 rounds, and his best
finish has been last year's tie for 18th. But timing being
everything in golf, he quite possibly has positioned himself for
his finest challenge at a U.S. Open. He has won his last two starts
_ the Deutsche Bank Open on the European Tour and last week's
Memorial, one of the most important nonmajors on the PGA Tour. And
he brings a more controlled game, featuring a rounded swing plane
less prone to errors and new evidence that he's been cracking the
books on course management.
</P>
<P>
   At the Memorial, Woods displayed his genius in the short game,
flopping out of trouble with uncanny regularity when he wasn't able
to fire successfully to the flagsticks. He also has learned to use
another 300-yard club, his 3-wood, a la Jack Nicklaus in his prime,
for landing the ball softly in firm fairways to avoid scooting into
the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Which bring us to the P-word. Patience. Woods finally is
starting to play like someone able to display it. And while Woods
has spoken before about par being acceptable in a U.S. Open, he has
not demonstrated as much when Thursdays arrived. But this time, his
more mature approach seems to be sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Open is one of those tournaments where your patience
is tested to the utmost,'' he said. ``You just have to hang in
there and make sure you limit the mental mistakes. You're going to
put the ball in the rough. You're going to have some tough putts.
But you just have to hang in there. Sometimes, you can fire at the
pin. Sometimes, you can put the driver down there and make birdie.
Other times, you just have to put it in play. If you can get to the
pin, OK. If not, take your par and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a new philosophy; it's just new for Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play the U.S. Open differently,'' Fred Couples said. ``You
know par is a great score. ... Every year it's like that. You're
not trying to go out there and be a hero and shoot 8-under for the
week. First of all, it's probably not going to happen. Second of
all, if it does happen, you'll win by six shots and play the four
best rounds of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinehurst No. 2's requirements will be different from most other
U.S. Opens. From tee to green, it doesn't appear to be so penal.
The trees are more decorative than punitive. The Bermuda rough
isn't unreasonably deep. The scary part is the crowned greens,
rebuilt in 1996 with speedy G-2 bentgrass. When Donald Ross built
them, drainage systems weren't as sophisticated as for today's
courses, and the putting surfaces became inverted bowls to allow
water run-off. However, golf balls fall off just as easily. Finding
safe spots for approach shots will require an exact number from the
fairway. Chipping or putting up slopes to the green will put
players such as Jose Maria Olazabal, Phil Mickelson, Lee Janzen or
Davis Love III in prominent roles. Or Woods, if he maintains his
controlled attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gotten frustrated in tournaments,'' Woods conceded.
``Unfortunately, you look at some of the spots I've put myself in.
I've put myself in bushes and trees and water, and I don't know too
many people that are going to be very happy with that. I know I
wasn't. ... But I think with the evolution of my game, just because
I'm hitting it better, you're going to be more patient. ... I've
learned, through my own mistakes, of handling my emotions, of
handling disappointments, as well as handling the highs a lot
better. ... That's one of the reasons my game has been very
consistent, why I don't miss a whole lof of cuts, why I finish in
the top 10 a lot, why I gave myself a lot of chances and why I'm
starting to win again.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance at Muirfield Village, as Woods flopped and
flipped his way to an amazing series of up-and-downs, definitely
has improved his short-game confidence for Pinehurst. At No. 2, you
will see Woods using his 3-wood from the fringes, putting or
settling his 60-degree wedge onto the crowned greens.
</P>
<P>
   In a No. 2 practice round before the Memorial, Woods said, ``I
tried almost every club in my bag around the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   If Woods slips into his old habits, he has the brawn to wrestle
the Pinehurst rough, which is not as thick as in some Opens. Woods
said he has put on nearly 20 pounds of muscle since turning pro at
a wiry 160 and has reduced his body fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing a lot of lifting, and it's starting to pay
off,'' he said. ``I've been able to hit shots I've never been able
to hit, because of strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever low-percentage shots have not worked out in previous
U.S. Opens, Woods has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I may get in my own way,'' he said, ``but I'd rather
do that than someday have to say, `I wish I would have tried
harder.' ''

ARIZONA BECOMING BASEBALL'S HOTTEST SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here is all you need to know about the
early-season success of the Arizona Diamondbacks. Actually, there
are three things that will impress even the most ardent fans, who
insist expansion teams must take their lumps.
</P>
<P>
   1. The second-year Diamondbacks scored eight or more runs in
seven straight games before being held to four by the Rangers last
Sunday. STATS Inc. researched back to 1951 and found no other team
to score eight or more in that many consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   2. Of the 73 fastballs Randy Johnson threw last Friday to end
Texas' nine-game winning streak, 44 were 98 mph or harder according
to the club's radar gun (16 at 98 mph, 23 at 99 and 5 at 100). His
96th pitch hit 99 mph. And catcher Damian Miller said Johnson, who
took a no-hitter into the seventh, had his best slider of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   3. Arizona already has had four National League Players of the
Week and none of them are Luis Gonzalez, who already has had a
30-game hitting streak and entered the weekend series against the
Angels with a .381 average. The others: Johnson, Matt Williams, Jay
Bell and Steve Finley, who received the honor last week.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up and the Diamondbacks suddenly are the bullies of the
National League, interleague and any other league that wants to
challenge their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is real,'' said Bell, who already has 18 home runs, just
three short of his career high. ``I mean the team is real. I don't
know how long I'll keep it up, but I'm enjoying the winning a lot.
The whole team is.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not the whole team. The Diamondbacks, who entered
the weekend two games ahead of San Francisco in the West, are
struggling with their relief pitching. With the free-agent money
spent on Johnson, Finley and Todd Stottlemyre (now injured), they
should be there all season. But championships are not won in June.
And they usually are won in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Gregg Olson has six blown saves (in 14 chances) and is
tied with Baltimore's Mike Timlin for the major-league lead. The
Diamondbacks have dropped five games they led entering the ninth
inning and have seen their opponents win 10 games in their final
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Olson has allowed four homers, matching his total from last
year. But the four this year have all been with two out and two on
and have all tied or won the game (one in the eighth inning, three
in the ninth).
</P>
<P>
   There has been a call for a new closer, either Byung-Hyun Kim
(the youngest player in the big leagues) or someone else. But
manager Buck Showalter usually stays with veterans.
</P>
<P>
   What happens from here in the West is uncertain. The Giants lost
just three games to Arizona during the seven weeks Barry Bonds
missed following surgery. The Dodgers have not really been heard
from yet.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want excitement, Arizona is your team. And it won't
get any better than July 18-20 when the Diamondback travel to
Seattle to face Johnson's former team in its new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the Mariners didn't think they could afford to keep
Johnson and pay pending big contracts to Ken Griffey, Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez. The Diamondbacks spent big money in the winter and now
are making everyone else pay.

 &HT;    FAA investigating Emery Worldwide over hazardous materials
 &HT;    (Moving in national (a) and financial (f) categories.)
 &HT;    By Wes Hills, Timothy R. Gaffney and Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Federal Aviation Administration is
investigating allegations that Emery Worldwide shipped hazardous
materials without adequate documentation, failed to notify pilots
of hazardous cargo on board their aircraft and concealed problems
from FAA inspectors, the Dayton Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA began the investigation more than a month ago, said Bill
Wilkening, manager of the FAA's Dangerous Goods/Cargo Security
Division in Washington, D.C. Wilkening would say only that the FAA
is conducting a nationwide investigation and that the alleged
violations involve the shipment of hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we do have a national compliance inspection'' under
way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two employees who worked at Emery's Dayton hub also told the
Daily News that they have been interviewed by an investigator from
the U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General's Office. A
spokeswoman in the office's Washington, D.C., headquarters would
not confirm an IG investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Emery spokesman Rocco Sacci acknowledged that FAA inspectors
have been auditing Emery Worldwide's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that they have been to 15 of our some 200 locations,
and they have done various types of auditing, as they do . . .
checking our security procedures, and our Hazmat procedures and so
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacci said the ``audits'' have found, ``At the worst, maybe some
minor administrative violations . . . maybe mistagging, or
mislabeling, something like that there. But there have been no
penalties or fines or anything like that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA probe is focused on Emery's North American freight hub
at Dayton International Airport because much of the company's cargo
_ including hazardous materials _ flows through the hub. The Daily
News obtained copies of documents made available to the FAA that
show a hazardous materials supervisor at Emery's Dayton hub
repeatedly brought complaints of violations to her superiors but
she said little was done.
</P>
<P>
   Emery's Dayton hub processes about 5 million pounds of freight
daily, according to its 1998 annual report. Although only a small
percentage involve hazardous materials _ 3 percent, say company
officials _ Emery routinely ships explosives, flammable liquids,
toxic substances, radioactive materials and biomedical products,
documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are permitted to carry hazardous materials, but the
shipments are subject to strict federal regulations and require
special labeling, documentation, handling and loading.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkening said Emery personnel have been cooperating with
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   One Emery employee who said she has been interviewed extensively
by FAA investigators is Debbra O. Bullock, 40, who from July 1997
until October 1998 worked as a hazardous materials supervisor at
Emery's Dayton hub.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock agreed to speak to Dayton Daily News reporters in the
offices of her attorney, Lawrence J. Greger, after she was asked
about documents related to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Those documents, including numerous memos from Bullock to her
superiors warning of dangerous practices, describe a pattern of
violation after violation of hazardous materials laws over a
two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious allegations include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Sept. 26, 1998, memo by Bullock regarding the hiding from
FAA inspectors hazardous materials in an area ``way out past the
waste building in what used to be called the graveyard.'' The Daily
News could find no evidence that an Emery manager responded to the
memo.
</P>
<P>
   _ A lengthy and detailed memo of February 1998 alleging hundreds
of shipments of hazardous materials moving without paperwork or
pilot notification, a pattern one Emery manager described as
``alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Shipping materials Emery supervisors acknowledge are not
permitted ``in our system.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An acknowledgement by a hub supervisor that the handling of
hazardous materials ``has always taken a back seat to other
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacci said Emery would not respond to specific allegations
involved in the FAA investigation. But he called the company's
hazardous materials handling ``industry-leading.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery has ``spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and thousands
of hours in development and training to achieve what we believe to
be the finest program for the handling of Hazmat shipments that can
be found in the air industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock said during her tenure the company did improve its
compliance record. She said she succeeded in reducing the number of
compliance violations from 800 a month to about 100. However, she
said she asked to be removed from her position last fall because
she did not feel other supervisors shared her commitment to
complying with FAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 26, 1998, letter requesting a transfer, Bullock
stated, ``I love my job, I care about the company I work for, and I
see a large liability I feel has never been addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock said she first discovered that FAA rules were being
repeatedly ignored shortly after becoming hazardous materials
supervisor in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed there was a large number of hazardous materials that
were traveling out of compliance,'' Bullock said. ``Materials were
traveling through our process without being loaded correctly (and
without) pilot notification. The paperwork was not going with the
hazardous material, so therefore no one even knew the hazardous
material was on the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Federally-mandated paperwork that tracks and documents hazardous
shipments is a key component of safe transportation, Bullock said,
because pilots and ground crews must know the location and content
of hazardous freight aboard aircraft in the event of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA should have been notified when Emery violated federal
rules, but to Bullock's knowledge, federal authorities weren't
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Her frustration and stress over conditions at the company boiled
over, Bullock said, when Emery passed an FAA inspection with flying
colors in September 1998 despite what she said were deeply
entrenched problems.
</P>
<P>
   Because Emery had prior knowledge of FAA visits, workers
successfully avoided problems by holding up hazardous materials
shipments for the period of the inspection, Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't set well with me,'' she said. ``I couldn't hardly
stomach it...I had people standing around everywhere because we
just hardly got any freight at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA acknowledged that it often informs companies like Emery
in advance when annual inspections occur so the people responsible
for hazardous materials will be available to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock also alleged that forms certifying that Emery planes
were loaded in accordance with FAA regulations carried a mechanical
signature of her name, even when she was not at work and had no
idea what was aboard a particular aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which means if your name's on there and there's a problem, the
FAA is going to call you and you're going to be the one held
accountable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock continues to work at Emery in another supervisory job.
She said the FAA has not offered her any job protection in exchange
for her cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was my obligation to continue to not lie to the FAA.
I felt I needed to answer their questions and answer them
honestly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers such as Emery have come under increasing scrutiny from
the FAA since the May 11, 1996, crash of ValuJet Flight 592 in the
Everglades that killed all 110 people aboard. Investigators blamed
the crash on a fire caused by oxygen generators that had been
improperly packaged, labeled and loaded into the plane's belly.
Following the crash, the FAA increased its hazardous materials
inspection staff from 12 to more than 130.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen generators use chemical reactions to produce oxygen.
Airlines use them in their emergency oxygen systems, but the FAA
banned passenger airlines from carrying them as freight after the
Valujet crash. Freight airliners may haul oxygen generators if they
follow strict packaging and loading rules. But Emery memos describe
errors that worried the company's hazardous materials supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Bullock wrote a memo that said an audit by the
hazardous materials department found hundreds of hazardous
materials shipments being moved without required documentation.
Noting one that contained oxygen generators, she wrote, ``This is
what brought down ValuJet.''
</P>
<P>
   An October 1998 memo by another hazardous materials supervisor
described how a shipment of oxygen generators got loaded into a
cargo container next to part of a shipment of paint. The oxygen
generator was classified as an oxidizer and the paint as a
flammable liquid, which the supervisor called ``incompatible
materials'' that should not have been loaded side-by-side in the
same container.
</P>
<P>
   That cargo container and another one containing the rest of the
paint shipment were loaded onto a plane bound for John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York. The improper loading was
discovered after some of the paint in the other cargo container was
spilled as it was being loaded, requiring both cargo containers to
be pulled from the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Had the spill happened in the cargo container containing the
oxygen generator, the supervisor rote, ``the oxidizer could have
reacted with the paint causing a serious fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents show numerous Emery supervisors were aware of the
alleged violations.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, Bullock was urged by a supervisor to ship a
package of methanol even though Emery's policy prohibits it on
airplanes. The shipment had already been flown to the Dayton hub
from Oklahoma City, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment ``was in fact not allowed in our system and should
not have been accepted,'' the supervisor wrote, ``but since it will
be flying only on Emery aircraft to the destination, we can move
this shipment, this once, on our aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents also, at times, reflect concerns of Emery
supervisors to comply with FAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 2, 1998, memo, Mike A. Massie, director of
environmental affairs/dangerous goods, states, ``We expect 100
percent compliance for all shipments accepted and offered for air
transport.''
</P>
<P>
   And in another, dated March 28, 1998, Tom R. Olson, Emery's
director of primetime hub operations, said, ``We've got to close
the gap on these non-compliance shipments yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery Worldwide operates one of the biggest U.S. airlines
specializing in freight, serving customers from small retail
shippers to auto companies and the Department of Defense. Based in
Redwood City, Calif., Emery Worldwide has more than 75 cargo
aircraft, 2,000 trucks and vans, and 560 service centers in 229
countries.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an important part of the Dayton area's economy.
Emery's Dayton freight hub employs about 4,200 workers _ 60 percent
of them part-time _ and expansion plans here call for an additional
6,100 jobs. In April, the company and Dayton airport officials
announced a proposal to spend $1.2 billion in three phases over 20
years on runways, infrastructure and road construction in and
around the airport, mainly to support Emery's growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the freight business is also highly competitive, and company
documents suggest that Emery personnel can be under great pressure
to move hazardous materials to retain important customers.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 1, 1998, memo describing a partially damaged shipment,
an Emery manager warned that if the items weren't moved promptly,
``there could be a plant shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   After examining portions of Emery's internal documents regarding
the alleged violations, Mary Schiavo, former Inspector General of
the U.S. Department of Transportation, said Emery is running the
risk of being grounded by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Schiavo is the author of Flying Blind, Flying Safe , which is
critical of the FAA and warns the public about the most dangerous
planes and flying conditions. Schiavo is also a pilot, former
assistant U.S. attorney, and a professor of public policy at the
Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial reaction is it's pretty serious stuff and if it's
still going on they could be in for some big fines, and if they're
endangering passengers they could be in for worse action,'' Schiavo
said. ``The FAA hates to ground carriers, but if they won't shape
up, I suspect if it persists they might even have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Michael Maya Charles, a professional pilot for over 25
years and expert aviation witness and safety consultant, also
reviewed portions of the Emery documents.
</P>
<P>
   Charles, of Erie, Colo., said it is vital that pilots know
what's aboard their aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any problem with the shipment in flight, including
a fire, odors, or smoke (or) fumes, that listing of Hazmat is vital
to the health or lives of the crew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles said pilots have little tolerance for hazardous
materials being loaded aboard their aircraft without their
knowledge, but he said the penalties for such violations do little
to discourage the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, the penalties for Hazmat violations amount to
little more than hand slaps and fines,'' he said, ``which only
encourages the bold and the reckless to try shipping the high
tariff dangerous goods without telling the shipper.''

 &HT;    FAA investigating Emery Worldwide over hazardous materials
 &HT;    (Moving in national (a) and financial (f) categories.)
 &HT;    By Wes Hills, Timothy R. Gaffney and Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Federal Aviation Administration is
investigating allegations that Emery Worldwide shipped hazardous
materials without adequate documentation, failed to notify pilots
of hazardous cargo on board their aircraft and concealed problems
from FAA inspectors, the Dayton Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA began the investigation more than a month ago, said Bill
Wilkening, manager of the FAA's Dangerous Goods/Cargo Security
Division in Washington, D.C. Wilkening would say only that the FAA
is conducting a nationwide investigation and that the alleged
violations involve the shipment of hazardous materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we do have a national compliance inspection'' under
way, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two employees who worked at Emery's Dayton hub also told the
Daily News that they have been interviewed by an investigator from
the U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General's Office. A
spokeswoman in the office's Washington, D.C., headquarters would
not confirm an IG investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Emery spokesman Rocco Sacci acknowledged that FAA inspectors
have been auditing Emery Worldwide's operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that they have been to 15 of our some 200 locations,
and they have done various types of auditing, as they do . . .
checking our security procedures, and our Hazmat procedures and so
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacci said the ``audits'' have found, ``At the worst, maybe some
minor administrative violations . . . maybe mistagging, or
mislabeling, something like that there. But there have been no
penalties or fines or anything like that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA probe is focused on Emery's North American freight hub
at Dayton International Airport because much of the company's cargo
_ including hazardous materials _ flows through the hub. The Daily
News obtained copies of documents made available to the FAA that
show a hazardous materials supervisor at Emery's Dayton hub
repeatedly brought complaints of violations to her superiors but
she said little was done.
</P>
<P>
   Emery's Dayton hub processes about 5 million pounds of freight
daily, according to its 1998 annual report. Although only a small
percentage involve hazardous materials _ 3 percent, say company
officials _ Emery routinely ships explosives, flammable liquids,
toxic substances, radioactive materials and biomedical products,
documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are permitted to carry hazardous materials, but the
shipments are subject to strict federal regulations and require
special labeling, documentation, handling and loading.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkening said Emery personnel have been cooperating with
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   One Emery employee who said she has been interviewed extensively
by FAA investigators is Debbra O. Bullock, 40, who from July 1997
until October 1998 worked as a hazardous materials supervisor at
Emery's Dayton hub.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock agreed to speak to Dayton Daily News reporters in the
offices of her attorney, Lawrence J. Greger, after she was asked
about documents related to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Those documents, including numerous memos from Bullock to her
superiors warning of dangerous practices, describe a pattern of
violation after violation of hazardous materials laws over a
two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious allegations include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Sept. 26, 1998, memo by Bullock regarding the hiding from
FAA inspectors hazardous materials in an area ``way out past the
waste building in what used to be called the graveyard.'' The Daily
News could find no evidence that an Emery manager responded to the
memo.
</P>
<P>
   _ A lengthy and detailed memo of February 1998 alleging hundreds
of shipments of hazardous materials moving without paperwork or
pilot notification, a pattern one Emery manager described as
``alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Shipping materials Emery supervisors acknowledge are not
permitted ``in our system.''
</P>
<P>
   _ An acknowledgement by a hub supervisor that the handling of
hazardous materials ``has always taken a back seat to other
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacci said Emery would not respond to specific allegations
involved in the FAA investigation. But he called the company's
hazardous materials handling ``industry-leading.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery has ``spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and thousands
of hours in development and training to achieve what we believe to
be the finest program for the handling of Hazmat shipments that can
be found in the air industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock said during her tenure the company did improve its
compliance record. She said she succeeded in reducing the number of
compliance violations from 800 a month to about 100. However, she
said she asked to be removed from her position last fall because
she did not feel other supervisors shared her commitment to
complying with FAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 26, 1998, letter requesting a transfer, Bullock
stated, ``I love my job, I care about the company I work for, and I
see a large liability I feel has never been addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock said she first discovered that FAA rules were being
repeatedly ignored shortly after becoming hazardous materials
supervisor in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed there was a large number of hazardous materials that
were traveling out of compliance,'' Bullock said. ``Materials were
traveling through our process without being loaded correctly (and
without) pilot notification. The paperwork was not going with the
hazardous material, so therefore no one even knew the hazardous
material was on the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Federally-mandated paperwork that tracks and documents hazardous
shipments is a key component of safe transportation, Bullock said,
because pilots and ground crews must know the location and content
of hazardous freight aboard aircraft in the event of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA should have been notified when Emery violated federal
rules, but to Bullock's knowledge, federal authorities weren't
contacted.
</P>
<P>
   Her frustration and stress over conditions at the company boiled
over, Bullock said, when Emery passed an FAA inspection with flying
colors in September 1998 despite what she said were deeply
entrenched problems.
</P>
<P>
   Because Emery had prior knowledge of FAA visits, workers
successfully avoided problems by holding up hazardous materials
shipments for the period of the inspection, Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't set well with me,'' she said. ``I couldn't hardly
stomach it...I had people standing around everywhere because we
just hardly got any freight at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA acknowledged that it often informs companies like Emery
in advance when annual inspections occur so the people responsible
for hazardous materials will be available to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock also alleged that forms certifying that Emery planes
were loaded in accordance with FAA regulations carried a mechanical
signature of her name, even when she was not at work and had no
idea what was aboard a particular aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which means if your name's on there and there's a problem, the
FAA is going to call you and you're going to be the one held
accountable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock continues to work at Emery in another supervisory job.
She said the FAA has not offered her any job protection in exchange
for her cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was my obligation to continue to not lie to the FAA.
I felt I needed to answer their questions and answer them
honestly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers such as Emery have come under increasing scrutiny from
the FAA since the May 11, 1996, crash of ValuJet Flight 592 in the
Everglades that killed all 110 people aboard. Investigators blamed
the crash on a fire caused by oxygen generators that had been
improperly packaged, labeled and loaded into the plane's belly.
Following the crash, the FAA increased its hazardous materials
inspection staff from 12 to more than 130.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen generators use chemical reactions to produce oxygen.
Airlines use them in their emergency oxygen systems, but the FAA
banned passenger airlines from carrying them as freight after the
Valujet crash. Freight airliners may haul oxygen generators if they
follow strict packaging and loading rules. But Emery memos describe
errors that worried the company's hazardous materials supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Bullock wrote a memo that said an audit by the
hazardous materials department found hundreds of hazardous
materials shipments being moved without required documentation.
Noting one that contained oxygen generators, she wrote, ``This is
what brought down ValuJet.''
</P>
<P>
   An October 1998 memo by another hazardous materials supervisor
described how a shipment of oxygen generators got loaded into a
cargo container next to part of a shipment of paint. The oxygen
generator was classified as an oxidizer and the paint as a
flammable liquid, which the supervisor called ``incompatible
materials'' that should not have been loaded side-by-side in the
same container.
</P>
<P>
   That cargo container and another one containing the rest of the
paint shipment were loaded onto a plane bound for John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York. The improper loading was
discovered after some of the paint in the other cargo container was
spilled as it was being loaded, requiring both cargo containers to
be pulled from the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Had the spill happened in the cargo container containing the
oxygen generator, the supervisor wrote, ``the oxidizer could have
reacted with the paint causing a serious fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents show numerous Emery supervisors were aware of the
alleged violations.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, Bullock was urged by a supervisor to ship a
package of methanol even though Emery's policy prohibits it on
airplanes. The shipment had already been flown to the Dayton hub
from Oklahoma City, according to the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment ``was in fact not allowed in our system and should
not have been accepted,'' the supervisor wrote, ``but since it will
be flying only on Emery aircraft to the destination, we can move
this shipment, this once, on our aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The documents also, at times, reflect concerns of Emery
supervisors to comply with FAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sept. 2, 1998, memo, Mike A. Massie, director of
environmental affairs/dangerous goods, states, ``We expect 100
percent compliance for all shipments accepted and offered for air
transport.''
</P>
<P>
   And in another, dated March 28, 1998, Tom R. Olson, Emery's
director of primetime hub operations, said, ``We've got to close
the gap on these non-compliance shipments yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Emery Worldwide operates one of the biggest U.S. airlines
specializing in freight, serving customers from small retail
shippers to auto companies and the Department of Defense. Based in
Redwood City, Calif., Emery Worldwide has more than 75 cargo
aircraft, 2,000 trucks and vans, and 560 service centers in 229

</P>
<P>
   But the freight business is also highly competitive, and company
documents suggest that Emery personnel can be under great pressure
to move hazardous materials to retain important customers.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 1, 1998, memo describing a partially damaged shipment,
an Emery manager warned that if the items weren't moved promptly,
``there could be a plant shutdown.''
</P>
<P>

A CHANGE OF PHIL-OSOPHY

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Los Angeles Lakers were recently eliminated from the
NBA playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs, Jerry West had a lengthy
conversation with Jerry Buss.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about a variety of subjects, foremost of which who
would be coaching the Lakers next fall in their inaugural season at
the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson's name was mentioned, but Buss shook his head in
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of my price range,'' said the Laker owner.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Buss was set to retain Kurt Rambis, much to the
displeasure of most Laker fans, most members of the Southern
California media and Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   But then a few weeks later, West had another powwow with Buss at
his home near San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   And this time Buss, perhaps chastened by the withering criticism
he had been enduring for his desire to bring back the inexperienced
Rambis, was singing a different tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would it take to get Phil Jackson?'' Buss asked a
startled West.
</P>
<P>
   West threw out a number.
</P>
<P>
   Buss didn't blink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then go get him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And so Jerry West the past week has been in serious negotiations
with Jackson's agent, Todd Musberger, in a development stunning to
those who had been led to believe that Buss would be unwilling to
spend the kind of money necessary to lure the former coach of the
Chicago Bulls to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made a deal yet,'' said West Saturday. ``Phil
Jackson has not signed anything. I think we're close. I think it
can be done. The offer is out there. But you never know for sure
until all parties sign the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   It is believed the Lakers have offered Jackson a five-year
contract worth in the vicinity of $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   West said he still hasn't spoken to Jackson, but figures to
sometime this week. Jackson is scheduled to be in L.A. on Wednesday
to lend campaign support to his ex New York Knick teammate, Bill
Bradley, a Democratic presidential candidate. It won't be
surprising if Jackson arrives here earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Jerry Buss suddenly change his mind and decide to open
up his bank vault for Phil Jackson, who coached the Michael
Jordan-fueled Bulls to six NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm sure the Lakers' playoff failures in recent seasons
have something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The team hasn't won a world championship since 1988, hasn't been
in the finals since 1991, and has been swept in four games during
the past two post-season competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Such erratic deportment has to be grating to Buss, a man who had
come to savor all the national publicity he received when the
Lakers won five NBA crowns during his first nine seasons as their
owner.
</P>
<P>
   The last three coaches that Buss hired, Randy Pfund, Magic
Johnson and Rambis, have been huge disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the aging Buss didn't want to risk blowing another
Laker season with the unproven Rambis, who proved only during his
brief incumbency that he was far closer to being another Randy
Pfund than another Pat Riley.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the fact that Buss also has been absorbing his share of
media attacks in recent times---a new experience for him---might
have played a vital role in his deciding that Phil Jackson wasn't
too expensive for his tastes, after all.
</P>
<P>
   As you might known, Buss was denounced for nixing a 1997 trade
Jerry West had made for Mitch Richmond, was condemned for
conducting hardball contract negotiations with West, and had been
roundly ridiculed in recent weeks for choosing to ignore Jackson
because of financial considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if Buss were losing money on the Lakers, such fiscal
restraint on his part would have been quite understandable.
</P>
<P>
   But since it's known the Lakers are a lucrative enterprise and
that Buss earns anywhere between $25 and $35 million a year from
the team, Buss' posture toward Jackson wasn't exactly tenable.
</P>
<P>
   It became obvious to anyone who had only the barest knowledge of
basketball that the undisciplined, disoriented Lakers, with two
players of exceptional athletic skills in Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant who have been unable to play effectively together, were in
desperate need of a strong leader with established credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Who better than Phil Jackson, who pushed all the right buttons
with the Bulls including even the ones geared toward Dennis Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil's really a good guy,'' said West, who played against
Jackson when Jackson was a reserve forward with the Knicks. ``The
players he's coached liked him, but he can be quite tough. He's
also an extremely hard worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Securing Jackson's services will take a chunk out of Buss'
private profits, but Buss figures to make up for such lost revenue
if Jackson is able to get the Lakers to the same level that he did
the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson was the beneficiary in Chicago of coaching the
greatest player in all the seasons of basketball in Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   He won't have such a divine force in Los Angeles, but the wily
Jackson knows the Lakers aren't exactly undermanned with the
presence of O'Neal, Bryant and Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been all very interesting,'' said West, who seems
genuinely excited by the imminent arrival of Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike others in recent years, this is one Jerry Buss decision
that Jerry West clearly endorses.

   WASHINGTON _ While Texas Gov. George W. Bush was making his Iowa
debut Saturday, Vice President Al Gore sketched a Democratic
presidential campaign that he said will be grounded in family and
children's issues _ and PG-rated in its approach to his Republican
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to bring about revolutionary improvements in our public
schools and give families a chance to be strong and live in safe
and liveable communities,'' Gore said in a roundtable discussion
with political writers in the vice president's residence at the
Naval Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would push for ``full access to high-quality
pre-school for every child in America,'' and smaller class sizes
all the way through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing Bush and Elizabeth Dole in early polls, Gore has moved
up his campaign kickoff in his home of Carthage, Tenn., to
Wednesday. It's a political launch in which he faces the tricky
task of identifying himself with the economic good times the nation
is enjoying, while setting a course independent of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I represent is continuity where the prosperity is
concerned, but dramatic change where our approach to solving social
problems is concerned,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's advisers have predicted the Gore strategy will be
to wear down their candidate over what promises to be a very long
general election campaign, one that will grow increasingly nasty
and personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Gore said, repeating a pledge by his
campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, that anyone engaging in ``that kind
of activity'' will be fired, with ``no appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore was also asked about his choice of Coelho, who is
considered to have pioneered many of the fund-raising practices
which have been a source of political trouble for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been friends for more than 20 years and I don't think
there's anybody more capable of being a national campaign
chairman,'' Gore replied tersely.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he'd not seen the televised coverage of
Bush's speech earlier Saturday in Cedar Rapids and declined to
comment directly on some of the Texas governor's tax-reduction
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   But he had a reply, nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the keys to keeping our prosperity going is
steadfastness in rejecting risky tax schemes based on political
appeals to the extreme right that threaten to drive the economy
straight into the ditch,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of the discussion with the vice president dealt with
domestic matters.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gore said he'd had an hour-and-15-minute telephone call
earlier in the day with Sergei Stepashin, the new Russian prime
minister, about the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Russian troops that moved into Pristina was ``not a
militarily significant force'' and expressed confidence that
frictions with the Russians could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   He credited Russian emissary Victor Chernomyrdin with ``the key
role in bringing about an end to the conflict and said he had done
``a spectacular job.''

ZEN AND JERRYS IN A KOAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a season in detox, the NBA will wave the white flag at its
addiction to Zen and Jerrys.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Zen and Jerrys will be served in a koan.
</P>
<P>
   This timing is better than swell. As the next millennium grinds
to within walking distance, the Phil-osophy of the East is poised
to collide with the protocol of the West ... Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling into Laker Acres behind the wheel of luxury karma is
Phil Jackson, Zen Master P, the coach/spirit guide who coaxed six
championships out of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the rings, Jackson's Windy City flavor had been
reduced to a bitter strain of wavy gravy. His stream of higher
consciousness was rippled by a celebrated power struggle between
himself and personnel serpent Jerry Krause, who wore the blessing
of Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf.
</P>
<P>
   Now on the cusp of becoming warlord of the Lakers, Jackson will
be under the scrutiny of two more big-time Jerrys, West and Buss.
</P>
<P>
   Did either side really have a choice?
</P>
<P>
   If he never coached again, the perception of Jackson's legacy
would be limited to his uncanny knack for putting Jordan in the
starting lineup. Oh, he wasn't about to validate his genius by
hauling the triangle offense to a risky site such as Vancouver. But
the Lakers just happen to satisfy the league-championship recipe
for Hall of Fame-caliber talent.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence suggests that hiring Jackson could bring the type
of immediate results you might achieve by assigning Dirty Harry to
direct traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over in Inglewoodstock, a franchise that has
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant on the payroll is riding the crest
of two consecutive season-ending playoff sweeps. It had begun to
look like the only Jackson who could handle this crisis was Jesse.
</P>
<P>
   Short of Pat Riley, Zen Master P may be the only coach in
captivity with the historical chutzpah to stand up to this Laker
cast.
</P>
<P>
   So, with Phil on the bench, the next order of business will be
selecting a championship parade route. Right? Well, for reality's
sake, let's send the clue bus on that first victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   The only guarantees Jackson brings are greater expectation and
relentless drama.
</P>
<P>
   OK, he did weave a convincing psyche job through the fabric of
his Bulls teams. But the Lakers and their management team (don't
forget Earvin Johnson) suit up more ego per square inch than roll
call at the Academy Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls weren't starving for ego either, but they ran behind
the lead of one alpha dog ... Jordan. The Lakers, on the other
hand, have two many pups barking at the same time. Jackson, who has
a couple of books on his resume, will be challenged to steer Shaq
and Kobe onto the same page.
</P>
<P>
   West's duty will be selecting the proper supporting mutts to
fill in around them.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been interesting if this week's rumored
acquisition of Scottie Pippen was more than a rumor. A source close
to West said it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   With Pippen in the lineup, Jackson may have convinced the Lakers
to embrace his concept of Zen defense.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of defense: While major league baseball is under siege
by purists who believe it's suffering from too much offense, the
NBA has been accused of screaming in the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough scoring, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry ... a few league sharpies are attempting to concoct
remedies. One such notion - fueled by frequent sightings of
low-post sluggos burning 15 seconds while backing toward the hoop -
is to outlaw the illegal defense.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow the illogical defense ... the zone.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, striving to improve point production by allowing a zone
would be as strategically absurd as promoting population control by
passing out Barry White CDs.
</P>
<P>
   But sources close to the NBA's competition committee doubt that
any wild changes in defensive freedom or shot-clock duration will
occur. One change that could happen is altering the lane to conform
with the triangular shape used in international play.
</P>
<P>
   Boo. That would cripple low-post activity. Think ``A Rik Smits
in every garage.''
</P>
<P>
   The best move would be resurrecting the ol' five-second count
for a closely guarded ballhandler. That would discourage backing in
and send Charles Barkley to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   And if the league insists on stirring up more offense, it should
encourage its referees to call fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Still pitching Penny: Yeah, it's June, a month for kids to be
released into the wild, and a time for reporters to hurl a few
trade rumors against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   One that won't stick is this week's fictional tale concerning
Penny Hardaway and the Clippers. According to a popular New York
news sharpie, the Clips were prepared to package their first-round
pick (No. 4 overall) with two re-signed free agents (Lamond Murray
and Rodney Rogers) and send this gift to Orlando in exchange for
Penny.
</P>
<P>
   The talk-radio bandwagon was crowded in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to sources for both teams, that deal hasn't
been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, the Clippers, who reporters think are to the baggage
of other teams as Mikey is to Life cereal, don't need to deal the
pick for a big-ticket free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Come July 1, they will experience something wonderful ...
serious cap room. If Penny wanted to play for them (doubtful) in
the first place - and they wouldn't make a trade without such an
agreement - the Clippers could buy him and keep their draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't seem to have is an owner who will commit to the
85 million scoots Hardaway is seeking and the $70 million-plus tab
to re-sign Maurice Taylor in the same summer.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway as a Clipper is not impossible, but in a climate of
pinch, don't expect Penny.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-draft campfire: According to snitches reporting from the
NBA's Pre-Draft Camp at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, the
action has been as promising as an airport bar at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the draft's expected heavyweights didn't participate,
but Corey Maggette, the lottery's X-factor, did provide something
to chatter about. Maggette, who's from Chicago, did (with the help
of an eager agent) stage a one-man workout for representatives of
13 teams in an attempt to prove leaving Duke after his freshman
year is not a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Including the water breaks, said one scout, the Maggette show
lasted about 20 minutes. All the 6-foot-6 helicopter did was miss
an inordinate amount of unguarded, mid-range jump shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it won't matter,'' the scout said. ``Some team will look
at him and see (1999 rookie of the year) Vince Carter. They'll be
too scared not to take him. But Carter has much better skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Maggette will be in L.A. on Friday to put his skills to the test
of the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Shot-clock violations: If you're shocked by the playoff
performance of the Knicks' Marcus Camby, you probably didn't see
him outplay Tim Duncan when UConn defeated Wake Forest during their
junior season. Camby finished the season as the national Player of
the Year. ... Two players who have worked out for the Lakers are
Arizona point guard Jason Terry and Duke sniper Trajan Langdon. ...
Isiah Thomas remains the grapevine favorite to coach the Wasington
Wizards, but don't be surprised if he after putting together a
group of investors buys the CBA. He then would attempt to make the
CBA a true minor league for the NBA. ... Next month, an arbitrator
will decide if the league's new collective bargaining agreement
allows Jalen Rose to become a free agent or keeps him on the
Indiana roster for one more season. Rose would be a hot free-agent
commodity, but don't forget that his agent is L.A.-based and
Clipper-friendly Norm Nixon, and a close friend is Clip star Mo
Taylor, like Rose an ex-Michigan Wolverine. ... Dennis Rodman took
a verbal shot or two at Jerry West this week, proving that it's
much easier to put your foot in your mouth when you can't find your
shoes.

US ATTEMPTS TO SMOOTH OVER DIFFERENCES WITH RUSSIA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Their thunder stolen by the Russians and
their progress slowed by thunderstorms, NATO troops rolled into
Kosovo Saturday, beginning the peacekeeping operation aimed at
getting 850,000 refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
   Led by an advance party of British troops that disarmed some
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels and Serb police officers, the first
NATO forces to enter Kosovo proceeded slowly and cautiously,
fearing land mines and booby traps in the eight tunnels and 50
miles between the Macedonian border and the Kosovar capital. But
the tedious trek from Macedonia, where British and other NATO
troops have been waiting for months, went without major incident.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment coincided with the effort by US officials to
smooth diplomatic relations with Russia, negotiating with Moscow
over the terms of the peacekeeping mission after the unexpected
arrival of Russian troops in Kosovo earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian movement remained a mystery Saturday. Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen said he did ``not know what the
motivation was,'' although he and other US officials insisted the
200-member Russian convoy was militarily insignificant and a minor
glitch in an overall triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to working with Russia and others who may not
have agreed with our military campaign, but do agree with the
proposition that all the people of that tiny land, Serb and
Albanian alike, should be able to live in peace and freedom,''
President Clinton said in a commencement speech at the University
of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the dispute is who will command Russian troops _
NATO or Russia. Russian leaders say they will not be a part of a
NATO-led Kosovo-Force (K-FOR) peacekeeping unit; NATO has said it
will not accept a separate Russian patrolling zone, for fear it
would lead to the partitioning of Kosovo. Cohen reiterated that
demand Saturday, saying ``there must be NATO forces throughout the
region and NATO in every sector, and they will be under a unified
command.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, as Russian and NATO soldiers faced each other
for the first time in Pristina, it was still unclear how the matter
would be resolved, despite a day of talks in Moscow between Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and the Russian national security
chief, Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov. Vice President Al Gore also phoned Russian
Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and had a ``very constructive,''
hourlong conversation, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   But a Russian participant in the talks said the United States
had taken a ``rigid'' position and indicated that the sides were
still far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs within Kosovo took delight in the early arrival of the
Russians, because it upstaged NATO and because they consider
Russians, their fellow Orthodox Christian Slavs, an important
counterweight to the Western allies. The Russians proceeded to the
airport, where there was a brief but tense standoff between
British, Russian and Yugoslav forces late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The British forces had spent the day journeying into Pristina,
becoming the first Western presence in Kosovo in nearly three
months. They were greeted along the road by a mixture of cheers
from scattered local Albanians and jeers from Serbs, many of whom
continued to flee the province.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant James Blount of the British Army's Household Cavalry
Regiment, who surveyed the journey into Kosovo from the top of a
Scimitar light tank, described the landscape of burned-out homes as
eerie. His firsthand glimpse of ethnic cleansing underscored the
necessity of the mission, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen a single civilian yet,'' said Blount, as the
convoy of the first NATO troops stopped about 20 miles within
Kosovo. ``Everybody's gone. It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, bursts of automatic gunfire sounded around Pristina
frequently Saturday and into Saturday night, a not so subtle
reminder to occupying forces that they are surrounded by a heavily
armed, hostile local population, albeit one that grows smaller by
the day as Serbs continue to leave Kosovo in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Serb humiliation was evident on the face of a police officer,
one of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's feared Interior
Ministry police, blamed for most of the atrocities during the
conflict, who was disarmed just south of Urosevac. Another police
officer who had his sidearm taken away covered his empty holster
with his right hand as photographers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   British Army Captain Frasier Rea, leading the first NATO troops
into Kosovo, a dozen members of the Royal Gurkha Rifles Regiment,
took a submachine gun from the officer, who said he needed it for
protection from the Kosovo Liberation Army as he drove south.
</P>
<P>
   Rea, who was in the first NATO vehicle, a Land Rover, to drive
into Kosovo, insisted there were no hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them very politely,'' he said. ``We've had very
little trouble. We've met VJ forces, KLA, everyone's been friendly.
Everyone understands the terms of the military-technical
agreement.'' VJ is an acronym for the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for all Serb forces to withdraw from Kosovo
within the next eight days.
</P>
<P>
   The first NATO troops on the ground inside Kosovo were the
Gurkhas, a British regiment recruited from Nepal. NATO's
multicultural troops provided a contrast to the forces representing
Serbia, which has provoked four wars in 10 years in a policy aimed
at creating a Serb-dominated nation.
</P>
<P>
   Gurkha Corporal Chet Gurung, 30, said he was not concerned that
the Russians had beat them into Kosovo. ``Not a worry,'' Gurung
said, his machine gun at the ready. ``Peace already dawned.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet officials in the United States and Russia were far less
certain of how those roles would be carved up. Saturday night, no
one seemed to know if the Russian deployment was intentional, or if
it indicated the Russian military was wildly out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov, the foreign minister, said early Saturday that the
Russian troops had entered Kosovo by mistake and that they had been
ordered to leave the province. But late Saturday, the Russian
troops were still in Pristina and Russian news agencies reported
that reinforcements were ready to leave for Kosovo. At the same
time, Russian President Boris Yeltsin promoted the general who led
the unit, Viktor Zavarzin, to the rank of three-star general,
indicating approval at the highest levels. Clinton and Yeltsin are
scheduled to have a conference call Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen reported from Pristina; Kornblut from Washington. Also
contributing were Globe staff members David Filipov from Moscow,
Susan Milligan from Kukes, Albania, and Globe Correspondent Kurt
Pitzer from southeastern Kosovo.

BUSH MAKES IT OFFICIAL, BUT WHAT DOES HE DO NEXT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ Barely five minutes after stepping off a
plane dubbed ``Great Expectations'' and setting foot on Iowa soil,
George W. Bush Saturday dropped any pretense that he is only
exploring a presidential candidacy and vowed to earn the Republican
nomination by appearing on every porch in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if on cue, an old Stevie Wonder tune blared from the
loudspeakers: ``Here I am, baby! Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm
yours!''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that, in these first instants of Bush's campaign, the
dilemma of the Republican front-runner was on vivid display. The
son of former President Bush made it clear that he needs to prove
he deserves the nomination, but that he has been perceived by many
as a shoo-in _ signed, sealed, delivered _ before having uttered a
single campaign speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running for president of the United States,'' Bush said.
``There is no turning back, and I intend to be the next president
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   While few have doubted in recent months that Bush was running,
this was the first time he uttered his intentions without
condition. He outlined a broad agenda, with few specifics, that
included his signature theme of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to reduce marginal tax rates, but didn't say by how
much. He backed the idea of putting Social Security contributions
in private accounts, but didn't provide any details.
</P>
<P>
   Laid-back, wearing his usual cowboy boots and oversized belt
buckle, Bush seemed alternately bemused and awed by the support for
him in the polls. Frequently poking fun at himself, Bush said he
was given this advice by his wife, Laura: ``Don't try to be
charming, witty, or intelligent. Just be yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was impossible to gauge how his support translated
among the public of Cedar Rapids. Bush said, ``I'm taking my
front-porch campaign to every front porch in this state,'' but he
appeared on no front porches Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's events were mostly closed to the public, with an airport
hanger rally that was equally divided between 200 media and
supporters, and a $30-a-plate fund-raiser for Representative Jim
Nussle that was attended by 500 contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Many who heard him were enthusiastic. ``I like him,'' said Vern
Engeberg, who drove 225 miles from Council Bluffs to hear Bush
speak. ``He wants control back locally and education for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I came with an open mind,'' said Bonnie Fascher of Coggon, who
left as a supporter. ``He was down to earth and brought back the
basic ideas of government and morality and education.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people have only a vague notion of where Bush stands on
an array of issues. Even Texas Monthly magazine, which has covered
the governor for years, published a cover story this month titled
``Who is George W. Bush?'' At one event Saturday, some people held
signs filled with question marks. The meaning was explained in
minuscule type at the bottom of the posters: ``Paid for by the
Democratic National Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, speaking at the historic Amana Colonies before a
made-for-television stage surrounded by bales of hay and fork-lift
trucks, did not propose any government programs to close what he
called a ``gap of hope.'' Instead, he proposed to rally the
``armies of compassion'' at churches, synagogues, mosques, and
charities ``to encourage an outpouring of giving in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Bush's rivals, most notably his father's running mate,
former vice president Dan Quayle, have criticized Bush's
compassionate conservativism as code for being moderate. But Bush
said Saturday, ``I'm proud to be a compassionate conservative. I
welcome the label.''
</P>
<P>
   In a quick stop to visit with a half-dozen people at a downtown
church mission, Bush listened to some women explain how they had
gotten off welfare with the love and friendship of church members.
Bush jumped out of his folding chair with enthusiasm, saying: ``You
can't pass a law to make a law to make people love one another. I
wish you could.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many candidates, Bush did not devote his talks here
Saturday to telling his life story, which during his early years
included many years of hard drinking and has led him to say that
``When I was young and irresponsible, I was young and
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush said that if he is elected president, he would
launch a ``responsibility era.'' He decried the culture that says
``When it feels good, do it,'' and he warned _ without telling of
his own successful struggle to quit drinking _ that ``alcohol will
ruin your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at an appearance before campaign volunteers in Des
Moines, Bush announced that he would participate in an Aug. 14
straw poll for Iowa Republicans, which significantly raises the
stakes for that event.
</P>
<P>
   For months, polls have shown Bush is the front-runner, and a
Time/CNN poll released Saturday showed him defeating Vice Presdient
Al Gore 55 percent to 42 percent. Among Republicans, 54 percent
favored him for the nomination, compared with 14 percent for
Elizabeth Dole and 8 percent for Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who had postponed his trip until the Texas Legislature
ended its sesson two weeks ago, began his first campaign foray out
of the Lone Star State aboard a TWA charter jet dubbed ``Great
Expectations,'' which turned out to be the theme of the trip. The
Bush campaign distributed T-shirts that said ``I have Great
Expectations for Governor Bush,'' as well as star-shaped toys that
said ``Squeeze for Lower Expectations,'' and even a baseball-themed
luggage tag that asked reporters to rate Bush's performance from
``Grand Slam'' to ``Back to the Minors.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the Bush campaign produced all these clever
items that someone realized that the theme is borrowed from a
Charles Dickens novel that tells how great expectations are not
always met. Bush was said to be unfamiliar with the novel and with
the conventional wisdom that most campaigns prefer to lower
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Bush boarded the jet in the Austin dawn and promptly assumed the
role of flight attendant, picking up the cabin microphone and
drolly warned that the campaign might experience turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your candidate speaking,'' Bush said gravely. ``We
know you have a choice of candidates when you fly, and we
appreciate you choosing Great Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no other Republican candidate from the field of 10 or
so has offered anything like the opening day tour provided by Bush.
By putting off his campaign for so many months while retaining
front-runner status, Bush was able to attract more than 100 members
of the media for four days of campaigning in Iowa, New Hampshire,
and Massachusetts, along with a stop Sunday at the family compound
in Kennebunkport, Maine.

 &HT;    NATO FORCES ARRIVE IN PRISTINA: Situation tense as Serbs
retreat, Russians stay put
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-TROOPS-0613; KOSOVO-DEATHS-0613-1STLD.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ What began as NATO's exuberant liberation
of Kosovo Saturday turned into a dangerously edgy co-existence here
with Russian troops and Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO and Russian generals were negotiating at the city
airport to clarify command control of Pristina, automatic weapons
fire periodically erupted around the city, and burning buildings
still smoldered both in this provincial capital and its outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   NATO clearly was not in charge. Not only had the nearly 300
Russian troops dug in Friday night at the airport NATO planned to
take as its own headquarters, but armed Yugoslav soldiers and Serb
police were making conspicuous patrols around Pristina's streets.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin were
expected to tackle the question personally in a telephone
conversation Sunday, in hopes they can make more progress than
envoys who once again on Saturday failed to resolve the issue of
exactly what Russia's peacekeeping role should be.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 additional Russian troops were expected to move
soon into Kosovo from nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces are not required to depart this central sector of
Kosovo for several days yet, but any NATO troops expecting to
dominate this territory were sorely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the juxtaposition of NATO and Yugoslav forces was
jarring. The incoming NATO convoy met Serb tanks and trucks moving
in the opposite direction -- apparently on their way out of Kosovo
-- and the Serb soldiers gleefully smiled and flashed their
three-fingered ``V'' for victory sign.
</P>
<P>
   At one intersection, a NATO tank was the staunch sentry on one
corner, while a Serb tank was an equally solid presence on another.
</P>
<P>
   Small Serb military convoys appeared to be leaving in accordance
with the Military-Technical Agreement (MTA) under which Yugoslavia
agreed to pull all its forces out of Kosovo within 11 days. U.S.
Army Gen. Wesley, the supreme NATO commander, has since said that
the Serb pull-out may take 3-4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, called the first meeting between British and Russian
forces at Pristina's airport ``cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coordinated occupation right now and the final details
are going to be worked out,'' Shelton told reporters, adding that
there would be 800 NATO troops in the area by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   British Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, the NATO commander whose
troops had been talking for days of capturing the Pristina airport
on their first day in the province, did give a statesman's response
to the situation upon arrival here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome here the Russian KFOR commander,'' Jackson said,
referring to the name of the international peacekeepers here --
Kosovo Force. ``We are setting in place the command structure
necessary to oversee the entire KFOR force.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether referring to Pristina's gun-happy Serbs, or merely
issuing a general warning, Jackson emphasized that KFOR will
vigorously carry out terms of the agreement Yugoslavia's military
leaders signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence or non-compliance will not be tolerated from
whichever quarter it may come,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Serbs believe NATO forces will be unwilling or unable
to save them from revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians, and see
Russian troops as their protectors.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and American officials were stunned when a convoy of
Russian soldiers moved into Kosovo's capital about 1 a.m. (local
time) Saturday and were met by thousands of cheering Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov went on CNN and said the
troops had arrived ``unfortunately'' from Bosnia and had been
ordered to leave Kosovo. But Russian media later said no such
orders had been issued. After parading through Pristina, the
Russians deployed at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   President Yeltsin's top foreign affairs aide, Sergei Prikhodko,
said on Saturday that Yeltsin himself had given the deployment
order, but left the timing of the move up to the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been expected to take part in the peacekeeping force,
but has been unsuccessful in negotiations with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to secure control of a sector of
its own -- alongside allies Italy, Germany, France and Great
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, whose talks are to resume Sunday with Ivanov, has
suggested that a Russian brigade serve in the American sector in
southeastern Kosovo and report to American general -- similar to
the arrangement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The tension here was a palpable presence Saturday. Serb families
were on the roads departing the province altogether or moving from
isolated villages to the protection of numbers in this city with a
large Serb population.
</P>
<P>
   They and their possessions were stuffed in cars and trucks and
the same kind of tractor wagons that ethnic Albanians used to flee
Kosovo under the rigorous Serb ethnic cleansing campaign that
finally appeared to be ending with the signing of the military
document. Now it became the Serbs' turn to run.
</P>
<P>
   A plump Serb woman walking in the cool rain exemplified the
intense animosity dividing the ethnic communities here. She began
vile swearing when she happened upon two carloads of Western
journalists sitting at the side of a street entering Pristina,
trying to fix one of their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out from here. Go away,'' she said. ``Tonight we will
massacre the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   The day started on a dramatically different note for the
hundreds of tanks and trucks and armored carriers that convoyed
from Camp Able Sentry outside Skopje, Macedonia, north across the
border into Kosovo for the first time Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian refugees cheered their departure from Macedonia,
and they proceeded largely uneventfully across the border and into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The British vanguard of paratroopers and Nepalese Ghurka Rifles
had little trouble clearing the road of explosives for the
following troops, but they strung boundary strings on both sides of
the pavement to indicate the limited area known to be safe to walk
or drive.
</P>
<P>
   And French tanks were halted by a minefield along the
Yugoslav-Macedonian border. A French mine-clearing team was
dispatched to the area, while 1,200 French infantry were preparing
to leap-frog over the minefield to fan out into the province.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans -- including liaison and de-mining personnel --
and about 200 Germans crossed the border, too, and the Italians
were to enter Kosovo later Saturday. A larger contingent of the
expected 8,500 Germans were to march into Kosovo from Albania on
Sunday, and U.S. Marines were to move in as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Once over the border, the convoy passed a virtually de-populated
land for at least 12 miles. Wrecked cars and ransacked roadside
restaurants gave way to entire villages where not a person nor an
intact window could be seen. Homes and apartments had big black
squares where windows should have been reflecting the bright
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Roses bloomed outside empty, often fire-scarred homes, adding
gentle color to the eerily silent scenery. At some apartments, a
few items of clothing still hung on balcony washlines, testimony to
the inhabitants' hasty departure.
</P>
<P>
   The first small group of waving people appeared just beyond the
town of Kacanik, but then more nearly abandoned villages filled the
otherwise bucolic countryside where lavender waved a blueish tint
to the fields and Queen Anne's lace made dots of white.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers and greenery of trees spreading over mountainsides
were an unseemly blend both with the destruction of the buildings
-- nearly every gas station and restaurant was damaged and empty --
and the presence of so many troops stationed to secure the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops lolled in a soccer field, stretched out on the sides
of roads, stripped to the waist to wash at an abandoned gas station
and threw up tents at a non-working brick factory.
</P>
<P>
   One farmer was seen haying in his field.
</P>
<P>
   When more people did begin to appear, they were an adoring
audience for the passing troops.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Urosevac, about 100 ethnic Albanians flocked
to the roadsides and cheered the incoming troops. They waved flower
bouquets and shouted ``NATO! NATO!'' and many reached onto the road
to touch the slower moving vehicles. Some even pulled at branches
of green camouflage and, if successful, wore it in their hair.
</P>
<P>
   At one roadside collection of smiling Kosovars, 31-year-old Ilaz
Noradimi told how his family had moved from place to place three
times after their own home was burned down. He was elated to see
the troops arrive in this cooling and clouding up afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were coming. We saw the helicopters,'' he said.
``This is the first time we have been outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others said Serb troops continued burning homes even on
Saturday, making a last statement before they left the region. And
smoldering remains suggested that was so.
</P>
<P>
   Noradimi, 34, said the ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo have
been ``in a bad state'' for more than a decade, and now in the
faces of the passing NATO soldiers, in the tanks and guns and their
support for Kosovar Albanians, he saw the light of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first day we feel free,'' he said.

RUSSIAN MOVE NO MISTAKE, MOSCOW SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The unexpected arrival of Russian troops in Kosovo was
no mistake, but a calculated move to spoil NATO's victory party and
to ensure a central peacekeeping role for Russia, officials and
commentators here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They said the orders to deploy 200 Russian paratroopers early
Saturday in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, were issued by the chief of
Russia's general staff, almost certainly with the prior agreement
of Yugoslav leaders and most likely with the approval of Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise deployment won praise here as a victory for Russia,
but caused alarm in Western capitals over Moscow's intentions and
raised speculation about whether the military was acting on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   It also prompted Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, to tell
CNN early Saturday that the troops' arrival in Pristina was a
``mistake'' that would be corrected by the force's immediate
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   But the troops stayed put. Officials later said Ivanov had not
been informed of the plan. He was not alone: Russian NTV television
reported that Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, who was out of town,
was also out of the loop, as was Russia's national security chief,
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   NTV reported that the order had been given by General Anatoly
Kvashnin, the head of Russia's general staff and one of a number of
senior Russian officers who have grumbled that the peace deal
between Belgrade and NATO brokered by Russian special envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin had sold out Russia's interests. A Russian official,
who asked not to be named, confirmed that Kvashnin, one of the few
officials with direct access to the reclusive Yeltsin, had issued
the order to move.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's top foreign affairs aide, Sergei Prikhodko, said that
the president himself had approved the deployment, but that the
timing of the move _ before NATO forces entered into Kosovo _ was
the decision of the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the presence of the Russian contingent in Kosovo is
concerned, there are instructions from the president,'' Prikhodko
told reporters. ``The responsibility for their fulfillment and
timing depends on the military.''
</P>
<P>
   While Yeltsin did not mention Yugoslavia at a Kremlin ceremony
for Russian Independence Day Saturday, he promoted the commander of
the Russian contingent in Kosovo, Viktor Zavarzin, to the rank of
three-star general.
</P>
<P>
   The early-bird Russian intervention occurred as talks between
Russian and US officials failed to produce a role Moscow could
accept for its peacekeepers. Russia's negotiators, led by another
staunch critic of Chernomyrdin's diplomacy, General Leonid Ivashov,
had insisted that Russian troops would have their own sector
outside of NATO command. NATO was not ready to allow that, and
Russian officials were worried they would be excluded from the
force altogether if they did not act fast.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan, Yugoslav authorities escorted the troops
to the Pristina airport, the exact spot where NATO had been
expected to set up the command post for their force's commander,
British Lieutenant General Michael Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the troops had not entered Kosovo Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, they
would have never entered,'' the Interfax news agency quoted a
military official as saying. ``Moscow had to act to prevent that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Lukin, the politically moderate chairman of
parliament's foreign affairs committee, offered a similar
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO had impudently decided to turn a UN operation into a NATO
operation,'' Lukin said. ``Something had to be done, and it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Who commands its troops is a matter of both pride and principle
for Russia, which opposed the NATO airstrikes against its Serb
allies and considers the Western alliance the aggressor in the
conflict. But participating in the peacekeeping force is no less
important for Moscow, which wants to keep its hand in a region it
considers its sphere of influence. The Russian military said
Saturday it had given the order for 2,000 troops to join the
international force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's assertive move contrasted with its behavior in recent
years. Moscow, wary of the growth of US influence as its own clout
diminishes, has often criticized the West over such foreign policy
issues as the bombing of Iraq and the expansion of NATO. But
Yeltsin has been wary of forcing an open confrontation with the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the first time in his presidency that Russia has
defied the West with troops, and the move won praise from such
diverse sources as the Kremlin's Communist opponents in parliament
and the liberal media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia stole from NATO the victory in the Kosovo conflict,''
NTV commented.
</P>
<P>
   Some pro-Western politicians objected to the Russian troop
movements, saying it hurt Russia's international status more than
it helped it, while others portrayed the event as a kind of
military coup.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker Sergei Yushenkov and other commentators suggested that
Yeltsin had been forced to accept the generals' plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin had no option but to go along,'' said Pavel
Felgenhauer, defense analyst for the newspaper Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   But it is equally possible that Yeltsin decided to go ahead with
the plan because it gives his unpopular regime an easy domestic
victory, and an obvious scapegoat _ the military leaders _ if
something goes wrong. This is a favorite Yeltsin tactic.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader is also known for extracting revenge on those
who betray him in impulsive, demonstrative manuevers. Once, in a
fit of pique at his onetime mentor, Mikhail Gorbachev, Yeltsin took
away the former Soviet leader's cars, guards, and cottage. This
spring, when Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov got a little too
popular for the Kremlin leader's liking, Yeltsin took away his job.
</P>
<P>
   It is plausible that after weeks of seeing his objections about
NATO airstrikes ignored, Yeltsin is trying to take away the victory
from the man he used to call ``My friend Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness Yeltsin's caustic televised remarks after Clinton
thanked him for mediating a deal with Belgrade: ``Saturday Bill
Clinton called,'' Yeltsin said. ``Can you imagine? It turns out I'm
their good guy, their diplomat, and so on and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   If past battles that Yeltsin has won are any indication, the
Russian leader, after his conversation with Clinton Sunday, will
let others manage the crisis he has created. And it will likely end
with a face-saving deal with NATO that makes the West forget this
crisis ever happened.

RUSSIA FACES DIFFICULTY MANNING FORCE IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND DMITRY SHALGANOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHELYABINSK, Russia _ The fast entry of 200 Russian paratroopers
into Kosovo early Saturday put the Russian military where it wants
to be _ at the center of the peacekeeping operation in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Russian Army, cash-strapped and undermanned, faces a new
problem: where to find a few good men to beef up its peacekeeping
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Dmitriyev, 21, fits the bill. He wears a Mohawk hairdo
and a skull-and-crossbones medallion engraved with the words
``master artillery operator.'' He bears scars from his year of
combat in Chechnya as a private in a special forces unit. It was
the only job Dmitriyev, a high school dropout, ever loved.
</P>
<P>
   So when the military sent out the call for volunteers with
combat experience to join a Russian peacekeeping force for Kosovo,
Dmitriyev made a beeline to the draft board in this industrial Ural
Mountains city.
</P>
<P>
   He did not care where he would serve, or that Moscow and NATO
have not been able to agree on who will command Russia's troops, or
that Russia's Parliament has angrily denounced the peace agreement
that paved the way for a NATO-dominated peacekeeping force to begin
entering Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just gonna do it for Russia,'' Dmitriyev said minutes
after signing up this week. ``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not all. Dmitriyev and the other members of the
600-member force being assembled here will earn salaries starting
at $1,000 a month, over five times the average wage in Russia, for
their service in Kosovo, according to Russian military officials in
Chelyabinsk.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has said it will provide 10,000 of the expected 50,000
troops, but insisted that they not be under NATO command. NATO has
made it equally clear that it will form the ``core'' of the force,
and provide its commander.
</P>
<P>
   Russia does not have many troops ready to go, and that poses a
problem. The best peacekeeping troops Russia has are the 1,300
troops stationed in Bosnia, source of the 200 troops sent to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of any force Moscow sends will probably be cobbled
together from a number of units and regions.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Russia pulls together the troops it needs, a dire cash
shortage will make it difficult to send them to Kosovo. Once the
most feared fighting force on the planet, Russia's 1.2 million
servicemen are poorly paid and fed worse. Officers and
noncommissioned officers, strapped for cash because of chronically
late paychecks, moonlight as parking attendants and night watchmen
to pay their bills. Draftees beg for money on the streets in cities
and live off the land in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Brutal hazing is widespread. Last week in the Russian far east,
an entire platoon of 45 recent draftees deserted and later told
police they had left to flee physical abuse by their superior
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Morale is low, especially after the stinging defeat handed the
military after the 1994-1996 war in Chechnya. Russian Prime
Minister Sergei Stepashin said the military is in a ``catastrophic
state.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Chelyabinsk signup, which began last week,
comes in. Military officials bet that the cream of the 400,000
officers and soldiers demobilized during the cutbacks might be
lured by the promise of a well-paying, prestigious assignment. But
with a few exceptions like Viktor Dmitriyev, this has only been
half true: Many of the volunteers interviewed said money was their
main motivation for signing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life has forced me to go to Kosovo,'' said Alexander Timolin,
31, who served 13 years ago as a personnel carrier driver in the
army, but has spent the past few years looking for work. ``It's a
risk, but I've got nothing left to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   In his drab office in the rundown recruitment center, Lieutenant
Colonel Alexander Gorechuk gave Timolin the once-over and told him
to come back when he was sure he wanted to serve his country.
Gorechuk said the search for experienced drivers, snipers,
mechanics, and mine-removal specialists has been harder than he
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Of 83 volunteers who had applied by last Wednesday, only 21 have
been deemed to have the right stuff. One who did not is Alexei
Zamsha, 30, who was hoping to go to Kosovo to avoid trouble with
the law. He has four recent drunken driving convictions and
difficulties with a local crime gang that he refused to specify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just gotta get out of this mess,'' Zamsha said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorechuk said volunteers undergo checks with police and
counterintelligence agencies, along with medical checkups and a
test of their proficiency as military specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rule out taking anyone with problems,'' Gorechuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorechuk's commander, Colonel Alexei Meshcheryakov, said he was
under orders to form a battalion of 600 specialists by June 20. He
said he was surprised at the relatively low turnout so far. And, he
said, ``We still don't know who will pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for troops has gone a little better elsewhere.
Saturday military officials in Samara Region, on the Volga River,
said they had signed up 150 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Stepashin has said that a peacekeeping force of
2,500 would cost Russia $150 million for a year, but no one knows
where that money will come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``The troops cannot be forced to live off the land they way they
do in Russia,'' said Pavel Felgenhauer, defense analyst for the
newspaper Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   Felgenhauer said Russia must field a small force or must ask
NATO to help pay. That, he said, would force Russia to give up its
demand that its troops be independent of NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Filipov reported and wrote from Moscow; Shalganov reported from
Chelyabinsk.

KOSOVO TOWNSPEOPLE BLAME OUTSIDERS FOR BRUTAL ACTS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GNJILANE, Yugoslavia _ When the men in masks moved through this
Kosovo town a couple of months ago, they spoke in accents that led
ethnic Albanians to conclude they were not local men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the trouble here comes from outsiders,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the term ``outsider'' is about to get a whole new meaning.
With its 60,000 people split between 70 percent ethnic Albanians
and the rest Serbs, Gnjilane could be just any other town in
Kosovo, where Serbs and Albanians have lived in periods of awkward
tolerance and open hatred.
</P>
<P>
   But it is different, because this town is about to be
transformed into the headquarters of some 7,000 American troops,
part of the peacekeeping force here known as K-FOR.
</P>
<P>
   Some Serbs see the arrival of the Americans as a humiliation,
the latest in a string for the Serbs, who have lost wars in
Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and now Kosovo, seat of their religious
and national identity.
</P>
<P>
   But Rela Nesic sees nothing but dollar signs, or more precisely
dinar signs. Nesic runs the Hotel Europe, a 50-room hostelry that
has seen better days. Nesic smiles when he thinks about the
prospect of GIs and the flood of United Nations personnel about to
arrive in Kosovo filling his cavernous restaurant, which
 &UR; yesterday &LR;   &UR; afternoon &LR;  had only one table of diners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't I be hospitable to the American soldiers?'' he
asked. ``I have no problems with Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesic's politics, or lack of them, may explain his views toward
Americans. Most Serbs in Kosovo are hard-line nationalists, seeing
their very existence threatened by the Kosovo independence movement
led by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But Nesic insists that Gnjilane was always a more tolerant
place, where Albanians and Serbs got along. Outside, Yugoslav
soldiers on convoys passing through town as they withdraw from
Kosovo fired gunshots defiantly into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Nesic shrugs, saying, ``Nobody here approves of that. I'm a
Serb, what can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Nesic claims that Serbs here protected Albanians during the war.
Around the corner, an Albanian man who declined to give his name
challenged Nesic's rosy view of community relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few cases of Serbs protecting Albanians
here,'' he said. And he disputed the notion that only Serb
paramilitary police from outside Gnjilane caused the trouble here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying,'' he said. ``You are who your friends are.''
</P>
<P>
   But that man, and other Albanians interviewed  &UR; yesterday &LR; , said
there will not be reprisals against local Serbs when the Albanian
refugees return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through bad things, and we wouldn't do it to
anybody else,'' said one man, carring eggs and lettuce from a
three-week-old Albanian market that was frequented  &UR; yesterday &LR;  by
Serb police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Melici Ramadan, who was selling vegetables  &UR; yesterday &LR;  at the
market off the main square, moved here from Malisevo, a Kosovo
Liberation Army stronghold that has been punished repeatedly by
Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   He said 20 masked Serb police officers entered Malisevo two
weeks after the war began and summarily executed four men and
expelled the rest of the residents. Ten members of his family,
including his 90-year-old mother, joined more than 800,000 refugees
and left Kosovo. He decided to move here and stick it out.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan agreed with Nesic about the violence in this town,
saying that ``most people who made a mess here were not from here,
they were from Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   His relations with Serbs have been mostly positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born with them here. I had a good life and we worked
together for a long time. We never had a problem, but now we do,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, during the air raids of the last 2 1/2 months, Ramadan
took shelter in a Serb's basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nesic agreed with that, and wants to put the war behind him
quickly. ``This was a stupid war. Why would anyone go to war with
NATO?'' he asked. ``I wasn't responsible for this. Let's bury the
war. This war didn't produce any heroes. So let's just bury it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesic agreed with most local Albanians, saying he thought the
Albanians who fled will return to their homes. ``There was one
group here who were bad to Albanians. They could not be controlled.
Even the police here and the (Yugoslav Army) didn't like what
happened here. Who brought them here? Why? I don't know. They
should be held responsible for what they did, burning houses,
robbing places. Honest Serbs chased them out.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be entirely true, but even if it isn't the
Albanians don't seem to be waiting to even the score. While
Gnjilane has its share of problems, this is hardly the tensest town
in Kosovo. For that, the arriving Americans can be thankful. They
will have enough problems everywhere else.

WASHINGTON TRIES COOL RESPONSE TO RUSSIA'S SURPRISING MOVE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There it was on CNN, the startling sight of Russian
tanks rolling through the streets of downtown Pristina against US
wishes, and well ahead of NATO peacekeeping forces. Even so, White
House officials at first refused to believe it, rushing into
meetings late Friday night and dodging questions about why their
assurances of cooperation by Russian peacekeepers had been so
terribly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, the same officials were clearly playing cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, President Clinton glossed over the event, welcoming
Russian participation in tending to the peace. General Hugh
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, dismissed the
Russian move as part of the normal confusion of sending troops.
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen chalked it up to a Russian state
of mind, saying that while he was not certain of the motivation, it
might have been ``simply overanxiousness on the part of the
military commanders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignored throughout was a simple question: How were NATO and the
United States once again caught so unaware, despite the massive
intelligence capacities officials are usually so quick to promote?
Wasn't it just five weeks ago that NATO warplanes had accidentally
bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, prompting the idea of using
extra caution in future military affairs?
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the details behind the Russian advance were still
unclear. National Security Council spokesman David Leavy declined
to go into specifics, saying US officials had not been aware of the
Russian tank movement because the Russians ``gave us assurances
that wasn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, Leavy added late Saturday afternoon: Russian Foreign
Minister Igor ``Ivanov told us it was a mistake. They told us
privately and publicly they regretted what had taken place.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that US officials simply took Russian leaders at their
word _ and then cheerfully accepted an apology _ struck several
intelligence analysts as ludicrous. Also, said defense analyst John
Pike of the Federation of American Scientists, signs abounded that
the Russian deployment was not a mistake, including the fact that
Yeltsin Saturday promoted the commander who led in the troops.
Another reason: the reality that the troops disobeyed Ivanov's
retreat order by remaining in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew the convoy was on the way from Bosnia to Yugoslavia.
What we didn't know was what was going to happen at the border,''
Pike said. ``National technical means are very good for assessing
capabilities, but not so good for assessing intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems, according to analysts, were probably twofold: US
officials mishandled Russia diplomatically, reading incorrectly the
promises of Ivanov and failing to sense the dissatisfaction of the
military and the Russian Parliament with Russia's back-seat role in
the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   That diplomatic miscalculation could easily have led to a
military one, with US officials failing to order close surveillance
of the Russian convoy after it appeared to stop outside the border
of Kosovo. Hours after the tanks appeared to have settled in for
the night, they suddenly showed up in Pristina, and on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Galen Carpenter, the vice president for defense and foreign
policy studies at the CATO Institute, a conservative think tank,
said it was ``certainly embarrassing to have that kind of
intelligence failure again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sloppy diplomacy that no one would realize this was a
possibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If they had, military officials could have ordered unmanned
surveillance planes, known as drones or UAVs, to follow the convoy.
Those are the same planes that have been monitoring Serb troop
withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   According to retired Colonel Bill Taylor, now an analyst at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, the State
Department should have at least considered history. After World War
II, it was the Russians who ``moved en masse into Berlin before we
did,'' he pointed out, carving out extra space for the Soviet bloc
and defining the geography of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knows anything about history should have thought
of this as one of a dozen scenarios,'' he said. ``It's laughable.
It's one of a long series of screwups. Somebody goofed.''

MORE RAIN FOR MARLINS PARADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Florida Marlins had an unlikely seven-game
winning streak end this past week. But there was another stat that
might be more critical to their future in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Entering their weekend series with the New York Yankees, the
Marlins had experienced seven rain delays in their previous 12 home
games. Rain is part of life in the summer there, but for fans faced
with watching bad baseball it is another reason to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance, well over 3 million in the club's first season
(1993), was 1.75 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   New ownership is meeting resistance in attempts for a domed
stadium and it would still be years away if the measure was
approved. That might not be enough time to keep the club from
moving, however. &QL; 
JUST A THOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox admits the thought of shifting Chipper
Jones!off back to his natural position at shortstop crosses his
mind every time Walt Weiss is injured, which is often.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he plans to make no changes, keeping Jones at
third base and playing veteran Ozzie Guillen at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think about that,'' Cox said of moving Jones. Guillen
played 83 games last year in place of Weiss. Jones, who came though
the Braves system as a shortstop, played 38 games there in 1996,
but none since. &QL; 
TAKING AIM
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa drew criticism from some fans for not playing in last
year's All-Star Game, instead resting his sore left elbow. But he's
looking forward to both the game and the home run hitting contest
at Fenway Park this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be some fireworks show out there,'' he said. &QL; 
ROAD WARRIORS
</P>
<P>
   The Reds finished a four-city, 12-game road trip with a 9-3
record, the most wins they've had on a trip since going 11-2 in
September 1981. Their 19-10 road record is second only to
Cleveland's 19-7.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Reds, they are playing the high-powered
Indians this weekend in Cincinnati. Reds first baseman Sean Casey
entered the weekend batting an NL-best .388, but it will be
difficult to make the All-Star team with Mark McGwire, Jeff Bagwell
and John Olerud around. &QL; 
HOME BOY
</P>
<P>
   Dante Bichette ended the Rockies' last homestand with a
game-winning homer off Arizona's Gregg Olson. Then he proceeded to
go 2 for 34 on a 10-game road trip. In his first game back at Coors
Field, Bichette went 4 for 6 with three RBI, including the
game-winner on a 10th-inning single. &QL; 
WHO'S MORE VALUABLE?
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell hit three homers Wednesday night at Comiskey Park,
the third time in his career he has hit three homers and the second
time this season he has hit three in a game. But he might not be
the most important player on the Astros. From May 18 through June
4, Craig Biggio batted .193 and Houston's lead in the NL Central
shrank from 5{ games to one. &QL; 
MORE METS MADNESS
</P>
<P>
   How did GM Steve Phillips convince Mets owner Fred Wilpon that
he needed to fire three trusted members of embattled manager Bobby
Valentine's coaching staff? By promising to promote former Dodgers
pitching coach Dave Wallace, the organizational pitching guru, who
just happens to be close to Sandy Koufax, who just happens to be
Brooklyn high school buddies with Wilpon. &QL; 
GOIN' SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Since Curt Schilling ripped Phillies ownership for a lack of
commitment to winning, his season has soured. In his nine starts
before making those comments, he was 7-1 with a 2.58 ERA. In four
starts since, he is 1-2 with a 4.40 ERA. Schilling, who pitches
today despite a recent flareup of gout, has blown a four-run
ninth-inning lead against the Mets and a three-run seventh-inning
lead against the Giants, and lost both games. &QL; 
MOON SHOT
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Brant Brown was batting .164 in his previous 30
games when he went 5 for 5 against Detroit and hit just the 35th
homer to clear the roof at Tiger Stadium. He hadn't driven in a run
since May 9, when he hit his only other homer of the season, an
inside-the-park shot at Busch Stadium.

BUTHELEZI LIKELY TO BE TAPPED FOR HIGH SOUTH AFRICAN POST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Barring a last-minute shift, a man regarded as a
leading fomenter of ethnic violence during the closing years of
apartheid will step into South Africa's second-most powerful job
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to newly elected President Thabo Mbeki said the
successor to Nelson Mandela will tap as his deputy Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party and until
recently an arch-foe of the ruling African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is expected to come Monday shortly after a
special session of Parliament formally elects Mbeki to the
presidency. The new leaders will be inaugurated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Buthelezi marks a strategic attempt by Mbeki to
stabilize the troubled KwaZulu-Natal Province, where more than
12,000 people have been killed in factional fighting between the
ANC and Inkatha over the past decade. A partnership between the two
parties could also effectively give the ANC a 75 percent majority
in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to have Buthelezi inside than outside,'' said a
senior adviser to Mbeki. ``If we don't take that route, the
situation in KwaZulu could degenerate into the kind of experience
we see in many African countries today, where leaders fail to rise
above petty politics and ethnic differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Other moves by Mbeki to consolidate his power may mean that
Buthelezi will play little more than a ceremonial role in the
nation's second-highest office. That would mark a sharp contrast
with Mbeki's own role as Mandela's deputy. He ran the Cabinet and
played a primary role in foreign policy, essentially crafting
Mandela's doctrine abroad. He also ran, with Vice President Al
Gore, the US-South Africa Binational Commission, the most important
trade body linking the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Organizational moves announced by Mbeki's office last week
indicate that the incoming president is likely to reserve those
roles for himself. The new organizational chart structure places
the deputy president's staff under the president's
director-general. Mbeki also plans to form a secretariat, a
powerful coordinating organ within the president's office that will
oversee policy and planning.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Buthelezi's power is carefully checked, his
proximity to the presidency raises troubling questions for many
South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Buthelezi's party was deeply infiltrated by the apartheid
security forces during the late 1980s and early 1990s, and Inkatha
was linked to a third of the atrocities examined by the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, the panel charged with investigating the
human-rights abuses of South Africa's racist past.
</P>
<P>
   The commission concluded that, as Inkatha's leader, chief
minister of the KwaZulu government, and minister of police of the
now-defunct black homeland, Buthelezi was accountable ``where these
three agencies are found to have been responsible'' for gross human
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ANC officials scoff at the notion that Buthelezi's past should
disqualify him from holding office. They note that former president
F. W. de Klerk served as Mandela's second deputy president for two
years without coming clean about his apartheid-era actions.
</P>
<P>
   But past violations are not the only issue. More than 1,000
people have died in political violence in KwaZulu-Natal each year
since 1994, according to two independent analyses. At least half a
dozen have been killed since last week's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in an attempt to win immunity from prosecution, a
senior Inkatha leader disclosed to police the location of the
largest secret arms cache yet found in South Africa. The payload,
seven tons of explosives, amounted to a fraction of the weapons
known to have been brought into KwaZulu-Natal by apartheid police
ahead of the 1994 elections and delivered to Inkatha. The party
leader, Phillip Powell, faces possible charges of treason. There
are thought to be other such arms stockpiles whose locations remain
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Buthelezi has not come clean about his knowledge of the arms
caches, but the find last month indicates the importance of
rapprochement between the ANC and Inkatha.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thabo Mbeki is concerned about national unity,'' said Themba
Sono, president of the South African Institute on Race Relations.
``He doesn't want to see Buthelezi's followers become loose cannons
and go on a spree. So bringing Buthelezi on board is a price he is
willing to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Granting the Inkatha leader a high-profile seat in government
isn't a new move. Buthelezi served as minister of home affairs for
the past five years and often filled in as acting president when
Mandela was traveling outside the country. Those gestures paved the
way for ongoing peace talks between the ANC and Inkatha.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's move follows a similar strategy, but takes it further.
Earlier last week, three minor opposition parties joined together
to form a coalition government in the Western Cape, thereby
excluding ANC from power in the province. By bringing Buthelezi
into Mbeki's government, the ANC hopes to form a close partnership
with Inkatha and expand its power base at both the national level
and in KwaZulu-Natal.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary de Haas, an anthropologist at the University of Natal
who has studied the two parties' conflicts, is not sure the move
will end the ongoing violence in KwaZulu-Natal. Buthelezi may
happily trade his cooperation for higher office, she notes, but he
might not be able to swing the traditional Zulu leaders and rogue
warlords still stirring much of the strife.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC and Inkatha ``have been talking peace at the leadership
level, but it hasn't filtered down,'' De Haas said. ``For those
maintaining fiefdoms it means little. The violence will continue
unless the leaders go together throughout the region, talking peace
and reprimanding'' those won't toe the line.

U.S. TRIES TO SORT OUT RUSSIAN MOVE IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: TOPS with new information; UPDATES throughout) 
(ATTN: Ill.)  (rk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen said Saturday that
President Boris Yeltsin had authorized the early entry of Russian
troops into Kosovo, a deployment that surprised American officials
and possibly senior members of his own government.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon briefing Saturday, Cohen declined to characterize
the presence of Russian troops in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, as a
mistake, a term widely used in the last 24 hours by various
administration, NATO and Moscow officials as they played down a
Russian move that stole the spotlight from NATO's entry into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also rejected the possibility that the Russian deployment
was a case of crossed signals between Moscow and military
commanders in the Balkans, and he insisted that the Russian troops
would have to come under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unclear whether it's a mistake or not,'' Cohen said of
the continuing presence of Russian forces at the airport in
Pristina. ``It certainly was a precipitous action leading to some
confusion. It was surprising to the foreign minister, who had
indicated privately to Secretary Albright and others that there
would be no action taken going into Pristina last evening.'' He was
referring to the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Yeltsin had apparently given orders to his commanders
in Bosnia to prepare to move into Kosovo to take part in the
unfolding international peacekeeping operation there, even though
their specific role had not yet been agreed upon in talks between
American and Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin left it to his generals to decide when and where to
deploy their troops, Cohen said. They did so late Friday evening,
to the surprise and consternation of NATO officials who were
planning the movement of their own troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the motivation was,'' Cohen said. ``It may
have been simply over-anxiousness on the part of military
commanders. It may have been some confusion in terms of what the
direction was.''
</P>
<P>
   To try to sort out the muddle, Vice President Al Gore spoke by
telephone for an hour Saturday morning with Sergei Stepashin, the
Russian prime minister, according to an aide to Gore. The aide said
both sides had agreed not to disclose details of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to speak to Yeltsin on Sunday,
White House officials said. In a late addition to a commencement
speech he was giving at the University of Chicago Saturday, the
president alluded to the need for cooperation, saying, ``We look
forward to working with Russia and others who may not have agreed
with our military campaign but do agree with the proposition that
all the people of that tiny land _ Serb and Albanian alike _ should
be able to live in peace and freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the presence of the Russian troops continued to bedevil
the start of the mission.
</P>
<P>
   American and Russian diplomats and generals were meeting
Saturday in Moscow and in Macedonia to try to clarify Russia's role
in the peacekeeping force. Moscow has so far balked at putting its
troops under direct NATO command, but allied officials insist that
there will be no exclusive Russian sector and no independent
Russian military command.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they will work out an acceptable arrangement whereby
we can have our strict requirements met,'' Cohen said, ``namely
that we have a unified command structure, that there is not a
separate sector as such that is only Russian, as has been
requested, that there must be NATO forces throughout the region and
NATO in every sector. And they will be under a unified command.''
</P>
<P>
   The province has been divided into five zones, with the United
States, France, Britain, Germany and Italy each controlling one
sector.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said Moscow appeared to be
sending simultaneous and ambiguous signals to NATO, to the restive
Russian parliament and to the Serbian people.
</P>
<P>
   He said the uncertainty about Moscow's motives has cast at least
a temporary pall over the entry of American and European troops
into the shattered Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our military people are all that worked up about
it,'' the official said. ``They don't like the idea they were lied
to by the Russians. But on the other hand, there's a lot going on
in the Russian government, so who the hell knows what they're up
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, administration officials said that security
surrounding the Russian force's deployment was good enough on
Friday to prevent American intelligence agencies from intercepting
any communications ordering the troops into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say they are not sure whether the order
moving the troops was issued by Russian senior commanders at the
last minute because they have no intercepts to study. It is
possible, they said, that the Russian order was issued earlier to
avoid interception by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they do not believe that all the
Russian troops that are planned for deployment to Kosovo will come
from the contingent in Bosnia, but officials interviewed Saturday
morning could not say how many Russian troops are expected.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion over the timing and location of the deployment of
Russian troops in Kosovo arose from the unexpectedly abrupt end of
the NATO air war and the vague terms under which the conflict
ended. NATO and the Russians had not yet agreed on Moscow's role in
the peacekeeping operation or on the complex issues of command and
control of forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow might have been trying to settle some of those questions
pre-emptively by sending its troops to Pristina, an administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know ultimately where the Russians will be,'' a
senior official here said. ``All the sectors will have
participation by a number of countries.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But this official emphasized that wherever the Russian forces
are stationed, they will be under NATO command, even if the
alliance has to devise some sort of fig leaf to disguise the fact
that Russian troops are reporting to a NATO officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a unified command structure, I can assure you,''
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration aide said the sense in Washington
Saturday was that the perplexing Russian move was at worst a
temporary hurdle at the outset of a long military and relief
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow never approved of the NATO bombing of Serbia, a
historical ally of Russia, and might feel the need to assert its
independence from the alliance for domestic political reasons and
to signal its sympathy to the Serbian populace, this official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear whether this is a stunt or something serious,''
the official said. ``But we're trying not to get distracted by
something that in the long run won't be important. We hope it's
just a blip.''

BAD BOY BELLE NOT JUST HYPE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those who think Albert Belle's bad image is a
media creation, ask Baltimore Orioles manager Ray Miller about the
epic shouting match he had with Belle on Wednesday for barely
running out a ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, probably the least respected manager in baseball, became
a hero for jumping in Belle's face after Belle exploded for being
removed in a late-inning double switch. Belle, one of the most
productive players this decade, is batting .244 with 10 homers and
35 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   He already has alienated fans in Baltimore, who boo him
regularly for his lackluster effort. He recently made an obscene
gesture toward the bleacher section. The Orioles know that they
made a $65 million mistake signing him last winter, but won't admit
it because many people advised stubborn owner Peter Angelos against
signing Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos is expected to blame new GM Frank Wren for the Belle
fiasco and buy out the final two years of Wren's contract. &QL; 
CORDERO OUT
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Wil Cordero will miss at least 10 weeks after
undergoing surgery to repair a left wrist broken Tuesday on a
diving catch of Jeromy Burnitz's fly ball to left. Cordero was
hitting .316 with five homers and 26 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Before that game, Indians GM John Hart said the trade he
regretted making the most was sending Burnitz to Milwaukee for
Kevin Seitzer for the stretch run in 1996. Burnitz, who had 38
homers and 125 RBI last year, beat the Indians on Tuesday with his
10th home run. &QL; 
CANSECO IN
</P>
<P>
   Although the Devil Rays have the league's worst defense, Jose
Canseco was not part of the problem when he took over in left field
during interleague play. Canseco, who once let a fly ball bounce
off his head and over the fence for a home run, played well and
actually threw out Gerald Williams trying to stretch a single into
a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any hit off my head or anything. No errors,'' he
said. Sadly, the next night he left the game early with back pain,
which he attributed to playing the outfield. &QL; 
HAVE A LOOK
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox could be showcasing right-hander Jaime
Navarro, who has struggled since the team signed him, to National
League teams when he pitches today at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   After Navarro beat Houston on Tuesday, the Sox announced they
are moving him ahead of struggling John Snyder to start the final
game of the Cubs' series rather than staying on track to start
Monday at Tampa Bay. While Navarro (5-4) has won three starts in a
row, Snyder (6-5) has lost his last four starts. &QL; 
HIGHER POWER
</P>
<P>
   Oakland first baseman Jason Giambi hit one home run last Sunday
but said he lost two other homers in the Giants series to the wind
at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat is off to Willie Mays and all the other great players
who played in this hole,'' Giambi said. ``It's terrible. They can
blow it up.''

RUNNING ON EMPTY
</P>
<P>
   Of the Blue Jays' 27 victories entering the weekend, only one
has come when they've scored four runs or fewer (a 3-2 win over the
Angels on April 21). Toronto's poor play after a strong start has
the club wondering about the money it will take to keep some of the
better players, including David Wells, Carlos Delgado and Shawn
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado and Green are two eligible for free agency after 2000.
The Jays and Delgado have shelved contract discussions until the
end of the season after the two sides couldn't reach agreement
during the spring. Both want four years; Delgado for $44 million,
the Jays for $34 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who is making $4.67 million this year, has been offered a
two-year contract extension with an option for a third season that
could be worth $24.65 million ($15.65 guaranteed).

IF THERE'S A CHALLENGE, FOSSETT WILL BE UP TO IT

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ Steve Fossett can't understand why yacht racers
enjoy sailing America's Cup sloops. But show him a multihull with a
deck made of netting and a cockpit the size of a bathtub, and
you'll find a man with his sea boots on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing is a racing sport,'' the 55-year-old Fossett said
during a recent interview here. ``But in every other sport, a great
deal of attention is paid to who is the fastest. In most sailing,
how you do is based on handicap racing against other boats in other
classes, not on speed itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between buoy racing and speed exploits has drawn
Fossett into a five-year whirlwind of long-distance record
attempts. Going fast, after all, is what speed is all about _ 10
ocean records so far for Fossett. They include four Pacific Ocean
passages, on either single-handed or crewed voyages. Other records
are on traditional race courses such as the Chicago-Mackinac Race
along Lake Michigan. In 1998, he was first to finish there in 18
hours 50 minutes, a record.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Fossett set an astonishing standard for the
635-mile route from Newport to Bermuda. Sailing solo, he shaved 13
hours off the 53-hour time set in 1996 by Jean-Pierre Mouligne, the
French solo sailor.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett, who entered yachting in 1993 as a neophyte, is a quick
learner. His first victory was in the 1994 Round Britain Race, a
1,700-mile hair-raiser at sea aboard Lakota, the 60-foot trimaran
that Fossett used as his training wheels in boating.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett competed with David Scully, an around-the-world sailor
who finished fifth in the 1994-95 BOC Challenge yacht race around
the world. Scully, who was 10 years younger than Fossett, came to
the race with a younger body and more experience, but the same
inscrutable passion for speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wild,'' Fossett said. ``There was a lot of wind around
the British Isles. We were tearing sails, but did some fast sailing
_ up to 30 knots at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossett subsequently bought the three-hulled boat from Scully,
and has used it to cut his swath through long-distance sailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know very much then,'' he said. ``I had sailed
recreational dinghies basically. But David Scully was teaching me
at the same time I was sailing for records. I associated with good
sailors who carried the ball for me early on. Now I like to sail
single-handed to let people know that I'm doing much of it
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   His boating accomplishments are impressive. But layer them with
a history of other offbeat exploits, and the result is multifaceted
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   He swam the English Channel in 22 hours in 1985, and finished
47th in the Iditarod dog-sled race in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He has climbed the highest peaks in six of seven continents (he
has yet to reach the top of Mt. Everest) and competed in the
Paris-Dakar auto race and the 24 hours of Le Mans race, both in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he competed in the Ironman in Hawaii, the
mother of all triathlons that includes a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile
bike ride, and a 26.2-mile marathon. And since 1994, he has set a
series of ballooning records, which included two unscheduled dumps
into open ocean. In one, Fossett's capsule dropped from an altitude
of 30,000 feet at a rate of about 1,500 feet per minute. He landed
in the Coral Sea off the northeast coast of Australia, shaken but
undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Steve Fossett that fascinates me,'' said Bob
Rice, a meteorologist in Wolfeboro, N.H., who has guided Fossett's
ballooning and boating forays, ``is that he gets an idea and just
jumps right into it. He bought a balloon when he had no idea what
he was going to do with it. Then he went out and got a license and
flew it across the Atlantic. He has done the same thing with
boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Fossett is no obvious jock. He dresses conservatively, white
shirt and khakis at a recent interview, and with a receding
hairline and oval face, he looks more like a businessman than a
scruffy risk-taker. It is less surprising that he owns a successful
securities marketing company in Chicago than that he owns the
world's fastest sailboat. His new $4.5 million catamaran, the
105-foot Play Station, set a 24-hour speed record of 580 miles off
New Zealand in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I do are things that a lot of people would like to
do,'' Fossett said. ``So I go out and take on an interesting
project, like driving a race car or swimming the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unusual is that I actually go out and do them.'' &QL;

HOUSTON, THE SCORER, RISES TO THE OCCASION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)   (bl)  
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The game was glowing on the tube in the living room, but Alice
Houston was searching for things to tidy up in the basement of her
family's Louisville, Ky., home. Her son, Allan, was on the court
creating rainbows that splashed into the net, but she was scouring
the kitchen for another dish to wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on all three floors of the house,'' Alice Houston said
Saturday. ``I've been around this so long. My father was a coach.
Allan's father was a coach. They tease me because I've missed so
many great moments over the years, because I can't look. It's too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   But near midnight on the East Coast, Alice Houston crept into
the living room and stole a glance at the glorious finish of the
Knicks' victory in Game 6 against the Indiana Pacers, and the
moment when her son and his coach, Jeff Van Gundy, found each other
amid the mayhem and embraced beneath the pinwheel ceiling of
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they were going to the National Basketball Association
finals to meet the San Antonio Spurs. Together, they had made it
through a tumultuous season when Houston had to find his game next
to Latrell Sprewell and Van Gundy was nearly fired. The latter
might have taken place three weeks ago if Houston hadn't sent up a
spellbinding runner that kicked off the rim, kissed the backboard
and landed softly in the net to win the Knicks' first-round series
in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just maybe, Houston's 32-point effort in Game 6 Friday
night _ a game the Knicks played against Indiana without the
injured Larry Johnson for the last 30 minutes on the clock _ will
make it that much harder for the Garden president, Dave Checketts,
to nudge Van Gundy away.
</P>
<P>
   Unassuming by nature, Houston would never admit to any impact he
has had on Van Gundy's future. Team game. Team victories. That's
his response. But beneath that veneer, there is a player who
genuinely cares about his coach and understands the pressures he
has been under. His father, Wade Houston, went through a similar
situation when he was the coach at the University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan went through the rumors with his own father, and it was
hard for him,'' Alice said. ``Allan's close to Jeff, and his wife,
Kim, and the whole Van Gundy family. He knows how hard and draining
the job of coaching can be.''
</P>
<P>
   But as a coach's son, Houston has often looked to get his
teammates involved in the game before himself throughout the
playoffs. But not Friday night, not when circumstances demanded
that he assert himself as the dominant player. With six minutes
left in the second quarter, Johnson was found curled up on the
baseline of Madison Square Garden, writhing in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about when Larry went down,'' Houston said. ``I
just wanted to do what I could do the whole game, because if you
think about those things, you kind of put more pressure on
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   He played as carefree as a playground star. Whenever Indiana's
Reggie Miller tried to slap his spindly but prickly frame on him,
Houston simply faded away and lofted up a feathery jumper. Whenever
Miller attempted to cut him off, Houston ignored his presence and
barged to the basket. After beginning the night 2 for 6, Houston
finished 12 for 17 in an uncanny night of shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allan just carried us,'' center Chris Dudley said. ``He put us
on his back and carried us there for a while. He just came through
huge for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He came through just when the night looked bleak with the image
of Johnson being helped off the floor. He popped up as a star while
Latrell Sprewell was struggling to find his rhythm and played a
tireless 47 minutes that included a few cat-and-mouse chases with
Miller. After lurking in the background for most of the series,
Houston shed his wallflower status and became the life of the party
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've been waiting for all series from
Allan,'' said Chris Childs, who took over guarding Miller in the
fourth quarter to help Houston preserve his energy down the
stretch. ``Allan did it in the Miami game, and he did it in a game
in Atlanta. I talked to Allan's father after a couple of games and
I told his mother also, `He's got to shoot.' She even said: `Why
doesn't he just shoot? I mean, that's what he's there for.' Allan's
not here to lead us, he's here to score. I told his mother, `He's
got to be aggressive.' I mean, take nothing from Indiana, they're a
great team, but there's nobody in this league that can go on Allan
one-on-one. He has to believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his laid-back demeanor conceals that belief. But it's
there, as quiet as an ember. It may not have hit him consciously,
but Johnson's injury seemed to stoke Houston into a shooting
exhibition that wowed everyone who watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like being a fan sitting there,'' Sprewell said.
``I was going on the weak side just watching him do his thing.
Every shot he was putting up, there was nothing but net.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2 a.m., Alice Houston had a chance to see it for herself.
Knowing the outcome, she put the tape in the v.c.r. and opened her
eyes to what her son _ and the entire Knicks team, she will remind
you _ had done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Allan's wife, Tammy, and she said she knew it
was going to be a great June,'' Alice said.
</P>
<P>
   What could be more amazing than an NBA final series? A first
child. Tammy Houston is due any day now. Tammy's voice was the
first Alice heard from the site of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, just about five minutes after the game ended, I got
a call from Tammy, and she was still in her seats at the game,''
said Alice, who attended the road games during the Eastern
Conference finals. ``She was like, `Can you believe this?'''
</P>
<P>
   See it for yourself, Alice.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   _ PATRICK EWING was in a suit, but he was still on the floor
with the rest of the team when the Game 6 buzzer went off. ``When I
got hurt, I told them to go get me my ring,'' Ewing said. ``We're
right there knocking on the door. All we have to do is kick it
open.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The end of Game 6, and the chance to play in the finals,
marked a memorable moment for in the year of LATRELL SPREWELL, who
watched last year's playoff from home because of his suspension.
``To be at the bottom of the barrel and somehow climb your way out
and have the type of success that I've personally had and we've had
as a team, it's just a blessing from God,'' he said.  &QL;

ROBBER TURNED WRITER SAID TO ROB AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ For much of his life, Stephen Reid, who in the 1970s
led the notorious ``Stopwatch Gang'' on scores of precisely timed
bank heists across the United States and Canada, walked as crooked
a line as can be.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after winning parole in 1987, Canada's noted
robber-turned-wordsmith stuck to the straight and narrow for a
dozen years _ redeemed, he liked to say, by the job of writing, by
marriage to one of Canada's foremost poets, and by love for their
two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   As modestly acclaimed author, teacher of creative writing,
organizer of literary festivals and technical adviser on crime
movies, he became a high-profile figure in British Columbia's
lively arts scene _ and living, breathing testimony to the
possibilities of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My criminal career ended on the day I took up writing,'' the
mustachioed, soft-spoken 49-year-old ex-desperado liked to tell
interviewers.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, in what appears to have been a reversion to the
reckless ways of his past, Reid chucked aside the pen allegedly
once again to snatch up a pistol and a pump-action shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after a botched bank robbery, a gun battle with
police in a tourist-filled park, and a six-hour armed standoff in
Victoria, he was arrested and charged with 10 criminal counts,
including armed robbery, hostage taking, and attempted murder. An
accomplice was also arrested.
</P>
<P>
   To Reid's loved ones and friends, it was a stunning and
inexplicable twist. ``He's obviously gone off the deep end to a
private hell,'' Susan Musgrave, his wife of 13 years and one of
Canada's most renowned poets, told the Vancouver Sun. ``He lived a
larger-than-life life, but we never expected this. . . . I am
completely in a state of shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Said fellow writer and friend Brian Brett: ``This is an odd,
strange, terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Police, however, were far less appalled by Reid's apparent fall
from grace than by the violent episode that rattled British
Columbia's picturesque and famously peaceful harborside capital.
The drama marked the first shootout between police and suspects in
Victoria in at least two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing no one was killed or hurt,'' said Constable
Michael Yeager, one of the officers who traded shots with the bank
robbers during a wild car-and-foot chase through Victoria's Beacon
Hill Park and residential streets just a few blocks from the
provincial Legislature. ``It had all the elements of a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were also elements of extraordinary luck for law
enforcement. By coincidence, police were en route to the Royal Bank
of Canada to handle a routine complaint about a panhandler just as
two masked men armed with pistols and long guns burst out the back
door and into a getaway car _ their robbery attempt thwarted by a
sudden approach of the patrol vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   As the robbers and a growing cavalcade of pursuers careened
through Beacon Hill Park, one of the robbers fired on police, the
shot shattering the windshield of a van whose driver escaped
injury.
</P>
<P>
   More shots were fired before the two men abandoned their vehicle
and fled on foot. One man, identified as Allan McCallum, 30, was
quickly apprehended while the other _ reportedly wearing a jacket
marked ``Police'' _ charged into a retirement home and bluffed his
way into the apartment of 64-year-old Catherine Toupalik.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely polite, but obviously very scared,'' Toupalik
said. ``He said his life was over, but he had a wife and daughters
that he loved.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long standoff, Reid surrendered to police. He is being
held for psychiatric assessment pending a June 24 court hearing.
Police say the two men were armed with a .22 caliber pistol, a .357
magnum revolver, a pump shotgun, and bolt-action hunting rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Reid, meanwhile, were left to wonder why it was
that he would apparently succumb to the call of his old ways.
``This comes as a brutal surprise,'' said William Deverell, a
novelist who lives near Victoria. ``In the dozen years I've known
him, he's been an exemplary character. He'd become a pillar of the
community, one of the most gentlemanly figures in all Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in northern Ontario, Reid was a bright student
who turned to drugs and petty crime at an early age, quitting 10th
grade to hitchhike west to British Columbia. He soon was involved
in serious felonies, showing a special penchant for banks. Caught
and convicted of robbery, he was sentenced to prison outside
Kingston, Ontario _ escaping in 1973, the first of three breaks
from high-security penitentiaries across Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, he made criminal history.
</P>
<P>
   Reid and two cronies, Paddy Mitchell and Lionel Wright, teamed
up to form the Stopwatch Gang, a nickname invented by the press
after security cameras showed Reid wearing a stopwatch in bank hits
whose hallmark was split-second timing.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s, the gang is believed to have committed more
than a hundred armed robberies netting an estimated $11 million in
Canada and the United States, earning longtime spots on the FBI and
Royal Canadian Mounted Police most-wanted lists. The gang's most
successful holdup was a 1974 grab of gold bars worth $785,000 from
Ottawa's Uplands Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Although always heavily armed, the gang carried off its
robberies without violence, although Reid once shot himself in the
leg. Even today, the Stopwatch Gang boasts a loyal following among
aficionados of crime, with a Web site on which fans swap details of
gang history and lore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Stopwatch Gang may very well be the last of North
America's legendary bank-robbing gangs,'' wrote author Greg Weston
in a 1992 book on the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Captured by the FBI in 1980, Reid served 38 months in the Marion
penitentiary in Illinois before being returned north under a
US-Canada prisoner exchange treaty. He escaped twice, committed
more robberies, and seemed to define ``incorrigible'' until he
turned his energies to writing his life story.
</P>
<P>
   The book that would eventually become the Canadian bestseller
``Jackrabbit Parole'' was read in manuscript by Musgrave, then a
writer-in-residence at Ontario's University of Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrave, best known for her poetry but also a novelist and past
president of the Writers Union of Canada _ and a woman with an
acknowledged proclivity for dangerous men _ mailed Reid a literary
critique accompanied by a passionate love letter. The two were
married in a 1986 prison ceremony after which Musgrave flung her
garter on to the barbed wire coils surrounding the yard. Their
honeymoon was spent in a trailer on the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was paroled from prison in 1987, and they settled into what
he would describe as a life of happy domesticity. He adopted her
daughter by an earlier relationship and they had another daughter
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life now is Susan,'' he told the Toronto Star several years
ago. ``We lead quiet, work-filled lives. . . . I would never put
that at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid taught writing at a British Columbia college and to prison
inmates, rose to local prominence as an organizer of literary
festivals, and wrote book reviews for major Canadian newspapers and
magazines. In addition to serving as a technical adviser on several
movies, last year he performed a bit part _ as a bank guard _ in
the film ``Four Days,'' shot in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the robbers today are addicts or there is a lot of
violence,'' he told the London (Ontario) Free Press. ``We were an
old-fashioned gang. . . . We tried not to hurt people.''
</P>
<P>
   He also became a handyman, boasting of his renovations to the
home he shared with Musgrave and the two girls. Most recently, said
friends, he was building a family summer cottage in British
Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islands.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also signs that Reid missed his desperado past.
He spoke regularly to journalists, and in an interview in January
sounded almost wistful when recalling the ``exhilaration'' of
pulling off bank heists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to being a rock star,'' he said, ``being a bank robber is
the most chaotic and fun ride you can take.''

A DISCREDITED PRESIDENT RETURNS TO MEXICO ON A VISIT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Interrupting a four-year exile, former President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari visited Mexico on Saturday for the first
time since his tumultuous departure in 1995, when he left behind a
brother accused of murder, a country in economic crisis, and a
presidential legacy under seige.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' return provoked scattered demonstrations, hundreds of
angry calls to radio talk shows, and accusations by political
opponents that the visit had been timed to influence Mexico's
presidential campaign for next spring's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas told reporters he had returned for a two-day visit to
attend to his ailing father and to other family matters. But the
visit appeared to follow a carefully written political script.
</P>
<P>
   In television interviews and other encounters with the news
media that were choreographed hour by hour, Salinas defended his
presidency, which ran from 1988 to 1994, and especially his efforts
to modernize the Mexican economy. He also acknowledged mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pioneers,'' Salinas said. ``And pioneers often make
errors.''
</P>
<P>
   He especially lamented what he said was his failure to more
closely oversee his older brother, Raul, who amassed an illicit
fortune of at least $120 million during Salinas' presidency and who
was convicted last year of killing a political rival.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas has passed his exile in Ireland, with frequent visits to
Europe, Cuba and occasionally the United States. He arrived in
Mexico City Saturday morning on a private jet after a flight from
London via Nassau, he said, and intends to leave Mexico on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His visit roiled political currents in Mexico that have already
been whipped up by an unprecedented public struggle for the
presidential nomination of the governing party, a growing
controversy over the finances of President Ernesto Zedillo's 1994
campaign, and a continuing investigation into a $65 billion banking
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who succeeded Salinas, kept on many senior officials
from the previous administration and continued with similar
policies. Yet Zedillo enjoys considerable popularity, and Salinas
is currently one of Mexico's most reviled figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ruined my lunch!'' shouted one enraged caller to TV Azteca
minutes after an interview with Salinas was broadcast live
nationwide. ``That man is not a true Mexican! How can he be allowed
to move around freely here?''
</P>
<P>
   Even in Mexico's political system _ where presidents are exalted
with king-like powers and then immediately blamed for all the
country's ills when they leave office _ Salinas' fall from grace
was one of the bitterest.
</P>
<P>
   This is so largely because Salinas brought broad and painful
changes to the Mexican economy, including the sale of state
industries that left millions of workers unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks after he left office on December 1, 1994, speculators
began to attack the peso, which had become overvalued and which
Zedillo was forced to devalue. That immediate crisis threw at least
500,000 Mexicans out of work and plunged banks and debtors into a
crisis that continues to a degree to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, the police arrested Raul Salinas on murder
charges. The former president tried to defend his brother by
announcing a hunger strike, abandoned it days later, and after a
secret meeting with Zedillo flew to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, aides to Zedillo who spoke anonymously to reporters
said that Salinas had been forced into exile. Publicly, Zedillo and
Salinas have always denied that Salinas' departure was forced.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Zedillo repeated those denials Saturday in portraying
Salinas' return as a strictly personal decision by the
ex-president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was absolutely nothing to prevent him from returning,''
an aide to Zedillo said. ``He's not been charged with any crime,
there's no lawsuit, no investigation. His absence until now has
been his own free choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' visit appeared carefully planned. A female secretary
called scores of foreign and Mexican reporters Saturday morning,
inviting them to what was portrayed as an intimate encounter with
the ex-president but turned out to news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlos Salinas de Gortari would like to have coffee with you
this afternoon,'' she said, giving the address of Salinas'
colonial-style boyhood home along a cobbled street in the Coyoacan
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   As reporters gathered outside the home, Salinas was already
being interviewed live on TV Azteca, the first of several
television appearances Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In that interview, conducted by Sergio Sarmiento, Salinas said
that during his presidency he had no knowledge that his brother
Raul was systematically moving at least $120 million into foreign
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it is difficult for people to understand how a president
who was as well-informed as they thought I was could not have
known,'' Salinas said. ``But I was focused on aspects of Mexican
life that I considered important for the country's development.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes into the televised interview, TV Azteca's switchboard
lit up with incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a controversial figure that when I was interviewing
him on television, irate telephone calls started coming in,''
Sarmiento said in an interview later. ``His visit is going to
arouse a political scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Callers were so belligerent that several attacked Sarmiento, one
of Mexico's most admired broadcast journalists and newspaper
columnists, for his respectful treatment of Salinas, and the
interviewer himself felt obliged to defend the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Salinas' Coyoacan home, several protesters appeared.
``Salinas Get Out! Criminal!'' read one placard.

U.S. 71 THROUGH MISSOURI MAKES YOUR JAVA JUMP

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star

<P>
   You can pull onto U.S. 71 at the town of International Falls,
Minn., on the Canadian border, point your car south, and about
1,600 miles later -- three reasonable days or two brutal ones --
you'll wind up in Baton Rouge, La., almost in sight of the Gulf of
Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At one time or other I have driven every bit of that road,
except possibly the hour or so between Texarkana, Texas, and
Shreveport, La. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of that travel was years ago, so I can't claim my
information is current. But if there is any bumpier stretch of U.S.
71 than the piece between Kansas City, Mo., and the turnoff toward
my cabin in the Osage hills, I wouldn't know where to look for it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Listen, I am no stranger to bumpy roads. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have ridden on highways in Africa where the last maintenance
was done from the air, with explosives. Once, in Khartoum, Sudan, I
saw a Volkswagen stuck in a pothole so deep that only the top of
the windshield was visible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've been on back roads in Siberia, where melting permafrost
turns the surface to porridge, and peasants pray for the blessing
of a 70-degree-below cold snap to solidify the goo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.S. 71 is not as bad as those. Not yet, anyway. But if you have
to drive it, be prepared to do without any amenities or
indulgences. Extravagant luxuries such as, for instance, coffee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was headed toward the cabin the other day, lulled and
half-hypnotized by the chattering vibration set up by the washboard
texture of the pavement, when suddenly I noticed that my coffee had
risen from the holder in the arm rest to nearly shoulder level. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just the coffee, that is. The cup itself had remained in place,
but the actual fluid had been propelled upward by the bouncing, and
hung suspended there for a moment -- still in the shape of the cup
-- before gravity had its way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some fell on me. But some, enough to be worth saving, fell back
into the cup. So I lifted the cup from the holder, determined to
hold it until the drink was finished. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had I taken it in hand than the bouncing began again.
At first, there were only little droplets arcing up singly above
the rim of the cup. Then all the rest -- or what was left of it --
shot out. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, these several circulations through the air had
cooled my coffee to a point where it was useless even to consider a
lawsuit against the convenience store where I'd bought it, the
contractor who built the highway or the manufacturer of the car I
was driving. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So there I was -- mad as hops, wet to the hide, with nothing to
drink and nobody to sue, undone by the product (as the signs say)
of my highway dollars and yours at work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are, I suppose, a good many ways to get from International
Falls to Baton Rouge. For example, one could get on Interstate 94
south of International Falls and head west to Butte, Mont., then
Interstate 15 south to San Bernardino, Calif., where you'd pick up
Interstate 10 and stay on it all the way across California,
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, right straight into Baton Rouge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You could drink coffee any time it pleased you, save a lot on
your laundry bill, and never once have to lay a tire on U.S. 71. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, to get to my cabin in anything like reasonable time you
about have to go at least part of the way on U.S. 71. Every trip's
a trial. But just when I've about decided to give up and sell the
place, I come to my turnoff to the east. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right there at the junction there's a restaurant with good
coffee to go. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, the traffic is light. The state road is
asphalt, laid by people who knew what they were doing. And those
last 27 miles are like riding on air. &QL;

 &HT;    DISGRACED EX-PRESIDENT SALINAS RETURNS BRIEFLY TO MEXICO FROM
SELF-EXILE
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Carlos Salinas de Gortari, one of the most
despised ex-presidents in Mexican history, returned here Saturday
for a one-day visit for the first time since he went into
self-exile in Ireland four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas was once hailed as a free-market reformer and
Harvard-educated golden boy who would lead Mexico into new
prosperity after he took office in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But after he left office in 1994 the Mexican peso was devalued
-- a devastating economic blow -- and revelations of alleged links
between his brother, Raul, and drug cartels began to trickle out.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas' legacy took a 180-degree turn and he is now widely
blamed for reckless policies that worsened poverty, and for
allowing drug traffickers to infiltrate the highest circles of
power in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At a Saturday press conference Salinas, 51, downplayed his
administration's responsibility for Mexico's economic woes. He said
he had been ``reflecting'' on his administration and that an
``objective evaluation'' could reveal his good and bad policies.
</P>
<P>
   But he suggested that he was the victim of a smear campaign that
had incited hatred toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After four years of a tenacious campaign with distorted facts
. . . and a smoke-screen over the deeds that occurred when I was
carrying out my responsibilities as president,'' Salinas said,
``who couldn't understand that kind of manifestation (of hatred)?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also recognize the difficulties that the Mexican family has
lived through,'' Salinas added in a contrite manner.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could identify who was leading the campaign against
him, Salinas suggested the press would probably know more than he.
</P>
<P>
   During the conference, Salinas didn't forcefully defend his
brother, Raul, from allegations that he accepted $500 million in
bribes to protect drug traffickers. Swiss authorities say $114
million is in Swiss and British bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas said he had no knowledge of the funds, but suggested
that the allegations raise questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say that my brother's behavior hurt me and hurt
Mexicans. I think it requires a clear, precise explanation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas vigorously defended Raul on other charges, however.
</P>
<P>
   Raul, who Salinas said he spoke to Saturday, is serving a
50-year sentence in Mexico for ordering the 1994 murder of Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the Salinas' ex-brother-in-law and former
secretary general of the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   Salinas told reporters he thought Raul -- who is appealing his
sentence -- was wrongfully convicted on hearsay and testimony by
paid witnesses and witnesses who received reduced sentences in
exchange for testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas also bristled when reporters asked him about drug
traffickers who have implicated him in smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years later there are those who remember things thanks to
reduced sentences offered to them. They don't deserve to be
considered credible,'' Salinas said. ``My administration acted with
full severity'' against traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas said he returned to Mexico for personal reasons, mostly
to visit his ailing father and attend his son's university
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Mexico Saturday on a private airplane via London
and Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas said he planned to leave early Sunday to return to
Europe. He said he didn't know when he'd return again, but said
Mexico ``will always be my permanent residence.''
</P>
<P>
   During the press conference with Mexican and foreign reporters,
protesters gathered outside a Salinas family compound in Mexico
City's exclusive Coyoacan neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Jesusa Rodriguez, a Mexico City actress, said, ``I think Salinas
is a psychopath'' who represents ``the face of impunity in our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   During the press conference, photographers climbed over a fence
to get a glimpse of the ex-president as he spoke on a porch.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in an impeccable blue suit, Salinas waved and smiled and
said, ``Let them pass.''
</P>
<P>
   When Salinas was asked to comment on Mexico's upcoming
presidential race, he stuck to the long tradition of ``no comment''
from Mexican ex-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not participate nor comment on anything to do with the
electoral process,'' Salinas said.

 &HT;    NATO FORCES ARRIVE IN PRISTINA: Situation tense as Serbs
retreat, Russians stay put
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-TROOPS-0613; KOSOVO-DEATHS-0613-1STLD.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ What began as NATO's exuberant liberation
of Kosovo Saturday turned into a dangerously edgy co-existence here
with Russian troops and Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO and Russian generals were negotiating at the city
airport to clarify command control of Pristina, automatic weapons
fire periodically erupted around the city, and burning buildings
still smoldered both in this provincial capital and its outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   NATO clearly was not in charge. Not only had the nearly 300
Russian troops dug in Saturday night at the airport NATO planned to
take as its own headquarters, but armed Yugoslav soldiers and Serb
police were making conspicuous patrols around Pristina's streets.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin were
expected to tackle the question personally in a telephone
conversation Sunday, in hopes they can make more progress than
envoys who once again on Saturday failed to resolve the issue of
exactly what Russia's peacekeeping role should be.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 additional Russian troops were expected to move
soon into Kosovo from nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces are not required to depart this central sector of
Kosovo for several days yet, but any NATO troops expecting to
dominate this territory were sorely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the juxtaposition of NATO and Yugoslav forces was
jarring. The incoming NATO convoy met Serb tanks and trucks moving
in the opposite direction -- apparently on their way out of Kosovo
-- and the Serb soldiers gleefully smiled and flashed their
three-fingered ``V'' for victory sign.
</P>
<P>
   At one intersection, a NATO tank was the staunch sentry on one
corner, while a Serb tank was an equally solid presence on another.
</P>
<P>
   Small Serb military convoys appeared to be leaving in accordance
with the Military-Technical Agreement (MTA) under which Yugoslavia
agreed to pull all its forces out of Kosovo within 11 days. U.S.
Army Gen. Wesley, the supreme NATO commander, has since said that
the Serb pull-out may take 3-4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, called the first meeting between British and Russian
forces at Pristina's airport ``cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coordinated occupation right now and the final details
are going to be worked out,'' Shelton told reporters, adding that
there would be 800 NATO troops in the area by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   British Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, the NATO commander whose
troops had been talking for days of capturing the Pristina airport
on their first day in the province, did give a statesman's response
to the situation upon arrival here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome here the Russian KFOR commander,'' Jackson said,
referring to the name of the international peacekeepers here --
Kosovo Force. ``We are setting in place the command structure
necessary to oversee the entire KFOR force.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether referring to Pristina's gun-happy Serbs, or merely
issuing a general warning, Jackson emphasized that KFOR will
vigorously carry out terms of the agreement Yugoslavia's military
leaders signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence or non-compliance will not be tolerated from
whichever quarter it may come,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Serbs believe NATO forces will be unwilling or unable
to save them from revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians, and see
Russian troops as their protectors.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and American officials were stunned when a convoy of
Russian soldiers moved into Kosovo's capital about 1 a.m. (local
time) Saturday and were met by thousands of cheering Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov went on CNN and said the
troops had arrived ``unfortunately'' from Bosnia and had been
ordered to leave Kosovo. But Russian media later said no such
orders had been issued. After parading through Pristina, the
Russians deployed at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   President Yeltsin's top foreign affairs aide, Sergei Prikhodko,
said on Saturday that Yeltsin himself had given the deployment
order, but left the timing of the move up to the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been expected to take part in the peacekeeping force,
but has been unsuccessful in negotiations with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to secure control of a sector of
its own -- alongside allies Italy, Germany, France and Great
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, whose talks are to resume Sunday with Ivanov, has
suggested that a Russian brigade serve in the American sector in
southeastern Kosovo and report to American general -- similar to
the arrangement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The tension here was a palpable presence Saturday. Serb families
were on the roads departing the province altogether or moving from
isolated villages to the protection of numbers in this city with a
large Serb population.
</P>
<P>
   They and their possessions were stuffed in cars and trucks and
the same kind of tractor wagons that ethnic Albanians used to flee
Kosovo under the rigorous Serb ethnic cleansing campaign that
finally appeared to be ending with the signing of the military
document. Now it became the Serbs' turn to run.
</P>
<P>
   A plump Serb woman walking in the cool rain exemplified the
intense animosity dividing the ethnic communities here. She began
vile swearing when she happened upon two carloads of Western
journalists sitting at the side of a street entering Pristina,
trying to fix one of their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out from here. Go away,'' she said. ``Tonight we will
massacre the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   The day started on a dramatically different note for the
hundreds of tanks and trucks and armored carriers that convoyed
from Camp Able Sentry outside Skopje, Macedonia, north across the
border into Kosovo for the first time Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian refugees cheered their departure from Macedonia,
and they proceeded largely uneventfully across the border and into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The British vanguard of paratroopers and Nepalese Ghurka Rifles
had little trouble clearing the road of explosives for the
following troops, but they strung boundary strings on both sides of
the pavement to indicate the limited area known to be safe to walk
or drive.
</P>
<P>
   And French tanks were halted by a minefield along the
Yugoslav-Macedonian border. A French mine-clearing team was
dispatched to the area, while 1,200 French infantry were preparing
to leap-frog over the minefield to fan out into the province.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans -- including liaison and de-mining personnel --
and about 200 Germans crossed the border, too, and the Italians
were to enter Kosovo later Saturday. A larger contingent of the
expected 8,500 Germans were to march into Kosovo from Albania on
Sunday, and U.S. Marines were to move in as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Once over the border, the convoy passed a virtually de-populated
land for at least 12 miles. Wrecked cars and ransacked roadside
restaurants gave way to entire villages where not a person nor an
intact window could be seen. Homes and apartments had big black
squares where windows should have been reflecting the bright
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Roses bloomed outside empty, often fire-scarred homes, adding
gentle color to the eerily silent scenery. At some apartments, a
few items of clothing still hung on balcony washlines, testimony to
the inhabitants' hasty departure.
</P>
<P>
   The first small group of waving people appeared just beyond the
town of Kacanik, but then more nearly abandoned villages filled the
otherwise bucolic countryside where lavender waved a blueish tint
to the fields and Queen Anne's lace made dots of white.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers and greenery of trees spreading over mountainsides
were an unseemly blend both with the destruction of the buildings
-- nearly every gas station and restaurant was damaged and empty --
and the presence of so many troops stationed to secure the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops lolled in a soccer field, stretched out on the sides
of roads, stripped to the waist to wash at an abandoned gas station
and threw up tents at a non-working brick factory.
</P>
<P>
   One farmer was seen haying in his field.
</P>
<P>
   When more people did begin to appear, they were an adoring
audience for the passing troops.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Urosevac, about 100 ethnic Albanians flocked
to the roadsides and cheered the incoming troops. They waved flower
bouquets and shouted ``NATO! NATO!'' and many reached onto the road
to touch the slower moving vehicles. Some even pulled at branches
of green camouflage and, if successful, wore it in their hair.
</P>
<P>
   At one roadside collection of smiling Kosovars, 31-year-old Ilaz
Noradimi told how his family had moved from place to place three
times after their own home was burned down. He was elated to see
the troops arrive in this cooling and clouding up afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were coming. We saw the helicopters,'' he said.
``This is the first time we have been outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others said Serb troops continued burning homes even on
Saturday, making a last statement before they left the region. And
smoldering remains suggested that was so.
</P>
<P>
   Noradimi, 34, said the ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo have
been ``in a bad state'' for more than a decade, and now in the
faces of the passing NATO soldiers, in the tanks and guns and their
support for Kosovar Albanians, he saw the light of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first day we feel free,'' he said.

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) _ Seventy-seven-year-old Bob Deheer was
arrested at the local VA hospital for trying to park in a spot
reserved for VIPs. Deheer was a machine-gunner in France in World
War II. During an enemy assault in the fall of 1944, another gunner
abandoned his weapon and Deheer took over and helped fight off the
attack. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. If
that doesn't make him a VIP, what does? By E.J. MONTINI. Story will
move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories.

TEN YEARS LATER, FATES OF MURDERER'S THREE VICTIMS REMAIN A
MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Theresa Brown. Joan Butler. Christine Rusch.
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 years ago this month that the three young Johnson
County, Kan., women vanished, never to be seen or heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of their fates remains locked away in a Kansas prison
cell, along with the man who has kept it to himself for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   His prediction to police, ``You'll dig them up,'' remains
unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of bodies, Richard Grissom Jr. was convicted of
murdering all three. His first chance at parole will be in 2071,
when he would be 110 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Each family continues to remember their daughters in their own
way, but the hope they have shared of finding their bodies has been
tempered with the realization that they probably never will.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, some members of the families would even prefer
that they're not found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a long time ago, yet the memories you have of
your daughter are pretty vivid,'' said Christine's father, David
Rusch. ``Sometimes not knowing everything is better than knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the dozens of police officers and prosecutors who caught and
convicted Grissom, it remains their biggest case, and the biggest
mystery of their careers. To a person, finding the women's bodies
remains a consuming quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody involved in that case is ever going to
give up until those bodies are found,'' said Johnson County
District Attorney Paul Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Overland Park Police Detective Bill Batt estimates that he has
spent 5,000 hours on the case. He still fields about two calls a
month concerning the whereabouts of the women.
</P>
<P>
   He and other detectives have checked countless cases of human
remains found throughout Kansas and Missouri and as far away as
California and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought we would find them someday,'' Batt said.
``For me, it's not over yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenexa Police Sgt. Pat Hinkle, who with Batt was one of the lead
detectives in the case, says he thinks Grissom keeps the secret as
a way to maintain a sense of power and control.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that one last card to hold,'' Hinkle said. ``The
families of these three victims deserve better. They deserve an
opportunity to bury their loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Butler says he won't celebrate Father's Day this year. On
that day in 1989 he was looking forward to a phone call from his
oldest daughter, Joan Marie. It was a call that never came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess my luck's running out, Dad,'' she told him in their
last conversation on June 11, 1989. She had been in a car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Butler was 24. She lived alone in Overland Park and was a
buyer at a Kansas City advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   On June 18 she disappeared. The $900 in her bank account was
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, Lenexa roommates Theresa Brown and Christine Rusch
vanished. They were both 22, born on the same day. Money was
withdrawn from their bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In what would become the biggest investigation-manhunt ever
mounted in Johnson County, Grissom, a 28-year-old parolee, emerged
as the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost arrested the night before Brown and Rusch
disappeared. A police officer stopped him in the parking lot of a
Lawrence apartment complex as he opened the trunk of Butler's
rental car.
</P>
<P>
   But Grissom bolted and escaped. A friend later testified that he
gave Grissom a ride from Lawrence that night and last saw him at a
motel about half a mile from the complex where Brown and Rusch
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Grissom's car, packed with his belongings, was
found parked outside a Grandview apartment after a maintenance man
saw him lurking under a stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   The manhunt ended July 7, when detectives and FBI agents
arrested Grissom at the airport in Dallas. But the investigation
was only beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives spent thousands of man-hours collecting mountains of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most haunting item uncovered in the investigation
was a security camera photograph of Rusch standing in front of an
automatic teller machine on the night of June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Oversized sunglasses cover her eyes, but what appears to be a
large bruise is visible on her forehead.
</P>
<P>
   It is the last photograph of any of the women.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives also learned that Grissom had killed before.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 16, he beat and fatally stabbed an elderly neighbor
woman near his family's home in Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Court records are sealed because he was a juvenile, but two
years later he was on parole.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said the case was a good example of why people mistrust
the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had all the earmarks of somebody who is extremely
disturbed,'' Morrison said. ``If the system had worked right, four
young women would be alive today.''
</P>
<P>
   The fourth woman Morrison referred to is Terri Maness. She was
found dead in her Wichita apartment 11 days before Butler
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Like the woman in Lansing, her body was mutilated after she was
dead. Wichita detectives joined their colleagues from Lenexa and
Overland Park in the Grissom investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Grissom was named as a suspect in the Maness killing,
charges have never been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom's trial in October 1990 was the biggest Johnson County
has ever seen. About 600 people were summoned for jury duty. Jurors
were sequestered for more than two weeks of testimony. It is
thought to be the only time a Johnson County jury has been
sequestered.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators waited for hours in long lines for a seat to open up
in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers Kevin Moriarty and Tom Erker were appointed to represent
Grissom. They received threats at their homes and office. The rest
of their law practice came to a halt for the 3 1/2 months they had
to prepare Grissom's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most labor-intensive and emotionally and
psychologically taxing case I've ever worked on,'' Erker said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors called more than 100 witnesses and linked Grissom to
Butler's rental car through fingerprints. A drop of her blood was
found in the car's trunk, and Grissom's wallet was found inside.
</P>
<P>
   Credit cards and jewelry belonging to Rusch and Brown were found
in Grissom's abandoned car, along with keys to the apartments of
the roommates and Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom operated a painting company and had master keys to
apartment complexes across the area.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman who lived in a Kansas City apartment described her
escape from an attacker who tried to abduct her a week before
Butler vanished. The attacker drove a car like Grissom's, and
Grissom had keys to that complex as well.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated for 12 hours before finding Grissom guilty
of 11 felonies, including murder and kidnapping. District Judge
William Gray sentenced him to four consecutive life sentences plus
an additional 90 to 360 years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Grissom is at the El Dorado Correctional Work Facility.
He gets out of his cell one hour a day, five days a week, for a
shower and recreation. The rest of the time he is locked down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he lives to be very, very old so he has a lot of years
to suffer and think about what he's done,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   On Father's Day, Ralph Butler will go to Mass and say a rosary
for his daughter. It is an almost daily ritual he started when she
first disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, I was hoping that she would be found,'' he
said. ``Now I hope that she's in heaven and God is giving her soul
rest and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Butlers, who live in Wichita, don't see the other families
very often.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns and Ruschs, who live in the Kansas City, Mo., area,
still get together once a year on the birthday their daughters
shared _ Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns have donated money to their church in Belton, Mo.,
for an outside prayer garden in memory of Theresa. They also have a
Mass said on the anniversary date of her disappearance every year.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruschs use money from an insurance settlement to make a
charitable donation in Christine's name every year.
</P>
<P>
   None of them thinks Grissom will reveal the truth, and none of
them has any interest in asking him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't give (him) ... the time of day,'' said Theresa's
father, Harold Brown. ``I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.''

IN THEIR INAUGURAL YEAR, MUCH RIDES ON SUCCESS OF KC CHARTER
SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City's new charter schools experiment
is among the more aggressive in the nation. That has parents and
educators both excited and worried. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This summer and fall, 15 of the independently operated schools
will open in the city. According to the Center for Education
Reform, a nonprofit group that advocates school choice, no other
district in the country has opened that many schools so soon after
they were authorized by state law. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the plunge into charter schools comes with questions: Are
too many of the schools opening too fast? Is the new law too
loosely written? Does the law lack proper safeguards for students
and the state money the schools will spend? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman sent letters last
week to the charter school sponsors encouraging caution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With the academic success and physical safety of students as
its top priority, the state board asks that you encourage schools
that are not completely ready to receive students to delay opening
until the 2000-2001 school year,'' Bartman wrote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools typically receive the same amount of state money
per student as any public school but are free of a district's
central office and much of the state's regulatory control. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By law, the schools must operate under a contract with a
sponsor, be able to measure student achievement and be responsible
for the school's finances. In exchange, they are free from
traditional school rules and regulations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman said he and the state Board of Education were worried
that some of the new charter schools would fail. With less than
three months to go before classes start, several schools have yet
to identify a site or hire a staff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Families and kids have to know that once they sign up for a
particular charter there's going to be a program for them that
lasts at least one year,'' Bartman said. ``Obviously the schools
which are just getting into business, there's no guarantee.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bartman wondered whether charter sponsors could oversee both the
academics and finances of charter schools. State law excludes the
Department of Education from conducting such oversight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bartman said the charter sponsors -- Central Missouri State
University, the University of Missouri-Kansas City and the Kansas
City School District -- have limited ability to check school
performances. Some sponsors, he said, seem reluctant to hire the
people it would take to monitor the schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At least the public schools have local boards of education
that can be held responsible,'' Bartman said. ``My concern is that
the law was written to clearly leave out the establishment from
oversight of these charters. We think there are some holes in the
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Thomas, a CMSU professor and chairman of the school's
charter oversight committee, agreed that the law is vague on
charter school supervision. For example, sponsors are not required
to review a school's academic performance until the end of the
second year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one is paying attention, these schools could fall flat
on their faces,'' Thomas said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also agreed that some sponsors are reluctant to hire more
administrators, saying it would create the very bureaucracies they
are seeking to avoid, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas expects that, to ensure the schools' success, sponsors
will work closer with the schools than state law requires. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is these are schools of choice,'' Thomas said.
``If they're not performing, parents won't put their children in
them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Oliver, dean of UMKC's School of Education, was
unavailable for comment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other charter proponents contend Bartman overstates the
problems. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judy Akers is associate director of the Della Lamb Center, which
will operate an elementary charter school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She said charter schools must follow state accounting
procedures. And they must routinely produce attendance records to
receive state funding. She said the schools will also face
tremendous internal pressure to show academic results. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The charter is a legal binding document,'' she said. ``If we
don't show accountability, we're subject to losing the very tool
that allows us to exist.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first charter school opened in 1992 in St. Paul, Minn. As of
April, more than 1,205 operating charters were serving 300,000
students in 36 states and the District of Columbia, according to
the Center for Education Reform. The schools cannot charge tuition,
must observe all federal anti-discrimination laws and meet health,
safety and accessibility regulations. All students must have an
equal opportunity to attend. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dave DeSchryver, a policy analyst for the Center for Education
Reform, agreed that if Kansas City opened a lot of charter schools,
it could lead to problems. But a recent report by the center showed
that less than 3 percent of all charter schools that opened before
January closed for poor performance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DeSchryver also said Kansas City will benefit from the
experience of other charters across the country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big number,'' DeSchryver said, ``but it's not
unmanageable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The impact of charters divides Kansas City School District
officials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Board member Sandy Mayer sees them as the district's salvation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the charter movement as comparable to deregulation,''
Mayer said. ``All the monopolies have broken up. Education is the
last to go. We're seeing a consumer-driven society affecting the
public school system.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said charter schools will speed up district reforms for
greater accountability among students, teachers and
administrators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All kids will benefit once the district starts changing,
transforming and competing,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet others worry that the charters could drain students from the
district and steal its top students and most involved parents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charter school officials said they were being swamped with
applications. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 9,000 students, or a fourth of the district's enrollment,
already have enrolled in charter schools. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not all charter students will come from district schools. Alta
Vista and Genesis, for example, already operate as alternative
schools and won't draw students from the district. And most expect
the free education in charter schools to lure private school
students. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zsa Zsa Addison, office manager at Hogan Preparatory Academy,
said students from Catholic grade schools and other area high
schools were flocking to the new charter program. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are like full,'' Addison said. The school has room for 250
students. ``The only spots we have left is for seniors.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   District officials say the uncertainty of how many district
students attend charters and how much money the district will lose
as a result makes it difficult to plan and budget. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an interesting experiment,'' Bartman said.
``We've got to hope for the best because we've got kids involved in
this thing.'' &QL;

BUSH LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN IOWA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMANA, Iowa _ So far, so good for Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Trailed by 200 reporters, Bush formally launched his
presidential bid Saturday with an energetic defense of his
``compassionate conservative'' philosophy and a bold proclamation
that suggested the hype surrounding his candidacy was justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be the next president of the United States,'' Bush
said early in his speech inside a farm building. ``There's no
turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying Bush's maiden campaign trip was the question of how
he would respond to the media frenzy surrounding him. And Bush,
though his blue dress shirt became soaked with sweat during his
25-minute speech, appeared to make a favorable impression and
avoided committing any gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators generally praised the address, and the crowd
responded warmly, interrupting the governor frequently with
applause. Several audience members said afterward that Bush not
only met expectations, but also exceeded them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the speech lacked specifics and was delivered with a
sometimes clunky style, Republicans said they appreciated Bush's
energy and seeming sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was great,'' said Mark Erceg of Iowa City, who
decided to back Bush after hearing him speak. ``He did a nice job
of connecting with the average voter.''
</P>
<P>
   Marge Ziskovsky of Toledo, Iowa, agreed: ``I liked his emphasis
on compassion and wanting something better for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trick for Bush will be to continue to show Iowans and
the rest of the nation that he's not merely riding into the Oval
Office on the wings of his famous name or on the passionate desire
among many Republicans to finally back a winner, no matter who that
candidate is.
</P>
<P>
   The going could get tougher. Last week, Bush's fellow
Republicans began taking shots at him, questioning his credentials
and emphasizing the untested nature of his candidacy. He is, some
say, merely a one-term governor riding the wave of a good economy.
Others equate him to a soap bubble yet to pop.
</P>
<P>
   There's something to that, suggested Peverill Squire, a
University of Iowa political scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, it's inevitable that some people are going to
feel disappointed by some positions he's taken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Bush ever will feel pressure to get more specific is
an open question, Squire added. He is so far ahead that he may be
inclined to coast and not risk alienating potential backers.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of rivals, Elizabeth Dole and Lamar Alexander, did their
best Saturday to push Bush. They stressed the fact that Bush has
not taken firm stands on many issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the former transportation secretary, unveiled a detailed,
10-point farm program aimed at contrasting herself with Bush's
nonspecific rhetoric. In a speech, Dole emphasized her support for
ethanol-blended fuels, a popular issue in Iowa because ethanol is
distilled from corn and offers a new market for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has yet to take a stand and, as an oil-state governor, will
be hard-pressed to offer similar support.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander dispatched a top aide, Brian Kennedy, to the event. He
termed Bush's speech a ``solid performance,'' but knocked the
governor for being vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to be more specific than that,'' Kennedy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd dismissed the concern, saying it is still
early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush began his first trip to Iowa with a quick stop in Cedar
Rapids before moving on to the Amana Colonies for a $30-a-head
fund-raiser for Rep. Jim Nussle. Then he was off to Des Moines and,
late Saturday, to New Hampshire, the state that has the first
primary.
</P>
<P>
   In Amana, the $30 bought Republicans a pork chop dinner. As they
ate, many seemed amused by the dozens of reporters fluttering
around the building waiting for Bush to arrive. Flash bulbs popped
when Cokie Roberts of ABC News entered the room.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush did not address farm policy, his speech was
delivered in an agricultural setting. The makeshift stage was
surrounded by bales of hay. On stage right was a gleaming red
tractor hoisting still another bale.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech full of sound bites, the governor emphasized his
intent to knock down trade barriers, strengthen Social Security and
cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that after we meet priorities, if we have money left
over it must be passed back to taxpayers so it is not spent in
Washington, D.C.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He drew some of his most sustained applause when he said he
would not make decisions based on polls, a direct jab at the
current administration, which has been criticized for doing
precisely that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be a president who sets a tone, a direction and an
agenda,'' he said. ``I will be an activist president who sets goals
worthy of a great nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would emphasize the need to teach children proper
values and the difference between good choices and wrong choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message must be loud and clear: It is not the definition
of a man to father a child out of wedlock and say, `They're not my
problem, they're yours,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He offered a stalwart defense of his ``compassionate
conservative'' approach to government, which critics have derided
as ambiguous and code language for a liberal style of governing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this approach has been criticized, but why?'' Bush
said. ``Is compassion beneath us? Should our party be led by
someone who boasts of a hard heart?''

BUSH RIVALS TACKLE HOG-SIZED PROBLEMS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Iowans demonstrated their passion for
candidates on the hoof Saturday, vying at the Pork Expo auction for
prize swine like Red Ace and Duncan, then gathering across the
state fairgrounds to amiably hear three Republican presidential
contenders try to buck the media whirlwind of Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush touched down with great fanfare in the state and in the
presidential nomination race, one of his rivals, former Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee, quickly criticized him, asking why Bush was
laying out broad campaign themes to the east in Cedar Rapids when
he could have been here tackling the deepening problems of hog
farmers face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of using slogans in another city he could be at the
Pork Expo at the fairgrounds saying exactly what we have to do to
open markets up,'' Alexander declared. His campaign aides searched
among a mere trickle of media representatives so that he might get
a piece of a political day dominated by Bush's arrival and maiden
speech before a traveling press corps of more than 100
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The odd psychological effect here at the fairgrounds, where pigs
squealed and farm families leisurely snacked amid clouds of
barbecue smoke, was of an offering of thoughtful political speeches
by a gathering of instant presumed also-rans, a feeling that
annoyed some listeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't exactly know why he gets this big buildup,'' Linda
Hicks, a housewife from nearby Clive said of Bush's being favored
by waves of organizational Republicans and of his prodigious lead
on the pack in preliminary opinion polls. ``His name, I guess, and
he has enough money to talk with people who have the big campaign
money,'' she said. ``I'm thinking of working for Alexander,'' she
added in the typical spirit of Iowans who like competitiveness in
their caucus season, which culminates in precinct preference voting
next February.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates who addressed the Pork Expo fairgoers,
Elizabeth Dole, former Red Cross president, and Rep. John R. Kasich
of Ohio, chose to take the day's focus on Bush in stride and speak
in detail of their farm proposals. Alexander, who has been running
for five years, also offered a list of ideas to help pig farmers.
But he took care to draw a political bead on Bush as the
beneficiary more of hyperbole, he complained, than of hard work
among the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too important to be inherited,'' he said of the
nomination in an allusion to former President George Bush, the
governor's father. ``It ought to be earned,'' he told an audience
of more than 200 people. ``I am here today and not somewhere else
in order to earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, who brandished the most detailed program of all for
her highly knowledgeable audience, drew repeated applause as she
praised American farmers and sympathized with their problems in the
global market. In a demonstration of political adaptability, she
said the new peace in Kososvo should be used as an opportunity for
American farmers to sell exports to ``people in the mountains and
the forests who desperately need food.''
</P>
<P>
   All three Republicans stressed the need for more open marketing
information for farmers anxious about falling prices, for an end to
farm inheritance taxes, and, above all, for a rapid expansion of
free world trade as the salvation of American agriculture. They
criticized China only sparingly in the areas of human rights abuses
and nuclear espionage charges, calling for acceptance of Beijing in
the World Trade Organization to open its markets to American
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's do it quickly,'' said Mrs. Dole, adding that at the same
time ``we can be very, very tough on the human rights front.''
</P>
<P>
   The fairgrounds, with prize boars promenading for the auctioneer
just down the trail from the importuning candidates, presented an
early tableau of summer Americana. Listeners slaked their thirst
with fresh lemonade in the sweltering sunshine, while entire
families wielded big grilled pork chops for lunch in the
grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen so much pork since the highway bill passed in
Congress a year ago,'' Kasich of Ohio began his stump speech,
surveying a vast campus devoted to the products, achievements and
problems of America's hog farmers.
</P>
<P>
   There were computerized high-tech management programs (``Swine
Finish'') and giant mechanical paraphernalia resembling space
rocket vents used in the odoriferous hog megafarms that have been
eliminating Iowa's traditional family homesteads. There was also
the ``PigCasso'' show over in the art tent where the lucrative
creature groomed for the abattoir was sentimentally
anthropomorphized after the styles of Modigliani, Grant Wood, and
even George Grosz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of a populist at heart,'' said Kasich as he spoke
emotionally of the family farm as the repository of moral values
that ``need to transcend time.'' ``Those old fashioned God-fearing
values that dominate the small town in rural America,'' he said,
matching his rivals in their bucolic enthusiasms. All three paid
homage to two Iowan political icons _ ethanol, the subsidized
automobile fuel produced here from corn, and the state's senior
senator, Charles E. Grassley. He listened in blue jeans off to the
side and kept his counsel about whom he might eventually endorse.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley did not fault Bush for not using the Pork Expo as a
campaign stop, saying that in multiple campaign visits across the
year he expected Bush and his rivals must all offer detailed farm
programs in order to be taken seriously in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three candidates stumping the Pork Expo, only Alexander,
who party professionals say needs a strong early showing to
continue beyond Iowa, allowed his frustration to show at the
pre-emption of so much early attention by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give him credit for winning the pre-season,'' he said. ``His
strategy is to make sure that the contest never gets to the
people,'' Alexander contended. ``Mine is to make sure it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasich gently observed of Bush, ``A guy so far ahead in the race
doesn't need my advice.'' Then he turned back to listening to a hog
farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole hurried from the Pork Expo to her next stop, beaming,
``I'm just enjoying my day in Iowa.''

FAMOUS FOR ITS FESCUE, TOWN ALSO HAS A FESTIVAL WITH A FUNNY NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLEAN, Mo. -- What did Missourians do last weekend? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom might be that Show-Me residents,
seemingly in lockstep, mowed yards, attended baseball games, fired
up the barbecue and hauled large boats to lakes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they also went to fishing tournaments (Maryville); rodeos
(Tarkio and Kennett); quilt shows (Kirksville and Carrollton);
homecomings (Lee's Summit and Union were among several);
wool-growing exhibitions (Butler); dart tournaments (Noel);
concerts (Weston, Columbia, Independence); and horse shows, craft
gatherings, 10K runs and even chautauquas. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, they attended festivals, those oversized block
parties that little towns throw and that feature food, soft drinks,
beer, games, booths and music -- usually loud. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That latter category fit Olean, population 106 and renowned,
Monday through Friday, for the processing of millions of pounds of
high-quality fescue grass seed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Saturday, Olean's numbers jumped to 6,000 as throngs
of people jammed this village for its festival. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Main Street was wall-to-wall crowds; the local watering hole,
The Hut, was packed; Zeravica Park was teeming, and there were
enough motorcycles to make Olean resemble Sturgis, S.D., the
legendary rendezvous for Harley-Davidson bikers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was also the smell of cooking -- which organizers freely
admitted was aimed at snagging as many visitors as possible. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the deep fryers were turkey fries and bull fries -- what some
call mountain oysters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In short, the main course here was that part of poultry and
livestock rarely mentioned but which some find -- golden brown and
heaped in a red- checkered cardboard basket -- a culinary
delicacy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, some came just to say they've been to Olean's
festival, one whose official name adorned caps, T-shirts, beverage
cups and more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And suffice to say that the anatomical word preceding
``festival'' almost rhymes with it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Allen Groves came up with the name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was to grab people's attention, hit 'em right
between the eyes,'' he said. ``With a corny name -- you know, peach
or strawberry or ones like those -- people are going to go ho-hum
and forget it,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our festival you can't forget. People see the name and they
tell themselves, `I got to go and see what's going on.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Groves said the festival's name had drawn one or two letters in
the newspaper in nearby Eldon. No problem, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard a single complaint around here,'' he said.
``But then, we're not politically correct out here yet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But they are charitable. Sponsored by the Olean Jaycees, the
festival raised in excess of $14,000 for Camp Wonderland for
disabled children; Mission Inn, a group of 13 residences around the
country for kids with AIDS; and Access Day at the Missouri State
Fair, which gives disabled people a chance to go to the Sedalia
event in August. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our sixth year,'' said Dave Gooch, president of the
Jaycees. ``That first year people thought we'd lost our minds. Part
of it was what we were offering as food. Who'd drive out to the
middle of Missouri for that? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But Olean's perfect. Small. Good people. Traffic's not really
a problem, although parking close in can be a bear.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gooch is the first to admit there's absolutely nothing profound
about Olean's festival. But then that's the whole point, he said.
That and helping kids and the disabled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing could get a whole lot bigger,'' he said. ``We could
get a pasture outside town, mow it, and I'll bet we could bring in
$100,000. But that's way in the future. Right now we're just having
a good time with people who want to kick back, come to a small town
and have some fun.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While a tiny and random sample of those attending said they'd
heard about the festival through fliers or word of mouth, a few
told Gooch they'd seen Olean listed on the Missouri Division of
Tourism Web site, www.missouritourism.org. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be frank. When Olean's listing came in, we had a little
meeting about it,'' said Marta Newman, who works for the division
and runs the site. ``You know, the name. But then, it was a
festival and it does draw a lot of people. So we listed it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The division's Web pages currently are getting about 500,000
hits a month. And while that number sounds impressive, said Newman,
a more revealing figure is that a tenth of those _ roughly 50,000
people a month _ are spending from three to five minutes visiting
various parts of the site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the ones who are really interested,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The site, added Newman, offers Missouri an opportunity to cut
the spending for making and mailing high-cost, four-color printed
brochures and ads. Plus, she said, it may mean that spur-of-the
moment travelers with access to the Internet can just head out to a
rodeo in Tarkio, a concert in Columbia, even a dart tournament in
Noel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at our site today,'' Newman said. ``There's
something going on in Kansas City to do with alligators. Well,
maybe somebody in eastern Missouri is really into alligators. It
probably won't be in their local paper. But we'll have it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in little Olean, hardly a familiar place name to most
Missourians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aileen Bishop, 77, also known hereabouts as ``Mrs. B.,'' sat on
her front porch on Olean's main drag and watched and listened as
the big Harleys passed by with their distinctive rumble. Time was,
she said, when not so long ago the road into Olean was just
gravel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a busy place then,'' she said, recalling there was a
barbershop, a truck line, a hatchery, a restaurant, a bank, an Odd
Fellows lodge, a milling company, a gas station, a garage, a
mercantile, a post office, several grocers, a lumberyard,
stockyards, and a high school and a grade school. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Now all that's left is a post office and a restaurant,'' she
said. ``The schools? Oh, they closed years ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. B was asked about the name of the festival. She said it
didn't faze her a whit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what they call it. Doesn't matter. What does
matter is that this town comes back to life, even if for only a
day.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Bush mBy Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMANA, Iowa _ The trip had been billed as ``exploratory,'' but
at a barbecue lunch fund-raiser for an Iowa congressman, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush on Saturday made official what everybody has known
for months: He wants to move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come here today to tell you this: I'm running for
president of the United States,'' he told a crowd of several
hundred cheering people gathered for a fund-raiser for Rep. Jim
Nussle at a historic German community called the Amana Colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no turning back _ and I intend to be the next
president of the United States,'' Bush said in a surprise
announcement on the same day that his father turned 75.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's head-first entry into the White House race marked a
decided change in strategy in recent weeks. In mid-May, Karl Rove,
Bush's top political adviser, said the governor was planning to
assume a tone of ``I'm exploring it'' during this first foray. This
trip, Rove said last month, was to be ``an introductory thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's Saturday comments came amid rumblings of dissatisfaction
from Iowa and New Hampshire Republicans who are used to seeing
candidates early and often. Where, they asked in recent weeks, was
Bush, who was working behind the scenes on a presidential race
while the Texas Legislature moved toward its May 31 conclusion?
</P>
<P>
   On a spring Saturday in Iowa, where the presidential season
unofficially begins with an August straw poll and officially starts
with its February caucuses, Bush showed up to begin filling in the
blanks for voters who know him only as an as-seen-on-TV candidate.
He arrived during the busiest week in Iowa so far this year for
presidential aspirants. GOP challengers Elizabeth Dole, Lamar
Alexander and John Kasich were also in the state. And earlier in
the week, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan and Gary Bauer visited.
</P>
<P>
   While his GOP opponents slammed Bush on issues ranging from
abortion to trying to inherit the nomination, they were noticeably
silent about Bush after his Saturday declaration.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Democratic National Committee, with months to
prepare for Bush's entry into the race, was ready with a
full-frontal assault on the GOP front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' goal was to link Bush with a fallen GOP leader
and the party's far-right reaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know that George Bush's `compassionate conservatism' is
really just Newt Gingrich's `Contract with America,''' said
Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew in releasing a
document that asks ``Is Bush really any different from Newt
Gingrich, Pat Robertson or any other old-fashioned right-wing
conservative?''
</P>
<P>
   After months of pretended indecision, Bush put himself solidly
on the starting line here Saturday with a speech that was quickly
posted on his web site and listed as ``The Speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am running for president of the United States. Full
throttle. Pedal to the floor. No turning back,'' his posted speech
said. Although he deviated slightly when he spoke to the Iowa
crowd, Bush left no doubt that he's in.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the front-runner in the polls long before he asked for a
single vote, headed out from Austin Saturday morning on a campaign
jet his staff has dubbed ``Great Expectations.'' In Iowa, Bush and
his wife, Laura, were greeted by a boisterous crowd that filled a
hangar at the Cedar Rapids airport. They waved signs reading,
``Iowa is Bush Country,'' ``Iowa Loves Laura,'' and ``Viva Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman handed Bush her cell phone so he could say hello to
her sister. Hours before his official announcement, the governor
shattered all pretense of the trip as an ``exploratory'' mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want your vote in the caucuses,'' he said into the phone as
he smiled for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa hosts the February caucuses that are viewed as the
traditional kick-off of the presidential campaign season. The
contests actually will begin when Louisiana holds its caucuses
prior to Iowa's, but many top contenders skipped Louisiana in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's entry into the race will make it difficult for Bush
to skip Iowa's August straw poll, generally regarded as the first
major test of strength. As an undeclared candidate, Bush, perhaps
seeking to avoid an early stumble, might have been able to skip the
August event. With what he said here Saturday, it now would be
difficult for him to beg off.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bush will head to Maine for a quiet day with his parents
in Kennebunkport. He'll hit the campaign trail again Monday and
Tuesday in New Hampshire, which hosts the nation's first primary,
and then he goes to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first out-of-state foray for Bush, who stuck to his
pledge not to leave Texas before the Legislature adjourned. Without
actively campaigning or appearing at an out-of-state fund-raiser
until this past Friday, he has built a large lead over his rivals.
He has secured so many major GOP endorsements and raised so much
money _ an expected $20 million by month's end _ that many have all
but crowned him the winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush aides who chose the name for his airplane were poking
fun at those high expectations. The candidate did the same thing
when he greeted the roughly 100 reporters who flew with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please store your expectations securely in the overhead bins,
as they may shift during the trip and hurt someone _ especially
me,'' Bush said over the intercom as the plane _ and his campaign _
prepared for take-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please understand that while you are traveling with a
well-trained crew, for many of us this is our first solo flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, wearing ostrich skin cowboy boots and a state of Texas
belt buckle embossed with his name, appeared to be a little
apprehensive as he wandered back with a cup of coffee to talk to
reporters. But he was buoyed by the enthusiasm of the crowd at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready, I'm ready,'' he said, as if to steel himself for
the journey ahead. ``I intend to earn this nomination and I intend
to win this nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   This trip marks Bush's official introduction to a national
audience. But, as promised, he didn't offer much in the way of
specific policy proposals. In his speech at the barbecue, the
prelude to a ``formal'' announcement in the fall, Bush focused
mostly on the broad themes that would guide him as president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be a president who sets a tone, a direction, an agenda.
I will be an activist president, who sets goals worthy of a great
nation. I will not use my office as a mirror to reflect public
opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be guided by conservative principles, that government
should do a few things, and do them well. Government should not try
to be all things to all people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeated many of the themes he's ridden to two
gubernatorial victories in Texas. He talked about personal
responsibility, limiting government regulation, and rallying
``armies of compassion,'' such as the faith-based organizations he
has empowered in Texas, to provide many social services in a
nongovernmental way. He also defended his self-styled
``compassionate conservatism,'' which some of his Republican
opponents have ridiculed as meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this approach has been criticized, but why? Is
compassion beneath us? Is mercy below us? Should our party be led
by someone who boasts of a hard heart?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did touch on some specifics, saying he'd support allowing
people to invest part of their Social Security contributions in
private accounts, and that he'd increase defense spending. With
little detail, he also said he'd cut taxes without hurting
``struggling families on the outskirts of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who attended the luncheon weren't bothered by the dearth
of specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he came up with a plan,'' said 22-year-old Randy
Foreman of Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Edwards, a retired farmer from Marengo, said Bush was smart
to avoid hot-button issues so early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the abortion issue totally alone, which I think may be
just as well for the present,'' said Edwards, who is anti-abortion
rights. ``But he's going to have to make a stand sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League (NARAL) prepared for Bush's trip by publicizing his
anti-abortion rights views on bill boards and on radio commercials
in Iowa. But those hoping to pin Bush down were disappointed:
Nearly all of the people who attended Saturday's events already are
Bush supporters, and there wasn't a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Bush's late arrival here could hurt him, but an early
start doesn't guarantee success: Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who began
organizing here long before the 1996 campaign was in high gear,
finished a dismal fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Bush chairman Joe Gunderson insists that ``Iowans don't
think that a shortened presidential election cycle is a bad
thing,'' and Bush supporters here have worked hard to put a
positive spin on the governor's promise to remain in Texas until
after the legislative session.

ONLY BUSS COULD PULL OFF MEGA-DEAL FOR JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the end, Jerry Buss' vanity overcame his
stubbornness. And that is why, when Phil Jackson returns from his
Klondike vacation, he will become the next coach of the Los Angeles
Lakers for a cool $6 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   That type of cash was previously reserved only for the Kobe
Bryants and Shaquille O'Neals of Lakerland.
</P>
<P>
   The dirty little secret of the Lakers' organization is that Buss
pays his players top dollar and everyone else works for dirt. That
also applies, to a certain extent, to the coaching position. At
least until now.
</P>
<P>
   Buss bent because his self-image is probably the only thing that
could trump his pocketbook. His playboy persona and devil-may-care
attitude made him a fan favorite, but lately he was beginning to
look more like George Steinbrenner with a bad dye job.
</P>
<P>
   The aloofness toward Jerry West. The desire to sign Dennis
Rodman over West's objections. The constant rumblings that this was
no longer pro sports' most ideally run franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Buss started to look more and more like a caricature and people
were wondering if he had lost it. That's that last thing a swinger
like Buss ever wants to be said about him.
</P>
<P>
   So it was time for a bold move. Enter Jackson. He's been
drooling over the thought of coaching the Lakers for a year, and
likes the team's makeup even more now.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson believes O'Neal, Bryant and Glen Rice _ yes, Glen Rice _
can perfectly execute his beloved triangle offense. He also has the
stomach and star power to keep the immature Lakers in line.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jackson who convinced Michael Jordan to stop thinking of
his teammates as his ``supporting cast.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Jackson who berated Horace Grant until he became a
rebounding menace.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jackson who got Scottie Pippen to believe in himself
without it being a detriment to teammates.
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson needs the Lakers as much as they need him. Jackson
doesn't want his obituary to read that he won six NBA titles, all
with Jordan. Shoot, the average fan figures he could have won six
titles with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson needs to demonstrate he can go somewhere else and claim
a championship. So why not go to a team that has two of the biggest
stars in the game?
</P>
<P>
   The loser in all of this, of course, is Rambis. He was sent to
Chicago for the pre-draft camp while the organization was secretly
negotiating with Jackson's camp.
</P>
<P>
   But Rambis had his own issues, though none probably mattered
more than Buss' desire to hit the home run with the fans. Rambis
couldn't broker a peace deal between Shaq and Kobe and never seemed
to reach the moody Rice. He also used Derek Harper inconsistently
and tried to cut his influence in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about Rambis. He'll likely be securing a deal a year
from now with another NBA team. Besides, as tumultuous as coaching
the Lakers might have seemed, he could have made a bigger mistake
and taken the Los Angeles Clippers job.
</P>
<P>
   Look who's talking: The Bulls were thought to be satisfied with
keeping the No. 1 pick. But they may be tempted by some recent
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is reportedly offering its fifth and 12th picks for the
top spot so the Raptors can draft Maryland's Steve Francis. Then
there is Atlanta, which is trying to put together a package
involving players and draft picks to grab the Bulls' draft choice.
And yes, Dikembe Mutombo's name has been mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   As for Vancouver, it was presumed ready and willing to deal its
pick at No.2 under any circumstances. Now there is strong sentiment
that the Grizzlies will consider keeping the choice if Francis is
available, and pairing him with Mike Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   And they are also warming to Lamar Odom, if he drops out of the
top slot.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you believe the talk in Portland, the Blazers are
willing to part with Rasheed Wallace for the Grizzlies' pick.
</P>
<P>
   Seven's an unlucky number: Down at No. 7, Washington GM Wes
Unseld is hoping someone will offer him a veteran, because the
Wizards don't believe anyone will be available to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he'll continue begging Isiah Thomas to become
the coach.
</P>
<P>
   Bad Penny: Orlando coach Doc Rivers gave it the old college try
to keep him, but the Magic wasn't exactly broken up that Penny
Hardaway opted out of his contract and became a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Several teams, including Minnesota, are interested in Penny but
the Magic is relieved to rid itself of Hardaway's negative
influence in the locker room, especially with impressionable
rookies like Matt Harpring and Michael Doleac.
</P>
<P>
   One team that won't acquire Hardaway is the Lakers. O'Neal will
never, ever play again with the volatile point guard.

THIS TIME, CITY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST THE LURE OF
PRIVATIZATION 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (NOTE-With four sidebars: PRIVATE-WATER, PRIVATE-ARENA,
PRIVATE-GOLF, PRIVATE-PORT)
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The blossoming debate in Kansas City over
privatization -- allowing private companies to deliver city
services -- is about money. Your money, as a taxpayer; city
employees' money, as wage-earners; and private enterprises' money,
as for-profit businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As with most issues governmental, this one has produced two
views:
</P>
<P>
   Advocates see bloated payrolls slashed; city services improved;
and more money for the city from its arenas, airports and golf
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see city workers laid off, taxpayer-supported public
buildings handed over to private corporations, and a profit motive
subverting and supplanting public service.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, the debate raging over privatizing has become
politicized since Mayor Kay Barnes' chief campaign consultant, Pat
Gray, was linked to a private company's efforts to manage or buy
the Water Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   But privatizing is really nothing new. It has been studied off
and on for the past quarter-century at City Hall and is growing in
popularity nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some Kansas City government services already are
performed by private companies, such as garbage collection,
boulevard maintenance and street resurfacing.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept has gained resonance in recent months, prompted
by a mayoral campaign that focused on better basic services and the
need to shrink a $15 million gap between city revenue and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Areas ripe for consideration in Kansas City are the convention
and sports facilities, drinking water services, Kansas City
International Airport and the city golf courses. Combined, they
have a payroll of about $43 million and more than 1,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   But some are urging caution, aware of the concerns by city
employees over jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have indicated I am not for privatization just for
privatization's sake,'' said City Manager Bob Collins. ``What the
mayor is asking for is that we have a reasoned approach for
providing services, looking at public/private partnerships as a way
to improve services.''
</P>
<P>
   Privatizing can take several forms, but in general, it means
shifting some or all of the responsibility for service delivery to
private companies, or to some type of partnership between the
government and private sector, with the goal of saving money and
boosting performance.
</P>
<P>
   It can run the gamut: sale of a city asset, in which the city
gives up all control; long-term leasing of a facility, with private
management and private or city employees; or short-term contracts
with greater city control.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another approach, which the city auditor endorses, involves
``managed competition,'' in which city employees can bid against
private vendors to provide a city service. They often win the bid,
reducing costs and increasing efficiency along the way.
</P>
<P>
   National League of Cities officials say they know the concept
has increased in popularity since the early 1970s, when cities
confronted shrinking budgets and the public's demands for greater
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge someone to come up with a service that I can't
find at least one city that's privatized it, including police and
fire,'' said Adrian Moore of the Reason Public Policy Institute, a
market-oriented think tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overarching lesson is that, if done right, it works well.
The trick is to learn how to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Definitive data on how well privatization has worked in other
cities are difficult to find and, because each city has different
problems, comparing data also is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But cities have privatized everything from trash collection to
adoption services. Usually, the private sector can perform the same
task with lower utility costs, lower purchasing costs and
two-thirds the number of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, for example, saved $27 million in 13 services between
1979 and 1994. It awarded 22 competitively bid contracts to city
workers and 34 to private contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest opposition to privatizing usually comes from unions.
Moore said cities must involve employees in the planning and avoid
any hint of special-interest favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Local 500 President Nate Byas, who represents Kansas City's
2,200 blue-collar and clerical workers, said his union was
concerned that the city might use privatization to skirt
affirmative-action rules. He said his members, two-thirds of whom
are minorities, feared privatization would be ``devastating to the
minority community.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moore said the practice shouldn't be perceived as a threat
to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The techniques for doing privatization without large-scale
layoffs and without putting the burden on the back of public
employees have gotten far more refined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cities such as Atlanta and Milwaukee have written into their
contracts that the private contractor must hire every city employee
in the area to be privatized. Other cities require contractors to
give right of first refusal to public employees, using attrition
and buyouts to cut the work force.
</P>
<P>
   In one example cited by the National League of Cities,
Charlotte, N.C., adopted a no-layoff policy, but still managed to
reduce the work force by 272 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Byas said he wasn't opposed to managed competition between
Kansas City employees and the private sector, but he wants to make
sure the mayor isn't showing favoritism or cutting deals for her
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   He also is skeptical that privatization can save money, because
many city employees already are paid less than private-sector
workers. Byas wonders what would happen if a private company
reneged on an agreement when profits didn't meet expectations:
``Then who will be the ones who make sure the job gets done?''
</P>
<P>
   Other city officials said talk of privatization hurt employee
morale and made it difficult to recruit employees and department
managers.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, a report on public/private partnerships is
expected from the city manager by July 8. Assistant City Manager
Rich Noll said he was looking at how other cities did it.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis, Noll said, created a committee of civic leaders,
city staff members and union members who recommend privatizing
opportunities. Noll thinks that's a good idea because he doesn't
want privatizing to be threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will put on an entirely neutral process that favors no
one,'' he said.

THIS TIME, TALK OVER PRIVATIZING WATER SERVICES MIGHT NOT GO AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (NOTE-Sidebar to PRIVATE-CITY)
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- More than four years ago, City Auditor Mark
Funkhouser recommended that Kansas City's water system be sold,
leased or turned over to private management.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing came of it. Today, city officials still run a
moneymaking drinking water operation with about 500 employees and a
$22.4 million payroll that sells water to the city's residents as
well as more than two dozen neighboring suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But talk about privatizing the Water Services Department, which
also handles storm drainage and wastewater management, is back. And
this time, it might not go away.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City isn't alone. Pick almost any city, and its water
department is likely to be at the center of a flourishing debate
about whether it would fare best in private or public hands.
</P>
<P>
   If Kansas City were to take its water department private, it
would become the largest water utility -- based on its
240-million-gallon daily capacity -- to be privatized in the United
States so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this is going to continue to be a hot topic,'' said
Jack Hoffbuhr, executive director of the American Water Works
Association, a Denver trade group representing 4,000 water
utilities in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization of something so fundamental as water is an
emotional topic.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, Ala., found that out last year when voters rejected
a plan by city officials to sell their department. Larger water
utilities in cities such as Oklahoma City and Jersey City, N.J.,
have retained private management.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's water utility earlier this year hired private managers
for its water department, becoming the largest to do so. Atlanta's
water utility, which produces 200 million gallons per day, expects
to save $400 million over the next 20 years in labor costs, energy
savings and operating efficiencies. It will use the money for
repairs and to expand the water system.
</P>
<P>
   United Water Services, a Harrington Park, N.J., company, won the
bid for the Atlanta system. Lou Ann Baker, a company spokeswoman,
said that the company took over in January and that savings were
already accruing.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the privatization debate is Chattanooga,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 130 years since the city was in such bad
shape that it couldn't afford to purchase a drinking water system
built on orders of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to water, old times there are not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga now wants to buy the utility, which has always been
privately owned. The utility's owner, however, is resisting, and
the city is trying to force a sale through condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it back,'' said Ken Hays, chief of staff for
Chattanooga's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say public ownership would save $100 million over
10 years and reduce water bills for consumers by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Loftin, a spokesman for Tennessee-American Water Co.,
the owner of the Chattanooga water utility, said that the savings
figures were bogus and that its existing rates were competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga would retain private management if successful in
buying the utility. But Hays said that Chattanooga needed better
control of its future and that owning the water department was key.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're crazy not to own our most precious resource,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In privatizing water departments, the fate of employees has
become the most sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
   United Water has recognized the union that represents about half
of the Atlanta water department's workers. The company also agreed
to offer benefits equal to or better than offered by the city.
United Water pledged no layoffs, and any staff reductions would be
through attrition.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there has been uneasiness among employees. There
were 430 workers in the department last year. There were 417
employees when United took over in January. Today, the employment
number is 402.
</P>
<P>
   One grievance is that water department employees can stay in the
city's pension plan, but only their service with the city will
count. No additional contributions will be made to the city system.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees say they will be harmed by the move. Atlanta
employees have filed a lawsuit against the city over their
pensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still problems,'' said Marie Robinson, executive
director of Local 1644 of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, which represents 2,200 of Kansas City's
6,900 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Robinson said water department workers under private
management had received higher pay raises than city workers
received.

CLINTON ASKS CONGRESS TO SUPPORT NEW INTERNATIONAL TRADE DEALS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ President Clinton urged Congress Saturday to help him
forge new international trade agreements that would create a more
open marketplace while making a stronger commitment to improving
labor conditions around the world.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted Congress to give him the authority to
negotiate trade agreements based not only on the notion of
protecting interests in things like food safety and intellectual
property, but to protect the environment and the rights of workers
in other regions as well.
</P>
<P>
   By publicly endorsing labor and environmental rights as part of
trade accords, Clinton is trying to close a huge breach in the
Democratic Party that has stymied his trade efforts for years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he was forced to withdraw a bill that would have
given him broader authority to negotiate after more than half of
his own party rebelled, led by the House minority leader, Rep. Dick
Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is bound to come up again in coming months. Some
Democrats are already threatening to make labor and human rights
provisions a part of any deal to get China into the World Trade
Organization, a step the Chinese have already ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   It is a particularly difficult issue for Vice President Al Gore
because he is seeking to mollify the unions, which oppose both the
trade authority and any China agreement, without seeming to differ
from Clinton's approach.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that in many countries children work ``in conditions that
shock the conscience,'' the president announced that he had signed
an executive order directing all federal agencies to take steps to
ban the purchase of goods manufactured by companies that use forced
or indentured child labor.
</P>
<P>
   The order requires federal agencies to make a list of any
products that they suspect were made with the use of forced child
labor, and any federal contractor found to be in violation of the
ban on selling those goods to federal agencies could be barred from
doing business with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the announcement in a commencement address at the
University of Chicago, amid a cluster of Gothic spires on the south
side of Chicago, where he personally greeted nearly every one of
the 800 graduates who rose to accept a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would step up his efforts to negotiate a new
international agreement that would seek to combat the worst forms
of child labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to figure out how to build a system that is both free
and fair, and not just to workers in the United States, but in
other countries of the world,'' he said to applause from the more
than 6,000 people who gathered on the Harper quadrangle here. ``The
only way to do that is to have trade agreements that lift everybody
up, not pull everybody down. They shouldn't undermine labor rights
or environmental standards.''

 &HT;    NATO FORCES ARRIVE IN PRISTINA: Situation tense as Serbs
retreat, Russians stay put
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-TROOPS-0613; KOSOVO-DEATHS-0613-1STLD.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ What began as NATO's exuberant liberation
of Kosovo Saturday turned into a dangerously edgy co-existence here
with Russian troops and Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO and Russian generals were negotiating at the city
airport to clarify command control of Pristina, automatic weapons
fire periodically erupted around the city, and burning buildings
still smoldered both in this provincial capital and its outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   NATO clearly was not in charge. Not only had the nearly 300
Russian troops dug in Saturday night at the airport NATO planned to
take as its own headquarters, but armed Yugoslav soldiers and Serb
police were making conspicuous patrols around Pristina's streets.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin were
expected to tackle the question personally in a telephone
conversation Sunday, in hopes they can make more progress than
envoys who once again on Saturday failed to resolve the issue of
exactly what Russia's peacekeeping role should be.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 additional Russian troops were expected to move
soon into Kosovo from nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces are not required to depart this central sector of
Kosovo for several days yet, but any NATO troops expecting to
dominate this territory were sorely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the juxtaposition of NATO and Yugoslav forces was
jarring. The incoming NATO convoy met Serb tanks and trucks moving
in the opposite direction -- apparently on their way out of Kosovo
-- and the Serb soldiers gleefully smiled and flashed their
three-fingered ``V'' for victory sign.
</P>
<P>
   At one intersection, a NATO tank was the staunch sentry on one
corner, while a Serb tank was an equally solid presence on another.
</P>
<P>
   Small Serb military convoys appeared to be leaving in accordance
with the Military-Technical Agreement (MTA) under which Yugoslavia
agreed to pull all its forces out of Kosovo within 11 days. U.S.
Army Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme NATO commander, has since said
that the Serb pull-out may take 3-4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, called the first meeting between British and Russian
forces at Pristina's airport ``cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a coordinated occupation right now and the final details
are going to be worked out,'' Shelton told reporters, adding that
there would be 800 NATO troops in the area by nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   British Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, the NATO commander whose
troops had been talking for days of capturing the Pristina airport
on their first day in the province, did give a statesman's response
to the situation upon arrival here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome here the Russian KFOR commander,'' Jackson said,
referring to the name of the international peacekeepers here --
Kosovo Force. ``We are setting in place the command structure
necessary to oversee the entire KFOR force.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether referring to Pristina's gun-happy Serbs, or merely
issuing a general warning, Jackson emphasized that KFOR will
vigorously carry out terms of the agreement Yugoslavia's military
leaders signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence or non-compliance will not be tolerated from
whichever quarter it may come,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But many Serbs believe NATO forces will be unwilling or unable
to save them from revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians, and see
Russian troops as their protectors.
</P>
<P>
   Both NATO and American officials were stunned when a convoy of
Russian soldiers moved into Kosovo's capital about 1 a.m. (local
time) Saturday and were met by thousands of cheering Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov went on CNN and said the
troops had arrived ``unfortunately'' from Bosnia and had been
ordered to leave Kosovo. But Russian media later said no such
orders had been issued. After parading through Pristina, the
Russians deployed at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   President Yeltsin's top foreign affairs aide, Sergei Prikhodko,
said on Saturday that Yeltsin himself had given the deployment
order, but left the timing of the move up to the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been expected to take part in the peacekeeping force,
but has been unsuccessful in negotiations with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to secure control of a sector of
its own -- alongside allies Italy, Germany, France and Great
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, whose talks are to resume Sunday with Ivanov, has
suggested that a Russian brigade serve in the American sector in
southeastern Kosovo and report to American general -- similar to
the arrangement in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The tension here was a palpable presence Saturday. Serb families
were on the roads departing the province altogether or moving from
isolated villages to the protection of numbers in this city with a
large Serb population.
</P>
<P>
   They and their possessions were stuffed in cars and trucks and
the same kind of tractor wagons that ethnic Albanians used to flee
Kosovo under the rigorous Serb ethnic cleansing campaign that
finally appeared to be ending with the signing of the military
document. Now it became the Serbs' turn to run.
</P>
<P>
   A plump Serb woman walking in the cool rain exemplified the
intense animosity dividing the ethnic communities here. She began
vile swearing when she happened upon two carloads of Western
journalists sitting at the side of a street entering Pristina,
trying to fix one of their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go out from here. Go away,'' she said. ``Tonight we will
massacre the Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   The day started on a dramatically different note for the
hundreds of tanks and trucks and armored carriers that convoyed
from Camp Able Sentry outside Skopje, Macedonia, north across the
border into Kosovo for the first time Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanian refugees cheered their departure from Macedonia,
and they proceeded largely uneventfully across the border and into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The British vanguard of paratroopers and Nepalese Ghurka Rifles
had little trouble clearing the road of explosives for the
following troops, but they strung boundary strings on both sides of
the pavement to indicate the limited area known to be safe to walk
or drive.
</P>
<P>
   And French tanks were halted by a minefield along the
Yugoslav-Macedonian border. A French mine-clearing team was
dispatched to the area, while 1,200 French infantry were preparing
to leap-frog over the minefield to fan out into the province.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans -- including liaison and de-mining personnel --
and about 200 Germans crossed the border, too, and the Italians
were to enter Kosovo later Saturday. A larger contingent of the
expected 8,500 Germans were to march into Kosovo from Albania on
Sunday, and U.S. Marines were to move in as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Once over the border, the convoy passed a virtually de-populated
land for at least 12 miles. Wrecked cars and ransacked roadside
restaurants gave way to entire villages where not a person nor an
intact window could be seen. Homes and apartments had big black
squares where windows should have been reflecting the bright
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Roses bloomed outside empty, often fire-scarred homes, adding
gentle color to the eerily silent scenery. At some apartments, a
few items of clothing still hung on balcony washlines, testimony to
the inhabitants' hasty departure.
</P>
<P>
   The first small group of waving people appeared just beyond the
town of Kacanik, but then more nearly abandoned villages filled the
otherwise bucolic countryside where lavender waved a blueish tint
to the fields and Queen Anne's lace made dots of white.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers and greenery of trees spreading over mountainsides
were an unseemly blend both with the destruction of the buildings
-- nearly every gas station and restaurant was damaged and empty --
and the presence of so many troops stationed to secure the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops lolled in a soccer field, stretched out on the sides
of roads, stripped to the waist to wash at an abandoned gas station
and threw up tents at a non-working brick factory.
</P>
<P>
   One farmer was seen haying in his field.
</P>
<P>
   When more people did begin to appear, they were an adoring
audience for the passing troops.
</P>
<P>
   On the outskirts of Urosevac, about 100 ethnic Albanians flocked
to the roadsides and cheered the incoming troops. They waved flower
bouquets and shouted ``NATO! NATO!'' and many reached onto the road
to touch the slower moving vehicles. Some even pulled at branches
of green camouflage and, if successful, wore it in their hair.
</P>
<P>
   At one roadside collection of smiling Kosovars, 31-year-old Ilaz
Noradimi told how his family had moved from place to place three
times after their own home was burned down. He was elated to see
the troops arrive in this cooling and clouding up afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were coming. We saw the helicopters,'' he said.
``This is the first time we have been outside.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others said Serb troops continued burning homes even on
Saturday, making a last statement before they left the region. And
smoldering remains suggested that was so.
</P>
<P>
   Noradimi, 34, said the ethnic Albanian people of Kosovo have
been ``in a bad state'' for more than a decade, and now in the
faces of the passing NATO soldiers, in the tanks and guns and their
support for Kosovar Albanians, he saw the light of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first day we feel free,'' he said.

PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE DEVELOPING TRACK RECORD MANAGING CITY
ARENAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (NOTE-Sidebar to PRIVATE-CITY)
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Private management of convention halls and
public arenas is hardly a new concept -- in Kansas City or
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In many states, private management of public arenas is the rule
rather than the exception. The notion has been bandied about in
Kansas City Council chambers for years, and Mayor Kay Barnes has
made no secret that she favors looking at privatization of some
city services.
</P>
<P>
   But the disclosure last week that Pat Gray, a Kansas City
consultant and Barnes' key political adviser, worked for one of the
nation's largest arena-management firms has agitated the Convention
and Entertainment Center Department's 223 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Philadelphia-based SMG, operates dozens of public
and privately owned arenas. SMG executives say they would love to
add Kansas City's Bartle Hall and Kemper Arena to their portfolio,
and they acknowledge they already have been meeting privately with
city officials -- but not yet with Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Bartle, Kemper, Municipal Auditorium, the American Royal
complex, Barney Allis Plaza and several city parking facilities
collectively generate less annual revenue than it takes to operate
them. They manage to break even through a generous subsidy from the
city's hotel and motel room tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   The Convention and Entertainment Center Department this year is
budgeted to spend $20.8 million, including $7.7 million for
salaries, while taking in around $13.2 million from rentals and
other operations.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is not unique in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to make a profit'' with any convention, sports or
concert arena, said Keith Curry, a consultant with
Philadelphia-based Public Financial Management.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Eckerman, an executive with SFX Entertainment Inc.,
agrees. New York-based SFX operates about 70 U.S. arenas and
similar buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our facilities are definitely in what I call the
popcorn-and-peanut business,'' he said, plus the occasional parking
lot, because those are about the only profit centers left after the
entertainers are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Top-name performers command fees up to 85 percent of ticket
revenue, and even lesser stars can grab 60 percent or more,
Eckerman said.
</P>
<P>
   It takes $11.3 million a year to run Bartle and Municipal, and
even though those buildings are rented virtually every day of the
year, they are projected this year to bring in only $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same story in Topeka, Kan., where SMG operates the
12-year-old Kansas Expocentre.
</P>
<P>
   The company came on board in 1993, five years after the center
was built and opened by the Shawnee County Commission -- whose
members gladly contracted operational control to people with
industry and marketing savvy the county staff admittedly lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stagnant,'' said Winnie Kingman, a former county
commissioner closest to the civic auditorium project.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization, she said, ``was the best thing for that facility
... and the reason for its success today.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling Expocentre a success, however, may be a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   SMG General Manager Gary Desjardin said Expocentre was running
an average $1.2 million annual deficit under county control.
</P>
<P>
   He said SMG cut the annual loss to less that $800,000 until last
year, when the red ink dipped around $400,000 -- thanks largely to
the addition of the Topeka Scarecrows minor-league hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still running in the red, but we've saved the county
money,'' Desjardin said.

 &HT;    Anderson extension unlikely before Falcons' camp
 &HT;    (Resending to fix garble.)
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons begin ``passing camp'' Monday, and
although attendance is not mandatory, coach Dan Reeves has made it
clear he regards it as important. For running back Jamal Anderson,
it could mean more than that.
</P>
<P>
   As contract extension talks continue with Anderson, team
officials are looking for a sign that he regards the Falcons'
efforts as earnest. It wouldn't hurt if the 26-year-old All-Pro
would take a flight from his offseason home in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Jim Sims said the goal is for Anderson to be one of the
three highest-paid backs in the NFL. The best offer the Falcons
have made averaged $5.2 million a year, which would place him in
the top five, depending on whose contrace interpretation is used.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation Anderson is waiting on a signing
bonus of $10 million, which would far surpass the franchise-record
$6 million bonus quarterback Chris Chandler got with his four-year
extension last fall, with $2 million deferred until this spring.
Sims isn't confirming the $10 million figure.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led the NFC and was second in the NFL last season with
a franchise-record 1,846 rushing yards on a league-record 410
carries. But Reeves points out that Anderson's breakout season was
just that. He had 1,002 yards in 1997, with a 3.5-yard average, and
1,055 yards in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' Emmitt Smith, Denver's Terrell Davis and Detroit's Barry
Sanders have nine rushing titles, five Super Bowl titles and three
league MVP awards among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a player who has had one outstanding
season,'' Reeves said. ``We don't have to be doing anything. We're
talking about a player who has a contract this year. Still, we want
to extend Jamal. At the same time, we've got to do what's best for
our team (financially).''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sims offered a counterproposal Wednesday, and said,
``We're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims would not say whether Anderson will be here Monday, and
Anderson could not be reached last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sims hasn't forgotten that the Falcons called the Patriots on
draft day to see if New England was interested in acquiring
Anderson in a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to know (Anderson) is going to be a Falcon,'' Sims
said. ``We don't want him to be used as trade bait again next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   Passing camp will barely resemble training camp, but there is
on-field skill work as players work in shorts, shirts, cleats and
helmets. Players will focus on basic offensive and defensive sets
for 30-45 minutes a day _ Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday _
for four of the next five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, but no thanks
</P>
<P>
   The agent for recently released Rams strong safety Toby Wright
called his former head coach, Atlanta defensive coordinator Rich
Brooks, to see if the Falcons might be interested. Atlanta already
has seven safeties, though, and probably will keep five, perhaps
four. ... Atlanta will not pursue recently waived Dallas wide
receiver Billy Davis, and probably will not pursue recently waived
Patriots cornerback Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   Working hard
</P>
<P>
   Strength and conditioning coach Al Miller said free safety
Eugene Robinson and defensive end Chuck Smith are in great shape.
``I don't think there's any comparative analysis that would show
how much further along they are,'' Miller said. ``Chuck's in the
best shape in my three years, and Eugene is light years ahead of
last summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Among rookies, first-round draft choice Patrick Kerney, a
defensive end, has been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Moving parts
</P>
<P>
   Reserve linebacker Craig Sauer, who moved from the weak side to
the strong side last season, probably will move back to the weak
side, where Keith Brooking is expected to start. ... The plan is
for Ronnie Bradford to get some work at free safety, but Bradford
will begin training camp as the starter at right cornerback, ahead
of '97 first-rounder Michael Booker.

   Honor thy uniform
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay left-hander Wilson Alvarez still is hearing about it
after flinging his hat and glove into the stands at Turner Field on
Tuesday night and ripping off his jersey. Now 8-19 with a 4.82 ERA,
Alvarez offered apologies to the team, manager Larry Rothschild and
owner Vince Naimoli after seeing a replay of his act on TV, but it
rang hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Rothschild said that Alvarez, in the middle of a five-year, $35
million contract, is out of shape and will have his weight
monitored. Alvarez flipped after the Braves nicked him for nine
hits and seven runs in 2 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never, as long as I'm managing here, let a player throw
this uniform on the ground,'' Rothschild said. ...
</P>
<P>
   Like father like son: Yankees pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre
took off just one night after being struck in the forehead by a
Tino Martinez line drive during batting practice. The hit opened an
11-stitch gash. Earlier in the week in Arizona, son Todd
Stottlemyre vowed, ``Nothing will stop me from returning before the
year's out.'' He continues rehab exercises to help a partially torn
right rotator cuff.

   Tigers `one year behind'
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers are through fooling themselves. The additions
of catcher Brad Ausmus, third baseman Dean Palmer, DH Gregg
Jefferies, right-hander Dave Mlicki and right-hander Willie Blair _
plus a $10.8 million increase in payroll _ created false hope. The
Tigers haven't been better than .500 all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're one year behind where we thought we were,''
manager Larry Parrish said. ``Everyone thought we were ready to put
it together this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly owner Mike Ilitch, who has reiterated his desire
for the club to be improved by next spring, when it moves into new
Comerica Park. The Tigers have taken series from New York, Boston
and Cleveland, but have won just two of their other 16 series.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys either have to find a way within themselves to
learn how to win,'' general manager Randy Smith said, ``or we have
to go out and get somebody to show us how to win.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Will pitching ever be the same after Kansas City's I-70 Series
with St. Louis? The two staffs gave up 63 runs in three games and
needed 24 relief appearances. ... AL player of the week Frank
Thomas, who hit .555 with four doubles, just recorded his 1,000th
career RBI but hears nothing in Chicago about his home-run
production. He entered the weekend with just five home runs. ``I've
always prided myself on consistency,'' Thomas said. ``Lately, it's
just been fun to hit the ball hard.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Keep on knucklin'
</P>
<P>
   Old knuckleballers never die. They just get released. Tom
Candiotti said goodbye to his fifth organization when Oakland axed
him, a painful decision for the A's. Candiotti was 3-5 with a 6.35
ERA when manager Art Howe called him in. ``It was real emotional on
my part,'' Howe said. ``I know how Tom must feel. I went through
it. It's not an easy thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Life immediately resumed. Rookie Tim Hudson took Candiotti's
spot in the rotation and struck out 11 in his debut Tuesday. And
Candiotti's name immediately was linked with Cleveland, where he
once led the Tribe in victories in 1987 _ with seven wins. ...
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's Ken Griffey and left-hander Jeff Fassero are running
neck and neck _ Griffey with 23 home runs hit and Fassero with 23
homers allowed. The Mariners discussed with San Diego the
availability of relievers Donne Wall and Dan Micelli. ... Texas'
bullpen was 17-1 entering the weekend and on a 14-game winning
streak. Rangers starters were 19-22.

 &HT;    Braves slumps contagious
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Slumps have been passing through the Braves clubhouse
like the flu. Next case: Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox started Keith Lockhart at second base
Saturday, he said, to ``get Keith some at-bats.'' Another factor
may have been to give Boone time to collect himself. He goes into
tonight's series finale on a 0-for-13 skid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go through it every year at some point. It happens,'' said
Boone, who had started 57 of the first 60 games. ``It's just in the
last four or five games, my swing's just got long on me for some
reason. I've got to shorten it up and get back.It's going to end.
It's going to end soon. It's just not any fun going through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone hit .302 in May, third highest on the club, but is
5-for-36 in June with nine strikeouts. He has lost 33 points off
his season average to .266 in the last 16 games. His last
extra-base hit came May 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing the ball fall,'' he said. ``I'm getting my pitch to
hit and fouling it off. I'm not swinging and missing and flailing
around.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager reserved comment on a Kansas City report
that Royals GM Herk Robinson had inquired about the availability of
Atlanta first basemen. Robinson, who has been in touch with ``six
or seven'' teams, was said to be particularly interested in Randall
Simon, though the Braves are not interested in dealing,
particularly now the rookie has just begun platooning on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some oars in the water,'' Robinson said. ``We've got
to have somebody who is going to catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals have been playing converted catcher Mike Sweeney and
converted outfielder Jeremy Giambi at first, with regular Larry
Sutton on the DL. The club earlier dealt away Jeff Conine and Jeff
King retired, leaving the organization stripped at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let Herk talk about his search for a first baseman,''
John Schuerholz said.

   John Smoltz is no longer wearing the energy band he wore around
his wrist for while.

</P>
<P>
   Add that to the body magnets he tried in spring camp and the
other treatments, workouts and gimmicks Smoltz has experimented
with to find a comfort zone for his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if encouraged is the right word,'' said Smoltz,
who tonight will make his third start since coming off the disabled
list. ``I'm more positive. I'm not going to be consumed with
whether it feels good or whether it doesn't. I'm more concerned
with how to win that particular game.''

   Jethroe meets Jones
</P>
<P>
   Sam Jethroe, the first African-American to play for the Braves
when he was the 1950 NL rookie of the year, made his first visit to
Turner Field Saturday. Jethroe came from Erie, Pa., for the
dedication of a baseball field in his name at Welcome All Park in
the Ben Hill section of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Jethroe was interested in meeting Andruw Jones, who last season
tied the record of 413 putouts by a Braves outfielder that Jethroe
set in 1952.

   Counsell, Marlins break up

<P>
   If you can't find playing time in Florida, someone is sending a
message, which second baseman Craig Counsell has received loud and
clear. After being lifted Tuesday for defensive substitute Luis
Castillo, Counsell, a hero of the 1997 world champion Marlins,
requested a meeting with manager John Boles and asked to be traded.
Friday, he was designated for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can handle being a utility player, and I can handle losing
my job in spring training,'' said Counsell, who lost the starting
job to Castillo during camp. ``But now they're telling me I can't
play defense?'' . . .

   Phillies right-hander Carlton Loewer had felt a ``dull ache'' in
his arm most of the season, but it was not until team physician

possibly snapping his arm, as Tampa Bay's Tony Saunders did two

   A vote against interleague

   Mark McGwire took his last look at the site of his first career
homer when the St. Louis Cardinals visited Detroit. As an Oakland
rookie in 1986, McGwire cracked a shot past the 440-foot sign at
Tigers Stadium, which will be vacated after this season.
</P>
<P>
   With the old park jammed with 20,000 just to watch batting
practice, McGwire marveled, ``If I hit a home run, they cheer for
me. And if I strike out, they cheer for me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, interleague play has lost its interest for the
Cardinals, who urge that it should be revamped on a rotating
divisional basis or scrapped. Growing familiarity and the imbalance
between divisions mar the current arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some divisions have more talent than others,'' former Braves
left- hander Kent Mercker said. ``Would you rather face Mercker or
would you rather face (Greg) Maddux?'' . . .

   The Pirates are pushing second baseman Warren Morris, acquired

homer to Tyler Houston in a 5-3 loss, after which manager Buck
Showalter nominated rookies Vladimir Nunzez and Byung-Hyun Kim for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Kim spiced the new arrangement the following night, when a
liniment-laced bandage he was wearing on his shoulder flew out from
under his jersey at mid-inning. Cubs first baseman Mark Grace
handed it to plate umpire Ed Montague during the changeover, and
Kim was promptly ejected for using a foreign substance. Showalter
maintained that the goo was just balm for a sore shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Grace laughed at that one. ``You have to give (Kim) credit,'' he
said. ``Most guys don't start cheating until later in their
career.'' ...

   The Dodgers' proposed move to a new spring training home has
become a mess, after the Fort McDowell Indian Community of Arizona
disclosed that their baseball facility would include no housing for

Fla., a more attractive option, the state of Florida has scaled
back tax-related offers to keep the team in their only spring home
since 1948.

 &HT;    Packers gear for rebound
 &HT;    (Resending to fix garble.)

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pundits in Las Vegas currently rate Green Bay as no better
than the No. 3 favorite, behind Minnesota and Atlanta, in the NFC
for 1999. Quarterback Brett Favre, however, thinks the Packers can
return to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened last year stung us,'' Favre said about the
team's second-place finish in the NFC Central and last-minute loss
to San Francisco in the wild-card round. ``Maybe we'll have the
luxury of sneaking up on folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Under first-year coach Ray Rhodes, the practices are longer and
more physical than the no-pads workouts of Mike Holmgren. But even
without Reggie White, general manager Ron Wolf has worked hard to
improve the depth. Look for the team to pursue tailback Lawrence
Phillips as a backup to Dorsey Levens and to sign a veteran
linebacker. There is optimism that fourth-year wideout Derrick
Mayes finally is ready to make an impact. And though the offensive
line is the deepest it has been in years, offensive coordinator
Sherm Lewis has Favre working from the shotgun for the first time
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The Pack used its first three draft choices on defensive backs _
Antuan Edwards of Clemson (No. 1), Vanderbilt's Fred Vinson (No. 2)
and Mike McKenzie of Memphis (No. 3) _ in an attempt to get bigger
and quicker in the secondary. But it is the return to health of
corner Craig Newsome and additional experience of free safety
Darren Sharper that defensive coordinator Emmitt Thomas will count
on for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say we were complacent last year,'' strong
safety LeRoy Butler said. ``I just know we're better now than we
were this time a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Saints getting busy
</P>
<P>
   At the league owners meetings, New Orleans GM Bill Kuharich
vowed the Saints would be active in the free-ageny market after
June 1. Two weeks later, he seems to be intent on fulfilling that
promise. Within a three-day stretch last week, New Orleans met with
offensive tackle Andy Heck; linebackers Dixon Edwards, Anthony
Davis and Greg Lloyd; fullback Tim Lester; cornerbacks Ashley
Ambrose and Ryan McNeil and punter Tommy Barnhardt. With $2.38
million in cap room and one-man draft class Ricky Williams under
contract, the Saints could make some noise. They were working hard
during the weekend to get a deal with Ambrose.
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   With free safety Mark Carrier requesting a contract extension,
Detroit officials have inquired about the availability of New
England's Willie Clay. The former Georgia Tech star has a base
salary of $1.5 million, and with the Patriots needing cap room so
they can re-sign corner Ty Law and strong safety Lawyer Milloy,
personnel director Bobby Grier might listen to offers. ...
Free-agent quarterback Neil O'Donnell is close to a contract with
Tennessee. ... At the Pittsburgh minicamp last week, former Georgia
star and second-year wideout Hines Ward was lining up with the
first-unit offense as coordinator Kevin Gilbride began installing a
more wide-open scheme he hopes will benefit quarterback Kordell
Stewart. ... It looks as if Dallas owner Jerry Jones will gamble
that Deion Sanders can be ready to play at least half the season.
Jones already lost one gamble this spring. He gave defensive tackle
Leon Lett a signing bonus to lower his base salary to $400,000. Now
he won't get much salary-cap relief while Lett serves his drug
suspension. ... Baltimore will restructure the contract of corner
Rod Woodson, who probably will move to safety this year. ... What
kind of shape is Ryan Leaf in? When the San Diego quarterback
finally showed up for a minicamp last week, he strained his
throwing arm in the third practice. ... Miami coach Jimmy Johnson
is incensed that rookie tailback Cecil Collins sprained his back
jumping on a trampoline at an event sanctioned by the NFL Players
Association. ... The league had to address a festering problem with
its Berlin franchise in the NFL Europe League last week. Some
citizens of Turkish background, upset by the fact that local white
women were dating minority players, were threatening players in
their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk juggles offers
</P>
<P>
   The Rams made two offers to tailback Marshall Faulk. The first
is four years, $19 million. The second is a seven-year deal worth
$38.5 million, but includes ``voidables'' that decrease its value.
</P>
<P>
   Money matters
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday, there was a total of just $60.45 million in
salary-cap room remaining in the league. But three teams _
Cleveland ($8.5 million), Philadelphia ($7.1 million) and
Cincinnati ($6.24 million) _ account for more than one-third of it.
Ten clubs each are under $1 million, and Oakland ($82,000), New
England ($33,000) and Carolina ($16,000) are under $100,000.

 Airport turns profit, but that money doesn't leave the property  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE RICE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (NOTE-Sidebar to PRIVATE-CITY)
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Some city officials think it's time to sell
Kansas City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Others think hiring a private firm to manage the airport is the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   KCI, with 330 employees and a $12 million annual payroll, is a
moneymaking commodity. Last fiscal year, the Aviation Department --
the bulk of which is KCI's operations -- made a profit of $19.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   So why sell something that makes money?
</P>
<P>
   Because KCI's profit doesn't benefit the rest of the city, said
City Auditor Mark Funkhouser. Federal law prohibits airport revenue
from being used by a city's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't buy a police car or fix a bridge or pave a road with
the money it makes,'' Funkhouser said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Councilwoman Teresa Loar said privatization advocates
should be cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Because of safety issues, Loar said, government supervision of
departments such as aviation is beneficial to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privatization is a real buzzword right now,'' she said. ``But
I'm not going to jump on a bandwagon just to jump on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City -- which has never tried to sell KCI -- might have
to move fast to make the most of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the federal government launched a pilot program for
the first five cities that sell their airports.
</P>
<P>
   These pilot cities can put the profits from a sale directly into
a city's general fund. Usually, any money made on the sale of an
airport must go back into that city's aviation department.
</P>
<P>
   Funkhouser said there was another critical benefit to selling
KCI, which sits on 9,500 acres. ``If a private company comes in
there, it would be paying property taxes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Property taxes that Funkhouser estimated could amount to tens of
millions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be as if we went out to recruit a big firm,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, almost two dozen U.S. airports are managed by private
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Cities and counties that have done some sort of privatization
with their airports or launched feasibility studies include San
Diego; San Antonio; Newark, N.J.; and Allegheny County, Pa., home
to Pittsburgh International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The poster child of airport privatization is the country's
largest privatized airport -- Indianapolis International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Since privatizing in 1995, Indianapolis International has become
one of the world's largest cargo airports. Its work force has
increased from 275 to 309, and its non-airlines revenue -- such as
food and retail sales -- has doubled.
</P>
<P>
   But Indianapolis Councilwoman Susan Williams said she feared
that a private company could make damaging moves to passengers more
quickly and quietly than government -- by raising parking prices,
for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to other cities is that if privatization doesn't
show a definite upside potential, then don't do it,'' she said.
``You would be giving an asset away.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks about privatizing in Kansas City have sparked concern
among some blue-collar and minority workers. Some experts suggest
cities make contract stipulations for minority hirings and union
participation when selling their airports.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Paul Danaher, a vocal privatization supporter, said
workers might be better off with a private airport because there
would be a better chance for merit-pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the present system,'' he said, ``someone who is getting
Southwest Airlines to expand here is not able to get merit pay.''
</P>
<P>
   And there can be job creation, as has happened at the Pittsburgh
airport.
</P>
<P>
   BAA USA took over that airport's commercial area in 1992 and
converted it into a shopping center-style operation with new stores
such as The Gap, TGI Friday's, and a Discovery Channel store.
</P>
<P>
   That new retail and restaurant area has created more than 1,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Webber, a local transportation consultant who
supports privatization, said non-airline businesses might not reach
that type of potential at KCI because of its curved, three-terminal
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't get the critical mass that you would normally get
from 11 million passengers a year at KCI,'' Webber said.

CEDING CITY CONTROL OF GOLF COURSES WOULD BREAK 93-YEAR-OLD
TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>

   (NOTE-Sidebar to PRIVATE-CITY)
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Urged on by Mayor Kay Barnes and new park board
Chairman Bob Lewellen, the Kansas City Parks and Recreation
Department plans to seek a feasibility study on some type of
private partnership for the city's four golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   If recommended, it would be a big change in a city that has run
golf courses since it opened the metropolitan area's first, Swope
Park Golf Course, in 1906. Today, the department employs about 110
people on its courses during the summer, with a golf operations
budget of about $3.3 million and a $1.4 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Still, privatizing of municipal courses is catching on
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   About one-fourth of U.S. cities contracted for golf operations
by 1995, up 67 percent since 1987, according to the Reason Public
Policy Institute, which supports prudent privatizing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, an avid golfer, wants the park board to explore what
other cities have done, the potential costs and benefits, and the
effect on city employees.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's four courses include Minor Park, Hodge Park and
Blue River Golf Academy in Swope Park.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and Lewellen said private involvement could range from
complete management of the courses, to management of the golf carts
and pro shop, to management of the food and beverage concessions,
or other combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Cities such as St. Louis and Indianapolis rave about
privatization, while Fort Worth, Texas, gave up on it in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, American Golf Corp. won a 20-year lease to run St.
Louis' two courses at Forest Park. The company provided $500,000 in
capital improvements, and the city now receives $125,000 per year
in revenue. Maintenance and use of the courses improved
significantly, said Dan Skillman, commissioner of parks.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis' 13 golf courses also privatized in 1993. The city
garners about $1 million a year in revenue and last year had a
$100,000 budget surplus. The courses also kept the lowest fees in
the state -- $15 for 18 holes.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, a company defaulted on its contract and the city
had to take back control of one of its two courses in January 1998.
The other company, American Golf, fulfilled its eight-year contract
on the second course, but the council opted not to renew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City Council wanted to see how it worked. In our case, it
didn't work very well,'' said George Kruzick, golf operations
manager. ``We had a lot of complaints from the golfers about the
condition of the courses. ... The other city-run courses were
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City parks department officials say they are not opposed
to some type of private partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt you can always improve your maintenance,''
said parks director Terry Dopson. ``It's an open question whether
privatizing would make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   City audits in 1996 and 1997 were critical of the parks
department's course maintenance, inventory controls, and freebies
to marshals and VIPs that cut into profits.
</P>
<P>
   Dopson said maintenance improved in 1998, the marshals no longer
play for free, strict inventory controls are in place, and profits
last year were more than $450,000 -- up nearly $75,000. But those
profits don't account for depreciation or indirect costs. If
factored in, the city auditor argues, the courses actually lose
money.
</P>
<P>
   In many cities, municipal employees remain on the job at
competitive wages but work for a private company, such as American
Golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the vast majority of cases, we offer to come into and
assume all the existing staff,'' said Sheri Clark of American Golf,
the nation's largest municipal-course operator.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager usually is replaced by an American Golf
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis' courses are run by local businessmen or PGA pros.
City workers were moved to other jobs in the parks department and
the courses improved, said Lou Hurrle, city golf administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Some Kansas City golf experts are skeptical that privatizing
would be an improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Krakauer, a director of the Missouri Golf Association,
points out that Leawood, Kan., and Blue Springs, Mo., contracted
for management of their courses because they had small parks staffs
that lacked expertise. He said that was not the case in Kansas
City, which hires PGA professionals to run its courses and has
ample staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they would benefit by having a private
company,'' Krakauer said. ``I think the replacement would be very
difficult. It would be very difficult for a replacement to know as
much about it as these guys know.''

BOTH FINALISTS HAVE KARMA, BUT SPURS HAVE THE TOWERS

<P>
   The NBA Finals: New York's Destiny vs. San Antonio's Domination.
</P>
<P>
   After an irregular season in which both teams hit rock-bottom
lows and contemplated firing their coaches, followed by provocative
playoff runs in which their stars sacrificed starring roles, the
Spurs and Knicks match mojos in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   While the favored Spurs own the home-court advantage and
dominant 7-footers Tim Duncan and David Robinson, the surprising
Knicks try to overcome key injuries by riding the unique talents
and unlikely chemistry of Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt we can beat them,'' said Camby, the human
jumper-cable reserve who has sparked the Knicks' shocking and
unprecedented rise to the Finals as the East's No. 8 seed.
``Nobody's given us a chance, but here we are. One more mountain to
climb. We've got a chance to do something really special.''
</P>
<P>
   With a simplistic plan based on the offense of Duncan and
defense of Robinson, the Spurs have been the league's best team
since March. They have won 42 of their past 48 games and are 11-1
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Knicks barely sneaked into the playoffs, then
needed a quirky last-second bounce to upset the Miami Heat in the
first round. Despite injuries to key players Patrick Ewing and
Larry Johnson, the Knicks knocked off the Indiana Pacers with
relentless passion and boundless energy provided from Sprewell and
Camby. The Knicks were 21-21 in late April, but 18-5 since firing
general manager Ernie Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of the intriguing strategic, social and silly matchups
that will provide NBA Finals storylines the next two weeks:
</P>
<P>
   Twin Peaks vs. Twin Freaks: Chris Dudley will never be mistaken
for Duncan's ``Mini-Me'' and the Spurs look like the Houston
Rockets during their repeat titles, only with two Hakeem Olajuwons.
The tattooed Camby and dreadlocked Sprewell will try to get San
Antonio's Twin Towers into a running game, but without Ewing and
Johnson, it could get ugly underneath. Advantage: Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Alamodome vs. Madison Square Garden: One has played host to a
Beatles concert, a Muhammad Ali fight and an NBA Championship Game
7. The other has pink splashed on its hardwood. Advantage: Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Rest vs. Rust: The Spurs haven't played since winning Game 4 of
the West finals in Portland on June 6. Their nine-day layoff will
be the second-longest for a Finals team, matching the Jazz's wait
last year and one short of the Lakers in '89. Both those team lost
the series, but the Knicks have to be physically and emotionally
drained. Advantage: Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   George Valle vs. Spike Lee: Valle, president of the Spurs'
Baseline Bums, has missed five games in 26 years. Lee wears a
bright orange towel on his head. Advantage: Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Texas vs. New York: See the NHL Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Popovich vs. Jeff Van Gundy: Spurs fans chanted ``Pop Must
Go!'' after a February loss that dropped their team to 6-8. Shortly
afterward, Popovich gave the ball to Duncan. With his team at .500
and on the playoff bubble, Van Gundy was given a playoffs-or-else
ultimatum. Shortly afterward, he started playing Sprewell and Camby
more minutes. Popovich could be mayor of San Antonio, but Van Gundy
now has job security and a $4 million bonus for just reaching the
Finals. Advantage: Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   26 years vs. 26 years: One team is Final-ly destined for a Susan
Lucci breakthrough. The Knicks won their most recent NBA title in
1973, same year the Spurs rose from the ashes of the Dallas
Chaparrals. Advantage: Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   One-horse Town vs. The City That Never Sleeps: The Big Apple is
the nation's No. 1 media market and home to nine major professional
sports teams. The town that invented jalapeno peppers is the 37th
largest market and home to the Spurs and the minor-league baseball
Missions. Advantage: Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Avery Johnson vs. Charlie Ward: Has there ever been a Finals
with such unassuming, unproductive point guards? Both score only
when wide open and are devout Christians who give credit for every
made jumper or victory to God. Considering their empowerment, can
either have an edge? Advantage: Even.
</P>
<P>
   River walk vs. Central Park: In San Antonio, you might see a
boat float by with a load of tourists. In New York, you might see a
mugger sprint by with someone's purse. Advantage: Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamo vs. The World Trade Center: Both still standing after
being bombed by angry foreigners. Advantage: Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight vs. Foresight: Take the vote now _ after Duncan's
demolition of Shaquille O'Neal and the emergence of Grunfeld
acquisitions Camby and Sprewell _ and the most valuable player
award would go to Duncan and executive of the year to the fired
Knicks GM.
</P>
<P>
   $1,290,000 vs. $855,000: Winners' share of the Finals' pot
compared to the losers' take. New York has the league's largest
payroll and the world's highest cost-of-living. Advantage: Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs vs. Knicks: Don't forget, the Knicks were one bounce away
from playoff elimination and the Spurs one game away from
postseason perfection. While the Knicks' enthusiasm has been
refreshing, and coach Jeff Van Gundy's tenacity undying, dealing
with Duncan is another world from defending Miami's Alonzo
Mourning, Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo or Indiana's Rik Smits. And if
that's not enough to rip apart the Knicks' inferior interior,
there's always Robinson. For once, the nice guys who would be flops
on MTV won't finish last in the NBA. Advantage: Spurs. nn

FLORIDA STATE RELIEVER STIFLES TEXAS A&AMP;M

<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Each time Chris Chavez is called to the mound to
pull off another desperate rescue of Florida State, Kay Chavez
rises from her seat and departs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, my mom, she's always done that,'' Chavez said. ``Whenever
I pitch, she'll walk off and get somebody to tell her what happened
... or maybe go underneath the grandstand and watch it on TV. It
makes her nervous to see me pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the afternoon yesterday, Texas A&AMP;M probably
considered joining her.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a withering relief performance from Chavez, the
second-seeded Seminoles (54-12) rolled to a 7-3 victory against
Texas A&AMP;M (52-17), dropping the Aggies into an elimination game at
6:30 p.m. tomorrow against the Stanford-Cal State Fullerton loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, you'd have to say this was a game that Chavez
just came in and took control of,'' Seminoles coach Mike Martin
said. ``Not forgetting, of course, what Matt Diaz \Rtwo home runs,
three runs batted in\S did, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   game.'']
</P>
<P>
   Chavez arrived in the fifth inning afterSeminoles ace Nick
Stocks walked the first three batters. A 4-3 Seminoles lead was
teetering, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who mixes a sidearm delivery with his normal pitching
motion, struck out the next three hitters, eventually retiring 12
in a row before Chad Hudson opened the ninth with single. By then,
Florida State had a four-run cushion, and Hudson was promptly
erased in a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez faced the minimum 15 batters, struck out six, and then
went off to find his mom and give her a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just bases-loaded, no-outs, one-run game,'' Martin
said. ``Not really that tough of a situation.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M coach Mark Johnson said the Aggies had been mesmerized by
Chavez, who is 7-5 with five saves, a 2.35 earned-run average and
102 strikeouts in 78 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if you look at the opponents batting average against him
\R.194\S, it's not that surprising,'' Johnson said. ``We'd never
seen him, and he has a unique motion that's hard to pick up. And he
can make the ball break both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Shawn Schumacher, who homered off Stocks in the second,
expressed the Aggies' frustration with Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat there inning after inning trying to pick up some kind of
pattern,'' he said. ``He didn't have one; he threw anything he had
whenever he wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's Casey Fossum pitched into the eighth and threw 144
pitches. His four strikeouts made him the school's career leader
with 404, passing Jeff Granger.
</P>
<P>
   Both Texas entries in the College World Series lost their
openers; Rice faces Oklahoma State in an elimination game tonight,
and the Aggies will try to survive tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this dropped us to our knees,'' Johnson said.
``We've been in this situation before.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Who are these girls of summer? You've probably
heard of Mia Hamm, but how about Nigeria's ``Marvelous'' Mercy
Akide? Or a Mexican named Laurie Hill?
</P>
<P>
   With the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup less than a week away, its
theme _ ``If we build it they will come'' _ is looking more
dignified each day. This could actually become the breakthrough
event that WWC president Marla Messing has been talking about. The
tournament gets underway Saturday in New York and San Jose, with a
doubleheader scheduled for the Rose Bowl next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it has all the personalities of a big event, which is
being billed as the single largest women's sporting event ever in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   WWC and FIFA officials have sold more than 388,000 tickets for
the 10 venues throughout the country. WWC hopes to sell 400,000 to
500,000 tickets before the tournament ends.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also believe they can put a half-million spectators
in the seats by selling out the 77,716-seat Giants Stadium for the
American and tournament opener Saturday and the 92,542-seat Rose
Bowl for the championship game July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers easily exceed the total of 112,000 tickets sold
for the 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden or any other single
women's event held here previously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's well beyond what we expected it to be,'' said Messing.
``The demand is greater than we had projected. It's one of two
things: The people we thought would buy are buying a whole lot
earlier, or a lot of people are interested in coming to the
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy said they will prove wrong the
naysayers who believed a women's event such as this shouldn't be
held in large stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said when we started this World Cup, `You can't do it
on a big stage, you can't do it in big stadiums, you won't draw,'
'' said Foudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell us what we can't do and we'll do it. We love these types
of obstacles. This is the opportunity for us to show the world our
sport and what we've done with it. Women's athletics needs to know
it can put on a big event and be successful. The hardest part is
they don't want to take the risk. We were fortunate enough that we
had great backing to take the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the (1984) Olympics and put the soccer final in the
Rose Bowl and sold it out,'' said Alan Rothenberg, president of the
1994 World Cup held in the United States. ``We had the (1994) World
Cup and put the soccer final there and sold it out. And now, with
the Women's World Cup, we've put the final there again. What we're
going for is the soccer hat trick.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's on. Sixteen countries will play a total of 32 games
during the tournament, which will be aired nationally by ABC, ESPN
or ESPN2, in addition to overseas television. The U.S., China,
Norway and Germany are the top seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many iffy teams capable of having a tremendous
tournament that the chance of upsets are tremendous,'' said U.S.
coach Tony DiCicco. ``Even those lower tier of teams are emerging
as dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. dominated the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991 by
outscoring its opponents 25-5. U.S. defender Brandi Chastain says
that won't happen again because other counties have continued to
get stronger.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, defending World Cup champion Norway defeated the U.S.
1-0 in the semifinals of the 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden; but
the U.S. avenged that defeat by capturing the 1996 Gold Medal in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are a lot more teams like Norway that can defeat
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is not the U.S. getting worse or people
catching up,'' said Chastain. ``It's other countries becoming more
involved with women's soccer. These countries always had the
potential to have good teams, it was just a matter of their
federations getting behind them and letting them play. The battle
was never could they play soccer, it was always about who would
allow them to play soccer.''

David Duval: Free and easy and on top of the golf world 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wraparound sunglasses are off, allowing an unobstructed view
of blue eyes that have seen generous helpings of triumph and
tragedy through 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, this simple act serves as the perfect metaphor for
a 1999 season that has seen David Duval climb to the top of the
world golf rankings and willingly embrace the distractions that
come with it.
</P>
<P>
   As he made final preparations for the U.S. Open, which begins
Thursday at Pinehurst (N.C.) Resort and Country Club, Duval
acknowledged he finds the fuss that surrounds him puzzling. In his
mind, Duval is little more than a homebody who likes to read books,
catch fish and break par.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including his parents, view him as a survivor of two
childhood ordeals that steeled his resolve and narrowed his focus,
two traits that ultimately benefited his golf game. But friends and
family members believe mental scars resulting from his brother's
death and the breakup of his parents' marriage made Duval leery of
outsiders until the past couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, said Duval, probably rests somewhere in between. Yes,
Duval said, he still thinks occasionally of Brent, the older
brother who died in 1981 when bone marrow donated by 9-year-old
David was rejected by Brent's body. He would have preferred that
his parents, Bob and Diane, stay together, rather than separating
and eventually divorcing, in the wake of the profound grief that
accompanied Brent's death.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, those events helped shape Duval's lone-wolf
personality that others, including former college teammates at
Georgia Tech, have interpreted as arrogant and aloof.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Duval shows none of those traits on this day, which begins
with a practical joke orchestrated by playing partner Fred Funk. As
Duval waited to begin the second round of the Houston Open in late
April, Funk sneaked behind him carrying a life-size, cardboard
cutout of the PGA Tour's lone four-event winner this season.
</P>
<P>
   Printed at the top of the cardboard image were the phrases ``If
life were better, I'd be twins'' and ``I want to be like David.''
Funk donned a pair of Oakley shades, the signature piece of Duval's
golfing ensemble because they protect eyes sensitive to sunlight
and allergies. He wrapped his arm around the cardboard Duval and
smiled as fans began chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Duval turned, roared with laughter and urged Funk to keep the
cutout ``in your house, behind the night stand.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Duval drowned a pair of approach shots and
ballooned to a 78, his worst score of the season. Instead of
grousing, he left the course in good spirits and spent several
minutes signing autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the biggest kick out of days like this,'' Duval said.
``I don't enjoy playing bad. But a day like this makes you
appreciate it more when things go well. You need one of these every
once in a while to maintain your perspective.''
DROPPING HIS GUARD
</P>
<P>
   Perspective is something Duval will tell you he has gained since
turning professional in 1993. First, by spending a couple of
humbling seasons on the Nike Tour and later by finding religion
(he's a practicing Christian) and establishing a long-term
relationship with Julie McArthur, his live-in girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Those have been key ingredients, Duval said, in a recent surge
that has seen him win 11 times in his past 38 PGA Tour events after
failing to post a victory in his first 86 career starts. They have
made him more willing to drop his guard, as well as his Oakleys,
and welcome interaction with outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to be to be known as a great player, want to achieve
great things in the game, then I have to be ready for the things
that come with it,'' said Duval, whose 1999 earnings total
($2,861,350) already stands as a single-season tour record. ``Image
is not something terribly important to me, but I must have done
stuff to achieve that \Raloof\S label. It did annoy me. What it
was, I don't know. I don't think it's really fair to draw
conclusions about someone when they're 21 and they haven't matured
into what their personality's going to be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself that way at all. I'm not a reluctant
participant in people getting to know me. I'm eager, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Duval has shown a greater willingness to talk
about his brother's death, his once-strained relationship with his
father and other personal topics since making himself the odds-on
favorite to win player of the year honors by virtue of his
blistering start to the 1999 season. Just don't ask him to try to
connect today's great play with personal tragedies that surfaced 18
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's not relevant to what I'm doing out here. That
seems like a lifetime ago,'' said Duval, who leads the PGA Tour in
five statistical categories, including scoring average (69.01) and
greens in regulation (70.8 percent). ``I think people are well
aware of my brother's death and my parents' divorce. But I can't
grasp how \RBrent's death\S might have affected me. I was too
young.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, said Duval, he is puzzled _ and a bit
uncomfortable _ by the attention his past tribulations have
received since he became the world's top-ranked player after
winning The Players Championship on March 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I don't understand the fascination with me,'' said
Duval, who skipped both the GTE Byron Nelson Classic and the
MasterCard Colonial because he felt ``burned out'' by mounting
demands on his time. ``Other people have been through more. I
wouldn't use the word `trying' to describe my life ... because I
don't want it to sound like I need sympathy. It's not comfortable
stuff to hear about for a lot of people. It's not comfortable for
me to talk about, either. But those are the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like it's a fact that, the longer you live, the more
you're going to run into some people who don't like you. We all
know we can't please everybody. I'm going to step on some toes. Not
intentionally, but I'm sure I will. I've done it before.''
KEEPING A LOW-KEY APPROACH
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent toe belonged to his father, Bob, the man who
chased a distraught David for several blocks through the streets of
Cleveland after he paid a last visit to his dying brother in a
children's hospital on May 17, 1981. Bob Duval said David, because
he had been a marrow donor in an unsuccessful transplant, ``blamed
himself'' for Brent's death and lapsed into a sullen fog that
seemed to lift only when his son retreated to the sanctuary of a
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brent's death triggered a lot of things, none of them good,''
Bob Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   The first was a one-year separation of Duval's parents, shortly
after Brent's death. Although the couple reconciled, they
eventually divorced in 1993. By then, David had pounded enough
practice balls in lieu of an active social life that he'd earned a
spot on the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   He responded to the divorce by avoiding contact with his father,
which Bob Duval considered ``perfectly understandable ... because
no one wants to see their family disrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, their chilly relationship thawed to the point that
David served as his father's caddie during his Senior Tour debut in
1996. In March, when they became the first father-son tandem to win
PGA Tour and Senior Tour events on the same day, both were overcome
with emotion in discussing the significance of their shared feat.
</P>
<P>
   For Bob Duval, it marked his first career victory. For David, it
was his 10th in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Asked who was proudest of the other, David Duval said: ``I think
I would win that award as the most proud. This is a special day.
We've been through a lot together.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, one significant piece of advice has been passed
down from generation to generation in the Duval family: Never fear
failure on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the hardest things to learn out here,'' Duval
said. ``But it's the greatest golf gift I've ever received. Because
of my dad, I learned not to be afraid of shooting low scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval put that into practice Jan. 24, firing a closing round of
59 at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic in which his 11 birdie putts
and one eagle putt traveled a combined 54 feet. Not only did he
pick up a victory and tie the PGA Tour record for lowest round in
history, several peers believe Duval might have turned in the
greatest ball-striking round the game has seen that afternoon in La
Quinta, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. Duval's hot streak, unlike the early surge
by Tiger Woods that triggered ``Tigermania'' in 1997, has been
greeted with open arms by veteran players. Witness the willingness
of Funk, 42, to tease him on the tee box in Houston. Listen to Joey
Sindelar, 41, contrast the hot young player of 1999 with the rising
star of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their personalities are a lot different,'' Sindelar said.
``With David, there's no cockiness. In the past year, Tiger's come
a long way in that department. But in the beginning, he wasn't able
to be one of the guys for a while. David always was. He's had his
struggles, and he's paid his dues. Guys respect that about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players like David's low-key approach to what he does. It took
an eagle putt at the end for him to even pump his fist when he shot
his 59. We all realize he's an awesome player who's having a great
run, and we're happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lickliter, 29, said Duval showed who he really is in
Houston while shooting that 78 _ nine strokes above his season
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never acted frustrated or upset. We spent the whole day
talking about fishing,'' said Lickliter, who shot a 69 as Duval's
playing partner. ``David's so cool. Success hasn't changed him at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has changed the way Lickliter views his former Nike Tour
peer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandkids,'' he said, ``will hear about this round. You can
bank on that.''
RATING HIS SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   Duval, in turn, will bank on a rare blend of power and finesse _
he's the only player ranked among the tour's top 10 in driving
distance (seventh), putting (second) and greens in regulation
(first) _ to continue building the star power that he craves. For
the moment, however, he considers himself unworthy of such acclaim
because he has no major championships on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   Others have compared his recent dominance of the golf world with
the success enjoyed by NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon or retired NBA
legend Michael Jordan. Duval disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's really inappropriate to compare me to Michael
Jordan or Jeff Gordon,'' Duval said. ``I don't think I've done it
long enough. That'd be a disservice to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, Duval envisions a place for himself in such
rarefied company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's most certainly a desire. And I think I've shown that I
might have that potential,'' Duval said. ``But defining a great
golfer is a lot harder now than it was a generation ago. The level
of competition is higher and deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, do you have to win eight majors, like Tom Watson did, to
be one of the great players? Is six enough, like Nick Faldo has?
I'm not sure how much the standard for greatness has changed over
the years. But whatever it is, I'd like to look back when it's over
and think that I got there.''
</P>
<P>
   When the time comes for reflecting, David Duval still figures to
be viewing the world through his wraparound sunglasses. But recent
indications show that he'll take time to drop his guard, as well as
his Oakleys, and sniff the flowers along the way.

PEREZ MIGHT BE PULLED AS STARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ After getting wracked in another start, Los Angeles
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson may be ready to pull lefty Carlos
Perez from the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he'll talk to Perez in the next few days and make a
decision. Perez's next start would be Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never do anything unless I put a lot of thought into it,''
Johnson said. ``I've been thinking about it for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson opts to go with another starter _ perhaps righty
Jamie Arnold _ the breaking point was easily Friday's loss to
Oakland. Perez allowed eight earned runs in 21/3 innings. He's 2-8
with a National League-worst 7.18 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had the utmost confidence in Carlos to start doing the
things to make him successful,'' Johnson said. ``He can't be out
there trying to paint the corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the latest debacle the Dodgers thought Perez was making
progress _ no matter how minute it seemed. However, Johnson said he
didn't see any type of progress against the A's. He also wasn't too
happy about Perez, who signed a three-year, $15.5 million contract
during the offseason, throwing 79 pitches and walking four batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to happen early (in the count),'' Johnson said. ``When
he's right, it doesn't take 130 pitches. It takes 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Catfish honored: Before the game the Athletics held a ceremony
to honor Hall of Famer Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, and to raise money
and bring awareness to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as
Lou Gehrig's disease, from which Hunter is suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Emotion was strong as Hunter told the crowd about a saying he
once had over his locker: Winning isn't everything, but wanting to
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want something bad enough, you have to work for it,''
Hunter said. ``And that's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's presence also triggered emotions for Dodgers hitting
coach Rick Down, who met Hunter during spring training in 1989.
Down was the Yankees' roving hitting instructor and Hunter was a
special instructor at the Yankees' camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year as a Yankee, Dallas Green was the manager and
the whole mystique of the Yankees and the lure, it can really take
you back,'' Down said. ``I didn't know where the ballpark was and I
was in the hotel and Catfish came up to me and offered to take me
to breakfast and he took me to the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have to. It was an awful nice gesture to extend a
hand like that. That's the kind of guy he is. He didn't have to
help me but he did just because he was that kind of guy. He won't
remember it, probably, but I don't forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Dodgers center fielder Devon White returned to the lineup
after missing three games with a groin strain.... Brent Cookson
started in left field and Gary Sheffield was the Dodgers'
designated hitter.... Eric Young and Raul Mondesi each stole a base
off A's starter Kenny Rogers, the second and third stolen bases
he's allowed this season.... Rogers is 4-0 at home this season, has
won 16 straight at Oakland and is 14-0 with a 2.33 ERA here since
joining the A's.... Oakland's top draft pick, USC pitcher Barry
Zito, threw a bullpen session on the side wearing No.43, last worn
by Dennis Eckersley. Zito will report to Single-A Visalia on
Tuesday.

FROM STARS TO STALKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shannon Miller felt sorry for the man who was
stalking her until police showed her a drawing they had discovered
in his apartment. The man had sketched Miller with her head hacked
off.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after her fall from guilelessness, the most
decorated Olympic gymnast in U.S. history is still trying to regain
her emotional equilibrium. On the first anniversary of her
stalker's Feb., 1998 arrest, Miller had a bad dream. Somebody was
watching her, and hard as she tried, she couldn't escape his prying
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   She awoke cold and confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just feel claustrophobic,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   Only since she started sharing her story has Miller come to
appreciate that she wasn't living the nightmare alone. People
approach her all the time, she says, with similar stories. It's
little wonder why. An estimated 1.4 million people are being
stalked in the U.S. In three of four reported cases, the objects of
obsession are women.
</P>
<P>
   An increasing number are athletes.
</P>
<P>
   From Temple University in Philadelphia to UCLA, alarmed college
administrators are forming focus groups to study the hot-button
issue, the way they once did binge drinking and fraternity hazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a phenomenon that across the board has gotten
really scary,'' said Sparks guard Jamila Wideman.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers, daughters, CEOs. Amateurs, collegians, pros. No one is
outside a stalker's range. Miller, the amateur, Wideman, the pro,
and Kyra Elzy, the collegian, found that out the horrible way. They
are part of a sickening sorority. All three have been pinned by
obsessed fans.
</P>
<P>
   Stalkers, 90 percent of whom suffer from mental disorders, take
the natural yearning to connect with another person to perverse
extremes. The more visible female athletes become, the more
vulnerable they are to obsessed fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question female athletes are at a higher risk,'' says
Dr. Park Dietz, a Southern California-based forensic psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   Dietz has been studying stalking behavior for the past 20 years.
What he has found in his cases involving athletes is the high
profiles that launch a thousand press clippings are meat and
potatoes to a person starved to make a connection.
</P>
<P>
   The mundane details of an athlete's life that become a matter of
public record _ her dog's name, her favorite foods, her best
friend, her schedule, for example _ can whet an unstable fan's
appetite for contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal information produced by the press on an athlete
can enhance the illusion of a personal relationship,'' Dietz says.
</P>
<P>
   Female athletes can reinforce the illusion without realizing it.
They are instructed, after all, to play by the Golden Rule. They
know to treat the public well.
</P>
<P>
   There are fans to be cultivated, one hello and handshake at a
time. Sportswomen are constantly reminded they are also saleswomen,
duty-bound to pitch their sport, to dive into crowds and do
backflips for the public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Temple sports psychologist Carole Oglesby says, ``Female
athletes are more likely to extend themselves to fans beyond what
(their male counterparts) normally would. They'll reach out for
approval and a favorable response because they're aware of the fact
public attention generally is lacking and they want to encourage
some type of fan base.''
</P>
<P>
   The public knows it can count on female athletes to be polite.
They're usually much more than that, never comprehending anybody
could mean them harm. Their fans, secure in the knowledge they
won't be rejected, are thus emboldened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general attitude of fans is that we are somehow available
to give ourselves to people,'' said the Sparks' Wideman. ``The
great majority of people are extremely supportive. I'm really glad
people see me as approachable. But it's very unsettling to know
that your accessibility opens you up to the possibility (of being
targeted) by people who don't understand clearly what boundaries
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA has its eyes wide open to the obsessive-fan phenomenon.
League representatives meet with each team and one of the things
they address is the dangers that potentially lurk behind a fan's
smiling face. The league also pays for plainclothes police to
patrol the area around both benches in its arenas on game nights.
</P>
<P>
   Even with precautions in place, an obsessed male fan stalked
Wideman her first two seasons with the Sparks. The deviant behavior
started the usual way, with a game-day encounter. From there it
escalated to phone calls and physical confrontations until Wideman
finally sought and obtained a restraining order against the man
last year.
</P>
<P>
   She is hesitant to divulge any more details because she doesn't
want to imbue her tormentor with more power (through publicity)
than he already has brandished over her. She does say she hasn't
seen him since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a little scary,'' Wideman says.
</P>
<P>
   She believes her background makes her an easier target for
obsessed fans. The daughter of Pulitzer Prize-winning author John
Edgar Wideman, she has been the subject of stories since she made
the varsity team at Amherst (Mass.) High as a seventh-grader. The
1993 season at Amherst _ her senior year _ was chronicled in a
book, ``In These Girls, Hope is a Muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lot of people look for is people who have been
humanized,'' Wideman says. ``From an emotional standpoint, I'm much
more real to people.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The torment of Elzy, a guard on the exalted Tennessee basketball
team, began with a tender note sent in the fall of her freshman
year in Knoxville, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you,'' it read. ``You're my sweet cake. You're the one
for me. I see you on TV and you're pretty as candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elzy, a rising senior, giggled and her roommates laughed along
with her. It didn't seem so funny a few months later when the
letters were arriving daily, filled with marriage proposals and
love songs and a log of her comings and goings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting kind of scared,'' Elzy says. ``But I kept
blowing it off, being the naive person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa man, who was in his late 30s, had been writing her for
more than a year before Elzy mentioned him to anyone on the
Tennessee coaching staff. The man became more bold in early 1998,
showing up at a game at Tennessee and slipping a note to Elzy
through an usher.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was appearing like an apparition at the Vols' road
games. The university responded by placing extra security behind
the bench during home games and assigning someone to walk Elzy to
her car afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The man continued to pester Elzy until he was confronted after a
game by Vols coach Pat Summitt and Elzy's mother Sheryl, who is a
prison guard in Kentucky. Elzy didn't hear from him for three
months. Then one day in May of 1998 she was walking on campus and
there he was, not 50 yards away, waving at her like they were old
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart dropped,'' Elzy says.
</P>
<P>
   When she couldn't ditch him, Elzy contacted an assistant coach
who called police. The man was arrested on campus and hauled into
court on charges of stalking and criminal trespassing. He was
sentenced to two years' probation and ordered not to attend any
more Tennessee basketball games. Elzy hasn't seen him since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously he has some kind of problem,'' she says. ``I was
lucky he was just in love with me and wasn't dangerous.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Miller, too, knows she was fortunate to escape the clutches of
her stalker with no physical scars. The man who would have Miller
running in fear for a couple of years before being convicted last
fall of misdemeanor stalking began his pursuit of the gymnast by
jogging past her family's house.
</P>
<P>
   When he began filling her answering machine with telephone
messages, Miller grew anxious. She went out of her way to spurn his
attentions, which only made the man, who was in his early 20s, more
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   He moved into her apartment complex and enrolled at the
University of Oklahoma, where Miller was a student. Somehow he
wound up in the same meteorology class as Miller. A fitting bit of
irony, that, for he had become the tenebrous cloud in Miller's
otherwise sunny life.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad, Miller says, she saw him out her apartment window
and in her sleep. Miller got ``really worried,'' as she puts it,
yet she told no one outside her family for fear of seeming panicky
and/or paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt embarrassed to go to the police,'' Miller says. ``I
felt sorry for him because it was obvious something wasn't right
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   He proved Miller right about that when, in a fit of jealous
rage, he rear-ended a pickup truck driven by Chris Phillips in
February of last year. Phillips married Miller on Saturday but at
the time they only had just begun dating.
</P>
<P>
   After the accident, investigators combing the man's apartment
found 115 clippings that made mention of Miller and 16 videotapes
of her performances. And of course, the dismembered drawings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw those drawings, it honestly made me sick,'' Miller
says. ``I had to leave the room, I was so ill. You're thinking to
yourself, this can't be happening to me, this isn't real. It's hard
to accept there could be someone out there who wants to hurt you.
It's almost like you try to remain naive about it and hope it just
goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, Elzy and Wideman are wiser _ and warier _ now. When it
comes to protecting themselves against stalkers, they know
vigilance is the better part of valor. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOMEBODY'S WATCHING ME
</P>
<P>
   A list of female athletes who have been hunted like prey by
obsessed fans reads like a Who's Who in the Wide World of Sports.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to gymnast Shannon Miller and basketball players
Jamila Wideman and Kyra Elzy, other stalking victims include tennis
players Monica Seles (the poster girl for fans' crazed behavior)
and Steffi Graf; basketball player/coach/commentator Cheryl Miller;
swimmers Janet Evans and Summer Sanders; golfers Annika Sorenstam
and Laura Davies; volleyball players Gabrielle Reece, Elaine Roque
and Laurie Jones and figure skater Katarina Witt.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations with many of them, familiar refrains rang out.
We've blended their voices into a chorus of Dos and Don'ts to
Safeguard Yourself Against Stalkers:
</P>
<P>
   _Do be vague when it comes to divulging personal information to
people you don't know well.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't, as a rule of thumb, give out your phone number or
address.
</P>
<P>
   _Do filter all requests for contact through a third party (a
coach, a team liaison, a parent, an agent).
</P>
<P>
   _Don't list your telephone number or address in the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   _Do invest in a post office box rather than have correspondence
sent to your home address.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't assume you can reason with a person who is bothering you.
When a stranger is stalking you, in the vast majority of cases it
is someone who suffers from a mental disorder that precludes him or
her from developing normal personal relationships through
conventional and socially acceptable means.
</P>
<P>
   _Do act swiftly to nip unwanted advances, no matter how
seemingly innocent, in the bud. Dispassionately let the person know
at the outset that you have no interest in developing a
relationship with him or her.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't put off contacting law enforcement officials if the
person persists in pestering you. At the very least, you'll
establish a paper trail.

PLESAC ACQUIRED TO FILL BULLPEN HOLE  
 BATISTA, FRASCATORE GO TO TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Diamondbacks have been searching for quite some
time for an experienced pitcher, preferably a left-hander, to add
to their bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   They finally made a deal for one Saturday, acquiring 37-year-old
Dan Plesac, a 13-year veteran with 153 career saves, from the
Toronto Blue Jays for infielder Tony Batista and right-handed
middle reliever John Frascatore.
</P>
<P>
   Plesac is scheduled to join the club today in time for the
finale of a three-game interleague series with the Anaheim Angels.
To fill Batista's spot on the roster, the Diamondbacks called up
infielder Edwin Diaz from their Triple-A Tucson affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: How much does Plesac have left?
</P>
<P>
   He was 0-3 with an 8.34 ERA in 30 games for the Blue Jays. He
had a career-high 78 appearances in 1998, his third season with 70
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter said the team wanted a
second left-hander in the bullpen to supplement Greg Swindell, who
signed as a free agent during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have more flexibility,'' Showalter said. ``If you
brought in Greg in the sixth or seventh innings, you would lose
your match-ups (with left-handed hitters) later. Now we have
another guy. He's good against left-handers, but he can get
right-handers out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Telling Batista and Frascatore) was pretty emotional. They
both did some good things for us, but we feel we got in return a
player who can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Plesac throws a good fastball and change-up. His
best pitch may be his slider. Plesac has given up only nine hits in
44 at-bats (.205) against left-handers this season. He has 778
career appearances, 25th on the all-time list, including 774 in
relief. He began his career with Milwaukee in 1986 and pitched for
the Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh before going to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's another veteran guy who's been in the big leagues for 13
years and been in a lot of pressure situations,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Didier, senior assistant to General Manager Joe Garagiola
Jr., has been following Plesac, as have Ron Hassey, a special
assistant to Garagiola, and scout Ed Durkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given us good reports,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Plesac's arrival also gives Showalter another option in the
closer's spot. Veteran right-hander Gregg Olson had a lock on the
role last season with 30 saves but has struggled this season. He
has eight saves but has blown six other opportunities.
Right-handers Byung-Hyun Kim, Vladimir Nunez and Darren Holmes also
are capable of filling the closer's role.
</P>
<P>
   Plesac will make $1.5 million this season, and the team will
have an option for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Frascatore, acquired from St. Louis for right-hander Clint
Sodowsky on March 30, was disappointed that he had been dealt a
second time. He was second on the club in appearances (26 to
Swindell's 27), with a 1-4 record and 4.09 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to leave a good team and a good bunch of guys. There's
a lot of uncertainty, especially going up into Canada,'' he said.
``I felt I did a good job. I knew they (Diamondbacks) were trying
to do something, but I didn't think I would be involved. I
understand what they're trying to do. I've been on teams with only
one lefty in the bullpen, and it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter hedged on saying it, but Batista's departure means
that Andy Fox will be the starter at shortstop most of the time.
Batista began the season as the starter but struggled, and the two
had been in a platoon situation, the right-handed-hitting Batista
against left-handed pitchers and the left-handed-hitting Fox
against right-handers. Hanley Frias, a switch-hitter, started
Saturday night against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has 73 career games at shortstop, 23 for the Diamondbacks
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big surprise. I didn't see this coming at all,''
Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fox didn't play shortstop last season after being
acquired in a spring trade with the New York Yankees, he did start
in 122 games at six positions. He hit .277 with nine homers and 44
RBIs in 502 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that many at-bats, I think I showed that I'm capable of
playing every day,'' Fox said. ``But I just go out and play. I
never think about, `Hey, I'm the guy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain how long Diaz will be with the big club. Danny
Klassen, the organization's top middle-infield prospect, could be
called up soon, perhaps by next weekend's home series against the
Atlanta Braves. Klassen has had a sore left knee and recently had a
magnetic resonance imaging test as a precaution, but his status
does not appear to be in jeopardy. He was with the big club for a
month in 1998, playing in 29 games and starting 28 at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Batista was taken from the Oakland Athletics in the expansion
draft and played mostly at second base in 1998, hitting 18 home
runs. He moved to shortstop this season and veteran Jay Bell moved
to second. Batista started 38 games at short and hit .257 with five
homers and 21 RBIs. He is expected to give Toronto Manager Jim
Fregosi a boost at shortstop because Alex Gonzalez is out because
of an injury. &QL;

YANKEES BEAT MARLINS, 5-4  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1995 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Roger Clemens is the only five-time winner of the Cy
Young Award, but he is not a Cy Young Award candidate this year. So
far, he has been less than overwhelming and has been forced to
navigate through games with his experience, like a pilot working
without a computer or compass.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens struggled against the Florida Marlins Saturday night,
allowing seven hits, five walks and four runs in six innings, but
that was good enough, in the Yankees' 5-4 victory. Bernie Williams,
Paul O'Neill and Scott Brosius all hit home runs, as the Yankees
(35-24) won for the third straight game and moved one and a half
games ahead of Boston in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and Manager Joe Torre were ejected by the first-base
umpire, Brian Gibbons, in the eighth inning, after O'Neill was
called out on a pickoff play at first base. After being called out
_ the replay would indicate that Gibbons's call was incorrect _
O'Neill turned in disgust, pulled off his helmet and bounced it off
the ground. Gibbons immediately ejected O'Neill, spurring Torre
from his dugout seat, and after Torre informed Gibbons what he
thought of his umpiring and his call, Torre was tossed, for the
first time in the 23 games he has managed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens practices self-analysis more than anyone other than
Woody Allen, and in spring training, Clemens mentioned how
important it is for him to command his adrenaline early in the
game; even after his first exhibition appearance for the Yankees,
he talked about this.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been games when Clemens has seemed unable to rein
in his emotions, Saturday night's game being only the latest
example. In his 10 starts, he has allowed 18 runs in innings 1 and
2, for an earned run average of 8.10; after the first two innings,
his e.r.a. is 3.63.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams bombed a two-run homer in the Yankees' first
inning, the Marlins quickly jumped on Clemens: Alex Gonzalez dumped
a double down the right-field line, Cliff Floyd singled, Bruce Aven
swung at a pitch on three balls and no strikes and bounced a single
through the right side of the infield. After Tim Hyers fell behind
no balls and two strikes, he pulled a hit to the right side. When
Preston Wilson grounded into a fielder's choice, Aven scored to
move the Marlins ahead, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is throwing hard, his fastball consistently clocking
anywhere from 92 to 95 miles an hour. But Saturday night, he had
trouble developing a secondary pitch with which to finish off the
Marlins' hitters after getting ahead in the count _ a splitter in
the dirt, a slider or a curveball.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens often seemed to battle the Marlins with only his
fastball, and as the conventional wisdom goes, major league hitters
will eventually hurt you if you throw only fastballs, no matter how
hard you throw. Clemens reached two-strike counts on 11 occasions
in the first five innings, and 7 of those 11 batters reached base
with a hit or a walk.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees resorted to the long ball to regain the lead
against Livan Hernandez, who constantly placed himself in
compromising situations: He threw a ball on the first pitch to 14
of the first 24 batters he faced, and in one stretch of 10 batters,
he threw at least four pitches to each hitter.
</P>
<P>
   And Hernandez's breaking ball was not fine. He tried to spin a
slider to Paul O'Neill leading off the fourth, and O'Neill waited
and waited for it and stretched his body and swung, his back foot
lifting off the ground just after contact. For some hitters, the
imbalance would mean a groundout to second, but O'Neill blasted a
tremendous home run to right-center field, tying the score, 3-3.
O'Neill has seven home runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Three batters later, Hernandez hung a slider to Brosius, the
pitch heart-high, and Brosius crushed it, far and long and high
over the left-field wall; Yankees 4, Marlins 3.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the theme, Kevin Orie led off the bottom of the
same inning for Florida by bashing Clemens's first pitch _ a
split-fingered fastball that didn't drop _ for a game-tying home
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees moved ahead once more in the fifth inning. Chuck
Knoblauch worked a walk and when Derek Jeter singled to right,
Knoblauch sped around second and pulled into third. The Marlins'
infield played back, rather than moving in and trying to cut off
the run at the plate, and when Williams grounded to second base and
the Marlins tried unsuccessfully to turn a double play, Knoblauch
crossed the plate to push the Yankees ahead, 5-4.

AUCTIONING OFF THE TREASURES OF RALPH KRAMDEN AND SCARLETT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What price memory? How much of today's cash does it
take to own a vestige of yesterday's passion?
</P>
<P>
   For someone else's Oscar, Michael Jackson paid $1,542,500 at
Sotheby's Saturday. The singer's winning bid, for the gold-plated
Best Picture statuette awarded in 1939 to the producer David O.
Selznick for ``Gone with the Wind,'' dwarfed the previous Oscar
auction record of $607,500 paid in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson, whose own doo-dads have occassionally gone on the
auction block and who has been known to bid on such esoteric items
as an obscure Sinclair Lewis novel, was not alone in taking
nostalgia to inflationary heights.
</P>
<P>
   For a slate blue wool jacket and matching pants worn about 45
years ago by the overweight (49 1/2-inch waist, 49 3/4-inch chest)
Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden, aka Jackie Gleason, an
unidentified but obviously devoted fan of the ``The Honeymooners''
television shows paid $64,100.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, as he banged his gavel, the Sotheby's auctioneer
murmured, ``How sweet it is!''
</P>
<P>
   For a pink percale dress with ruffled sleeves and lace collar
worn by Vivien Leigh as Atlanta burned in ``Gone with the Wind,'' a
darkly beautiful Brazilian woman in a black fishnet veil and prim
black gloves paid $90,500.
</P>
<P>
   She would identify herself only as Elizabeth, the proud owner of
trunkloads of Ms. Leigh's hats and clothing and a Sao Paolo
restaurant named, not surprisingly, ``Scarlett's.''
</P>
<P>
   Deepening the mystery with hyperbole, her 11-year-old son,
Rodrigo, said his mother is famous back home not only for greeting
her customers in full Southern Belle gloved-and-petticoated
regalia, but for having seen ``Gone with the Wind'' upwards of
8,000 times since her first fateful encounter with the movie 31
years ago, as an impressionable 8-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, although perhaps on a slightly different scale, a
Manhattan psychologist recaptured a bit of his childhood for
$1,035, buying a wooden mural of a clown and a dashing bejeweled
couple riding a carpet through the clouds that once adorned the
Magic Carpet ride at Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more thrilling than any rollercoaster,'' said Barry S.
Lubetkin, recalling how the whole chair of the ride collapsed and
left its screeching occupant involuntarily recumbent. ``It's one of
my strongest memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubetkin, now 55, said he intends to hang his newly acquired
amusement park memorabilia above the couch in his office. ``I'm a
shrink,'' he joked. ``I use magic carpets in therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces of Coney Island rides and attractions also were
sold at prices ranging up to a high of $10,350, for the garish
7-foot-tall bubble-blowing clown face that used to delight children
at the Brooklyn park. But perhaps Coney Island's most famous lady,
the mechanical Fat Lady called Minnie Ha Ha, did not draw a bid
high enough to be sold.
</P>
<P>
   Its owner, Leonard Goodstein, said he would put it on display at
the Brooklyn Historical Society museum. ``It's time,'' he said,
``to let my childhood go.''
</P>
<P>
   The price paid for Selznick's Oscar was vastly higher than the
$200,000 to $300,000 estimate made by Sotheby's in advance of the
auction, which also sold the final shooting script belonging to the
producer's script assistant on ``Gone With the Wind'' for $33,350.
</P>
<P>
   Cinema flotsam, especially from the classics, has fetched
increasingly high prices over the past decade, but the interests
and passion of film buffs and collectors can be wildly
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Gable's leather-bound script from ``Gone With the Wind''
brought $77,000 in 1994. But in 1996, the director, Steven
Spielberg, bought Gable's Oscar for his role as a reporter in ``It
Happened One Night'' for $607,500 and then presented it as a gift
to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Television and rock aficianados, at least those at Sotheby's
Saturday, do not appear to have the same deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of John Lennon's wire-rimmed prescription glasses sold
for $25,875 and a copy of ``Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band''
signed by all four Beatles brought $57,500.
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen suite _ a battered table and chairs, a dresser and
icebox _ from ``The Honeymooners'' show during the 1960s, when
Gleason and friends filmed it in Miami, was bought for $63,000 by
the TV Land cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Larry W. Jones, the general manager, said he plans to take the
furniture from Ralph Kramden's fictional cold-water flat on the
road to promote his company's airing of reruns from the show,
starting in January.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's officials said they could not identify the buyer of
the oversized blue bus driver's outfit worn, around the mid-1950s,
by Gleason. The bid was received by telephone. But Peter Crescenti,
one of the two remaining members of RALPH, the Royal Association
for the Longevity and Preservation of the Honeymooners, said the
outfit is one of very very many produced over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gleason was notorious for having his weight go up and down,''
said Crescenti, who put the Gleason memorabilia up for sale. ``So
there were a lot on hand.'' The one sold was from one of the star's
heavier periods.

requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and

criticism from publishing houses.)

KIM, BELLE, PERDUE: IT'S ALL SO GREASY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith has taken a little break
from a drawn-out coaching search and was rumored to be spending a
little time in San Diego, where, apparently, he is interviewing
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Let me get this straight: Sammy Sosa takes a bow and triggers
beanball warfare. Byung-Hyun Kim takes a bow and is hailed for good
manners.
</P>
<P>
   If Kim is found guilty of cheating, the question is this: Did an
unassuming kid bring these habits to America? Or did he learn such
trickery inside the locker room at BOB? And if that's the case,
someone pass the petroleum jelly to Gregg Olson.
</P>
<P>
   If hitting a baseball is really the toughest thing in sports,
isn't it odd that pitchers feel the need to doctor baseballs, scuff
baseballs and throw them at a hitter's head?
</P>
<P>
   The Suns held a workout Saturday for Israeli star Oded Katash, a
small kid with a great shot who might be playing for the Knicks if
not for the NBA lockout. In fact, Israeli newspapers say that Tom
Chambers wants Katash in a Suns uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Before you laugh at the notion of Albert Belle giving financial
advice on his Web site, understand that he makes $19,000 every trip
to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Proof that arrogance has not died at Bank One Ballpark:
</P>
<P>
   ``My chest swells out every time I see Jay Bell and Matt
Williams and Luis Gonzalez and Steve Finley _ and I could go on and
on _ run around the bases after a home run,'' Diamondbacks Manager
Buck Showalter said. ``It's not a look-at-me mentality. We have so
many guys here whose substance is their style instead of their
style being their substance. I know things have changed in our
society, but a lot of guys here are easy to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, air sickness bags are located underneath your tray
tables.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with San Antonio in the NBA Finals, except for the
prospect of Will Perdue winning his fourth championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Presidents Cup: Aside from offering what could be the
most entertaining NHL finale in years, Dallas and Buffalo are two
cities where a U.S. president was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing against David Duval, but suffering second-degree burns
while lifting a teapot is merely the perfect metaphor ever for a
country club sport.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Marcus Camby is no longer tagged as Marcus Gumby (or
Cotton Camby), now that the eighth-seeded Knicks are headed to the
Finals, Ernie Grunfeld should be General Manager of the Year. And
the first to be fired during midseason.
</P>
<P>
   Good-natured jab delivered at Diamondbacks pitcher Brian
Anderson following a short stint against the Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian, I hate to tell you this, but you're not going to win
the ERA title this year,'' Andy Benes said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Jeff Van Gundy has reached the Finals and is guaranteed
$3.3 million next season, could he do us a favor and buy himself
some sleep?
</P>
<P>
   The lollipop kids: Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller got married on
Saturday and stood exactly one inch taller than her five-foot-high,
butter-cream wedding cake.
</P>
<P>
   Good stuff: After a diet of tutoring sessions and night classes,
ASU basketball recruit Donnell Knight posted the highest SAT score
of any Sun Devils hoopster in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is floating the notion of ineligibility for freshmen in
basketball, an asinine concept that would only encourage high
school kids to opt for the NBA. So how about this: Have the NBA
fund a developmental league and any kid who goes to college can't
be drafted for three years. And don't tell me it would open a
floodgate of lawsuits. It works in baseball, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Chicago Tribune'' reported that the Blackhawks, through
tamperproof channels, have contacted Jeremy Roenick and asked how
he'd feel about a return to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly what Roenick had in mind when he decided to play
Game 7 with a broken jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tocchet, on marital bliss: ``My wife wants me to play
another five years, minimum. And when I look at my American Express
bill, I know why.'' &QL;

   &UR; DREAMLAND: TRAVELS INSIDE THE SECRET WORLD OF ROSWELL AND AREA
51 &LR;  By Phil Patton. Villard, $12.95. This offbeat history explores
the once top-secret military base in Nevada where experimental
aircraft were tested, and the flying-saucer subculture and
conspiracy theories that have flourished around it. The author ``is
keenly interested in the origins of UFO lore and in all things
aeronautical,'' Glyn Vincent wrote in The New York Times Book
Review in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE NEWTON LETTER &LR;  By John Banville. Godine, $10.95. After
renting a cottage in rural Ireland to work on a biography of Isaac
Newton, a historian becomes obsessed with an eccentric family whose
members echo characters from an 1809 Goethe novel. In 1987 the
reviewer Molly Hite called this a ``powerful novella'' with much to
say about literary history and the history of science.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued another novel by Banville,
 &UR; MEFISTO &LR;  ($13.95), a modern version of the Faust legend in which a
math prodigy is seduced by a trio that includes a portly engineer,
a deaf woman and a winking master of ceremonies named Felix.
```Mefisto' is a novel of virtuosic scope, written in a style as
pristine as the rarefied mountain air atop the Brocken, the
witches' gathering place on Walpurgisnacht,'' Amy Boaz wrote in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KOSOVO: A SHORT HISTORY &LR;  By Noel Malcolm. Harper Perennial,
$16. This carefully researched account by a British journalist,
published last year before the conflict in Kosovo but updated with
a new preface, reveals how much history matters in the Balkans and
how much of today's strife is linked to a mythologized past. The
result is a ``painfully useful ... well-written, readable book,''
the reviewer Anna Husarska wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST RESORT &LR;  By Alison Lurie. Owl/Holt, $13. This
bittersweet story features men and women who move to Key West for
desperate, misguided and even sensible reasons and find themselves
baking in the hothouse at the nation's southern tip. ``The novel
and its readers ... have great fun with what these people expect
from their southward migration, and what they wind up getting,''
Francine Prose wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FAMILY MAN &LR;  By Calvin Trillin. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $11.
The curmudgeonly author turns to family life _ his own _ in this
collection of low-key humorous essays devoted to his domestic
adventures with his wife and two daughters. ``It's hard to think of
another writer who so consistently manages to be acerbic without
being mean, a literary Houdini act that has won Trillin legions of
readers,'' Suzanne Berne wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; WANTING A CHILD &LR; , edited by
Jill Bialosky and Helen Schulman ($13), in which 22 writers recount
their difficult, often painful struggles to conceive or adopt
children. ``Each story in this moving anthology reiterates the
universal need to be a parent,'' Leslie Chess Feller wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAVEDWELLER &LR;  By Dorothy Allison. Plume, $13.95. In the second
novel by the author of ``Bastard Out of Carolina,'' a rock 'n' roll
singer returns to her roots in rural Georgia and the two daughters
she abandoned when she fled her first marriage. This ``unabashedly
emotional'' story ``pays close attention to the way women get by,
the way they come to forgive one another, the way they choose who
they will be,'' Valerie Sayers wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOLIBO MAGNIFICENT &LR;  By Patrick Chamoiseau. Vintage
International, $12. This novel, originally published in French in
1988, revolves around a storyteller whose death from strangulation
by words is emblematic of the destruction of Creole in the French
Caribbean and the author's attempt to supplant it with a home-grown
hybrid of his own. The book ``wonderfully illustrates the moment
when oral literature reluctantly leaves the stage clear for the
written word,'' Caryl Phillips wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITIZEN LORD: THE LIFE OF EDWARD FITZGERALD, IRISH
REVOLUTIONARY &LR;  By Stella Tillyard. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $15.
Lord Edward Fitzgerald was a handsome, high-spirited aristocrat who
abandoned a promising career in the British army and wound up
taking part in the 1798 Irish rebellion. Last year the reviewer
Thomas Flanagan called this a persuasive portrait of ``a committed
revolutionary, more radical in his politics than the other Irish
leaders, more resolute and reckless in action.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IRISH REBEL: JOHN DEVOY AND AMERICA'S FIGHT FOR IRELAND'S
FREEDOM &LR; , by Terry Golway (St. Martin's Griffin, $15.95),
chronicles the life and times of an ardent nationalist who fled his
country in 1871 and spent the next 57 years trying to raise
American support for Irish independence. ``Golway ... has produced
a well-researched biography of a man whose life has hitherto been
given too little attention,'' the reviewer David Murray wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIKE A HOLE IN THE HEAD &LR;  By Jen Banbury. Mysterious
Press/Warner, $12. The heroine of this raucous first novel, who
spends much of her time tossing wisecracks at crazed hoodlums as
she hunts down a missing book in Los Angeles, ``is just as
hard-boiled as ... Sam Spade, and she's a lot funnier,'' Brian
Morton wrote in 1998.

IF JACKSON'S IN, COUNT ON HARPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Playing 58 games in 108 days took a toll on Derek
Harper's 37-year-old body. The bitterness of a playoff sweep took
its toll on his resolve, and it all left the Los Angeles Lakers
veteran considering retirement when the season came to a crashing
halt last month.
</P>
<P>
   But it took just two words to get Harper jazzed for a 17th NBA
season.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from his home in Dallas on Saturday, Harper
enthusiastically became the first Lakers player to publicly endorse
Jackson, who is close to signing a deal to become coach. An
announcement could come in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a dream come true for the Lakers to get Phil
Jackson. I would come back in a heartbeat if Phil Jackson is
coach,'' said Harper, who has one year left on his contract. ``I
would cherish the opportunity just to be around a guy like that.
I've played for a lot of great coaches, from Pat Riley (in New
York) to Dick Motta (Dallas) to Chuck Daly (Orlando). Adding him to
my portfolio, so to speak, would do nothing but help my career, at
the end of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   And might help Harper win the elusive NBA championship ring he's
coveted since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson won six rings as head coach of the Chicago Bulls, and
while Michael Jordan deservedly gets much of the credit, Jackson
played a vital role, Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, Phil Jackson orchestrated a lot of Chicago's
success,'' he said. ``The guy's a winner, he's a proven winner. He
was on a championship team in New York (as a player in 1972-73),
and he's just a respected person, a respected coach, a coach that
obviously is a no-nonsense coach....
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to some of the Chicago players. He's a good guy,
but he also finds a way to motivate players and hold them
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, Harper said, might be what the young Lakers _ built
around 27-year-old Shaquille O'Neal and 20-year-old Kobe Bryant _
need most. Harper didn't say it, but the Lakers' problems might
have been too much for rookie coach Kurt Rambis to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kurt did as good as he could being in a new
situation,'' Harper said. ``Phil's experience would definitely help
our young team.... Phil adds a lot of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   And Jackson's presence might help distill the locker-room
chemistry problems that plagued the Lakers this season. Competing
egos and agendas contributed to a subpar season for the
star-studded roster.
</P>
<P>
   But in guiding the Bulls to six championships in eight years,
Jackson managed to corral the Goliath egos of Michael Jordan and
Scottie Pippen and the unpredictability of Dennis Rodman while
maximizing role players like Steve Kerr and John Paxson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Chicago's situation, Dennis (Rodman) was
there, and they had a lot of different personalities there, too,''
Harper said. ``Phil, he's as good as anybody at getting it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper spent much of his first season with the Lakers preaching
sacrifice and teamwork, but those messages only occasionally got
through. So the Lakers found themselves watching the conference
finals on TV, while teams with less talent but more selfless play
and willing role players competed for bids to the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy like Phil would definitely be able to get guys to play
those roles,'' Harper said. ``Take a guy like Ron Harper (no
relation), who was an All-Star once or twice in his career and a
big-time scorer (with Cleveland and the Clippers). (Jackson) got
him to play a defensive role. That's what it's all about, man. It's
about accepting a role and being committed and willing to
sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers, Jackson would have to find a way to mesh the
talents of O'Neal, Bryant and Glen Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel in my heart that all three of those guys can play
on the same court, but it's gonna take sacrifices for the good of
the team,'' Harper said. ``You look at (Robert) Horry, (Rick) Fox,
(Derek) Fisher, all of our little guys are willing to sacrifice.
Without a doubt, Shaq, Kobe, Glen _ our stars _ they're gonna have
to sacrifice too.''

SWANN STAYING MUM ABOUT KNEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - One can envision Eric Swann firing out of his
three-point stance, striking with his trademark fierce charge, and
taking down all his frustration in a big bear-hug tackle 6 yards
behind the line. If he were right.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, perhaps as early as September, Swann might once again
be able to do that to an opposing quarterback. Returning to the
dominating level of play that caused him to be regarded as one of
the premier defensive left tackles in the business would soothe the
riled waters of his mind, one would suspect.
</P>
<P>
   For now, one can only suspect because Swann continues under a
shroud of secrecy his rehabilitation on his arthritic right knee on
which two more surgeries were performed in the closing 10 weeks of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Where he is in the process and how he feels about the public
reaction to his decision to have the second surgical procedure at
the height of the Cardinals' playoff run remain his private domain.
</P>
<P>
   Swann is not talking. His latest surgeon, Dr. Richard Steadman,
is not talking. Until Friday, after the latest bizarre rumor
regarding Swann had taken on a life of its own, Swann's agent,
Steve Zucker, was not talking. Earl Edwards, the Cardinals player
programs coordinator, who has served as a mentor to Swann, did not
return phone calls Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His coaches say that Swann, who can disrupt an opposing blocking
scheme as few others in the game can, is on schedule. They say they
base that on reports relayed to them from team medical personnel,
who in turn are getting information from Swann's caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   Swann did not get results that satisfied him from a procedure
performed by team medical personnel last Oct. 28. Swann, who at 28
has had four surgeries on his right knee and two on his left,
sought outside advice. He turned to Steadman of Vail, Colo.,
orthopedic surgeon of the U.S. Olympic Ski team. Steadman convinced
Swann to have a microfracture performed on Dec. 7. It would end
Swann's season but perhaps prolong his career.
</P>
<P>
   That subjected Swann to widespread criticism from inside and
outside the organization, to which he did not take kindly, hence
the information vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a player's perspective, regardless of what amount of
money you've been paid, you're still human and you still have
feelings,'' said Joe Greene, the Cardinals defensive line coach and
a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. ``And when you put
yourself on the line game in and game out, and then you're being
questioned about your manhood and your toughness from someone
that's never walked the walk, if he gives a damn what people say,
then it bothers him. Some of us understand that we can't change how
people think, and don't try.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding more mystique to Swann's situation are reports such as
this innocuous one in a Valley newspaper last week that Swann ``had
an unspecified internal procedure done recently, possibly for
stomach-related problems.'' From that grew reports on Internet
sites that Swann faced life-threatening or career-ending surgery.
That only fueled further speculation on talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that Swann won't talk?
</P>
<P>
   But Zucker finally did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where these rumors get started,'' Zucker said
Friday, ``but it's absolutely not true.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is almost certain to further enrage a private man who now
might have more reason than ever to feel burned by fans, the media,
and perhaps even the Cardinals, who did not hide their displeasure
with Swann's decision to step outside their medical network. Club
officials were incensed when Swann informed them Thanksgiving
morning that he was going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches are hopeful that Swann comes back and takes it out
on a schedule of opponents that is among the toughest they ever
have faced, as they hope for a return trip to the playoffs, where
they won a game for the first time in 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't talked to him in a while but the report I get
through our medical people is he's on time and on line to return
once the season starts, that's all I know,'' said defensive
coordinator Dave McGinnis. ``Mentally, he feels like he really
missed out on something last year, the special feelings. He was
here every day and in meetings but he wasn't on the field. He
missed out on a big happening that went on here. He knows this
football team is on the upswing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the first couple of days in minicamp (in May) we had
to take him out and slow him down because we knew this was not what
he was supposed to be doing. He's wanting to get out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann refused interview requests during minicamp last month.
</P>
<P>
   He recently flew to Pennsylvania to take part in a golf outing
organized by center Mike Devlin to raise money in the name of
Devlin's late father for a scholarship. Cardinals players who were
there said Swann looked great and seemed fine. Swann played in the
group that finished third.
</P>
<P>
   One who has been unwavering in support of Swann is Greene, who
knows what an arthritic knee feels like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had mine for 25 years,'' Greene said. ``Arthritis does
hurt and there's no way you can get rid of that, and that's the
line that he's been given. But he thought it was something more
than arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how Eric felt, or what made other people say what
they said. But having walked in Eric's shoes before, the most
important thing a guy thinks about is taking care of his team and
his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   His health comes somewhere second or third. Eric felt that he
wasn't holding up his end of the bargain based on the way things
were going. He got an opportunity, a small opportunity, to improve
it, and he took it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals wanted to hustle Swann back into action six weeks
after his first surgery. They saw a chance to have a winning record
and get to the playoffs, goals they ultimately would accomplish
anyway without Swann.
</P>
<P>
   Swann continued to complain of pain four weeks into the first
rehab. Steadman convinced Swann that without Steadman's
microfracture procedure, Swann risked seriously injuring the knee
if he came back.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Swann's teammates were irked that he would elect to have
the season-ending procedure. With Swann, the Cardinals were among
the best in the league at stopping the run. Without him, they
quickly plummeted to the lower echelon. In seven games, Swann made
33 tackles, four sacks, had seven quarterback hurries, five tackles
for loss, four pass deflections, and two forced fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers attest to Swann being among the premier defensive
tackles, something the Cardinals also believed when they rewarded
him with a five-year, $25 million contract before the 1998 season.
It included what then was a team-record $7.5 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Five games into the season, Swann felt his knee flaring up. He
played two more games, practicing very little during the weeks
leading up to them, hoping to coax enough out of the knee to get
him through the season. He agreed to the October surgery by Russell
Chick, team orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult thing having gone out and set a standard
for yourself like Eric had, being a dominating player, then not
being able to deliver on that game in and game out,'' Greene said.
``Not only is it physically draining but it's mentally draining.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis is damage to surface cartilage that covers the bone at
a joint. It starts as a softening of firm cartilage, then becomes
rough and fissured, then eventually disappearing so the underlying
bone is exposed. If there is lost meniscal pad, it can lead to an
aggressive form of arthritis at a relatively young age. It is not
uncommon among linemen who are carrying a lot of weight. Swann (6
feet 5, 315 pounds), who had meniscus cartilage removed from the
right knee in 1995, is an example.
</P>
<P>
   Swann couldn't get into a football stance or push off on his
right leg when Steadman examined him just over a month after the
surgery by Chick. Swann agreed to let Steadman do it again his way,
refusing requests by the team to get an outside third opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The Steadman procedure ended Swann's season. That set off the
old-timers and the self-proclaimed experts harkening to players
from an era in which if they could walk he could play.
</P>
<P>
   Swann was on crutches for more than two months after Steadman's
procedure, which involves drilling a series of holes around the
joint causing a cartilage cap to be recreated. The initial
prognosis was for a six- or seven-month rehab. He was doing
minicamp walkthroughs at six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Eric understands that it's always going to be painful,
that arthritis is that way,'' Greene said. ``But he didn't think
this particular thing was just arthritis. That's what he told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hope he's ready for the opener. . . . Eric is a force
in there. He is powerful. He does things you don't coach. When he's
right nobody can handle him. That's what we want.'' &QL;

4-TIME OPEN BRIDESMAID  
 LEHMAN AIMS TO END NEAR-MISSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say that nothing is fair at a U.S. Open. The rough is too
deep, the fairways too tight, the greens like lightning and the
pins untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   Patience seems to be the prevailing virtue, because the U.S.
Open reserves the right to be fickle.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman knows how it goes only too well. For the past four
national championships, the Scottsdale pro has been paired in the
final group on Sunday, a distinction he shares with the legendary
Bobby Jones (1927-30). But unlike ``The Greatest,'' who captured
four Opens and was the runner-up in four others, Lehman has yet to
solve this intricate equation for victory in the U.S. Golf
Association's most prestigious event.
</P>
<P>
   Two opportunities were especially painful:
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, at Oakland Hills in Michigan, Lehman was tied with
Steve Jones as they walked to the final tee. Jones selected a
3-wood, while Lehman opted to go with a driver. It was a costly
mistake, as Lehman's ball raced through the fairway and
parallel-parked against the lip of a bunker. The resulting bogey
left him in a tie for second place, as Jones went on to make par
and win by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, at Congressional Country Club outside of Washington,
Lehman was chasing Ernie Els down the stretch when he tried to go
for the pin at No. 17 with a 7-iron. The shot was pulled slightly,
and the ball took one hop and disappeared in the water, dunking
Lehman into third place behind Els and runner-up Colin Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman also had near-misses in the '95 Open at Shinnecock
(N.Y.), and last year at the Olympic Club near San Francisco. Both
times he was paired with the leader before ending up tied for third
and tied for fifth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Lehman's failures are grounded in reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, I beat myself by being too aggressive,
trying to make too much happen, which led to bogeys,'' explained
Lehman, 40, whose only major in his four career victories was the
1996 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I wouldn't trade the experience for
anything. It was very enjoyable being part of the drama in an Open.
I think you have to look at the bright side, pat yourself on the
back and learn from your mistakes. Those near-misses hurt, but I'm
looking forward to the future.'' &QL; 
Late start &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lehman only hopes he can be in the final twosome at Pinehurst
No. 2 when the 99th U.S. Open unfolds Thursday through Sunday in
the big pines of North Carolina's most storied golf community. He
certainly will be among the favorites, based on his track record
and his improved play as the 1999 season wears on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, things are beginning to come around,'' Lehman said
Friday just before a flu bug attacked him midway through the second
round of the FedEx/St. Jude Classic in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a grind, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder took longer (to rehabilitate) than I expected,''
Lehman said of an injury that dates to last year's British Open.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lehman did not start his '99 campaign until late
February. In 10 tournaments, his best finishes are a runner-up in
the Bay Hill Invitational and a fifth place at Greater Greensboro.
His 70.36 scoring average ranks him 25th among his peers. He enters
today's final round of the St. Jude Classic in a four-way tie for
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the U.S. Open hardly equates with play on the PGA
Tour. For whatever reason, guys like Lehman tend to take it up a
notch in the major championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the reasons I play better in the Open is that
par is a good score, and I seem to make a lot of them,'' he said.
``Plus, I usually have had at least one great round during the
tournament, where I've lapped the field. A great score goes a long
way in an Open.''
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance reveals that Lehman has six scores in the 60s
during the past four Opens. By comparison, Tiger Woods and David
Duval each have two sub-70 scores during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman also has another key ingredient to his game that bodes
well for Open-style courses. Even though his percentage is off
slightly this year (64.1 percent), he has been a virtual machine
when it comes to hitting greens in regulation, finishing ninth in
that tour category in 1995, fourth in '96, first in '97 and second
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman also cites his low-key demeanor for helping him rise
above the madness of an Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played under a lot of heat in Ryder Cups, Presidents
Cups, as well as the U.S. and British opens,'' he said. ``I've got
that ability to be calm when I get there.'' &QL; 
No changes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is no reason to think he won't do more of the
same this week. Pinehurst No. 2, despite new and slicker greens, is
a venue that matches up well with his game. He even has some
insider's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the 1992 Tour Championship held at Pinehurst, I learned the
better I played, the worse I scored, mostly because the better my
game got, the more I attacked the pins,'' he said. ``During the
first two rounds, I just hit it to the middle of the green and made
pars.''
</P>
<P>
   A strategy, Lehman said, he'll stick with this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I have to do,'' he said, noting there is a sense
of urgency to winning the Open, given his advancing age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the one tournament I want to win more than any other. The
British Open was great, but this is our national championship.'' &QL;

BETTMAN CONFIRMS TEAMS LOSING MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During his annual state-of-the-league meeting last week in
Dallas, NHL Commissioner  &UR; Gary Bettman would neither confirm nor
deny reports by Boston Bruins President and General Manager  &UR; Harry
Sinden that at least 20 of the league's 27 teams lost money this
past season. Or that 70 percent of NHL revenues are going directly
to pay player salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sinden) is dead right,'' one NHL owner said. ``Actually, I'd
find it hard to believe if any more than three teams are making
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the actual numbers are, Bettman does admit there is a
problem in the NHL and that the league will address it. At the same
time, however, he also calls it nothing more than a ``four- to
five-year phenomenon'' that will begin to correct itself on its
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make it a practice not to get too specific in the numbers,''
said Bettman, who does just that in most meetings with the media,
constantly rattling off stats and trends like a math wizard.
``Suffice is to say, the percentage is higher than it should be and
more teams are losing money than they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I am not going to indulge in a public debate as to what
the percentages are. We have too many clubs losing money and we are
paying too much out on the expense side, and that is something we
are going to do something about.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution?
</P>
<P>
   Two words: Salary cap. The NHL's collective bargaining agreement
doesn't expire until 2004, and rest assured, a set salary ceiling
will be the major item on the owner's agenda when negotiations
commence. The Players Association will never go for it, of course,
but it might be the only way to save the sport as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   There are concerns that some teams might try to fight escalating
salaries by refusing to re-sign free agents or low-ball them on
offers and perhaps stay away from the unrestricted free-agent
market altogether. Though unlikely, that's a dangerous step that is
spelled C-O-L-L-U-S-I-O-N, and that's worse than 20-something clubs
operating in the red. &QL; 
Keen on Mike &QL; 
 &UR; Mike Keenan, the vagabond former NHL head coach and general
manager, hasn't been up for any job openings since being canned at
the All-Star break by the Vancouver Canucks. Not that he's worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be back,'' Keenan said Saturday. ``I don't have any
doubts about that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   It will have to be the right situation, of course. Some believe
only an established, self-confident GM would take a chance on
``Iron Mike,'' who also has made stops in Philadelphia, Chicago,
New York and St. Louis. And if Keenan were to somehow return to an
NHL front office, the head coach would have to be strong yet
willing to let Keenan run most of the controls.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan, never contacted about the Coyotes' head coaching job,
was asked what he'd tell all the critics who continue to say he's
done and won't coach again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell them they'd be wrong,'' he said, ``because they've
been wrong before, haven't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Call me Cup Crazy, but Keenan deserves another shot. &QL; 
Gretzky back in LA &QL; 
Recently retired superstar  &UR; Wayne Gretzky has moved his family back
to Thousand Oaks, Calif., from New York and apparently has no
active plans to re-enter the hockey business just yet. Gretzky has
said he might be interested in someday owning an NHL franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne is going to take the summer off and spend time with his
kids,'' Gretzky's agent,  &UR; Mike Barnett, told the ``Los Angeles
Times.'' ``But I'm sure he'll be open to opportunities at the turn
of the calender year. He's an athlete, and at some point I'm sure
he'll want to compete with a suit on.'' &QL; 
Slap shots &QL; 
An informal survey with various NHL executives has revealed some
good news about the state of the troubled Pittsburgh Penguins. The
general consensus is the team will remain in Pittsburgh, that
 &UR; Mario Lemieux's ownership plan will be granted formal approval,
and thankfully, there will be no dispersal draft or dissolving of
the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking good,'' one official said. ``I have no doubts
that the Penguins will stay where they are and become healthy again
for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pittsburgh Bankruptcy Court has set a June 24 deadline for
accepting Lemieux's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of deadlines, the NHL has until Sept. 15 to notify the
International Hockey Federation of its intentions to participate in
the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. All signs look like a
go.
</P>
<P>
   So who will the Coyotes name as their new head coach? Well,
reports continue to circulate that General Manager  &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Smith might still have interest in former Edmonton Oilers Coach
 &UR; Ron
 &UR; Low and may have actually interviewed Low on Saturday in San Diego.
But don't bet on it. This is assistant coach  &UR; John Tortorella's job
to lose. The longer Smith drags it out, though, makes you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   How serious is former NHL star  &UR; Bryan Trottier, now an assistant
coach with the Colorado Avalanche, about becoming a head coach?
Very serious. His name has been linked to openings in both Phoenix
and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful compliment to have my name brought up,''
Trottier told the ``Denver Rocky Mountain News.'' ``I've been real
happy in Colorado, but . . . when there's an opportunity to be a
head coach, you want to give yourself a chance for advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   A possible dark horse in the Coyotes' coaching search:  &UR; Stan
Smyl, a longtime assistant coach with the Vancouver Canucks. Said
Canucks GM  &UR; Brian Burke, ``Stan's done a fine job. If he gets the
opportunity to move on, fine. If not, we've got a place for him
here. . .'' &QL;

<HEADLINE>
CUTTING CENTERS WOULD BE DEPLORABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fullback  &UR; Larry Centers should retire in a Cardinals uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Centers, the team's career leading receiver, deserves that. So
do the 35,000 fans who for years had little to cheer about except
the NFL's best pass-catching back.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that the team was getting blown out. There
always was the chance Centers would catch a pass in the flat, vault
six feet in the air over a defender and return from the
stratosphere amid cheers of ``Larry, Larry.''
</P>
<P>
   That chant was heard often late last season when the Cardinals
finally exorcised their Morgan Athletic Club/Racine/Chicago/St.
Louis/Phoenix Cardinals demons. They broke an 0-for-Arizona
non-winning streak and had their first playoff victory in 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody on the team deserved the success more than Centers, who
had endured nine frustrating years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Centers, scheduled to earn $2.5 million next season, could
become a salary cap casualty as the team tries to trim $3 million
to sign their 11 draft picks. One of the running backs almost has
to go. It's the one position where the team can afford to make a
move.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a done deal. General Manager  &UR; Bob Ferguson,
Assistant to the President  &UR; Rod Graves and Vice President  &UR; Bill
Bidwill
 &UR; Jr., the salary cap guru, are looking at every contract to see
which could be reduced, restructured or extended to get the
Cardinals under the $57.3 million cap.
</P>
<P>
   Centers, in the final year of a three-year, $7.5 million
contract, isn't opposed to having his deal reworked. He understands
his situation: He's a pass-catching specialist on the down side of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Never an outstanding blocker, Centers has become, in some eyes,
a luxury the team cannot afford. Sure, he's still an offensive
weapon. But is he standing in the way of second-year running back
Michael Pittman, who has excellent hands, and rookie fullbacks Joel
Makovicka and Dennis McKinley?
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals officials should exhaust every possibility before
parting with Centers, their second-most-popular player behind
quarterback Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Centers, a survivor of `` &UR; Buddy (Ryan) ball'' and the
``Legitimate Tough Guy'' regime of  &UR; Joe Bugel, has earned that. The
fans have, too.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty should matter. &QL; 
Sign of the times &QL; 
Even if Centers does return, he will be playing on the last year of
his contract unless it's extended.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are going to have to spend much of next season
reworking contracts or they are going to be in a worse dilemma in
February than they are this year.
</P>
<P>
   Others scheduled to become unrestricted free agents at the end
of the 1999 season include offensive lineman  &UR; James Dexter and
 &UR; Aaron
 &UR; Graham, running backs  &UR; Adrian Murrell and  &UR; Mario Bates, tight end
 &UR; Johnny
 &UR; McWilliams, defensive end  &UR; Simeon Rice, linebackers  &UR; Ronald
McKinnon and
 &UR; Patrick Sapp and strong safety  &UR; Tommy Bennett. All are starters. &QL; 
Ready and able &QL; 
Packers quarterback  &UR; Brett Favre, the league's Most Valuable Player
in 1996 and '97, appears determined to make up for a subpar season
a year ago, when he was intercepted 23 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be the best player in this league again,'' said
Favre, who said earlier that he was giving up alcohol and cutting
back on his personal appearances. ``I think I can be. The day that
I wake up and don't feel that way, I'll retire.'' &QL; 
In demand &QL; 
 &UR; Lawrence Phillips already had piqued the interest of NFL teams
before he ran for a 73-yard touchdown last weekend to help
Barcelona to the greatest comeback in NFL Europe history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, teams are lining up to try to get him, ignoring the fact he
could face a league suspension if he has any more legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers and Bengals are interested in Phillips, who earlier
was waived by the Rams after being arrested three times in 19
months. He then was signed by the Dolphins, who cut him because he
wasn't in shape. He also was accused of hitting a woman in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't follow him around,'' Barcelona Coach  &UR; Jack Bicknell
said. ``I don't know where he is all the time, and I haven't had a
problem with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bicknell, who coached quarterback  &UR; Doug Flutie at Boston
College, calls Phillips and Flutie ``the two best players I've been
around.''
</P>
<P>
   In eight games going into this weekend, Phillips had set NFL
Europe records for carries (160), yards (893) and touchdowns (12).
He had 177 yards rushing a week ago. &QL; 
Double trouble &QL; 
While teams are trying to decide whether Phillips is worth the
risk, the New England Patriots gave up on cornerback  &UR; Chris Canty,
their first-round pick two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Canty, who started the first nine games in '98, was waived last
week because of problems on and off the field, some bordering on
the bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely showed up at the team's off-season program, but he
almost always had an excuse for being absent. His latest was that
he suffered a rash caused by a reaction to the team's laundry.
</P>
<P>
   None of his teammates had complained that the soap powder the
Patriots were using made them itch.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Canty was arrested last season after police found
him asleep in his Mercedes at a gas station at 6 a.m. with a
container of an alcoholic beverage in his vehicle. &QL; 
Risky business &QL; 
In January, the Patriots lost starting running back  &UR; Robert Edwards
to a knee injury in a beach flag football game at the Pro Bowl in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dolphins rookie running back  &UR; Cecil Collins has hurt his
back in a photo shoot sponsored by the NFL Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a fifth-round pick, suffered a bruised back while
jumping off a trampoline at last month's NFL rookie premier show in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who could be a real key for us, and he gets hurt
in something stupid,'' a Dolphins official said. ``You know guys
can get hurt walking across the street, but you live with that. We
thought this was going to be a few photos taken, and all of a
sudden they are jumping off trampolines. You get guys like that
together, and it becomes a competition thing and then it really
gets stupid.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
The five-year, $10 million deal signed by Rams first-rounder
 &UR; Torry &UR; Holt last week was lower than many teams expected, which is
good news for those clubs picking near Holt, taken sixth overall.
The Cardinals chose Ohio State wide receiver  &UR; David Boston eighth
overall.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for  &UR; John Kent Cooke, the outgoing Redskins
president, to get out of town. Cooke, who received $60 million from
the team's sale to  &UR; Daniel Snyder, is retiring to Bermuda, where
he'll save nearly $6 million in income taxes. &QL;

EVEN A'S BAFFLED BY DODGERS' EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ The pained, perplexed expressions of manager Davey
Johnson tells the story of how the Los Angeles Dodgers' season has
been going. And, quite possibly, where it's going.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hit into four double plays, botched a ball in the
outfield and on a cutoff on the same play and again sleepwalked
through a 4-3 loss to the Oakland Athletics on Saturday at the
Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (29-31) have lost two straight and five of six.
They're 3-7 and in the makings of a June swoon, they're two games
below .500 for the first time, and, after the loss, trailed
front-running Arizona by 6{ games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in their clubhouse so I don't know what's going on
over there, but they look like we did about a week ago,'' A's first
baseman Jason Giambi said. ``They're just playing the game,
unemotional about it. It seems like they're just there. There's no
emotion from them over there and the amazing thing is they have a
lot of (gutsy) players.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you know that's not the problem. They just seem flat out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a crepe.
</P>
<P>
   It's to the point where the patient Johnson is searching for
answers as to why the Dodgers aren't scoring more runs and why
mental mistakes are happening.
</P>
<P>
   This was also another wasted effort by right-hander Ismael
Valdes. Even though he hasn't allowed more than three earned runs
in any of his past three starts, he's lost each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Against the A's, Valdes (5-5) allowed three earned runs in 61/3
innings, including home runs to Olmedo Saenz and Tony Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't get him any run support,'' Johnson said. ``Not
real heads-up stuff out there. That just chews at you when you're
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the gnawing went on through the night, especially on a
pivotal play in the sixth inning when the A's scored twice.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez singled with the bases loaded. Ben Grieve scored and
John Jaha was initially held at third. Dodgers right fielder Raul
Mondesi bobbled the ball, and Jaha went toward home. But the
ensuing play at the plate was interrupted when first baseman Eric
Karros cut the ball off. Karros then spun and fired wide as the A's
took a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut the ball because I saw Jaha stop,'' said Karros, who hit
a solo homer in the top of the inning. ``I'm picking up the
third-base coach. I saw he was stopping (Jaha) at third. I already
had in mind I was going to cut the ball and I did. We had three
double plays. That's where the issue is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of this loss was because of wasted opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had a hit in each inning yet scored in only three of
them. Their leadoff runner reached base four times (all in the
first six innings) but none of them scored.
</P>
<P>
   The woes were best illustrated in the second inning when the
double plays began. The Dodgers had the bases loaded with none out,
but rookie Brent Cookson struck out and Angel Pena grounded to
shortstop for what turned into a telling double play.
</P>
<P>
   A's second baseman Tony Phillips said he had no intention of
throwing to first to get Pena, but Pena was ruled out because
Adrian Beltre slid hard and late into second to break up the double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Second-base umpire John Shulock, citing rule 6.2, said Beltre
left his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know why he called that,'' Beltre said. ``You get
called out because you go off the base line, not because you
overslide the base. With the way we're struggling, anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The last double play ended the eighth inning. Mondesi singled
for the third straight at-bat and Karros walked, but Devon White
hit a soft liner to second. Mondesi was doubled off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just in a funk,'' said Eric Young, who's ninth-inning
sacrifice fly made it 4-3. ``We're not getting any breaks. It's
just not going our way right now.''
